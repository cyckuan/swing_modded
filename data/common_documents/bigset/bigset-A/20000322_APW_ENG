Md. Hostage Suspect Killed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- Three hostages held by a murder suspect jumped to safety
from a window in their home tonight and police stormed the apartment, fatally
shooting the man who had held them captive since Friday. The standoff began
Friday when the suspect, Joseph Palczynski allegedly forced his way into a home
in a Baltimore suburb and took three people hostage, including the mother of his
former girlfriend. Palczynski was accused of kidnapping his ex-girlfriend, Tracy
Whitehead, on March 7, killing four people over a two-day period and leading
police on a manhunt for more than a week.

Bush, Gore Claim Ill. Primary
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- George W. Bush and Al Gore won the Illinois presidential
primaries Tuesday. Bush had 74,694 votes, or 69 percent, and Alan Keyes had
9,950 votes, or 9 percent. John McCain, who appeared on the ballot although he
is no longer running for president, had 21,144 votes, or 20 percent. On the
Democratic side, Gore had 152,202 votes, or 84 percent, while Bill Bradley, who
also has dropped from the race, had 26,452 votes, or 15 percent. For many
Illinois voters, the primaries were an exercise in democracy, since Bush and
Gore already have won enough convention delegates to lock up the party
nominations.

Elian Gonzalez Asylum Suit Dismissed

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A federal judge Tuesday refused to block the U.S. government
from sending 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez back to his father in Cuba, saying the
court has no right to second-guess the attorney general on matters of asylum.
Twelve days after hearing arguments in the case, U.S. District Judge K. Michael
Moore dismissed the lawsuit filed by Elian's great-uncle in Miami. The judge
said that ''each passing day is another day lost between Juan Gonzalez and his
son.'' Elian's Miami relatives said they will appeal.

Bihari Vajpayee. But India rejected Clinton's call to slow its nuclear weapons
program. The president was pressing his case for stronger U.S. ties with India

papacy, Pope John Paul II on Tuesday began the first official visit by a Roman
Catholic pontiff to Israel, fulfilling his dream of visiting the land where
Christ was born and died. The pilgrimage caps the ailing 79-year-old pope's
efforts to reconcile Catholics and Jews. On Wednesday morning, the pope

Earthquake Jolts Eastern Indonesia
</SUBHEAD>

   HONG KONG (AP) -- An intense undersea earthquake with an estimated magnitude
of 6.2 has been recorded in the Maluku archipelago in eastern Indonesia, the
Hong Kong Observatory said Wednesday. There were no immediate reports of damage
or casualties. The temblor recorded Tuesday afternoon was centered north of
Halmahera island in the Pacific Ocean, the observatory said. There were no
reports of tsunami, destructive tidal waves caused by earthquakes. An earthquake
with a magnitude above 6.0 can cause severe damage when centered on land under
heavily populated areas.

Risk Goes Up in Teen-Filled Cars

   CHICAGO (AP) -- The more young people you pack into a car with a teen-ager

The problem is ''general foolishness and distractions'' for drivers who are just
getting to know the rules of the road, said Robert Foss of the University of
North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center. The study, published in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, was based on federal
data from 1992 through 1997.

Tuesday night. The victory made Indiana, which has the league's best home record
(31-3), the first team in the Eastern Conference to clinch a playoff spot. It
also gave the Pacers a 4{-game advantage over Miami in the battle for home court
advantage throughout the conference playoffs. The Pacers won despite shooting
just 4-of-12 from the field in the fourth quarter. New York, which shot 33-of-61
in the first three periods, was 7-of-26 attempts in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Rapist Caught in N.J.  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A rapist allowed to leave prison without
prosecutors knowledge was captured Tuesday night following a
nationwide search for the man who claimed to have raped and killed
more than a dozen women.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Alves was arrested at 7:40 p.m. at the Annandale train
station by police and the FBI after he got off a train from Newark,
said Bergen County Prosecutor William Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're absolutely thrilled,'' Schmidt said. ''We've been
working around the clock on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Alves was charged by federal authorities with unlawful flight to
avoid prosecution, and by Bergen County authorities with failure to
register as a convicted sex offender under Megan's Law.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was released from prison in New Jersey, Alves gave
authorities a fake Massachusetts address where he said he would be
living.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections Commissioner Jack Terhune has
acknowledged that state corrections employees violated numerous
procedures before releasing the 57-year-old Alves.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those violations, prosecutors weren't aware that
Alves was being let go and never got a chance to seek to have him
civilly committed as a sexually violent predator.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Gov. Christie Whitman called for a law making it easier
to confine sex offenders who had served their terms but were still
considered dangerous. The Legislature then passed the Sexually
Violent Predator Act.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the older law, which required a person to suffer from a
mental illness, the new law can be used to confine a person with a
mental abnormality or personality disorder that predisposes a
person to commit acts of sexual violence.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the new law makes it easier to confine sex offenders
who have served their full sentences, violating the Constitution's
ban on double jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Alves, who became a federal fugitive after prosecutors
discovered he was released, served less than half of a 47-year
sentence for the 1976 rape of one teen and the assault of another.
</P>
<P>
   He had claimed to have raped and killed more than a dozen women.

<HEADLINE> Former Panther Wins House Seat  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Rep. Bobby Rush, a former Black Panther leader,
held off two state senators who challenged him in the Democratic
primary Tuesday for his congressional seat on Chicago's South Side.
</P>
<P>
   In the affluent northern suburbs, congressional aide Mark Kirk
defeated nine other relatively unknown Republicans and won the
nomination to succeed GOP Rep. John Porter, an influential House
Appropriations Committee member who is retiring after 11 terms.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, 53, was all but guaranteed a fifth term on Capitol Hill in
the general election, since Democrats dominate his district.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rev. Jesse Jackson at his side, an elated Rush told
reporters in a hallway of his campaign headquarters that he had
been forced to scramble for the nomination but was stronger as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a better person, a better candidate and being a better
candidate I'll be a better congressman,'' Rush said. He said his
first priority on Capitol Hill would be relief for senior citizens
facing high prescription drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   Early results were inconclusive in farm country downstate, where
Gov. George Ryan and House Speaker Dennis Hastert were drawn into a
nasty spat in the four-way primary for the seat being left by
veteran Republican Rep. Tom Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   With 88 percent of precincts reporting in the South Side race,
Rush had 51,182 votes, or 60 percent. Barack Obama, the first black
president of the Harvard Law Review, had 26,778 votes, or 31
percent, while Donne Trotter, a veteran lawmaker and health-care
administrator, had 15,973, or 7 percent. A retired policeman picked
up a smattering of votes.
</P>
<P>
   The four candidates pretty much agreed on the main issues of the
campaign: The South Side needs more jobs, prescription drug prices
are too high and action is needed to combat racial profiling and
police brutality. But Obama and Trotter said Rush, who was swamped
in a challenge to Mayor Richard M. Daley last year, had failed to
provide enough leadership.
</P>
<P>
   So far this primary season, the only sitting member of Congress
to lose his seat has been nine-term Democratic Rep. Matthew
''Marty'' Martinez of east Los Angeles, who lost to a state senator
on Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Porter's suburban district, Democrats are given a good chance
of snatching away a GOP seat this fall, and the primary has been
one of the most expensive in state history. About $5.5 million was
raised, much of it from the pockets of the race's six
multimillionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Printing heiress Shawn Donnelley provided at least $2.3 million
in loans to her campaign and businessman Andrew Hochberg pumped in
$1 million of his own cash. Kirk, however, got heavy party backing
and the endorsement of Porter -- his former boss.
</P>
<P>
   With 80 percent of precincts reporting, Kirk had 14,422 votes,
or 32 percent; Northbrook Mayor Mark Damisch 6,973, or 15 percent,
and Donnelley 6,662, or 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk will face state Rep. Lauren Beth Gash, a Democrat who has
GOP leaders concerned because she has a knack for winning in a
legislative district where Republicans often cross party lines.
</P>
<P>
   In east-central Illinois, 29-year-old insurance man Sam Ewing
hoped to succeed his father. The race has spawned a spat between
Hastert and his old friend, Tom Ewing, with Hastert saying Ewing
deliberately delayed announcing his retirement to give his son an
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert backed state Rep. Bill Brady as the most electable
candidate in November. And Gov. Ryan supported veteran state Rep.
Tim Johnson, who was the front-runner most of the way. Dentist
Jeffrey Jones was also running.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Laurel Prussing, defeated twice by the
elder Ewing, was in a close race against former congressional aide
Mike Kelleher.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Rep. Philip M. Crane, the most senior Republican
in the House, took a leave of absence and entered a 30-day
treatment program for alcoholism. He was unopposed in his primary
in the Chicago suburbs, but he already was expected to face his
toughest general election campaign in years.

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks 3, Coyotes 0  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jocelyn Thibault stopped 34 shots for his 14th
career shutout as the Chicago Blackhawks kept their slim playoff
hopes alive and sent Phoenix deeper into a tailspin, 3-0 Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Dean McAmmond had a goal and an assist, and goals by Alexei
Zhamnov and Josef Marha helped run Chicago's unbeaten streak to six
games (5-0-1).
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, who could have moved into a tie with Los Angeles
for fifth place in the West with a win, couldn't get anything going
despite the return of captain Keith Tkachuk after a 16-game outage
to rest a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   They lost for the fourth straight game, counting an overtime
loss to Nashville on Friday, and the seventh time in their last
nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive breakdowns hurt Phoenix, with Sean Burke allowing
three goals in 33 shots, and the Blackhawks played defense with the
verve of contenders.
</P>
<P>
   They shut out the Coyotes in seven power plays. Thibault faced
only four shots in the first 15 minutes of the third period, when
Phoenix had the advantage twice, and made five more saves before
the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout was his second of the season and first since he
broke a finger on his left hand on Nov. 27. He missed six games
before returning Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Zhamnov became the Blackhawks' fourth 20-goal scorer when he
swatted a rebound through Burke's legs with 8:43 left in the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   But it took two strong plays by McAmmond to put the game away in
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   He sent a crossing pass to Marha, who let fly from the circle
4:47 into the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks got their 3-0 lead on McAmmond's hustle. He took the
puck off the stick of Phoenix defenseman Lyle Odelein and started
the rush with a pass to Tony Amonte.
</P>
<P>
   Amonte skated to the circle and sent a perfect feed to McAmmond
for a one-timer just above the crease.

<HEADLINE> Miss. 70, Southwest Missouri St. 48  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- Marcus Hicks scored 16 points and Rahim
Lockhart muscled his way to 13 as Mississippi pushed Southwest
Missouri State right out of the National Invitation Tournament with
a 70-48 second-round victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6 Hicks and 6-8 Lockhart didn't have any height
advantage on the Bears, but they proved to be too strong in the
paint and on the glass for Southwest Missouri to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart led Ole Miss (19-13) with 14 rebounds, 11 in the first
half, and Hicks had seven, as the Rebels' physical play at both
ends proved too much for Southwest Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears (23-11) had cut the Ole Miss lead to 49-39 with 12:25
left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rebels scored 10 straight points, the final six on
3-pointers by Emmanuel Wade and Jason Harrison, to lead 59-39 with
7:46 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels, who held North Carolina Charlotte to just 27 percent
shooting in a first-round NIT victory, held the Bears to 39 percent
from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Judd led the Bears with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Phillips, Southwest Missouri's leading scorer, had just
seven points, all coming at the beginning of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison had 11 points and Lataryl Williams 10 for the Rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss will meet North Carolina State in the NIT
quarterfinals. N.C. State defeated Arizona State and former
Mississippi coach Rob Evans 60-57 Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Win in Ill. Primary  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER WILLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Al Gore cruised to victory in Illinois'
Democratic primary Tuesday while George W. Bush showed some signs
of weakness on the Republican side.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush won, about one-third of GOP voters supported other
candidates. Political analysts said the breakdown suggests that
Bush is vulnerable, while his campaign conceded that he still has
some work to do to win over supporters of former rival John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   With 64 percent of precincts reporting, Bush had 319,260 votes,
or 66 percent, and Alan Keyes had 42,665 votes, or 9 percent.
McCain had 109,690 votes, or 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore had 340,145 votes, or 83 percent,
while Bill Bradley, who also has dropped from the race, had 62,109
votes, or 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may have a little bit of work to do,'' said John Pastuovic,
a spokesman for Bush's Illinois campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mooney, director of the Illinois Legislative Studies
Center at the University of Illinois at Springfield, agreed that
Bush has ground to make up. But he cautioned that the Texas
governor has plenty of time to woo former McCain supporters and
conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can change himself completely. Come October, he could be
the centrist candidate and Gore could be the crazy liberal,''
Mooney said.
</P>
<P>
   For many Illinois voters, the primaries were an exercise in
democracy, since Bush and Gore already have won enough convention
delegates to lock up the party nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois had 161 Democratic and 74 Republican delegates up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Fisher of Champaign said he didn't care that the
presidential nomination fight was already settled for both parties,
''because I'm for Bush anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The healthy economy under the Clinton-Gore administration helped
the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel satisfied,'' said Gore supporter Linda Hall, 45, of Oak
Park. ''I have more money now than ever before, so I want to keep
the Democrats in.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush visited Illinois ahead of the primary -- the
vice president on Monday and the Texas governor last week, moving
to build support ahead of Election Day in November.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters missed Bradley and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not excited about either of them (Gore and Bush), but my
only choice is Gore,'' said retired teacher Elinor Najita, 63, as
she voted in Chicago for the vice president. ''I thought it was
going to be exciting, but it ended too soon. Now, it's boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois, with its mix of races and cultures and economic
conditions, has a history of mirroring the nation and backing the
winning presidential candidate. The only recent exception was in
1976, when Illinois went for Gerald Ford instead of Jimmy Carter.

<HEADLINE> Leafs' Berard Has Retina Reattached  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The retina in Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman
Bryan Berard's right eye was successfully reattached in a 4{-hour
surgical procedure Tuesday, the NHL team said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Stanley Chang was able to reattach the severely damaged
retina,'' Pat Park, the Leafs' manager of media relations, said in
a recorded message. ''No further information was available.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was performed at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center by Dr. Stanley Chang.
</P>
<P>
   Berard's agent, Tom Laidlaw, told Canada's The Sports Network:
</P>
<P>
   ''Bryan's a lot more optimistic than he was after the injury,
obviously, and he realizes that his chances of seeing 100 percent
out of that eye again are not very good, but there's a good chance
he'll regain some or a lot of that vision, and we'll see what
happens. The hockey portion of it, although it's on his mind ...
right now he's just trying to worry about seeing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Laidlaw also told the Toronto news station Cable Pulse 24 that
Berard would likely head home to Woonsocket, R.I., late Wednesday
after his eye is evaluated by doctors. Laidlaw also said Berard was
hoping to return to Toronto early next month to be with his team.
</P>
<P>
   ''He brought that up yesterday, that if everything goes well
he'd like to get back in a couple of weeks,'' Laidlaw said. ''I
told him that I saw Pat Quinn interviewed and Pat had mentioned a
few times that he'd like to get Bryan back with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Quinn) thought it would be good for the team and I think
it would be good for Bryan. Again, I guess it depends on how
comfortable he feels and how the eye progresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Berard, a former NHL rookie of the year and U.S. Olympian, was
accidentally hit in the face by Marian Hossa's stick blade during
Toronto's 4-2 victory March 11 in Ottawa. The 23-year-old, who was
not wearing a visor, crumpled to his knees. A large pool of blood
formed on the ice as team personnel rushed to his aid.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a cut cornea, detached retina and the orbital bone
surrounding the eye was fractured.

   SENECA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- A school administrator lost her bid
Tuesday to become the first female mayor of Seneca Falls, the site
of the first known women's rights convention and the National
Women's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gail Lafler lost 989-784 to Republican Antonio
Costantino.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been 152 years since women got the vote and we still have
not been able to elect a woman mayor,'' said Lafler, 53. ''It's a
good old boys' network and it's very, very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffragists drew up a list of grievances and remedies in a
Declaration of Sentiments at a convention on women's rights in
Seneca Falls in 1848. Women didn't win the right to vote in the
United States until 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Costantino, a barber, said he thinks women's rights are
''beautiful'' but he was nonetheless ''really thrilled for the
victory.''

<HEADLINE> Conservatives may have Giuliani alternative; Liberals boostClinton  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In a move that could shake up New York's
Senate race, the powerful leader of the state Conservative Party is
talking about a mystery candidate who could be an alternative to
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is a Republican and no GOP candidate has won statewide
office in New York in more than a quarter century without the
backing of the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears there's an individual who will be moving forward in
a week, two weeks, three at the most,'' state Conservative Party
Chairman Michael Long said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Long refused to identify the possible Senate candidate other
than to say ''people will recognize the name ... He has a good shot
at bringing the Conservative Party together.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one of the state vice chairmen of the Liberal Party,
which in the past has backed Giuliani's New York City mayoral bids,
said many of the party leaders want to back Democrat Hillary Rodham
Clinton in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
add votes from third-party lines to their totals. That can be the
deciding factor in close contests. Republican George Pataki won the
governorship in 1994 on the strength of the Conservative Party
vote. Recent polls have indicated Giuliani and Clinton are in a
tight race.
</P>
<P>
   Long has said Giuliani, an abortion rights supporter, must back
a ban on what critics call ''partial-birth abortion'' if he wants
the Conservative Party ballot line. The mayor has refused to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party leader said the potential Giuliani
alternative is not U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island Republican
who has been considering whether to restart his dormant Senate
effort. Long said he had talked to Lazio on Friday and came away
with the impression the congressman would stay out of the race.
Lazio declined to comment Tuesday. At Pataki's urging, Lazio
suspended his Senate effort in August after the governor endorsed
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an influential Conservative Party leader from the
Rochester area said Tuesday that he was continuing his effort to
get Giuliani the party's nomination, saying any Long-backed
alternative would simply help elect Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every vote for 'Charlie Conservative' is (otherwise) a
Giuliani vote,'' said Thomas Cook, the party's Monroe County
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said he would try to convince other party leaders,
including Long, to get behind Giuliani or at least let him into a
Conservative Party primary where Cook predicted the mayor would
easily beat any Long-backed contender.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding Long has the power to block Giuliani from a
Conservative Party primary, Cook said he would ask Conservative
Party members to then vote in November for the mayor on the
Republican ballot line.
</P>
<P>
   On the Liberal Party front, Joseph Laux, a party leader from the
Albany area, said he and other Clinton supporters in the party
leadership had surveyed their upstate colleagues and found that 70
percent of them also want to support the first lady's candidacy.
Upstate party leaders account for 42 percent of the state
committee's weighted vote.
</P>
<P>
   No Democrat has won a statewide election in New York without
Liberal Party support since the party's founding more than 50 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rudy Giuliani is a great mayor, he's a good administrator, but
he'd be a lousy legislator,'' Laux said.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Clinton move by Laux and the others could put them at
odds with party boss Raymond Harding, one of the mayor's key
political advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel Ray is in an awkward position,'' Laux said.
</P>
<P>
   Harding declined to comment Tuesday other than to say that
members of the party's policy committee would meet with prospective
Senate candidates in April and that the policy committee would then
make an endorsement recommendation to the full state committee.
</P>
<P>
   Also up in the air is what role the state's Ross Perot-inspired
Independence Party will play in the Senate race. The party is
currently involved in a bitter leadership struggle that has wound
up in state court.

<HEADLINE> PM-NY--Lottery Scholarships, Bjt,0525  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The Pataki administration is moving forward
with its plans to give out $1,000 scholarships to 1,300 outstanding
high school seniors, despite Democratic warnings that the
Lottery-funded awards are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Lottery is to aid education, Lottery Division
spokesman Rob Hayes said Tuesday, and what better way to help
students than to reward the top graduating seniors at every private
and public high school in the state?
</P>
<P>
   ''We are clearly supporting education with this,'' Hayes said.
''It is clearly within the New York Lottery's province to execute
such a program and we will continue moving forward with this
program.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's Democratic Comptroller H. Carl McCall cautioned
Republican Gov. George Pataki Tuesday that the governor's ''Leaders
of Tomorrow'' scholarship initiative needs legislative approval
just like any other proposal involving the appropriation of state
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki outlined the scholarship program idea late last year,
mentioned it in his State of the State address in January and the
Lottery Division has been moving forward in promoting the program --
including the use of full-page newspaper advertisements -- ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   The ads tell school officials they have until March 31 to
nominate two candidates from their senior classes to get the
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said it is ''irresponsible'' for the Pataki
administration to be promoting a program which may not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor should not be making promises of scholarships
from an unauthorized program to students and parents,'' McCall
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said he wasn't necessarily against issuing the
scholarships, but also favors increases in the state Tuition
Assistance Program grants as a way of helping more high schoolers
afford college.
</P>
<P>
   Teens must be graduating from high school with a ''B'' average
or higher to qualify for consideration for a ''Leaders of
Tomorrow'' scholarship, plus have showed they are ''well-rounded''
academically, socially and athletically and are going to attend a
public or private college or trade school in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Three Democratic state senators this month told Pataki it was
illegal for him to award the scholarships without legislative
approval. They also complained that the qualifications for winners
are imprecise and would lead to the awarding of scholarships on an
inconsistent basis from school to school.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, who is considered a possible Pataki opponent in 2002,
released an opinion Tuesday from his counsel Randolph Treece which
advised that the Lottery Division is not legally authorized to run
a scholarship program without legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Lottery Division also can't legally pay for advertising for
the scholarship program, Treece advised.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery proceeds are supposed to go to aid education in the
state according to the constitution, but Treece said that document
stipulates that revenues go to schools ''as the Legislature may
prescribe.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki defends chancellor's salary, but says public told poorly  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State University of New York Chancellor
Robert King's $340,000 salary and compensation package is
appropriate for a man in his position but the public should have
been told about it from the beginning, Gov. George Pataki says.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should have been disclosed,'' Pataki said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The governor himself did not know about the housing allowance
until this week, an administration source said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki controls the SUNY system through his appointments to the
SUNY Board of Trustees. The trustees selected King, a friend of
Pataki's since their days together as state assemblymen, as
chancellor and they also approved the housing supplement.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY officials on Monday confirmed a New York Post report that
King is getting the extra money. At the time of King's hiring,
university officials said he would make $250,000, the same amount
as his predecessor, John Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the numbers themselves are excessive, I think
the process was flawed,'' Pataki said. ''The public should have
been aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old King made $147,490 a year as state budget
director under Pataki. The salary and housing allowance added
together as chancellor mean that King, who has no previous
experience as an academic administrator, received a 130 percent
raise when he left the state Budget Division to lead SUNY.
</P>
<P>
   King gets the housing allowance because he is not using the
SUNY-provided chancellor's residence in SUNY Plaza in downtown
Albany, instead living in his home in the Albany suburb of Clifton
Park. Ryan lived in the chancellor's residence and did not get a
housing allowance.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said since King is not using the luxurious chancellor's
suite, it should be turned into SUNY office space.
</P>
<P>
   ''What should happen is the residential space, that is valuable
space downtown in the state university building, should be used for
offices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY officials say they have been using the space for visiting
dignitaries and official university luncheons. SUNY spokesman E.J.
McMahon said officials were already thinking about converting part
of the residential area for offices.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said King's entire package -- which equals $340,000 with
the housing allowance -- is what the chancellor of America's largest
university system should make. '' My understanding is that it's
consistent with what universities of this size around the nation
(pay),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, University of California System President Richard
Atkinson makes $337,300 and University of Texas System Chancellor
William Cunningham makes $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki noted that the City University of New York also pays its
chancellor $250,000 plus a $90,000 housing allowance. ''I think
what the board has set is the same as what the City University has
set and I don't have a problem with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The SUNY and CUNY chancellors are the two highest-paid state
employees, even without the housing allowances, according to salary
records maintained by the state comptroller's office.

<HEADLINE> Silver: Giuliani broke law by releasing victim's juvenile record  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Assembly Democrats want to know how New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani got shooting victim Patrick Dorismond's
sealed juvenile record and plan on holding a hearing to take the
mayor to task for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''In releasing Patrick Dorismond's juvenile record, Mayor
Giuliani has violated the public trust, Mayor Giuliani has violated
state law, Mayor Giuliani has let down the people of the state of
New York,'' Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was fatally shot by a New York City policeman last
week during an attempted drug sting outside a midtown Manhattan
bar. He was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Giuliani released Dorismond's criminal
record, including a previously sealed juvenile offense. In
defending the exposing of that record, city lawyer Michael Hess
said when a person dies his or her ''right to privacy is
eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The law is when you die, your privacy interest ends,''
Giuliani said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Silver disagreed, and said the Assembly would immediately
convene hearings in New York City or Albany to find out how
Giuliani and the New York City Police Department got hold of and
released Dorismond's sealed juvenile records, a move he called
''reprehensible'' and ''egregious.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of this state are protected by a state law that
prohibited the release of these juvenile records,'' Silver said.
''We believe that Mayor Giuliani violated that law.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Assembly Codes and Judiciary committees would
subpoena all the witnesses it needed, including Giuliani if
necessary. Investigators will look into how the records were
released, whether any laws were violated and recommend increased
penalties to ensure it does not happen again, Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to know how did this mayor ... get his hands on
Patrick Dorismond's juvenile records in the first place,'' he said,
''we want to know how was it possible and why did he release that
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Any prosecution would have to be done by the proper authorities
like the attorney general or the local district attorney, Silver
said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican state leaders immediately said Silver was trying to
embarrass Giuliani to harm his candidacy for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Assembly investigation announced by Speaker Silver smacks
of political partisanship,'' Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno
said. ''The Democratic rhetoric sounds suspiciously like it was
crafted by Rev. Al Sharpton to aid the Hillary Clinton campaign,''
Assembly Republican Leader John Faso said of Giuliani's Democratic
opponent for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sheldon Silver has overpoliticized the Assembly and his office
to a degree that is shameful,'' New York City Deputy Mayor Joe
Lhota said. ''It's hard to believe he's getting in line with the
Rev. Al Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   A call to Pataki about the Assembly hearings was not immediately
returned. When asked earlier whether Giuliani should have released
the juvenile records, Pataki said, ''It's being investigated by
District Attorney (Robert) Morgenthau and I think that's
appropriate and I think the important thing is for people not to
engage in any inflammatory rhetoric and let that investigation run
through its course.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver denied any collusion with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about Mrs. Clinton. This is not about a Senate
campaign,'' Silver said angrily at a state Capitol news conference.
''This is about the highest elected official in the city of New
York having the perception out in the public and being proud of
violating the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver said he had not invited any members of the
Republican-controlled Senate to participate in the hearings. ''I
think if the Senate thinks as we do, they will hold their own
hearings or ask to join our hearings,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Celebrities lobby state for more arts funding  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A group of celebrities say that without
public funding for the arts, many of them would not be in show
business.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Andreas, the star of ''The Scarlet Pimpernel''
described a high school drama teacher that encouraged a ''gawky,
chubby, shy'' child to sing in front of the audiences she
entertains today.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Rosie Perez said Tuesday that without a state-funded field
trip to see ''The Wiz'' when she was 12 ''there is no way I'd be
who I am today.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Horton Foote said that it is
small state-funded theaters, not Broadway, that have been producing
recent award-winning pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The group lobbied leaders of each chamber of the state
Legislature and Gov. George Pataki to add $10.9 million in arts
funding to the 2000-2001 budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need more money,'' said Perez, who serves on the board of
advisors and as a teacher at Working Playground -- a New York City
based not-for-profit organization that gives students without
access to the arts in their high schools art, drama and dancing
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The funding call follows Pataki's recommendation that $1.8
million be cut from the arts in the upcoming budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''What most of the world notices are the big shiny productions --
the bright lights and the big playwrights and the big musicals,''
said actress Kate Finneran of ''The Iceman Cometh,'' ''Frasier,''
and ''Sex in the City.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But what most of the world doesn't know is that these plays
and productions all started in not-for-profit theaters, and these
were all state-funded,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The arts in New York receive $50.17 million under the 1999-2000
budget, more than any other state in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Also speaking at the rally were Celeste Holm, of ''Oklahoma!''
and ''All About Eve,'' and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer William
Kennedy.

<HEADLINE> Fed Action Unlikely To Cool Economy  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WHITE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Federal Reserve's latest rate increase
probably isn't enough to tame the unbridled spending of Americans
accustomed to the easy gains of a soaring stock market, economists
say.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed on Tuesday boosted rates one-quarter percent, the fifth
such increase since June. Economists worry that consumers will
shrug off the latest hike, as they did the four previous increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''A quarter percent works out to be an extra $1 a month on the
average consumer's credit card balance,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief
economist for Edward Jones in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the meantime, you have what people refer to as the wealth
effect, where people see the value of their stocks going up
consistently. They don't mind spending a little of that money with
the local retailer. The Fed is struggling to accomplish its
mission,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indifference to the Fed's actions so far is highlighted by the
breakneck pace of economic growth. The U.S. economy grew at an
annual rate of 6.9 percent during the final quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers' propensity to spend has continued in 2000. Retail
sales rose 1.1 percent in February, despite higher interest rates
and a sharp increase in gasoline and heating oil prices prompted by
OPEC production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest gain came at grocery stores, where spending went up
1.8 percent. Car sales rose 1.4 percent in February after jumping 3
percent in January. Americans also bought more clothes and
furniture than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Total consumer debt rose 4.1 percent between July and January.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's longest period of economic expansion -- 108 months
so far -- has convinced many consumers that the good times will roll
on, said Rajeev Dhawan, director of economic forecasting at the
University of California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''When consumer confidence is high, it means people are not only
happy about the present, they're also a little bit happy about the
future,'' Dhawan said. ''You don't base your purchasing decisions
on the present, but you base them on what you feel the future is
going to be like.''
</P>
<P>
   One area where rates do appear to be taking a toll is home
sales, which fell by 10.7 percent in January, according to the
National Association of Realtors. The drop, however, came on the
heels of record-setting sales in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is still strong, but it has slowed some. Housing
starts are down from their peak, home sales are down from their
peak,'' said Cynthia Latta, principal U.S. economist for Standard &AMP;
Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers are mostly interested in monthly payments. When it
comes to cars and other things the payments can be kept down with
rebates, special financing and things like that. On a house, there
aren't quite so many options,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the country, home sales continue to rise, said
John Karevoll, a housing market analyst for La Jolla, Calif.-based
Acxiom DataQuick. Preliminary figures suggest February will be the
second-highest month on record for the booming Los Angeles and San
Francisco areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought frankly that we would see sales level off, but they
haven't. We're seeing very strong sales in California and level
sales in the rest of the country,'' Karevoll said. ''It doesn't
appear that interest rates are high enough now to push too many
people out of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has chosen to raise interest rates
slowly over a long period to avoid causing panic among consumers or
in the stock market, Dhawan said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Latta, Dhawan expects Greenspan to continue raising rates
until they reach 6.5 percent while lecturing Americans to rein in
their spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a lot of what I call a jawboning strategy, using
the bully pulpit to send a message,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Wins, But More Battles Ahead  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The beleaguered tobacco industry's remarkable
survival skills were on display as the Supreme Court ruled that the
federal government had no authority to regulate cigarettes as an
addictive drug.
</P>
<P>
   But industry foes, disappointed by Tuesday's decision, vowed to
push Congress to change the law and give the Food and Drug
Administration comprehensive authority to regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco makers, meantime, renewed recent suggestions that they
are willing to discuss some tobacco regulation, such as enforcement
of laws to curb smoking by minors, federal oversight of cigarette
manufacturing and ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Their victory on the FDA issue came even as the tobacco industry
is facing growing legal pressures in suits by smokers and the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in Miami is hearing evidence on what damages to assess
after finding against the industry in a class-action suit on behalf
of Florida smokers. A jury in San Francisco on Monday found the
nation's two largest tobacco companies misrepresented the health
dangers of cigarettes in a case brought by a former smoker dying of
lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   And the federal government has sued the biggest tobacco
companies to seek reimbursement for the cost of treating
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Burry, who follows tobacco stocks for the investment firm
Brown Brothers Harriman, said the Supreme Court's decision on the
FDA's authority was critical for Big Tobacco. ''It could have been
the end of the industry if this had gone the other way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the industry were heartened by the declaration by the
Supreme Court's majority that tobacco use is ''perhaps the single
most significant threat to public health.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,
said that comment puts responsibility for effective regulation of
the industry in Congress' court.
</P>
<P>
   Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler
said the Supreme Court decision left Congress with ''a moral
responsibility'' to act.
</P>
<P>
   The leading tobacco makers indicated they were willing to open
discussions with Congress and others on some tobacco regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision closes one door but hopefully opens another,''
said Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the nation's biggest cigarette maker
and owner of the top-selling Marlboro brand.
</P>
<P>
   It said it opposed the FDA's proposed rules for tobacco issued
in 1996 because it treated cigarettes as medical devices and said
that could have led to prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   ''But federal regulation of cigarettes as cigarettes, dealing
with youth smoking while respecting an adults' right to smoke,
makes sense for smokers and manufacturers alike,'' the Philip
Morris statement said.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Corp., the No. 2 cigarette maker
with brands like Camel, Winston and Doral, said it was willing to
''begin a dialogue with Congress on reasonable options for
additional regulation of the design and manufacture of cigarettes
at the federal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., the nation's third-biggest
tobacco company, said it sought ''a cooperative dialogue'' with
government and the public health community on tobacco-related
issues.
</P>
<P>
   John Seffrin, head of the American Cancer Society, said he was
very disappointed by the Supreme Court decision but warned that
''Congress should not be fooled by any halfway measures that
tobacco companies may propose.''
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of tobacco country, North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt
said the ruling increased pressure on the states to find ways to
curb smoking among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought it was the FDA's role to enforce that,'' the
governor said. ''.... I think it is the state's responsibility to
do that, and we have to take it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up enforcement of the ban on tobacco sales to minors,
prohibiting smoking by adults on public school campuses and
improving antismoking education programs are some of the ways North
Carolina can reduce smoking among teen-agers, Hunt suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The case originated in federal court in Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco stocks gained ground after the ruling. Philip Morris
rose 37{ cents Tuesday to $20.31\ as the most active issue as of
the 4 p.m EST close of the New York Stock Exchange, where Loews
Corp., parent of Lorillard Tobacco Co., rose $2 to $47.12{ and R.J.
Reynolds rose 56\ cents to $17.06\. But the U.S. shares of British
American Tobacco, which owns Brown &AMP; Williamson, were down 56\
cents at $9.68}.

<HEADLINE> Ski Industry Eyes Possible Growth  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID SHARP, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- The Hathorn family used to head for the
hills after work every Friday for a full weekend of skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are long gone, replaced by a blur of basketball
practice, soccer practice and games for Scarborough High School
junior Heather Hathorn.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old's frenetic schedule demonstrates one of the
biggest concerns for the nation's ski resorts: Many families that
have the money to ski simply don't have the time, or they choose to
do other things.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, snowboarding is growing in popularity at the
same time the bulk of the children of baby boomers are reaching
their teens. The convergence may be the industry's first
opportunity for growth in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting ''echo boomers'' while they are teen-agers may be the
difference between growth and continuing flat ticket sales, said
Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we let this opportunity slip by, it's not going to happen
again anytime soon,'' Berry said. ''I think we recognize that.''
</P>
<P>
   The last big boom for the $10 billion ski industry was when baby
boomers themselves hit the slopes in the 1970s. While the years
that followed have been flat, the ski industry noticed an important
change in demographics about six years ago: the number of younger
skiers had begun to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The industry sees this echo boom as a pool of 72 million
potential skiers. But hooking them will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, they have a wide range of entertainment options --
from youth hockey to basketball to indoor tennis to surfing the
Internet. People consistently cite the time crunch, more than the
expense, as the main reason they do not ski, Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys also show families are more stressed out than ever when
it comes to the plethora of vacation options, including sunny
beaches, theme parks and cruises, said Jim Spring, president of
Leisure Trend Groups in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle of all may be cable TV and the Internet,
which have made teen-agers increasingly sedentary.
</P>
<P>
   ''The optimists say we're on the brink of something absolutely
terrific, this echo-boom generation. All we have to be is smart
about tapping into it,'' said David Rowan, founder and editor of
Ski Area Management Magazine, a trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''But are they as likely to become skiers and snowboarders as
their parents were? The answer is no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American Skiing Co., one of the nation's biggest ski area
operators, always has been aggressive about going after new skiers.
But the Newry-based company recognizes that a greater effort may be
needed to hook echo boomers.
</P>
<P>
   The industry already offers free ski passes to fifth-graders in
Maine, New York, Utah, Colorado and California and to
fourth-graders in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   American Skiing's chief executive, Les Otten, approached other
major skiing companies last season and proposed an industrywide
promotion campaign similar to what Kathy Lee Gifford did for the
cruise industry.
</P>
<P>
   There was interest, but contributions never materialized because
it turned out to be a bad year for the ski industry, said Skip
King, a company spokesman. There has been little talk this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''No single ski area can afford the type of campaign necessary
to get the real image about what this sport does,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Dunican, who owns Mount Abram ski area in Locke Mills,
said it is critical to lure teens to stop the graying of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at the mean average age of the skiers, they're
getting older every day,'' Dunican said. ''And there are a lot more
older ones than young ones.''
</P>
<P>
   He's experimenting with newfangled sleds so someone who doesn't
ski or board can ride down the slopes. The highly maneuverable
sleds have been a hit so far.
</P>
<P>
   To cut costs, he's also building no-frills ski dorms, where
skiers will be able to sleep for $15 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Survey's by Spring's Leisure Trend Groups suggest the number of
people taking up skiing is overtaking the number leaving the sport,
at least for the last two years. Whether the trend will continue
for a third season remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   That's heartening for the country's 509 ski resorts. So is the
fact that people like the Hathorns who leave the sport don't
necessary stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Even though basketball is fun, Heather Hathorn does not view it
as something she will do for the rest of her life. Skiing, on the
other hand, is something she believes she can continue into her
later years.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hathorn also said he and his wife plan to resume their
regular weekend trips when Heather graduates high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''When she's in college, we'll be back to skiing as frequently
as we can afford at that point,'' her father said.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies 98, Warriors 82  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Michael Dickerson scored 14
of his 25 points in the first quarter Tuesday night as the
Vancouver Grizzlies snapped a 12-game losing streak with a 98-82
win over the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson shot 9-for-13 from the field in 30 minutes and
combined with fellow guard Mike Bibby, who added 10 points, to give
Vancouver its 19th win of the season, equaling a franchise high.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors, who shot 34 percent from the floor in losing for
the 12th time in 14 outings, were led by 16 points from Donyell
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 34-24 after one quarter, the Grizzlies penetrated at
will on offense and took advantage of a sloppy start to the second
period by the Warriors. Golden State had just two field goals in
the first 6:43 and offered no resistance on defense, and
Vancouver's 59-37 lead at halftime was the largest in franchise
history.
</P>
<P>
   The second half was even worse for the Warriors, who were
without five regulars because of injuries. Vancouver moved to a
32-point advantage late in the third period, two baskets off
another franchise mark, at which time both teams emptied their
benches.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver won the game on the boards, holding an 50-42 edge
against the second-best rebounding team in the NBA. The Grizzlies
also took much better care of the ball, committing 15 turnovers, a
big improvement from their previous two outings in which they
registered 28 in each contest.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The win was the first by the Grizzlies over the Warriors in
eight tries dating back to Jan. 24, 1998. ...After releasing
ex-Grizzlies guard Sam Mack on Monday, the Warriors signed
journeyman forward Bill Curley for the remainder of the season...
Vancouver placed guard Brent Price (back) on the injured list and
activated rookie guard Milt Palacio... Vancouver guard Doug West
(foot) did not play. ... The Vancouver Sun reported Tuesday that
Jim Les, who coached briefly as an assistant with Sacramento of the
WNBA, will be added to the coaching staff being assembled by Dick
Versace for the Grizzlies next season. Versace has been working
closely with incoming owner Michael Heisley, assembling a second
scouting staff to watch the NCAA tournament. Les played six NBA
seasons and joins a lengthy list of Versace associates expected to
be employed next season by Heisley.

<HEADLINE> Former Panther Fights for House Seat  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Rep. Bobby Rush, a former Black Panther leader,
held off two state senators who challenged him in the Democratic
primary Tuesday for his congressional seat on Chicago's South Side.
</P>
<P>
   In the affluent northern suburbs, congressional aide Mark Kirk
defeated nine other relatively unknown Republicans and won the
nomination to succeed GOP Rep. John Porter, an influential House
Appropriations Committee member who is retiring after 11 terms.
</P>
<P>
   In farm country downstate, state Rep. Tim Johnson, who was
backed by Gov. George Ryan, triumphed over three other Republicans
for the nomination to succeed veteran Rep. Tom Ewing, who is also
retiring. Ewing's 29-year-old son was among those who lost.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, 53, was all but guaranteed a fifth term on Capitol Hill in
the general election, since Democrats dominate his district.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rev. Jesse Jackson at his side, an elated Rush told
reporters in a hallway of his campaign headquarters that he had
been forced to scramble for the nomination but was stronger as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a better person, a better candidate and being a better
candidate I'll be a better congressman,'' Rush said. He said his
first priority on Capitol Hill would be relief for senior citizens
facing high prescription drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   With 88 percent of precincts reporting, Rush had 51,182 votes,
or 60 percent. Barack Obama, the first black president of the
Harvard Law Review, had 26,778 votes, or 31 percent, while Donne
Trotter, a veteran lawmaker and health-care administrator, had
15,973, or 7 percent. A retired policeman picked up a smattering of
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates pretty much agreed on the main issues of the
campaign: The South Side needs more jobs, prescription drug prices
are too high and action is needed to combat racial profiling and
police brutality. But Obama and Trotter said Rush, who was swamped
in a challenge to Mayor Richard M. Daley last year, had failed to
provide enough leadership.
</P>
<P>
   So far this primary season, the only sitting member of Congress
to lose has been nine-term Democratic Rep. Matthew ''Marty''
Martinez of east Los Angeles, who was defeated by a state senator
on Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Porter's suburban district, Democrats are given a good chance
of snatching away a GOP seat this fall, and the primary has been
one of the most expensive in state history. About $5.5 million was
raised, much of it from the pockets of the race's six
multimillionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Printing heiress Shawn Donnelley provided at least $2.3 million
in loans to her campaign and businessman Andrew Hochberg pumped in
$1 million of his own cash. Kirk, however, got heavy party backing
and the endorsement of Porter -- his former boss.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk had 32 percent of the vote -- about twice as much as
Donnelley and Northbrook Mayor Mark Damisch.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk will face state Rep. Lauren Beth Gash, a Democrat who has
GOP leaders concerned because she has a knack for winning in a
legislative district where Republicans often cross party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The race in east-central Illinois spawned a spat between House
Speaker Dennis Hastert and his old friend, Tom Ewing, with Hastert
saying Ewing deliberately delayed announcing his retirement to give
his son an edge.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert backed state Rep. Bill Brady as the most electable
candidate in November. But Ryan supported Johnson, a longtime ally.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Laurel Prussing, defeated twice by the
elder Ewing, was in a close race against former congressional aide
Mike Kelleher.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Rep. Philip M. Crane, the most senior Republican
in the House, took a leave of absence and entered a 30-day
treatment program for alcoholism. He was unopposed in his primary
in the Chicago suburbs, but he already was expected to face his
toughest general election campaign in years.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Win Illinois Primary  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER WILLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Al Gore cruised to victory in Illinois'
Democratic primary Tuesday while George W. Bush showed some signs
of weakness on the Republican side.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush won, about one-third of GOP voters supported other
candidates. Political analysts said the breakdown suggests that
Bush is vulnerable, while his campaign conceded that he still has
some work to do to win over supporters of former rival John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   With 90 percent of precincts reporting in the Republican
primary, unofficial returns showed Bush with 423,715 votes, or 67
percent, and McCain with 139,602 votes, or 22 percent. Alan Keyes
had 56,041 votes, or 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, with 91 percent of precincts reporting,
Gore had 632,458 votes, or 84 percent, while Bill Bradley had
107,189 votes, or 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may have a little bit of work to do,'' said John Pastuovic,
a spokesman for Bush's Illinois campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mooney, director of the Illinois Legislative Studies
Center at the University of Illinois at Springfield, agreed that
Bush has ground to make up. But he cautioned that the Texas
governor has plenty of time to woo former McCain supporters and
conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can change himself completely. Come October, he could be
the centrist candidate and Gore could be the crazy liberal,''
Mooney said.
</P>
<P>
   For many Illinois voters, the primaries were an exercise in
democracy, since Bush and Gore already have won enough convention
delegates to lock up the party nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois had 161 Democratic and 74 Republican delegates up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Fisher of Champaign said he didn't care that the
presidential nomination fight was already settled for both parties,
''because I'm for Bush anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The healthy economy under the Clinton-Gore administration helped
the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel satisfied,'' said Gore supporter Linda Hall, 45, of Oak
Park. ''I have more money now than ever before, so I want to keep
the Democrats in.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush visited Illinois ahead of the primary -- the
vice president on Monday and the Texas governor last week, moving
to build support ahead of Election Day in November.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters missed Bradley and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not excited about either of them (Gore and Bush), but my
only choice is Gore,'' said retired teacher Elinor Najita, 63, as
she voted in Chicago for the vice president. ''I thought it was
going to be exciting, but it ended too soon. Now, it's boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois, with its mix of races and cultures and economic
conditions, has a history of mirroring the nation and backing the
winning presidential candidate. The only recent exception was in
1976, when Illinois went for Gerald Ford instead of Jimmy Carter.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Threaten To Fight  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Congo rebels threatened Tuesday to resume
their war against President Laurent Kabila in response to what they
described as government attacks on all fronts in violation of a
shaky cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The latest threat to a fragile peace in Congo came a week after
the Rwandan-backed rebels took Idumbe, 375 miles east of the
capital, Kinshasa, prompting the government forces and their
Zimbabwean allies to mount a counteroffensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the international community is not able to advance peace by
blocking Kabila's armed operations ... our units will receive
orders to fight until the change of regime in Kinshasa,'' said a
communique from the rebel Congolese National Army.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels and Kabila signed a peace accord in August, calling
for the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers and the withdrawal of
foreign troops. Rwanda and Uganda, which back the rebels, and
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, which back Kabila, also signed.
</P>
<P>
   But since, both sides have accused each others of violating the
cease-fire, and the United Nations warned that the authorized
deployment of 5,500 U.N. observers and troops to protect them may
be in jeopardy if the fighting intensifies.
</P>
<P>
   So far, almost 90 U.N. observers have been deployed in both the
rebel and government-controlled towns in preparation for a larger
U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   In the communique, the main rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy,
which is fighting in southern and southeastern Congo with backing
from Rwanda's troops and arms, said it had killed 192 government
soldiers and lost eight of its own in fighting since March 10, most
of them at Idumbe.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Congo's deputy U.N. ambassador, Atoki Ileka, said
the government was fully respecting the cease-fire agreement. He
said he couldn't confirm whether the government was responding to
the rebel capture of Idumbe, but said Congo reserved the right to
protect itself against the ''invasion'' by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Congo asked the Security Council on Friday to condemn the rebel
capture of Idumbe, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said they were expecting a major government
counteroffensive to retake Idumbe, Dekese and Longaport, and warned
the government was sending into combat two shiploads of troops
along Sankuru River.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also warned they would advance to Bandudu, a major
government defense outside Kinshasa, saying they have the ''will
and capacity'' to strike back.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of fighting could not be confirmed independently.

   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- Police stormed an apartment Tuesday night and fatally
shot a murder suspect who had been holding three people hostage since Friday.
Two captives had jumped to safety and a third, a 12-year-old boy, was rescued by
police. ''All of the hostages are safe,'' police spokeswoman Vickie Warehime
said. Joseph Palczynski, 31, who was believed to have four weapons, was shot to
death by police. The only shots fired at the end of the standoff came from
police, Warehime said. The standoff began Friday when Palczynski forced his way
into the apartment and took three people hostage, including the mother of his
former girlfriend.

Bush, Gore Win Illinois Primary
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Al Gore cruised to victory in Illinois' Democratic primary
Tuesday while George W. Bush showed some signs of weakness on the Republican
side. Although Bush won, about one-third of GOP voters supported other
candidates. Political analysts said the breakdown suggests that Bush is
vulnerable, while his campaign conceded that he still has some work to do to win
over supporters of former rival John McCain. With 90 percent of precincts
reporting in the Republican primary, unofficial returns showed Bush with 423,715
votes, or 67 percent, and McCain with 139,602 votes, or 22 percent. Alan Keyes
had 56,041 votes, or 9 percent.

   MIAMI (AP) -- A federal judge Tuesday refused to block the U.S. government
from sending 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez back to his father in Cuba, saying the
court has no right to second-guess the attorney general on matters of asylum.
Twelve days after hearing arguments in the case, U.S. District Judge K. Michael
Moore dismissed the lawsuit filed by Elian's great-uncle in Miami. The judge
said that ''each passing day is another day lost between Juan Gonzalez and his
son.'' Elian's Miami relatives said they will appeal.

Hong Kong Observatory said Wednesday. There were no immediate reports of damage
or casualties. The temblor recorded Tuesday afternoon was centered north of
Halmahera island in the Pacific Ocean, the observatory said. There were no
reports of tsunami, destructive tidal waves caused by earthquakes. An earthquake
with a magnitude above 6.0 can cause severe damage when centered on land under

also gave the Pacers a 4{-game advantage over Miami in the battle for home court
advantage throughout the conference playoffs. The Pacers won despite shooting
just 4-of-12 from the field in the fourth quarter. New York, which shot 33-of-61
in the first three periods, made only 7-of-26 attempts in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Called Television Station  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Murder suspect Joseph Palcyznki, shot dead by police
Tuesday
night after holding three people hostage for four days, had called
a television station Sunday and left a message begging to talk to
his former girlfriend.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citing safety concerns, WJZ-TV Channel 13 withheld playing the
message until after the standoff had ended. It aired Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The message follows:
</P>
<P>
   ''This is Joseph Palczynski ... I've got three people hostage
... This is really me. I've been trying to communicate to the
police. All I want to do is talk to Tracy Whitehead, my girlfriend.
I love her dearly. I did not mean to kill those people. They've
blocked all communication between Tracy and I, and any outgoing
phone conversations, or communications rather. I've been begging
for them to just allow me to talk to Tracy. I will surrender
peacefully. I won't kill anyody else, I won't hurt anybody else. I
did not mean to do any of this ... The police are blocking any
means of communication between Tracy and I, that's all I want to is
talk to her and we can end this peacefully ... This is not a prank
or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Police listened to the message at the station and took the tape
with them but did not comment.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Farm Laborers Wooed  </HEADLINE>
By KILEY RUSSELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- After more than 20 years of following work
from one town to another, former California farm laborer Martin
Feliscian has headed east, lured by the promise of steady work at a
bacon processing plant in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of seasonal jobs here and I finally got tired of
it and started looking for something else,'' Feliscian said during
a telephone interview from his mother's Visalia home just hours
before he got on a bus to make the two-and-a-half-day trip.
</P>
<P>
   The abundance of low-wage agricultural workers in the Central
Valley is attracting meat packing and processing recruiters from as
far away as Alaska, Iowa and Ohio. They come looking for rural
laborers to take jobs many of their local workers find distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Valley also is characterized by pockets of high
unemployment, up to 45 percent in some rural areas, versus pockets
of low unemployment in places like Iowa and Ohio, where rates have
hovered between 2 percent and 4 percent for the last several
months.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Feliscian, who's worked in California's citrus
groves and vegetable fields since he was 13, says he's done just
about every field labor job there is and still can't get ahead.
There are few opportunities for workers with limited education, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And the pay is really low. You can't live on $5.75 an hour.
You're not going to make it on that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For years he has managed to scrape by, trying to make payments
to help support his eight kids, but it's been tough, working in the
fields or at tire shops around Visalia. When he heard about a local
job service program matching workers to jobs out of state,
Feliscian said he couldn't wait to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   He was offered full-time work at $7.25 an hour with medical
benefits starting after six months, a free bus ticket to Washington
Court House, Ohio, and a $75 advance on his first paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of workers every year are following Feliscian, says
Karen Davidson, who runs a program in Tulare County called More
Opportunity for Viable Employment, which recruits workers from the
area for companies. Davidson's program will also pay workers'
families' moving expenses if they qualify under certain welfare
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''We move people throughout the U.S. to areas were jobs are
very, very plentiful -- to 34 different states in the last
year-and-a-half,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   The valley has become known for producing workers with the
skills and endurance necessary to tackle tough, unpleasant jobs in
agriculture. The meat and fish packing industries are finding it
fertile ground for their recruiting drives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find a lot of people in the area have experience picking
grapes or oranges and are used to the long hours in extreme weather
conditions,'' said Elizabeth Procious, a recruiter for Westward
Seafoods, a Seattle-based company with packing plants in Alaska's
Aleutian Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tough work, the difficult conditions and the
unfamiliar town, Feliscian is determined to carve out a life for
himself in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very excited about it,'' he said. ''I wanted to just bust
up in tears when I heard about the job.''

<HEADLINE> Neighbors Expect Tougher Russia  </HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia's neighbors foresee a tougher but
more predictable policy from Moscow after Vladimir Putin's expected
victory in Sunday's pivotal presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The swift rise of Putin, a former KGB officer, and his
statements on reviving Russia's military might and global clout
have caused some uneasiness among the 14 former republics that won
independence with the 1991 Soviet collapse. Most are wary of what
they perceive as Moscow's traditionally imperialist designs.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, now acting president, is new to the political arena and
many questions remain about his plans. But leaders and analysts in
the former Soviet republics describe him as pragmatic and say he
will be a welcome change after the often erratic Boris Yeltsin.
They say they do not expect any annexation threats under Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ukraine wants to see Russia as a good partner with a
consistent, predictable policy,'' Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma
said during talks in early March with Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
   Shevardnadze, whose small Caucasus Mountains nation has had
rocky relations with its huge northern neighbor, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all interested in Russia's global, European and
Caucasus policy being clear, unequivocal and predictable,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia remains the chief trading partner for the former Soviet
states and retains a military presence around its former empire.
</P>
<P>
   In Moldova and Georgia, Russian peacekeepers help maintain
stability along the borders of the breakaway areas of
Trans-Dniester and Abkhazia. In Tajikistan, Russian troops are
vital for the survival of the hard-line government after five years
of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine and Moldova are heavily dependent on Russian oil and gas
supplies and together owe Moscow billions of dollars in unpaid gas
bills. They repeatedly suffered from Yeltsin's policy zigzags.
Under Putin, Russia has taken a tough stance at gas debt
negotiations and raised oil and gas export tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is also at odds with the states that border the Caspian
Sea -- Azerbaijan, Kazakstan and Turkmenistan -- over rights to its
rich oil, gas and caviar supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, meanwhile,
want to have as little to do with Russia as possible. Yet they are
economically tied to it and clash with Moscow over alleged
mistreatment of Russian-speaking minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus is an exception: Its authoritarian leadership is
pressing Moscow for a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say it largely remains a mystery how Putin will deal
with this web of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a wait-and-see attitude about Putin,'' said Toivo
Klaar, foreign policy adviser to Estonia's president. ''For now,
there's no particular reason to be optimistic. But there's no
particular reason to be pessimistic, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say there is reason for doubt. They point to Putin's war
in Russia's breakaway region of Chechnya and his KGB past.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing people in Latvia look at is Putin's KGB
credentials,'' said Matthew Kott, a historian in the Latvian
capital, Riga.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Putin looks preferable to his nearest rival for the
presidency, Communist chief Gennady Zyuganov, who favors restoring
some Soviet-era borders.
</P>
<P>
   Gela Charkviani, Georgia's presidential adviser on foreign
relations, said: ''Putin's statements constantly point out that
Russia needs to have maximum integration with the West. He shows
himself to be an adherent of democratic values. Judging by the
impression of today, there will no return to the Soviet times.''

<HEADLINE> Agreement deadline looms in Southbury Training School negotiations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTHBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Both sides in the dispute over the care
of the mentally retarded residents at the Southbury Training School
say a settlement of that lawsuit appears unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   A mediation session scheduled for today was cancelled. Lawyers
for the state, who have defended residents' care, and lawyers for
groups that think the 700 residents would get better care in group
homes have not indicated if they will meet again.
</P>
<P>
   If the sides cannot agree on a resolution to the problem, U.S.
District Judge Ellen Bree Burns will be forced to rule on the
lawsuit filed against the state on behalf of Southbury residents.
</P>
<P>
   Burns presided over a nine-month trial in New Haven federal
court last year. After the case ended in December, she asked both
sides to try to mediate an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still am concerned that we are so far apart that a
settlement may not be reached,'' Thomas York, a Pennsylvania lawyer
who represents the state, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   York and the groups that are suing the state declined to discuss
specifics of the negotiations, citing the judge's gag order.
</P>
<P>
   Peg Dignoti, executive director of The Arc Connecticut, said the
advocates eagerly are awaiting the state's response to their
settlement proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to keep a positive outlook,'' Dignoti said. ''We're
not going to give up until we absolutely have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was brought in 1994 by The Arc, People First of
Connecticut and the Western Connecticut Association for Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The role parents play in determining the care of their children
is a central issue in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The state believes parents and guardians of clients deserve the
final say about whether their children and wards remain at the
school, one of the nation's last large institutions for the
mentally handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   The average resident is about 50 years old, and many have lived
at the school most of their lives. Some of the residents' parents --
elderly themselves -- are worried that their children will have a
hard time adjusting to life elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland supports keeping the training school open
as an option for the parents and guardians of retarded people. He
has committed millions of dollars toward upkeep of the aging
campus, which opened in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The groups who sued the state agree that parents deserve some
say in where their children live, but they also want a team of
professionals to examine the residents to see what kind of housing
would be best.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend Southbury residents have been subjected
to physical, emotional and sexual abuse.

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Town Becomes a Cemetery  </HEADLINE>
By BART JONES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEN DE URIA, Venezuela (AP) -- Truck-sized boulders sit on
eerily lifeless streets. A 30-foot-deep gorge cuts through the
middle of town where houses once stood. The beach now juts 200
yards farther out into the sea. Buried beneath it are hundreds of
villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Little Carmen de Uria used to be a breezy, palm-treed Caribbean
paradise where residents escaped the crime and congestion of
Caracas an hour's drive away. Now it is more a cemetery than a
town.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after landslides devastated Venezuela's central
Caribbean coast, shell-shocked survivors of the worst-hit towns are
trickling back to gape at the destruction, salvage belongings and
mourn the dead. Some are even moving back in, loathe to abandon the
places they've always called home.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech Monday unveiling an ambitious plan to rebuild
the disaster zone, President Hugo Chavez announced that Carmen de
Uria will not be rebuilt so as not to place future generations in
harm's way. Instead, it will be turned into a ''beautiful park,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dec. 15 landslides were of biblical proportions. A two-day
downpour dumped double the amount of rain that normally falls in an
entire year on the coast, and caused the already saturated mountain
that separates Caracas from the Caribbean Sea to collapse onto
towns and cities below.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that between 5,000 and 30,000 people were
killed by avalanches of mud, water, trees and boulders. Most bodies
were buried under tons of mud or washed out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   At least 500 of Carmen de Uria's 5,000 residents were killed and
500 of its 800 houses were washed into the sea along with trucks,
couches and refrigerators, says Napoleon Coronado, president of the
Carmen de Uria flood victims' committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come back from the dead,'' college student Sandra Rueda,
21, said one recent day when she returned to the town for the first
time since the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled watching in horror as a friend she'd known since
fourth grade was swept out to sea when her house collapsed into the
raging torrent. Rueda said her friend was standing on the house's
roof with about a dozen other people when they all suddenly
succumbed to the wave.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen de Uria was hard hit partly because it sits in a ravine
at the foot of the 1.7-mile-high Naiguata Peak, the highest point
of the steep Avila mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and early 1960s, the government diverted the course
of a river that flowed through the sloping ravine, covered the
original channel with landfill and started handing out free permits
to build on top of it, says watershed expert Raul Vidal.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the river retook its original path with fury. Many
people remained in their houses because they never imagined the
river would swallow the town.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Carmen de Uria is frozen in time. Christmas lights still
hang from houses. A red and green ''Happy Year 2000'' tinsel banner
stretches across a street. Walls are torn away, exposing kitchens,
beds with sheets and pillows, a huge bedroom mural of the Manhattan
skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors are living in temporary refugee centers at
military forts or stadiums, and waiting for new housing that
President Hugo Chavez says the government will construct in rural
regions. On Monday, Chavez announced that 300 houses would be built
on the outskirts of Caracas specifically for Carmen de Uria's
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But some doubt his promises and are moving back to the town
despite warnings from experts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The danger has already passed,'' said construction worker
Julio Diaz, 61, one of the town's founders.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 residents are now living in the town, including one who
is caring for her horse. There is no running water, electricity or
telephone service. Residents go to neighboring towns that were less
devastated to pick up food and drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado and others oppose plans to prohibit building in Carmen
de Uria and turn it into a park or memorial ground. He says most of
the bodies are buried in the newly extended beach, not in the town
itself.
</P>
<P>
   But most experts criticize the idea of rebuilding a town that
has been proven to be in harm's way. Many former residents think it
should be left to rest in peace.
</P>
<P>
   When Rueda visited with her 13-year-old brother Luis Alfredo, he
scrawled a message on the wall of the house where he'd lived his
entire life: ''Thank you dear people of Carmen de Uria. Here I
lived the most beautiful and saddest moments. I never imagined that
I would have to say goodbye to you forever.''

<HEADLINE> DPUC: Complaints down for phone service, up for electric  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The state fielded more than 6,000
complaints from utility customers last year about snowy cable
reception, long power outages, improper phone charges and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But a report Tuesday by the Department of Public Utility Control
said complaints are down about 3 percent from 1998 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints included poor service, being billed at the wrong rate
or delays in handling complaints. Customers also complained about
service cutoffs, including electric or gas service during the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who also fields complaints
about utilities, said consumers should read bills carefully and
should not be shy if they have a problem with a utility.
</P>
<P>
   ''My impression is that these complaints are simply the tip of
the iceberg,'' Blumenthal said. ''We spend an extraordinary amount
of time and effort seeking to help consumers deal with these kinds
of mistakes made by companies that are never reported to the DPUC
or ignored by the companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Utility customers were more satisfied with their telephone and
Internet services last year, but less happy with their electric
companies, the utility service scorecard found. Complaints about
water and gas companies remained about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints of ''slamming,'' or unauthorized switching of
service, were down 30 percent from the year before, the DPUC
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC does not verify the complaints. But in some cases, the
complaints have led to investigations. The DPUC is investigating
MCI after numerous complaints about billing and service.
</P>
<P>
   The largest number of complaints -- 1,510 -- was lodged against
Southern New England Telephone, which has more than 2.2 million
customers. But when complaints are calculated per 100,000
customers, SNET fared better than some national telephone companies
at customer satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   SNET did better in 1999 than in 1998, when the DPUC logged more
than 1,800 complaints against the New Haven-based company.
</P>
<P>
   SNET attributed the drop in complaints to investment in new
equipment and upgrades to older parts of their network since their
merger with SBC Communications of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We simply wouldn't have been able to make these investments
without the resources of SBC,'' said SNET vice president Michele
Macauda.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Light &AMP; Power Co. logged the second-largest number
of complaints, 1,298 -- or 117 complaints for every 100,000
customers it serves.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints were up from last year, when the DPUC recorded
almost 70 complaints per 100,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   CL&AMP;P spokesman Frank Poirot said the complaints are related to
persistent power outages and new billing procedures intended to
speed up the payment of delinquent bills.
</P>
<P>
   The company is trying to get people to pay their delinquent
bills off more quickly, to reduce a $12.4 million write-off CL&AMP;P
took last year, Poirot said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers say recycling nursing home drugs could save $7 million  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Some state lawmakers want to recycle
unused drugs sent to nursing homes, saying the policy could save
Medicaid and private insurance companies $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under a bill which passed one legislative committee and is
headed for debate in the House, leftover pills would be returned to
pharmacies and repackaged. Pharmacists would then credit
individuals or insurance agencies for the unused drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The state Office of Fiscal Analysis estimates that the recycling
program will save $7 million. About two-thirds of the savings would
go to the state's Medicaid program, which covers most nursing home
prescription costs, Rep. Mary McGrattan, D-Ledyard, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McGrattan, who is a registered nurse, says precautions would be
taken to ensure that the recycled pills would not be contaminated.
Currently, all prescription drugs are given to nursing homes in
sterile blister packs. The packages are locked away until the drugs
are administered directly to patients, McGrattan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill allows sealed and perfectly safe medications to be
put back into circulation,'' said McGrattan, D-Ledyard.
</P>
<P>
   New York has a similar law on the books, McGrattan said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peggy Sayers, who is co-sponsoring the bill, said she saw
plenty of waste as a nursing home inspector when unused medication
was flushed down the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea of flushing them down the toilet has evolved as the
proper mechanism for getting rid of these medications,'' Sayers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Enfield Democrat worked for the state Department of Public
Health for 14 years, inspecting nursing homes and reviewing their
pharmacy services.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a real shame that we had all these medications that we
were discarding, and the cost of medications is always
increasing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McGrattan also questioned what health effects flushing drugs
into sewer systems may have.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be concerned about all these drugs entering into
our waste treatment process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But pharmacists raised concerns about the integrity of recycled
drugs, and said the recycling and credit program may create too
much paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   John Cannarella, president elect of the Connecticut Pharmacists
Association, said it may be easier to cut down on wasted drugs by
prescribing fewer of them to patients. He said Medicaid requires
that drugs be prescribed for a 30 day supply.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all in favor of saving money. We see that there's a big
waste out there,'' Cannarella said. ''But perhaps there should be
fewer pills given at a time. It seems to be easier to give out less
medication than it would be to take it back.''

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Haunts Papal Pilgrimage  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Jerusalem, the most sensitive issue on Pope
John Paul II's Holy Land pilgrimage, became the noisiest as well
within minutes of his landing. It crept into every speech and was
even part of the background music.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's plane had barely touched down at Ben Gurion
International Airport near Tel Aviv on Tuesday afternoon when the
city that divides Israelis and Palestinians made a first
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The army band struck up ''Jerusalem of Gold,'' a song that
celebrates Israel's capture of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem in
1967, as soon as it completed both national anthems.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was pronounced, but foreseeable. Israelis were
taken aback last month when the Vatican signed an agreement with
the Palestinians that implicitly condemned Israel's continued hold
over the entire city, and recognized Palestinian claims in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claim the city as their capital, and it is one of the
most sensitive issues the sides face as they negotiate a peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry has described the timing of the
Vatican agreement -- just ahead of this week's historic pilgrimage --
as ''deplorable.'' Any Vatican hopes that this is where Israel
would end it dissipated soon after the pope landed.
</P>
<P>
   President Ezer Weizman culminated his airport welcoming speech
with a description of ''united'' Jerusalem as '' the capital of the
state of Israel and the heart of the Jewish world.''
</P>
<P>
   In his response, the pope notably did not mention the city.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff got another dose of Jerusalem politics when his
helicopter landed in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   He was greeted by Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, a leader of the
hard-line opposition Likud party.
</P>
<P>
   Olmert cited a psalm he said underscored Israel's claim to the
whole city. ''Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together,'' he said,
quoting psalm 122. He described Jerusalem as ''the eternal capital
of the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Olmert said the significance of the city's Israeli mayor
greeting the pope was not lost on Vatican officials. ''What was
important is that I would welcome him and I would escort him into
the city ... I think they understood there wasn't any other way,''
Olmert told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials were silent, but the highest-ranking Roman
Catholic official in Israel said he was aggrieved by Olmert's
reception.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah, the highest-ranking Roman
Catholic clergyman in the Holy Land, said the helipad ceremony was
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should have been either without Olmert, or with
representatives of both'' Israelis and Palestinians, said Sabbah, a
Palestinian.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers push ''empowerment'' legislation  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Struggling families and communities need laws
that unleash their potential then get out their way, a bipartisan
group of lawmakers pushing an ''empowerment'' agenda said.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda of the Congressional Empowerment Caucus, which
includes members from both houses of Congress, is heavy on religion
and includes legislation promoting anti-violence initiatives,
faith-based social services, savings accounts and fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda, released Tuesday, is tied together by the belief
that when it comes to families ''government has a role -- but not a
leading role, a supporting role -- in this drama,'' said Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is leading the caucus in the upper house along with
Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the caucus's legislative agenda stems from the work of
The Empowerment Network, chaired by former Indiana Republican Sen.
Daniel Coats.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit network promotes the idea that ''grassroots,
civic, volunteer, faith-based initiatives are a far more efficient
and effective way to deal with what seemed like intractable
problems in our communities,'' Coats said.
</P>
<P>
   But some question whether government can reasonably have a role
in programs that base their good works on religious principles.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious groups, notably Catholic Charities, have
separated any proselytizing from their charitable works, said
Elliot Mincberg, executive director of People For the American Way.
</P>
<P>
   But if a drug abuse program that urges addicts to rely on Jesus
Christ receives funding, ''either the government is funding
something that has a clearly religious method ... or you have to
remove the very element the religious groups think make their
program work,'' Mincberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The fatherhood bill, which passed in the House last year, sets
aside federal money for state agencies and nonprofit groups,
including religious ones, offering programs providing education,
economic or employment aid to young parents.
</P>
<P>
   The measure recognizes that ''government at its best is an
inadequate substitute for a loving, caring family,'' said Sen. Evan
Bayh, D-Ind., who is sponsoring the legislation in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Other legislation would expand conditions under which the
government can give money to faith-based groups.
</P>
<P>
   Religion is necessary to help combat youth violence, said Robert
L. Woodson, founder of the National Center for Neighborhood
Enterprise, which supports religious social services.
</P>
<P>
   School shootings in wealthy communities have proven that
violence is not only about lack of opportunity but about something
irrational. The only way to counter is with ''something equally
irrational, faith in God,'' Woodson said.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to empower working families is to help them feel
secure about the future, Lieberman said. Last spring he introduced
a measure that would expand the use of special saving accounts that
banks would match dollar-for-dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is aimed at addressing the ''wealth gap'' in
American society which is ''not an income gap but an asset gap,''
Lieberman said.

<HEADLINE> Witness accuses officers of being aggressors in shooting of unarmedman  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Undercover narcotics police cursed at Patrick
Dorismond after one of them fatally shot him outside a midtown
Manhattan bar, according to a co-worker of the unarmed black man.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kaiser made the accusation Tuesday at a Brooklyn news
conference where he announced a wrongful arrest claim against the
city. Kaiser, 22, said he was standing with Dorismond at the time
of the controversial shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a statement, he told reporters the tragedy unfolded
after ''three men who appeared like derelicts approached us for
weed.''
</P>
<P>
   The two off-duty security guards told the men to go away, Kaiser
said. But one -- an officer he identified as Anderson Moran --
taunted them with snarling sounds before the shooter, Detective
Anthony Vasquez, assaulted Dorismond, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw Detective Vasquez throw the first punch at my friend,
Patrick Dorismond,'' he said. ''Patrick did nothing to cause the
officer to strike him. At or about the same time, I heard the gun
go off.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, who is Hispanic, said the plainclothes officers never
identified themselves as police. After Dorismond was shot, he
added, he heard one of the officers say, ''Cuff that shot
(expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting last week of Dorismond, 26, a Brooklyn native of
Haitian descent -- coupled with city officials' decision to defend
the shooting by making public his record of petty crime -- has
outraged black activists, the victim's family and members of the
city's Haitian community. It also has fueled political sniping
between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton in their
race for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has charged Giuliani ''led the rush to judgment. That is
not real leadership.'' Other Democrats have accused City Hall of
breaking state law by releasing information from a sealed juvenile
case against the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani refused to back down. The mayor said Clinton's comments
were ''entirely political,'' and blamed her for trying to ''use
(the shooting) as a campaign issue.'' He also fed reporters new
details on Tuesday about Dorismond's brushes with the law,
including a March 7 incident in which he allegedly punched his
girlfriend on the side of the head while she was holding the
couple's 1-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's account of the botched narcotics sting operation
contradicted those of police officials and an attorney for Vasquez,
and deviated from his own statements in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The witness reportedly had claimed earlier that Moran -- not
Vasquez -- threw the initial punch, before Dorismond swung back.
Meanwhile, Vasquez has maintained that Moran was being attacked by
Dorismond when he and another back-up officer came to his aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We categorically deny that any one of those police officers
initiated a physical confrontation,'' the attorney, Philip Karasyk,
said Tuesday. ''The first punch was thrown by Mr. Dorismond.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez has claimed through Karasyk that as he rushed in he
heard one of the two men tangling with Moran say, ''Get the gun.''
Vasquez responded by yelling, ''Police! Police!'' and drawing his
own weapon. Dorismond grabbed at the gun, and one shot was fired,
sending a bullet into his chest, the officer claims.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's attorney, Sanford Rubenstein, refused to let his client
comment beyond his statement. The legal claim -- alleging that
police beat Kaiser and falsely imprisoned him after the shooting --
seeks $15 million in damages from the city.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times after the Thursday
shooting, Kaiser described a confrontation in which Dorismond and
one of the officers ''get real loud with each other, and one of the
officers swings at him first. ... Patrick proceeded to swing back,
and that's when the shot let out.''

<HEADLINE> Kings 98, Wizards 86  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Vlade Divac had 24 points and 12
rebounds and Chris Webber added 22 points and 11 rebounds Tuesday
night as the Sacramento Kings pulled away from the Washington
Bullets late in the game for a 98-86 victory.
</P>
<P>
   In his first trip back to Arco Arena, former King Mitch Richmond
scored 20 points in the opening quarter before shooting 2-for-17
thereafter and finishing with 26.
</P>
<P>
   Divac made two free throws and followed with a three-point play,
putting Sacramento ahead 90-84 with 3:01 remaining. Divac went
14-of-18 at the line, the most free throws he's made in a single
game in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Delk scored 12 points for the Kings, who have won seven of
nine games. Jason Williams and Predrag Stojakovic added 11 points
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Juwan Howard had 21 points and seven rebounds and Jahidi White
added 12 points for the Wizards, who were outscored 26-11 in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards had their three-game winning streak snapped, while
the Kings won their third in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Five straight points, the final one on a bucket inside from
Tyrone Corbin, put the Kings ahead for good 83-78 with 5:11
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Washington went on a 9-0 run early in the third quarter, erasing
a three-point halftime deficit. Chris Whitney and Howard scored six
points each in the period as the Wizards took a 75-72 lead into the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Stojakovic keyed Sacramento's 32-20 second quarter, scoring nine
points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Webber had 14 first-half points and Divac scored 10 as the Kings
led 55-52 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond couldn't be slowed down in the first quarter, shooting
9-of-13 to help Washington to a 32-23 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: After shooting 60 percent in the opening quarter,
Washington made only 9-of-26 in the second. ... Kings backup center
Scot Pollard, who missed the previous six games, was reactived,
taking the place of Bill Wennington, who was put on the injured
list. ... Wizards guard Rod Strickland didn't play in the second
half due to a quadracep strain. He had four points and four
assists. ... The Kings had only 12 assists.

<HEADLINE> Pistons 100, SuperSonics 90  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) - Grant Hill scored 33 points and Jerry Stackhouse
added 21 Tuesday night as the Detroit Pistons won their second
straight road game with a 100-90 victory over the Seattle
SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons, who ended an 11-game road losing streak with a
101-99 victory at Vancouver on Sunday, controlled the game against
the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Hill took over in the fourth quarter with 14 points and reached
30 for the 24th time this season. Stackhouse put the game away with
a two-hand dunk after threading his way around three Sonics
defenders for a 94-83 lead with 1:50 left.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton topped the Sonics with 22 points. Vin Baker and
Rashard Lewis added 18 each as the Sonics dropped their second
straight home game.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit swept the season series from the Sonics. They defeated
the Sonics 107-99 on Nov. 13 in Auburn Hills because of Hill and
Stackhouse, and that one-two punch was too much again for the
Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit had the upper hand most of the game though the Sonics
stayed close throughout the second half. The Sonics are now 1-2 on
their current seven-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had eight points, including two putback baskets, in a 10-3
run for an 81-72 Pistons lead with nine minutes left in the game.
The Sonics got no closer than four points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 67 when the Pistons started their push.
Michael Curry scored on layup on a bounce pass from John Crotty.
Stackhouse blocked Payton's reverse layup that led to a left-hand
runner by Curry for a 71-67 lead. Payton countered with a baseline
jumper that trimmed the deficit to 71-69 after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had 17 and Stackhouse 14 for the Pistons in the opening
half.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit scored the first 10 points of the second period for a
38-33 lead. The Sonics scored the final four points of the first
half for a 51-51 tie.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Crotty, who played for Seattle part of last season, is now
with his sixth team in his eight years in the league. ...Interim
Pistons coach George Irvine played his college basketball at the
University of Washington in Seattle and is 6-2 since replacing
Alvin Gentry, who was fired on March 6.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Rule on Reform Party  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- In the latest round of the Reform Party's
civil war, a federal judge is expected to decide which of its
warring factions controls the party and gets to shape its future.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is Jack Gargan, the man who became chairman Jan. 1
and insists he is still the legal head of the party despite being
voted out of office during a boisterous meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side is Pat Choate, the 1996 running mate of party
founder Ross Perot who was elected to succeed Gargan at the Feb. 12
meeting in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Each faction calls itself the real Reform Party, runs
''official'' party Web sites and claims ownership of $2.5 million
in federal funds for the national party conventions they are
planning.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan said the meeting was held in violation of party rules and
he is suing his predecessors for possession of the financial books.
Choate and others allied with Perot are seeking a court order to
bar Gargan and his supporters from calling themselves Reform Party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At issue before U.S. District Judge Norman K. Moon during the
three-day trial that opens today is which faction, under the law,
represents the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Once a decision is made, a new battle will be waged over control
of the federal money.
</P>
<P>
   With a third of the election year already gone, both factions
are looking to Moon to settle the dispute and provide the group
with stable ground from which to gird for yet another fight -- this
time against an independent panel's decision to exclude from the
official presidential debates any candidate with less than 15
percent support in national public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's decision most directly affects Pat Buchanan,
the former Republican seeking the Reform presidential nomination,
who has single-digit support in most polls.
</P>
<P>
   The infighting also steals attention from Buchanan, as well as
time that the party needs to rebuild its credibility, which
suffered after its highest elected official and most visible
spokesman, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, severed his ties last
month. Gargan was allied with Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Moon rejected Gargan's request to send the $2.5
million in federal funds to the Federal Election Commission, saying
bureaucracy might tie up the money indefinitely. But Gargan and
Ronn Young, the party's former treasurer, missed a Feb. 28 deadline
to turn the money over to the court for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Gargan and Young needed more time
to retrieve the money from at least four bank accounts scattered
from Virginia to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two of their checks to the court -- totaling about $921,000
-- initially bounced, the records show. But earlier this month,
Gargan and Young deposited about $2 million into the court's
custody, records show. The whereabouts of the remaining money has
yet to be determined.

<HEADLINE> Bush Against Condom Tax Exemption  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HOLMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush is disappointed that
condoms are among the over-the-counter medical items that will be
exempt from Texas sales taxes beginning next month, a spokeswoman
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate, who has said abstinence
should be promoted to teen-agers, proposed the tax break during his
re-election campaign in 1998 and didn't want it to cover condoms,
said his spokeswoman, Linda Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   But state Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander said Tuesday she
had no choice but to list condoms as a product that will be exempt
from the 6.25 percent state sales tax and local sales taxes
beginning April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature specified that the tax break should cover any
product that has a National Drug Code number issued by the Food and
Drug Administration and is used to diagnose, treat or prevent
disease and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush never wanted condoms to be exempt,'' Edwards
said. ''A condom is not a drug or medicine, although it does fall
under the FDA's National Drug Code.''
</P>
<P>
   Other over-the-counter items to be exempted include allergy
products, antacids, cold remedies and eye care products. That
should save Texans $160 million in 2001, Rylander said, adding that
prescription drugs have been exempt from the state sales tax since
it was enacted in 1961.

<HEADLINE> Miss America Winners Said Thinner  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Miss America is getting skinnier and
skinnier, according to researchers who conclude that many winners
are undernourished.
</P>
<P>
   Nutrition experts from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health
used the heights and weights from most of the winners in the
pageant's 78-year history for their study in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Benjamin Caballero, director of the Center for Human
Nutrition at Johns Hopkins, said pageant officials should screen
out contestants who are too skinny in order to ''promote a message
of healthiness.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The actual influence of pageant competitions on young women's
decisions about diet and lifestyle is not well-documented,'' he
wrote, ''but it is likely to have a strong, if indirect, effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers used the height and weight figures to calculate
a measure, called body mass index, and concluded that it has
generally fallen over the years. BMI is weight divided by the
square of height.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, contestants had BMIs in the range now considered
normal, which is 20 to 25, the researchers said. But an increasing
number of winners since then have had BMIs under 18.5, which is the
World Health Organization's standard for undernutrition.
</P>
<P>
   The highest index was 22.4 for Miss America 1941, Rosemary
LaPlanche; the lowest, 16.9, for Miss America 1986 Susan Akin.
</P>
<P>
   The pageant was not held from 1927 to 1933, and vital statistics
were not available for some of the years since 1990, when the
pageant stopped listing contestants' heights and weights.
</P>
<P>
   The medical journal did not publish the heights and weights of
the winners.
</P>
<P>
   The lightest Miss America, according to The Press of Atlantic
City newspaper archives, was also the first -- 1921's Margaret
Gorman, who weighed 108 pounds. The heaviest was Miss America 1952
Colleen Kay Hutchins, who weighed 143.
</P>
<P>
   Pageant winners, like the rest of the U.S. population, have
gotten progressively taller. But that doesn't explain the thinning
of Miss America, the researchers said. Pageant winners' height
increased less than 2 percent, but body weight decreased 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, Robert Renneisen Jr., chief executive of the Miss
America Organization, said recent winners have had some of the
highest body mass readings, a reflection of pageant officials'
emphasizing brains over beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The swimsuit competition counts for only 10 percent of the total
score, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We long ago made the change from more superficial to more
substantial criteria,'' Renneisen said. ''We're seeing that, not
only in the caliber of the young women competing but the very data
they show here, which shows that from 1986, even physically, the
kind of person is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   One eating disorders expert said the report substantiates what
he has suspected all along.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beauty pageants, like the rest of our media-driven culture,
give young women in particular a message, over and over again, that
it's exceedingly important to be thin to be considered successful
and attractive,'' said Dr. Harry Brandt, director of the Center for
Eating Disorders at St. Joseph Medical Center in Towson, Md.

<HEADLINE> Protein Deposits, Alzheimer's Link  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Certain protein deposits in the brains of
Alzheimer's victims may be a cause of the mind-robbing disease --
not just a symptom, researchers suggested today.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies on 79 nursing home patients confirmed that
beta-amyloid protein plays a role in the earliest stages of
Alzheimer's, even before symptoms of dementia appear, the
researchers reported in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Sticky plaques of beta-amyloid in the brain and tangles of a
protein known as tau inside brain nerve fibers are two of the
distinguishing features of Alzheimer's, which affects more than 4
million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists disagree over which feature may play a more central
role in the destruction of brain cells. And some believe that the
plaques and tangles are actually markers left by nerve cells killed
by some other unknown cause.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors favor the beta-amyloid theory because they
found that the presence of beta-amyloid preceded development of tau
protein in the brain's frontal cortex.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Dennis J. Selkoe, a
neurologist at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital, called the
conclusion exciting and said it could lead to new ways to diagnose
and treat Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   ''This work, coupled with early work, clearly points to amyloid
build-up as the cause,'' said Selkoe, who holds a stake in Elan
Corp., which is testing a vaccine aimed at preventing beta-amyloid
accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   But an executive at the Alzheimer's Association said the study
does not prove what causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''What it doesn't tell us is which comes first, the chicken or
the egg -- the disease or beta-amyloid,'' said William Theis, vice
president for medical and scientific affairs at the Alzheimer's
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, led by neuroscientist Jan Naslund of Rockefeller
University in New York, studied autopsy results on 63 patients with
mild to severe dementia believed to be caused by Alzheimer's and 16
mentally healthy patients.
</P>
<P>
   Increases of beta-amyloid in brain tissue were associated with
increasing severity of mental decline, with the highest levels of
beta-amyloid found in the brains of patients with the greatest
degree of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Abnormal beta-amyloid levels were also found even in patients
without dementia. The researchers said those patients would have
gone on to develop full-blown Alzheimer's had they lived.
</P>
<P>
   There were already significant levels of beta-amyloid found in
early dementia patients with no tangles in the frontal cortex, said
Dr. Joseph Buxbaum, a co-author and head of the molecular
neuropsychiatry laboratory at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New
York. Buxbaum said that suggests beta-amyloid ''must be a cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Buxbaum said his study is a boost to research aimed at finding
ways to block accumulation of beta-amyloid.

<HEADLINE> Athlete Heart Screenings Said Flawed  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Many campus screening programs aimed at detecting
dangerous heart problems in college athletes are inadequate,
researchers reported today in a survey of more than 800 NCAA
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The screenings are designed to disqualify athletes with such
ailments and prevent sudden deaths like that of Loyola-Marymount
University basketball star Hank Gathers, who collapsed during a
1990 game.
</P>
<P>
   The study, however, found that many such screening programs use
doctors without cardiac training and fail to ask key questions
about family history.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was done by researchers from UCLA and the Minneapolis
Heart Institute Foundation. The findings were published in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The two most common causes of such sudden deaths are hereditary
-- hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is an enlargement of the heart
muscle, and Marfan's syndrome, which usually involves weakened
heart valves.
</P>
<P>
   Both can be fatal during overexertion. They occur in less than 1
percent of the U.S. population, said Dr. Barry Maron, survey
co-author.
</P>
<P>
   Though such deaths are rare, ''they're sensational and create a
great deal of anxiety among athletes, among parents, among school
officials,'' said Dr. William Strong, a professor of pediatric
cardiology at the Medical College of Georgia. Strong helped write
the American Heart Association's guidelines for screening athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1995 and 1997, 855 of 879 schools surveyed screened
athletes with a physical exam and questions about family history
before allowing them to play varsity sports. But only about a
quarter of the screening forms were considered adequate by the
heart association.
</P>
<P>
   Only 52 percent asked questions about chest pain on exertion,
only 21 percent asked about prior limits placed on sports
participation, and only 9 percent asked about a family history of
Marfan's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Just 7 percent performed noninvasive tests such as EKGs and
chest X-rays. The AHA does not recommend such tests be included in
routine screenings because of the cost and the risk of false
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bryan Smith, chairman of the NCAA's Competitive Safeguards
and Medical Aspects of Sports Committee, called the study flawed.
He said that the NCAA published guidelines for member schools in
1998 -- after the survey -- and that schools may have changed
procedures since then.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pre-participation exams, regardless of how well they're done
are not going to completely prevent cases of sudden death,'' Smith
said.

<HEADLINE> Mighty Ducks 5, Kings 2  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kip Miller had a goal and two assists Tuesday
night to carry Anaheim to a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Kings
and move the Mighty Ducks into a tie for the final Western
Conference playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim has 76 points, even with San Jose, which was idle, for
eighth place in the conference. The Kings are in fifth place with
81 points.
</P>
<P>
   Miller gave Anaheim a 3-1 pad 8:06 into the third period with
his ninth goal, then Anaheim's Ladislav Kohn and Paul Kariya scored
to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Cullen set up Miller's goal with a fine effort, punching
the puck in front of him into the Kings' end, then, as he went
sprawling, sweeping the puck to Miller. His 25-foot slap shot
sailed past goaltender Jamie Storr.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings never led, but closed to 3-2 on Nelson Emerson's 15th
goal -- and first with the Kings -- at 11:27 of the final period.
Glen Murray, who scored the Kings' first goal, fed Emerson a
perfect pass across the crease for their second.
</P>
<P>
   But Kohn quickly restored Anaheim's two-goal lead. He scored
after a scramble in front of the net with 8:19 remaining for his
fifth goal. Kariya added his 37th, skating into the crease with
Gary Galley hanging on him and beating Storr high to the glove
side.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 2-0, the Kings scored with 4:39 remaining
in the second period, with Murray getting his first goal in eight
games. With Anaheim defenseman Ruslan Salei right on him, Murray
poked the puck between Guy Hebert's pads for his 13th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Antti Aalto gave Anaheim a 2-0 lead with his sixth goal of the
season, knocking in a rebound with 3:15 left in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Leclerc began the sequence that led to the score, pinching
at the left side and intercepting defenseman Aki Berg's clearing
pass from behind the net. Leclerc quickly fed Miller in the slot,
and Miller fired a shot that Storr blocked.
</P>
<P>
   But the puck dribbled off to the goalie's right, and Aalto was
there to flip it past the sprawling goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Donato opened the scoring 7:55 into the game with his 11th
goal -- just seconds after Ducks defenseman Niclas Havelid got away
with hooking Los Angeles defenseman Sean O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   Donato fired the puck into the crease from near the goal line on
the right side. The puck caromed off the skate of O'Donnell -- who
had just gotten up off the ice and scrambled to get to the crease --
and into the net as the Kings protested to referee Paul Stewart
about Donato not being called for the foul.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Ducks are now 8-1-2 in their last 11 meetings with
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were missing Ziggy Palffy, tied with Luc Robitaille as
their leading scorer. Palffy is sidelined by a right shoulder
strain suffered in the Kings' 2-2 with the Mighty Ducks on March
15.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Court Upholds Adoption Law  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES E. BEGGS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- The Oregon Supreme Court has let stand a
lower court decision upholding the nation's only voter-passed law
allowing adult adoptees access to their birth records.
</P>
<P>
   The decision released Tuesday clears the way for the law, which
easily passed in November 1998, to take effect April 12. The court
gave opponents 21 days to seek reconsideration and foes can appeal
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The law gives adoptees 21 and older access to the birth
certificates, which often contain birth parents' names. The Oregon
Health Division has more than 2,000 requests from adoptees seeking
birth records.
</P>
<P>
   Six anonymous birth mothers challenged the law, arguing it would
violate their rights to privacy. But they've lost three rounds -- a
trial judge and a state appeals court rejected their arguments
before the state's top court declined to review the lower court
judgments.
</P>
<P>
   David Malutinok, president of the National Council for Adoption,
said the group was ''disappointed on behalf of birth mothers and
others who are concerned their privacy has not been taken into
account.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The NCFA stands for mutual consent rather than forcing this on
someone,'' he said. ''We're not against adopted adults and their
birth parents finding each other if they both want to be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other states -- Tennessee, Kansas, Delaware and Alaska --
grant adoptees access to birth records, said Madelyn Freundlich,
executive director of the Adoption Institute, a New York-based
adoption research organization.
</P>
<P>
   While the group doesn't advocate for or against records laws,
she said, surveys indicate that adoptive and birth parents support
the idea of opening records.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who not want contact have been found to represent a very
small minority,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Adoptees who support the law say they should be given the same
opportunity as everyone else to know who their parents are. They
say that finding their birth parents could help detect potential
health problems and give them a sense of identity.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say birth mothers received promises from doctors,
nurses, lawyers and adoption agencies that their identities would
never be revealed and that most have no desire to be contacted by
children they gave up years ago.

<HEADLINE> Pacers 95, Knicks 91  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indiana is the league leader in free throw
accuracy, and New York paid a big price for consistently sending
the Pacers there.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose scored 28 points, including six on free throws, as
Indiana overcame a 10-point deficit in the final 10 minutes to
defeat the New York Knicks 95-91 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did a good job being aggressive. If you're not a team with
the ability to make plays, they can take advantage at the other
end. We took the ball to the hole, on some occasions we got
fouled,'' said Rose, who was 8-of-10 from the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, the league-leader in free throw accuracy, made 24 of 28
attempts. The Knicks got to the line 10 times and made eight. The
Pacers hit 14 free throws in the fourth quarter, while New York
didn't attempt one the entire period.
</P>
<P>
   Rik Smits had 20 for Indiana, including a short jumper over
Patrick Ewing that put the Pacers ahead to stay, 93-91 with 57.4
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a couple of options. Reggie (Miller) was coming off the
paint. If he had a good look, we were going to get it to him. The
ball came to me and I took the shot,'' Smits said.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing led New York with 23 points and was 10-of-18 from the
field. However, Ewing missed his last four shots -- two of them
coming after Smits put Indiana ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Ewing) looked very good. They went to him a lot more often
tonight,'' Smits said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ewing wasn't happy with the execution in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got to take better shots down the stretch,'' he said. ''The
bottom line is we got to execute on offense. When we play good
defense, we've got to go down and get good shots. ... We blew it.
This was a win that we should have have.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's final miss came with 6.9 seconds left and Rose grabbed
the rebound. He was quickly fouled and hit both free throws with
4.1 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The victory made Indiana, which has the league's best home
record (31-3), the first team in the Eastern Conference to clinch a
playoff spot. It also game the Pacers a 4{-game advantage over
Miami in the battle for home court advantage throughout the
conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller had 17 for Indiana, including a 3-pointer that
ignited Indiana's comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe tonight was the start of the playoffs. We're
fighting for our lives, trying to keep our lead in the East,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers won despite shooting just 4-of-12 from the field in
the fourth quarter. New York, which shot 33-of-61 in the first
three periods, was 7-of-26 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   New York took its biggest lead of the game at 81-71 as Kurt
Thomas and Marcus Camby scored the first two baskets of the fourth
quarter. Starting with Miller's 3-pointer, Indiana used free throws
to tie the game at 87 with a 16-6 run. The Pacers scored 10
consecutive points on free throws during the run, which ended on a
3-pointer by Austin Croshere.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time all season New York has blown a lead of 10
or more points in the fourth quarter and lost the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's fadeaway jumper gave New York its final lead at 89-87
and a basket by Latrell Sprewell made it 91-87 with 2:37 to play.
Two free throws by Smits and a jumper by Croshere tied the game
with 1:49 left, setting the stage for the go-ahead bucket as each
team exchanged turnovers.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Indiana's sellout streak at Conseco Fieldhouse is 34 games.
... Derrick McKey missed his third consecutive game with a strained
muscle in his right leg. Dale Davis rejoined the Pacers after
missing four games with a strained hamstring although he did not
start. He was limited to only 15 minutes after taking an elbow to
his eye that needed four stitches. ... Indiana had seven blocks,
with Smits getting three. ... Larry Johnson struggled from the
field, shooting just 3-of-16. ... Rose has been in double figures
35 consecutive games, scoring at least 20 in 17 of his last 23. ...
The game was the 200th of Larry Bird's coaching career and Miller's
1,000th as a player.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture secretary begins tour to raise awareness of invadingpests  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman began a
tour to publicize invading agricultural pests with a visit to an
urban park where the Asian long-horned beetle has felled 24 trees.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said he started his four-day tour in New York on
Tuesday because of the beetle, which has killed 4,400 trees in the
city, and the West Nile virus, the mosquito-borne virus that killed
seven people in the New York region last year and sickened 52
others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether it's the beetle or whether it's the West Nile virus,
the culprit that we're looking at here is species that are not
native to the United States, that come in many different ways,''
Glickman said. ''They can wreak havoc on farm and rural
communities, but they can also wreak havoc in urban areas, and they
can cause a public health problem to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said the West Nile virus has apparently survived the
winter, and with mosquito season approaching, his department has
allocated $375,000 in emergency funds for surveillance and testing
for the virus, primarily in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service has appointed a full-time coordinator to work with other
federal, state and local agencies in combating the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary was joined by U.S. Reps. Carolyn Maloney and
Joseph Crowley, New York City Democrats who touted their efforts to
obtain federal funds to combat the Asian beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney called the beetle, which entered the United States in
wooden Chinese packing crates and shipments of bonsai trees, ''a
large, ugly black bug with white spots on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said he had secured $7 million in the federal budget for
Fiscal Year 2001 to fight the beetle, a $5 million increase over
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Could we as New Yorkers imagine a Central Park with no
trees?'' Crowley asked. ''I dare say it wouldn't be the attraction
it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, Crowley, Glickman and other USDA officials then
shoveled dirt onto a newly planted tree in Ruppert Park on the
Upper East Side, where Maloney said the Asian beetle has killed two
dozen trees.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman's tour was to continue today in Miami, where he planned
to visit a lime grove damaged by citrus canker.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday he will tour an inspection facility on the
U.S.-Mexican border south of San Diego, and on Friday he will visit
the Port of Long Beach, the nation's busiest cargo container port.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Executes Convicted Killer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- A man convicted of killing two women was
executed by injection early Wednesday after refusing for years to
appeal his case amid claims that a gunshot wound had affected his
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Hampton, 62, did not seek clemency from Gov. Mel
Carnahan.
</P>
<P>
   As the first drug was administered, Hampton raised his head,
looked around and coughed a few times. His last words: ''Take the
phone off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton admitted beating Frances Keaton, 58, to death with a
hammer in 1992 after abducting her from her home in Warrenton. He
then fled to New Jersey, where he killed another woman, Christine
Schurman, 48, during a kidnapping attempt.
</P>
<P>
   As police moved in on Hampton, he stuck a gun beneath his chin
and shot himself. The bullet exited through the front of Hampton's
brain. At his trial in 1996, a neurologist testified that the brain
wound affected Hampton's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty opponents blamed impaired judgment for Hampton's
desire to die.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton went to reform school at age 11 and spent his adult life
in and out of prisons. Before his murder sentences, he served time
in 25 different prisons for crimes ranging from burglary to assault
to drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Issue Back in Congress  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anti-smoking legislators promised to move
quickly and aggressively to revive tobacco legislation after the
Supreme Court ruled that current law does not allow the government
to regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who led the unsuccessful charge
for tobacco legislation two years ago, also cautioned that, as in
the past, overcoming resistance from the tobacco industry will not
be easy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, just returned to the Senate after his unsuccessful run
for the Republican presidential nomination, said he would like to
see tobacco regulated but worried that tobacco companies, major
sources of political contributions, ''are too powerful'' for that
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Until Congress enacts legislation to limit campaign spending, he
said Tuesday, ''I'm not optimistic we're going to get that done.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Rep. Henry Waxman, a leading proponent of
anti-smoking legislation, said he was reintroducing a measure that
would give the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate
tobacco as a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now our responsibility,'' Waxman, D-Calif., said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said he was introducing
legislation giving the secretary of Health and Human Services the
authority to regulate the manufacture and distribution of tobacco
products. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said the Senate ''should be
able to act expeditiously to grant the FDA the full authority it
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also weighed in from India, urging Congress to
move swiftly. ''If we are to protect our children from the harms of
tobacco, Congress must now enact the provisions of the FDA rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, in its 5-4 decision Tuesday, said the FDA was
exercising an authority not granted by Congress when it reversed a
decades-old policy in 1996 and sought to crack down on cigarette
sales to minors.
</P>
<P>
   But any effort to regulate the tobacco industry faces strong
obstacles in Congress, as witnessed two years ago when the Senate
defeated an ambitious plan championed by McCain that would have
raised $516 billion over 25 years from increased prices for
cigarettes, bolstered anti-smoking campaigns and given the FDA
authority to regulate nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain bill had majority support but fell three short of
getting the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. Many
Republicans said they couldn't accept it because the bill, by
increasing the price of a pack of cigarettes, violated their
promise not to impose any new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It may be even more difficult to pass a tobacco bill in this
presidential election year, although both major party candidates
favor congressional action to further restrict tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the campaign of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumptive GOP presidential nominee, said Bush believes
''decisions about tobacco regulation should be made by Congress and
state legislatures'' and ''that Congress should pass tough laws to
keep tobacco out of the hands of kids similar to strict anti-teen
smoking laws he advocated and signed in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   His presumed Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, said,
''It is time for the Republican Congress and George Bush to show
their independence from Big Tobacco and do the right thing by
passing legislation that has had bipartisan support.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial reactions on Capitol Hill to the Supreme Court
ruling indicated that new anti-tobacco legislation would be far
more modest, focusing on giving the FDA regulatory power.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a physician who co-sponsored the 1998
bill with McCain, would consider introducing legislation based on
the FDA portion of the larger bill, said his spokeswoman, Margaret
Camp.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who has final say
about what gets to the Senate floor, said he was ''not one of
those'' who believes the FDA should have control over tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they do a very good job with what they're doing
now without more requirements being dumped on them,'' Lott said.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Prepares for Execution  </HEADLINE>
By AMY GREEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee is preparing to execute its
first inmate in 40 years and fall in line with the rest of the
South, where more people are executed than anywhere else in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is the only Southern state that has not executed
anyone since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Coe, 43, is scheduled to die by injection early Thursday
for kidnapping, raping and murdering an 8-year-old girl in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Coe's attorneys contend that he is insane and that executing him
will violate the 8th Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual
punishment. Appeals have failed and a federal judge will likely
decide today whether to delay execution to review claims about
Coe's mental competence.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of religious leaders are protesting the execution, but
they are the minority in a city known as the buckle of the Bible
Belt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's any accident,'' said the Rev. Joe Ingle of
Nashville, a death row minister since 1974 and a staunch opponent
of the death penalty. ''The Bible Belt is also the Death Belt.''
</P>
<P>
   According to 1998 statistics published by the U.S. Justice
Department, 68 percent of Protestants and 68 percent of Catholics
favored the death penalty, while 64 percent of those who cited no
religious faith also expressed support.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Supreme Court decision in 1976, 490 inmates in 12
Southern states have been put to death, compared with 120 elsewhere
in the nation, according to the Death Penalty Information Center in
Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Texas leads the nation with 211 executions and some 450 death
row inmates, followed by Florida with 46 executions and some 390
death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The other Southern states are Virginia, with 76 executions;
Louisiana, 25; South Carolina, 24; Georgia, 23; Oklahoma, 22;
Arkansas, 21; Alabama, 21; North Carolina, 15; Mississippi, 4; and
Kentucky, 2.
</P>
<P>
   Another Tennessee inmate, Philip Workman, is scheduled to be
executed April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Don Welch, associate dean of the Vanderbilt University Law
School, said protests from religious leaders have been partly
responsible for sparing the 96 men and two women on Tennessee's
death row.
</P>
<P>
   But recent changes in state and federal laws limiting the number
and the grounds for appeals for death row inmates have also forced
Tennessee to set execution dates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The move suits the Nashville-based Southern Baptist Convention,
the nation's largest Protestant denomination and death penalty
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that the state has a God-given responsibility to
protect society, and that the Bible tells us that includes the
ultimate penalty,'' said Barrett Duke, vice president of research
for the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Coe's crimes may seem especially gruesome to Christians. After
8-year-old Cary Ann Medlin was raped, Coe told authorities that
''she told me that Jesus loves me, and that is when I got so upset
and I decided to kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he pulled out a pocket knife after an attempt to
strangle the child failed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stabbed her in the neck once and pushed her down on the
ground,'' Coe said. ''She started jerking and grabbing at her shirt
at the neck. I stood there and watched the blood come out of her
neck like turning on a water hose.''
</P>
<P>
   Nashville resident Cathy Sparks said when Southerners hear
statements like that, it only strengthens their support of capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They see it as an embodiment of the moral decay in our
society,'' said Sparks, who opposes the death penalty. ''What
better way to snuff out that decay than to put it in the form of a
person and fry it to death?''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon Wray, director of Nashville's Restorative Justice
Ministries for the United Methodist Church, offered this view:
''There's a tendency to see God as a large, male sheriff with a gun
... ready to retaliate against anybody he doesn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think (capital punishment) is at odds with true
Christianity,'' Wray said.

<HEADLINE> End to Social Security Limit Eyed  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- During the 1996 presidential year, lawmakers
and an incumbent president decided to let seniors earn more without
penalizing their Social Security benefits. It's election time
again, and members of both parties can't move fast enough to remove
the penalties entirely.
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed by the House three weeks go to scrap the earnings
limit on about 800,000 people age 65 through 69 who continue to
work gets a vote in the Senate today.
</P>
<P>
   Under what some lawmakers term a relic of yesteryear, those
elderly workers now lose $1 in Social Security benefits for every
$3 in wages they make above $17,000. Until Congress acted four
years ago, they could only make $11,250 a year before seeing their
benefits drop.
</P>
<P>
   ''The earnings limit is part of a bygone era,'' said Senate
Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, a 78-year-old Republican
facing a tough re-election battle this year in Delaware. ''It is a
byproduct of the Great Depression, a time when folks believed an
individual should retire completely and make room for others to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Social Security recipients in their late 60s
could only make $11,250 on the job before having to give back a
portion of their benefit checks. Congress voted then to gradually
raise the earnings ceiling in steps to $30,000 by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who is not seeking re-election, also
voiced strong support for the bill but expressed concerns that more
comprehensive Social Security reform wasn't addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Without either an increase in the current 12.4 percent Social
Security tax or a decrease in benefits, the fund will start paying
out more money than it receives each year beginning in 2017,
shortly after the post-World War II baby boomers begin retiring in
mass, experts warn.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not likely the baby boomers will come to Congress and ask
for less,'' Kerrey said. ''It's likely they will ask for more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate amended the House-passed bill to change language that
would have imposed a more stringent earning limit on some Social
Security beneficiaries age 64. The bill must return to the House
for its assent to the change but aides said it should win swift
approval there again. The House unanimously passed the bill March
1.
</P>
<P>
   ''The technical amendment is not controversial,'' said Trent
Duffy, spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee. ''If that
is the only amendment, it will have House approval.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton endorsed the bill but said he would sign it
only if it were free of serious changes.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Drug Rezulin Off the Market  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rezulin, which once was cheered as offering
new hope for some diabetes patients, has been withdrawn from the
market after being linked to at least 61 deaths from liver
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration requested the drug be removed
Tuesday. The agency said the drug's manufacturers,
Parke-DavisWarner-Lambert of Morris Plains, N.J., agreed to the
action.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin was prescribed for type 2, or adult onset, diabetes
patients who had not responded to other therapies. It was used by
about 750,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent critic of the FDA, Dr. Sidney Wolfe, said the drug
should have been taken off the market long ago. He described
Rezulin as ''one of the most dangerous drugs'' on the market.
</P>
<P>
   According to an FDA announcement, a review of recent safety data
showed that Rezulin was more toxic to the liver than two newer
drugs, Avandia and Actos, which have similar action.
</P>
<P>
   ''Data to date show that Avandia and Actos, both approved in the
past year, offer the same benefits as Rezulin without the same
risk,'' the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now confident that patients have safer alternatives in
this important class of diabetes drugs,'' said Dr. Janet Woodcock,
director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
</P>
<P>
   The action comes just days after the FDA announced that at least
61 deaths had been linked to Rezulin and an FDA physician had sent
a letter asking Congress to help him persuade agency officials to
remove the drug from the market.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a
consumer advocacy group, said Rezulin ''should have been long
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The British government took it off the market a long time ago.
The question is, why did it take the FDA so long to take it off the
market?'' said Wolfe. He said if the agency had acted earlier, some
patients would still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is just another example of how low the standards have
gotten at FDA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin was well-received when it first went on the market in
1997 because it was the only drug available that restored the
body's sensitivity to insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Type 2 diabetes develops when the body no longer responds to
insulin, a hormone required to process sugar in the blood. Doctors
hailed Rezulin because it promised treatment for patients who
failed other therapies. Untreated diabetes can cause heart and
kidney failure, blindness and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   After Rezulin was on the market, the FDA began receiving reports
of patients suffering from liver failure after taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA ordered Parke-Davis to put stronger liver toxicity
warnings on the drug and an advisory committee recommended that the
drug be available to only a select group of patients -- those whose
diabetes was not well-controlled by other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, at least 61 patients died of liver failure while
taking Rezulin and another seven required liver transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Avandia, manufactured by SmithKline Beecham, and Actos, made by
Takeda Pharmaceuticals and marketed by Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., were
approved last year as alternative drugs to Rezulin. The agency said
Tuesday that after nine months on the market, it is clear that the
newer drugs ''have less risk of severe liver toxicity than
Rezulin.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Continued use of Rezulin now poses an unacceptable risk to
patients,'' said Woodcock.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said patients now taking Rezulin should contact their
doctors and discuss alternative treatments.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Policy, Rights Weighed  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court is weighing foreign policy
and human rights issues in a case that asks whether states can
limit purchases from companies that do business in countries known
for rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts sought to express its objection to such abuses in
Myanmar by generally refusing to buy from companies with dealings
in that Asian country.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing arguments today, the Supreme Court must decide by
summer whether Massachusetts is lawfully participating in the
economic market as it sees fit or unlawfully interfering with U.S.
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing in our federal Constitution denies to the states the
right to apply a moral standard to their spending decisions,'' the
state's lawyers said in court papers. ''Not one constitutional
grant, prohibition or command requires the states to trade with
dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   But the National Foreign Trade Council, which challenged the
1996 Massachusetts law, said in court briefs, ''The Constitution
reserves such foreign policy exercises exclusively to the national
government. To allow individual state action would undermine
national policy and put the nation at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is supporting the foreign trade
group, which won a lower court ruling that the law interferes with
the federal government's conduct of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Several state and local governments have restricted their
dealings with companies that do business in Myanmar as well as
other countries including China and Cuba. During the 1980s, many
states and cities boycotted companies that did business in South
Africa because of racial apartheid there.
</P>
<P>
   The military has ruled Myanmar, one of the world's poorest
countries, since 1962. Foreign donors including the United States
have heavily restricted aid to Myanmar-- also known as Burma -- since
a 1988 crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising in which the military
gunned down thousands of protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts law says a company doing business with Myanmar
can sell goods and services to the state only if its bid is 10
percent lower than all other bids. The law makes exceptions for
purchases of some medical devices and for news-gathering and
international telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Several months after the Massachusetts law was enacted, Congress
imposed its own more limited sanctions on Myanmar. Under the law,
President Clinton barred new U.S. investment in the country in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign trade council challenged the Massachusetts law in
1998. A federal judge ruled for the council, as did the 1st U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, which said the law interfered with
federal foreign policy and was pre-empted by the federal
government's own sanctions against Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' appeal is supported by 22 states: Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine,
Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Texas, Utah, Vermont and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign trade council is supported by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, American Insurance
Association and Chemical Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Natsios vs. National Foreign Trade Council, 99-474.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Talks Off to Good Start  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talks between Israel and the Palestinians at a
secluded U.S. Air Force base are off to a positive start. According
to a senior Israeli official, drafting of a prospective agreement
could begin by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides began over lunch at the officers' club at Bolling
Air Force Base Tuesday, then decided to meet head-to-head Tuesday
night at a townhouse there.
</P>
<P>
   American mediators Dennis Ross and Aaron Miller were on hand,
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright a telephone call away
with President Clinton on a visit to South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is willing to offer its own
proposals, but that would done be later, if Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators faltered.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said, ''We expect this
process to take a substantial amount of time to overcome
differences on these profound issues. And therefore, we do not
expect there to be early breakthroughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said there was ''an enormous amount of work to be done''
if Israel and the Palestinians intend to meet their Sept. 13
deadline for resolving Palestinian demands for a state and for part
of Jerusalem and settling other tough issues.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the negotiators began grappling with the Palestinian
demands, Israel surrendered an additional 6.1 percent of the West
Bank. It gave Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat a larger foundation
for a state and some land close to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians entered the talks in southeast Washington
hopeful not only to make headway on terms of a final settlement but
to ensure that the next scheduled Israeli pullback, in June, is a
generous one.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the talks were part of a step-by-step process of coming to terms
with the Palestinians. The official said one aim this week was to
find, with help from U.S. mediators, ''bridging proposals'' on
tough problems so the two sides could begin drafting a potential
accord at the conclusion of the week-long talks.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also is pursuing reopened negotiations with Syria, which
were broken off in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is due to meet Sunday in Geneva, Switzerland,
with Syrian President Hafez Assad. Their first meeting in six years
is likely to result in resumption of the Israeli-Syrian talks, but
that would not mean the two sides were ready to strike a deal, the
Israeli official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Washington Post, however, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak said that Syria and Israel have come close
to a peace agreement through indirect talks that have continued
unannounced since U.S.-brokered negotiations broke down in January.
The Egyptian said remaining issues ''will not be so complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   En route to Europe from South Asia, Clinton also plans to meet
with Sultan Qaboos of Oman when Air Force One stops in that Persian
Gulf country to refuel. Israel has a handful of diplomats in Muscat
operating a trade office, and Qaboos has had a significant
behind-the-scenes role in Middle East peace diplomacy for years.

Two captives had jumped to safety and a third, a 12-year-old boy, was rescued by
police. ''All of the hostages are safe,'' police spokeswoman Vickie Warehime

death by police. The only shots fired at the end of the standoff came from
police, Warehime said. The standoff began Friday when Palczynski forced his way

vulnerable, while his campaign conceded that he still has some work to do to win
over supporters of former rival John McCain. With 90 percent of precincts
reporting in the Republican primary, unofficial returns showed Bush with 423,715

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jalen Rose scored 28 points and Indiana overcame a
10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to defeat the New York Knicks 95-91
Tuesday night. The victory made Indiana, which has the league's best home record
(31-3), the first team in the Eastern Conference to clinch a playoff spot. It
also gave the Pacers a 4{-game advantage over Miami in the battle for home court
advantage throughout the conference playoffs. The Pacers won despite shooting
just 4-of-12 from the field in the fourth quarter. New York, which shot 33-of-61
in the first three periods, made only 7-of-26 attempts in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> NFL, Union on Same Side on Agents  </HEADLINE>
By KARREN MILLS, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- An investigation of claims that the San
Francisco 49ers made deals to get around the NFL's salary cap is
being delayed while a judge decides whether agents can be penalized
for violating the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL and its players union are appealing an arbitrator's
decision that agents can't be fined or sanctioned under the
collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are being investigated to determine whether they made
undisclosed payments to quarterback Steve Young and other players
in violation of the labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Minneapolis will hear arguments in the appeal
Thursday. His decision could establish a precedent for negotiations
throughout the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Under the labor agreement, salary cap disputes are sent to an
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of the 49ers has been stalled since early
December in a dispute over whether agents are subject to the
agreement because they represent players.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL contends the 49ers and agents Leigh Steinberg, Jeffrey
Moorad and Gary Wichard entered into secret agreements regarding
compensation for Young, former tight end Brent Jones and
quarterback Jim Druckenmiller, who now plays for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg and Moorad are partners and represent Young and Jones;
Wichard represents Druckenmiller.
</P>
<P>
   Special Master Jack Friedenthal ruled on Feb. 18 that agents are
not part of the 7-year-old collective bargaining agreement and
cannot be fined or sanctioned by the NFL or the NFL Players
Association for violating the labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   The league and the union have asked U.S. District Judge David
Doty, who approved the collective bargaining agreement in mid-1993,
to overturn Friedenthal's ruling. Doty presided at the antitrust
trial that led to the contract and has jurisdiction over all NFL
contract matters.
</P>
<P>
   If Friedenthal's order is overturned, the agents could be fined
up to $250,000 each under the collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL contends the agents are accountable to league rules and
subject to fines under the collective bargaining agreement because
they represent players.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL also says the agents are subject to the agreement
because they must be authorized to work in the league and pay dues
to the players' association. The agents maintain they cannot be
penalized for working on behalf of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Once Doty rules on the status of agents, the case goes back to
Friedenthal for further investigation into accusations against the
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, the 49ers confirmed the NFL was investigating
possible cap violations when Carmen Policy was the team president
and Dwight Clark was the general manager. Both now work for the
Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Walsh, the 49ers general manager, said the 49ers were
cooperating with the investigation.

<HEADLINE> 4 in 10 Ballplayers Make $1 Million  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- At the present rate of pay increases, half of
the players in major league baseball will have salaries of $1
million or more in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Of 916 players on Aug. 31 rosters, 342 players made $1 million
or more, according to a study of all major league contracts by The
Associated Press. That comes out to a record 37.3 percent, up from
36.5 percent in 1998 and 34.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were just 326 players at $1 million or more, and
that was up from 285 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Albert Belle was first at $11,949,794, followed by
Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez ($11.25 million), Los Angeles pitcher
Kevin Brown ($10,714,286), Atlanta pitcher Greg Maddux ($10.6
million), Los Angeles outfielder Gary Sheffield ($9,936,667), New
York Yankees outfielder Bernie Williams ($9,857,143), Arizona
pitcher Randy Johnson ($9.65 million), Yankees pitcher David Cone
($9.5 million), San Francisco outfielder Barry Bonds ($9,381,057)
and St. Louis first baseman Mark McGwire ($9,308,667).
</P>
<P>
   Figures include all salaries and earned bonuses, plus prorated
shares of signing bonuses and other guaranteed income. Figures
usually are finalized in December, but calculations were delayed
this year, primarily due to players who signed extensions during
the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, 15.8 percent of players, 145 in all, made the
minimum $200,000, up from 14.1 percent in 1998 and 13.0 percent in
1997. The Minnesota Twins had nine, the most of any team.
</P>
<P>
   The salary escalation seems assured of continuing this year, but
exact calculations can't be made until the week of April 3, after
teams set their opening-day rosters.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, many teams keep several veterans on minor league
rosters. Once a player is added to the major league roster, his
salary for the season becomes guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Figures were obtained by the AP from management and player
sources. For some players, parts of salaries deferred without
interest are discounted to reflect current values.

<HEADLINE> Tuesday's Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres were sure they'd gotten a clubhouse leader
when they traded for Al Martin last month.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're not sure what they got in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' low-key spring training turned bizarre when Martin
was accused of being a bigamist and punching a woman who claims she
became his wife in a Las Vegas wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone's shocked,'' third baseman Phil Nevin said Tuesday at
Peoria, Ariz. ''He's a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, traded from Pittsburgh to San Diego on Feb. 23 for
utilityman John Vander Wal and two minor leaguers, and Shawn
Haggerty-Martin were arrested on assault charges late Monday night.
They were released on their own recognizance and told to stay away
from each other.
</P>
<P>
   The police report contained accusations of bigamy, threats with
a gun and a wedding that Martin admits attending but didn't think
was real.
</P>
<P>
   According to Clark County records, a Shawn M. Haggerty married
an Albert C. Martin in Las Vegas on Dec. 11, 1998. The police
report lists Haggerty's middle name as Michelle, but Martin's is
listed as Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Martin released a statement through his agent, Jeff Moorad,
categorically denying the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night, I had an argument with a woman, Shawn Haggerty,
whom I have known for several years. This argument escalated and
eventually led to police intervention,'' Martin said. ''I take
these charges extremely seriously and will continue to cooperate
fully with the authorities investigating this incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres general manager Kevin Towers has known Martin since his
days as a scout with the Pirates in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''This would be the last guy that I think this would ever happen
to,'' Towers said. ''He's always been a model citizen and a guy who
represents himself well.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Padres were playing the Chicago Cubs, owner John
Moores and Towers met with Martin and his wife, Cathy, at their
Scottsdale home for about 1{ hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very emotional, very embarrassed,'' Towers said. ''The
last thing he wanted to do was be here (four) weeks and be a
distraction to this ballclub before we start our season.''
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale Justice Court, Martin was barefoot and wore the
same ripped white shirt, speckled with blood, that he had on when
he and Haggerty-Martin were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty-Martin was charged with assault-domestic violence, and
Martin was charged with assault-physical injury and threatening or
intimidating, all misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Police will investigate Haggerty-Martin's claim that Martin is
married to two women, Scottsdale police Sgt. Doug Dirren said.
</P>
<P>
   A judge entered innocent pleas for both, and a pretrial
conference was scheduled for April 12, the same day the Padres are
to play the Arizona Diamondbacks in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty-Martin began hitting Martin during an argument, and he
punched her in the jaw at least once, Dirren said.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty-Martin had a swollen face and he had scratches across
the bridge of his nose and behind his left ear, according to the
police report.
</P>
<P>
   Towers said at the time of the trade that Martin was a
''tremendous clubhouse presence'' and a team leader.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty-Martin said that at some point she realized that Martin
was still married, but he kept telling her that they were getting a
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Martin told police that he is not married to Haggerty-Martin,
but that she has been his girlfriend for about six years. Martin
told police that he attended a ceremony in Las Vegas a couple of
years ago but didn't believe it was real.
</P>
<P>
   In exhibition games:
</P>
<P>
Cardinals 10, Orioles 6, 10 innings
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Mark McGwire homered for the second

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Deadly for Reporters  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sierra Leone, a small West African country
roughly the size of Indiana, did not capture much time on the
nightly television news, but for journalists, it was the deadliest
assignment of 1999, a report says.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 journalists killed in the line of duty last year, 10
of them died covering the story of a rebellion by the Revolutionary
United Front against the elected government of Sierra Leone,
according to ''Attacks on the Press in 1999,'' an annual report by
the Committee to Protect Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their stories ... provide grisly evidence of what we believe
is an ominous trend: With civil conflicts increasing in all regions
of the world, the armed factions fighting them often see
journalists as witnesses to be eliminated,'' said Ann K. Cooper,
executive director of CPJ, a New York-based group that defends
press freedoms around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The report also suggests that many other countries are using
other means to repress the media, ''including such subtler tactics
as squeezing them financially through fines and punitive
taxation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, most of the killings occurred within a few days
last January, and many of the victims were hunted down by rebels to
stop them from writing about civilian atrocities, the report said.
Among the fallen:
</P>
<P>
   --James Ogogo of the Concord Times, who was sought by the RUF and
was shot.
</P>
<P>
   --Jenner ''J.C.'' Cole of Sierra Leone radio station SKY-FM, who
was abducted by the rebels and shot dead in front of his fiancee.
He reportedly was on a list of journalists to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   --Myles Tierney of The Associated Press, who was shot to death
when a man reported to be a rebel opened fire on his vehicle with a
semiautomatic rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The committee suspects the deaths of an additional 18
journalists in various nations were linked to their reportage, but
the committee's investigators are still working to substantiate
those connections.
</P>
<P>
   After Sierra Leone, the most dangerous place to report the news
was in Yugoslavia, where six journalists died. Colombia also was
risky, with five reporters killed on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The report documents a wide range of other types of attacks
against journalists, including hundreds who were fined or
assaulted, and 87 who were being held behind bars for their work by
the close of 1999. Among those imprisoned were 19 journalists in
China and 18 in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also offered a special report on the media in
Pakistan and the government's use of tax laws, import regulations
and other methods of censorship or repression.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sophisticated despots are adopting more subtle methods to
muzzle the press,'' Cooper said. ''Some wily leaders understand
that regimes can pay an international price for routinely jailing
journalists, so instead, they drive independent media out of
business by harassing them with tax laws, levying crippling fines,
or cutting off access to state-controlled newsprint and printing
presses.''
</P>
<P>
   Other countries that the report says employ such tactics are
Ukraine, Belarus and Algeria, where more reporters -- 59 -- died in
the 1990s than in any other country.

<HEADLINE> FAA approves Stewart Airport privatization  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal officials have given Stewart
International Airport permission to privatize.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration's approval late Tuesday was
the last regulatory hurdle needed to complete the deal for the
Newburgh airport. Stewart will be the first commercial airport in
the nation to privatize under a new FAA pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the New York State Department of Transportation,
David Bennett, the FAA's Director of the Office of Airport Safety
and Standards, said the office has concluded its review.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are prepared to issue the exemptions and other approvals
required for the lease of the airport,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   New York lawmakers including Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer and
Republican Reps. Benjamin Gilman and Sue Kelly praised the deal,
saying it would provide an economic boost to the mid-Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stewart offers quick, convenient access to the New York
metropolitan areas and possesses tremendous growth potential,''
Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, National Express Group, a subsidiary of a
British transportation company, will lease the airport from the
state for 99 years. NEG's parent company already operates two
airports in England. It will be able to run the airport 60 miles
north of New York City as it wishes within regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The lease must still be closed by the state and NEG. The deal
was negotiated by the Pataki administration and recently received
an okay from state Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
   New York state will get $35 million, plus 5 percent of the gross
after 10 years or 1.38 million passengers, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   NEG has promised more aggressive promotion of the airport --
which has seen passenger departures drop by about 25 percent over
two years to 305,509 last year. Critics have contended the state's
lack of marketing contributed to the drop.
</P>
<P>
   The company also wants to attract more cargo traffic and new
passenger carriers, including low-cost carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was used as a flight training area for cadets at nearby
West Point before serving as a U.S. Air Force base from 1948 to
1969, when the state took ownership. Scheduled passenger flights
began departing from Stewart in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Three other airports have been accepted into the FAA pilot
program: Brown Field in San Diego, Niagara Falls International
Airport and Rafael Hernandez Airport in Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Persian rugs now legal, but their future in U.S. market stillknotty  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RACHMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hundreds of exquisite oriental rugs line the
walls of Sol Kalati's dim Manhattan warehouse. Rolled and upright,
the thick trunks of these masterpieces -- likely the only art made
to be trod on -- burst with ivory arabesques and crimson medallions.
</P>
<P>
   Kalati peers through the thick of his rug forest and shrugs. The
United States is allowing Persian rugs to be imported for the first
time in 13 years but, he asks, what does it matter now?
</P>
<P>
   ''Generations have changed,'' says Kalati, in his Antique Rug
Mall warehouse. ''There were people who bought these things as an
investment. That generation is dead. For the new generation, they
don't know Persian rugs, they haven't seen Persian rugs.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced the end of
the import ban on Persian carpets, caviar and pistachios on Friday.
But carpet dealers in the United States say Iran will have to fight
to regain its place in the U.S. market because Indian, Pakistani
and Chinese factories filled the gap during the ban, even adopting
traditional Iranian motifs and colors.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Islamic revolution in 1979, Iran had about 80 percent
of the U.S. market in Oriental rugs, said Ron O'Callaghan, a dealer
in New Hampton, N.H., and publisher of the online magazine
rugreview.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they dropped out, the other makers said, 'What do you
want? What size? What color?''' said O'Callaghan. ''I don't see the
Iranians ever recapturing the market share that they enjoyed as
recently as 25, 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The rug trade in the United States -- conducted in darkened
showrooms in midtown Manhattan, in top-flight department stores and
increasingly on the Internet -- is a $1.25 billion business,
O'Callaghan said.
</P>
<P>
   Shahriar Afshar, president of the San Diego-based Iranian Trade
Association, which lobbied for lifting the sanctions, pointed out
that Persian rugs are Iran's biggest export after oil.
</P>
<P>
   Iran still gets 85 percent of its foreign exchange earnings from
oil so the U.S. move is largely symbolic -- but it's a gesture that
will resonate among Iranians who value their nation's artistic
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iranians are very proud of their carpets,'' Afshar said.
''It's kind of like -- if the U.S. can imagine -- exporting the
Mustang or apple pie. It's the very best that Iran has to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of Oriental carpets for the West goes back to the
days when Marco Polo judged that Asia Minor produced ''the best and
handsomest carpets in the World.''
</P>
<P>
   The precise origins of Oriental rugs are debated, but they
started out warming the floors of tents in Central Asia. Later,
tribes developed stylized motifs, preferred dyes, knot-types -- all
of which the keen collector can use to pinpoint origin.
</P>
<P>
   The carpet trade with the West took off in the 16th century,
when Iran's shahs elevated tribal rug-weaving to an art and an
industry. European kings and courtiers soon began demanding carpets
from Persia.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the ban, Iran's trade in rugs with the West by no
means ended. The country exported millions of dollars worth each
year to Europe, and antique Persians still are regarded as among
the finest rugs.
</P>
<P>
   But it's telling that the term ''Persian carpet'' to mean all
Oriental rugs has largely disappeared in the United States.
''Oriental rug'' has become the generic phrase -- partly for
accuracy but also because ''Persian'' no longer describes the
product.
</P>
<P>
   It's the recognition of the carpet as an integral part of Iran's
culture that makes lifting the U.S. import ban important, said
Hooshang Amirahmadi, who heads the American-Iranian Council that
arranged the conference where Albright made her announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than caviar or pistachios,'' he said, ''the carpet is
part of Iran's identity.''

<HEADLINE> James Hampton executed for kidnapping, beating death of woman  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SALTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- James Henry Hampton told anyone who would
listen that he didn't want to grow old in prison. So when police
cornered the two-time killer in New Jersey in 1992, Hampton put a
.38-caliber revolver beneath his chin and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bullet blew upward through his head, taking out an
eye and exiting through the frontal lobe of his brain, it didn't
kill Hampton. Over the next 7{ years, Hampton made it clear he
wanted to be executed, though death penalty opponents claimed the
bullet wound affected his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Early this morning, Hampton, 62, finally got his wish. He died
by chemical injection shortly after midnight at the Potosi
Correctional Center for the first of the two 1992 murders -- one in
which he used a hammer to beat a blindfolded and bound Missouri
woman to death.
</P>
<P>
   His last words: ''Take the phone off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first execution in Missouri this year and the 42nd
since the death penalty was reinstated here in 1989. Over Hampton's
objections, a group of death penalty opponents sought clemency from
Gov. Mel Carnahan, who rejected the request late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton refused interview requests from The Associated Press in
the days leading up to the execution. But two years ago, in
response to a court's question about why he wanted to die, Hampton
said:
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm 60 years old. I've confessed. I see prisoners down in
Potosi with 15 years on the row before they finally get to the
execution chamber, and I know that I don't want to go through that.
... I don't want to spend the rest of my life and die of old age in
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton grew up in a poor family in Louisville, Ky., one of 11
children. Court records indicate he was regularly beaten by his
father. None of his siblings went on to a life of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was sent to reform school at age 11, and spent his adult
life roaming the country, committing one crime after another.
Before the killings, he was convicted seven times and served time
in 25 prisons for crimes ranging from assault to burglary to drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is just a mean, nasty person,'' Attorney General Jay Nixon
said prior to the execution.
</P>
<P>
   During one stint in the federal prison in Marion, Ill., in the
early 1970s, Hampton befriended Gary Gilmore. Gilmore in 1976 would
become the first American to be executed after a decade-long
national ban on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Linhardt of the Missouri Catholic Conference, one of the
groups that sought clemency for Hampton, said, ''It's like he's
almost wanting to be like Gilmore.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of getting out of an Indiana prison in 1992,
Hampton and a friend, a real estate agent from St. Louis County,
devised a plan to get money from Frances Keaton. The agent had
worked with Keaton and knew the 58-year-old hairdresser had $30,000
in the bank. She also gave Hampton a key to Keaton's home in
Warrenton, about 50 miles west of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   So on the evening of Aug. 2, 1992, Hampton drove his car to the
parking lot of a Baptist church in Warrenton and parked it there.
Leaving a note that read, ''Car trouble. Gone for help,'' and
signed with a fake name, Hampton got a bicycle out of the trunk and
rode it the three miles to Keaton's home.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton entered with a sawed-off shotgun and demanded money.
Keaton and her fiance, Allen Mulholland, said they didn't have it
available, but Keaton said she thought she could get $10,000 from
her pastor. Hampton tied up Mulholland and warned him not to call
police, then abducted Keaton, taking her car and heading west on
Interstate 70.
</P>
<P>
   While driving, Hampton learned from a police scanner that police
had been alerted to the kidnapping. Hampton testified at his trial
that he had decided in advance to kill his hostage if police
learned of the kidnapping before he received his ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton bound and blindfolded Keaton and took her to a wooded
area of Callaway County in mid-Missouri. Once there, he killed
Keaton with several hammer blows to the head and then buried her
body. It was found about two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton drove back to Warrenton and attempted to retrieve his
car. He fled to New Jersey when he saw police were keeping the car
under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   About a month later, during another failed kidnapping, Hampton
killed 48-year-old Christine Schurman, in a barn on her property in
Wantage Township, N.J. Her body was found by her husband, Dr. Alan
Schurman. She died of a single bullet wound to the head.
</P>
<P>
   For months, police searched for Hampton. Then on Dec. 18, 1992,
the Fox television show ''America's Most Wanted'' profiled his
crimes. A day later, a pastor from West Orange, N.J., contacted
police after seeing the show. The pastor, unaware of Hampton's
crimes, had taken him in and allowed him to work as a caretaker at
the church.
</P>
<P>
   As police moved in, Hampton shot himself. At his trial in 1996,
neurologist Dr. Jonathan Pincus of Georgetown University testified
the brain wound affected Hampton's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton never showed remorse for the killings. In an interview
with St. Louis Post-Dispatch columnist Bill McClellan, he blamed
the victims, saying he shot Schurman because she struggled. In the
Missouri case, he said he warned Mulholland not to call the police.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ought to ask him if he has any remorse,'' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   After the execution, Keaton's daughter, LaVon Bowling, said she
had just one regret -- ''maybe that he didn't suffer like our mother
suffered.''

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense May Be Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton may wait as late as November
before deciding whether to commit the country to deploying a
defense against ballistic missiles, White House and Pentagon
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, officials had said a presidential decision was
expected this summer.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, officials said a Pentagon deployment recommendation
will be available to Clinton this summer, as originally planned.
But they said it was possible the president will put off a final
decision until October or November in order to buy more time for
arms control talks with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is strongly opposed to a U.S. national missile defense,
as is China. Some U.S. allies in NATO also have their doubts, in
part because they fear it would destroy a landmark arms control
treaty, the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile pact which prohibits
nationwide defenses against ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to amend the ABM treaty to permit limited missile
defenses -- which would intercept some types of missiles from
''rogue'' nations -- but Moscow so far has refused.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, director of the Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization, told a Pentagon news conference that
the next test of the anti-missile system will be June 26, two
months later than originally planned. The delay gives the Pentagon
time to fix a problem that caused a January test to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Pentagon had said it would make an assessment in
June of the system's readiness to deploy. Because the next test has
been delayed until June, the assessment will be done in July,
Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment in July will be done after 30 days of analysis of
the June test results -- half the time that Kadish's office has
taken to analyze the results of previous tests. Only 85 percent of
the data from the June test will be available for consideration by
July, but that will be sufficient, Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charged Tuesday that the Pentagon was cutting corners in
order to meet a politically driven timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a rush decision,'' said Stephen Young, deputy director
of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, an advocacy group that
believes there is little rationale for erecting a national missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The July review will still leave Clinton time to decide, by
October or November, whether to proceed with deployment -- a
decision fraught with political peril, including implications for
Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to wait beyond November, the Pentagon could not
remain on track to completing the construction required at bases in
Alaska in order to have the anti-missile system operating by the
target date of 2005, Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has required the Pentagon to deploy a national defense
against long-range missiles as soon as technically feasible.
Clinton has said that in addition to the technical feasibility, he
will take into consideration the financial cost, the level of
threat of missile attack on the United States, and the impact on
arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress -- both Democrats and Republicans -- are urging
Clinton to leave the deployment decision to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's position on the issue is similar to Clinton's, and
Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush has said he supports
building a missile defense system, even if doing so breaks the ABM
treaty.

<HEADLINE> India's 'Pink City' Beckons Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The ancient city of Jaipur has more to
show President Clinton than dazzling pink forts and an elephant
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries ago, Maharaja Sawai Man Singh, the local ruler of
Jaipur, filled a massive silver urn with thousands of gallons of
water from the Ganges River and hauled it with him to London.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will see the maharaja's urn at a museum Thursday when he
tours the Amber Fort in Jaipur, called the ''Pink City'' because of
the paint used for most of the ancient monuments, and many modern
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Jaipur, among the must-see tourist spots in India, is being
spruced up for the visit. Buildings were repainted, old ones were
torn down and illegal squatters were forced to move out.
</P>
<P>
   Jaipur is ringed by forts built by various rulers. Many visitors
ride an elephant -- with a serenading violinist walking along -- to
the top of the Amber Hill, a fort-palace built in 1592. Several
rooms in the palace have inlaid panels and glittering mirror
ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   But security concerns will mean the president will miss the
bustling streets where camel carts jostle with buses and cows for
space. He won't see the men with handlebar mustaches in sky blue or
shimmering pink turbans, aggressively hawking tie-dyed shawls and
gems on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike most tourists, Clinton probably will not be harassed
for a tip during an elephant ride up the hill to the fort.
</P>
<P>
   The president will meet with women's groups in Nayla Village,
located 20 miles south of Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan state.
In February, the village held elections in which one-third of the
seats were reserved for women.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen Wednesday
afternoon after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates. The
Tokyo stock market's main index closed moderately higher.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was trading at 106.80 yen, up 0.32 yen from late
Tuesday but below its late New York level of 106.93 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues rose 131.23 points, or
0.67 percent, to close at 19,733.59 points. On Tuesday, the average
closed up 36.04 points, or 0.18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve raised a key interest rate Tuesday by a
quarter-point -- the fifth increase since June -- in a preemptive
measure to contain any budding inflationary pressure in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed action met Wall Street's expectations of a modest
increase in interest rates, a move that convinced investors the
central bank was winning its battle to prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates increase the value of fixed assets such as
bonds more attractive to foreign investors, thereby making the
country's currency more desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also wary of buying yen after a senior Japanese
finance ministry official said that a strong yen is not desirable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope foreign exchange moves will reflect economic
fundamentals. In terms of fundamentals, the yen's strengthening is
not appropriate,'' Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs
Haruhiko Kuroda said.
</P>
<P>
   Government and business leaders have said that a strong yen
makes Japanese exports more expensive in dollar terms and could
hurt the nation's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 102.52 yen, down
from 103.52 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices rose following an overnight rally in
New York, where the market gathered momentum after the Fed
confirmed Wall Street's expectation of a quarter-point rate
increase.
</P>
<P>
   But players in Tokyo said active selling of Internet-related and
high-tech issues was limiting the positive effects of the overnight
surge on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Kazunori Jinnai, a senior equity division manager at Daiwa SB
Capital Markets, said investors were seeking to take profits in
information technology issues following the recent recovery in that
sector.
</P>
<P>
   About 765 million shares were traded on the first section of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 651.63 million shares Tuesday. Some
675 issues fell, while 593 rose and 137 issues were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 227.10 points
to 10,907.34 at Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 14.23 points, or 0.85 percent, to close at
1658.32. The TOPIX closed down 1.67 points, or 0.10 percent, the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.8400 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8650 percent. Its
price rose 0.21 points to 99.66.

<HEADLINE> Strike threatens Twinkie, Ring Ding lovers  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The Great Twinkies Shortage of 2000 is a desperate
time for lovers of the spongy, golden treat, and stricken
snack-cake lovers are threatening desperate measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll have to eat healthy food,'' said Rubens Breeden, a
28-year-old state worker longing for two other delicacies in short
supply: Ring Dings and Devil Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Bianchi, who works at a little snack bar in one of the
busiest state office buildings, said he is tired of facing the
wrath of the Twinkie-deprived masses.
</P>
<P>
   ''All day long, they're saying, 'Where's my Twinkies? Where's my
coffee cake? Where's my pound cake? Where's my Devil Dogs? Where's
my Yodels? Where's my Ring Dings?''' Bianchi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're ready to kill. They look at me with doubt in their
eyes. They think that I forgot to place the order. It's always the
coffee slinger's fault,'' laments Bianchi, 42, assistant manager of
Hal's Place.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the fault lies in a labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   A Teamsters strike has shut down bakeries and is causing
scarcities along the East Coast from Maine to Washington in a
variety of well-known bakery products, including Wonder bread and
Hostess brands such as Twinkies.
</P>
<P>
   As shelves empty across the region, the area will have to do
without deliveries of about 2 million Twinkies and cupcakes per
week and another 400,000 loaves of Wonder bread, a company official
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   What was billed as ''The last box of Twinkies known to Man?''
was being offered on the Internet auction site eBay, with the
minimum bid set at $2,500. There were no takers as of late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began a week ago when 1,400 Teamsters responsible for
delivery and sales of products from Interstate Bakeries Co.'s only
New England bakery in Biddeford, Maine, walked off their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the strike, the bakery that employs 400 people was
shut down, and the strike quickly spread as Teamsters set up
pickets elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The impact grew swiftly as Teamsters in other states honored the
pickets, and additional bakeries were shut down.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, five bakeries with 2,600 workers were shut down
in Biddeford; New York City; Philadelphia; Wayne, N.J., and
Buffalo, N.Y., said Mark Dirkes, senior vice president for
marketing in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The union has accused the company of refusing to honor
arbitration rulings. The company maintains it was shut out of the
arbitration process, and it has asked a judge to clarify the
process.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major sticking points has been the company's
requirement that drivers deliver more than one brand of Interstate
products at a time. The Teamsters say the practice violates work
rules designed to protect drivers who get paid different amounts
for each brand.
</P>
<P>
   Dirkes said the strike would affect the Northeast from Maine to
Washington and the Buffalo area. Also affected will be two other
brands known primarily in New England and New York: J.J. Nissen
breads and Drake's Cakes.
</P>
<P>
   In Concord, N.H.., Pamela Anderson, a mother of two, picked up
some of the last Twinkies at a local gas station.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say they're for my kids, but they're really for me,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Towne, a dental hygienist with Aesthetic Dental Center in
that town, saw a bright side to the strike: ''The dental community
might even benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Boston, shelves usually occupied by Hostess products
were bare or getting there quickly.
</P>
<P>
   At one downtown convenience store, Bruce Whitmore, sales manager
for Quinzani's Bakery, a Boston specialty bakery, was making a
pitch to fill the store's empty bread shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting a lot of extra business. The phone is ringing
off the hook,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Breeden, eating Twinkies and other snack cakes is just part
of growing up American.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like everything from baseball to watching the Celtics,''
he said. ''Basically, every little kid does it; it's like throwing
rocks and playing in the mud.''

<HEADLINE> Md. Hostages Safe, Suspect Killed  </HEADLINE>
By SHEILA HOTCHKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- Police stormed an apartment Tuesday night
and fatally shot a murder suspect who had been holding three people
hostage since Friday. Two captives had slipped out to safety and a
third, a 12-year-old boy, was rescued by police.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the hostages are safe,'' police spokeswoman Vickie
Warehime said. ''Nobody was injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Palczynski, an unemployed electrician with a history of
mental illness, was shot to death by police, Warehime said. The
only shots fired at the end of the standoff came from police,
Warehime said. Police believed he had four weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began Friday when Palczynski, 31, forced his way
into the apartment and took three people hostage, including the
mother of his former girlfriend. He is accused of kidnapping his
ex-girlfriend on March 7, killing four people and leading police on
a manhunt for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   The girlfriend's mother, Lynn Whitehead and her boyfriend, Andy
McCord, escaped from a first-floor bedroom window Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''God was really with us,'' said Laura Whitehead, Lynn's
daughter. ''We can live a normal life now. No fear. And we're just
thanking God,'' she told WJZ-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski was asleep on a sofa with a gun on his lap under a
blanket when police burst in through a living room window, police
spokesman Bill Toohey said. He woke up and started to stand when
police shot him, Toohey said. Police rescued Bradley McCord, who
had been asleep on the kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''They broke through the window, encountered Mr. Palczynski in
the family room, and shot him,'' Toohey said.
</P>
<P>
   After days of sporadic gunfire at police vehicles and other
targets outside the apartment, a single shot was fired inside the
apartment Monday afternoon, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A Whitehead cousin, Judy Gronke, said Andy McCord's leg was
grazed by a bullet Monday. Lynn Whitehead treated the wound with
the help of paramedics who advised her over the phone, Gronke said.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper and broadcast reports have said Palczynski's main
demand during the hostage drama was to speak to his former
girlfriend. Police have not said where she is or if she has played
any role in the negotiations police had with him.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call to WJZ-TV on Sunday that the station aired for
the first time Tuesday night, Palczynski said police wouldn't let
him talk to her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love her dearly. I did not mean to kill those people,''
Palczynski said. ''I've been begging for them to just allow me to
talk to Tracy. I will surrender peacefully. I won't kill anybody
else, I won't hurt anybody else. I did not mean to do any of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski was arrested March 4 on assault charges for allegedly
beating his girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, when she tried to move out
of their apartment. He was released the next day on $7,500 bond
despite a lengthy criminal record and a history of mental illness
involving several attacks on former girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   The killings began March 7, when police say Palczynski abducted
Whitehead at gunpoint while fatally shooting George and Gloria
Shenk, the couple who had sheltered her. Outside the Shenk home, he
allegedly shot and killed David Meyers, 42, a neighbor who tried to
help Whitehead during the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead escaped the next day by running to a police officer
who happened to be at a motel where Palczynski took her.
</P>
<P>
   Also that day, police said, Jennifer McDonel was fatally shot
and a 2-year-old boy was wounded when they drove by as Palczynski
fired shots during an attempted carjacking.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski then led police on a manhunt for more than a week,
surfacing in this Baltimore suburb Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That's when police say he broke into a home and stole guns, then
shot his way into the home of Whitehead's relatives and took them
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   During the hostage drama, relatives and friends pleaded for
Palczynski to come out. The emotional appeals were aired live on
television stations in hopes he would be watching.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski has been in a similar situation before. In 1992, he
kept police in Idaho at bay for 16 hours following a domestic
violence complaint by a girlfriend. He was finally forced out with
tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   The latest standoff had been wearing down the patience of
residents in the four-block area surrounding the home where
Palczynski was holed up. Police cordoned off the area and did not
allow people in or out of the neighborhood until Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Fed Raises Key Rate a Quarter-Point  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve's decision to raise
interest rates for a fifth time since June is likely to be followed
by additional rate boosts in coming months as the central bank
struggles to slow the rampaging economy and keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists predicted that the central bank will boost rates
at least twice more this year, at meetings on May 16 and June 28,
because of the head of steam the economy had going into the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Yamarone, an economist with Argus Research Corp., said
the Fed appears to be trying to take some of the booze out of the
punch to try and calm down the inflation-risking economic party the
country is enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nevertheless, we believe that the economic soiree will
continue to roar along,'' Yamarone said. Thus, he said, rates will
still go higher.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts estimate the economy is expanding at close to a 6
percent rate in the current quarter, much faster than the Fed is
comfortable with. In the final three months of 1999, the economy
grew at a rip-roaring 6.9 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining its decision to bump up interest rates Tuesday by
a quarter of a point, the Fed said it remains worried that the
rapidly growing economy ''could foster inflationary imbalances that
would undermine the economy's record economic expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy entered into its 108th consecutive month of
uninterrupted growth in March and in February broke the record of
the 1960s expansion to become the longest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fed's one-page policy announcement, some economists
detected growing worries about inflation. Specifically, they said
that the Fed dropped past references to increased productivity
helping to keep prices in check and concentrated instead on
potential inflation problems from the supercharged economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are turning more hawkish and growing more fearful that
the economy is getting away from them,'' said Mark Zandi, economist
with RFA Dismal Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street took the latest rate increase in stride. The Dow
Jones industrial average, up by more than 100 points before the Fed
acted, soared higher after the announcement and finished the day up
227.10 points at 10,907.34.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed boosted its target for the federal funds rate, the
interest that banks charge on overnight loans, to 6 percent from
5.75 percent. It marked the fifth quarter-point increase since last
June 30, when the funds rate stood at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also increased by a quarter-point, to 5.5 percent, its
largely symbolic discount rate, the interest it charges for loans
made directly to banks.
</P>
<P>
   In response, commercial banks, led by Bank of America and Wells
Fargo, raised their prime lending rates -- the benchmark for
millions of consumer and business loans -- by a quarter-point to 9
percent, the highest level in five years.
</P>
<P>
   In the part of the Fed's statement that reflects possible future
moves, the central bank said ''risks are weighted mainly toward
conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures'' in
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has worried for months
that with unemployment near a 30-year low, the tight labor markets
soon will translate into rising wage demands and higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Greenspan's tight money policies complained that the
Fed is acting without any evidence that inflation, outside of
energy prices, is starting to become a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said the Fed ''continues to look
under the bed for a phantom inflation that doesn't exist,
needlessly putting the brakes on the nation's economic growth.''

<HEADLINE> Meat Plant Inspection Cuts Proposed  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cutting back on inspectors' visits to meat
processing plants could save millions of dollars in overtime pay
that is borne by the industry, while allowing the government to
concentrate on facilities where food is most likely to be
contaminated, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors currently are required to visit each processing plant
once a shift, including overtime runs. The Agriculture Department
wants to switch to daily, random checks, starting in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''By having our resources allocated based on risk the public is
well served,'' Margaret Glavin, associate administrator of USDA's
Food Safety and Inspection Service, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the move could imperil public health. ''This idea
comes out of left field with no data to support it,'' said Caroline
Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
''It's just saving money for the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Processors, who must cover the inspectors' overtime pay, would
save an estimated $19 million a year. The department, which has
7,500 inspectors, would save $4 million, which would be shifted to
other food safety programs.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors, who often work 12-hour shifts, can earn up to
$14,000 a year in overtime in addition to their salaries, which
average $35,000 to $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughtering plants, which must have USDA inspectors on site at
all times, would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Inspections would be reduced at processing plants, including
soup canneries, where the risk of contamination is lowest, and
focused instead on plants that have a history of problems or are
considered to be riskier because of what they process, such as
ground beef, the most common source of the deadly E. coli O157:H7.
</P>
<P>
   Several major incidences of food poisoning have been traced to
processed meat products in recent years, including a 1998 outbreak
at a Michigan hot dog plant that killed 15 people and sickened at
least 100 others.
</P>
<P>
   However, overall foodborne illnesses have been dropping, and
health officials say the decline is due in part to a new
science-based inspection system that is now being used in
processing plants nationwide. It requires plants to identify and
control for possible contamination rather than relying on federal
inspectors to catch problems.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials say that means their inspectors can be used more
effectively in an oversight role. Switching to a random inspection
system for processors will make it harder for facilities to hide
problems from the government, Glavin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a plant does not know when an inspector might show up we
think there's some deterrent there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged the reduced inspections will save the plants
money but said that was not the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   USDA's inspectors union is opposed to the reduction as well as a
pilot project at several slaughtering plants where inspectors have
been pulled off production lines and used to oversee plant
employees.

<HEADLINE> Australia Rejects NRA Claims  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian officials demanded today
that the National Rifle Association pull a video airing on its Web
site claiming that the nation's gun reform laws had backfired.
</P>
<P>
   The video, presented as a television news story, claims that
crimes involving guns have increased in Australia since the laws,
which ban all semi-automatic rifles, semi-automatic shotguns and
pump action shotguns, were introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Attorney General Daryl Williams said the NRA was using
inaccurate statistics and urged the group to remove ''any reference
to Australia'' from its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it quite offensive that the NRA is using the very
successful gun reform laws introduced in 1996 as the basis for
promoting ownership of firearms in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams sent a letter today to NRA president Charlton Heston,
asking for the immediate withdrawal of misleading information.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's gun-related homicide rate was 0.28 per 100,000
people in 1998 compared to 4 per 100,000 in the United States,
Williams wrote in the letter, which was distributed to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many things that Australia can learn from the United
States,'' he wrote. ''How to manage firearm ownership is not one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia adopted the gun laws after an April 1996 rampage by
Martin Bryant, who opened fire with military-style rifles at the
Port Arthur historic site in Melbourne. Bryant, who killed 35
people and injured 19, is serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   More than 640,000 firearms were removed from the Australian
community under a buyback program. The NRA video shows footage of
guns being sawed to pieces, and thousands of destroyed guns piled
on scrap heaps.
</P>
<P>
   South Australia's Attorney General Trevor Griffin -- who is seen
in the video talking about crime -- said he was not interviewed by
the NRA and a quote from him was taken from a previous interview
and used out of context.
</P>
<P>
   The video claims that after the gun laws took effect, armed
robbery in Australia went up 69 percent, assaults involving guns
rose 28 percent, gun murders increased 19 percent and home
invasions rose 21 percent. It does not give a source for the data.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Adam Graycar, director of the Australian Institute of
Criminology, said the statistics were misleading.
</P>
<P>
   He said the latest annual crime figures, for 1998, showed that
assaults had increased but that most attacks did not involve guns.
He said homicides decreased and were only rarely committed with
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Because there were so many other factors involved, such as
population change, it was ''enormously difficult'' to draw
conclusions about what effect the gun laws have had on the level of
crime, Graycar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very long bow to draw,'' to claim the ban led to an
increase in crime, he told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we've got here is an American group with a heavy gun
culture -- guns figure very significantly in crime in the United
States -- trying to transpose that into Australia. There is no
comparison,'' Graycar said.

<HEADLINE> Park Service Sets Jet Ski Limits  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vacationers looking to skim across the water
on Jet Skis may find a problem this summer in some national parks
or seashores as the government imposes new restrictions on the
popular watercraft.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service announced Tuesday it would prohibit
use of Jet Skis in dozens of federal parks, recreational areas and
seashores, although the craft still would be welcome at 21
recreational areas where they already are widely used.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and conservation groups criticized the park
service for not banning the motorized water craft outright, arguing
that they pollute the water and disturb the tranquility of parks
with their noise, as well as pose safety hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Park Service Director Robert Stanton acknowledged the agency was
trying to find a middle ground on an issue over which the agency
has grappled for four years.
</P>
<P>
   He said the regulation, which goes into effect April 20, was a
''prudent approach'' that will allow some use of the watercraft
''yet protects park values ... and reduces conflicts with park
visitors who seek solitude and traditional recreational
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service said the watercraft, widely known by a trade
name, Jet Skis, would not be allowed in 66 of the 87 parks,
recreational areas and seashores where motorized boats are allowed.
While many of the 66 park system units have little or no Jet Ski
activities, the Park Service said there has been growing use of the
craft in at least 32 of the park areas.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the service said Jet Skis would continue to be
allowed -- unless the local superintendent decides otherwise -- at 10
national recreational areas where water-related recreation has been
''a primary purpose'' since their creation. These included a number
of man-made lakes such as Glen Canyon along the Arizona-Utah line,
where tens of thousands of boaters go for water recreation, and
Lake Mead in Arizona and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 other areas, mostly federal seashores, Jet Skis would
continue to be allowed during a two-year ''grace period'' during
which local park officials could decide whether to seek special
approval for their continued use.
</P>
<P>
   At all other places the craft will be banned, unless approval is
given by the Washington headquarters as part of a formal
rulemaking, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy, in the works since 1996, did not satisfy
conservation and park advocacy groups. They accused the park
service of placating the watercraft's users. According to industry,
there were 106,000 of the craft bought last year, with an estimated
1.2 million Jet Skis or similar watercraft in use in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Park Service has admitted that Jet Skis pollute the air
and water, harass wildlife and interfere with other visitors. Yet
they still propose to allow most use to continue,'' complained Tom
Kiernan, president of the National Parks and Conservation
Association, a private park advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Long, director of Blue Water Network, a group that seeks
to protect seashore areas, said the agency ''is ignoring the damage
... and destruction'' from Jet Skis.
</P>
<P>
   But the Personal Watercraft Industry Association complained as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Lambrose, the association's executive director, said the
ban was too broad and that even at the places given the two-year
grace period, local park officials could impose a ban. He disputed
assertions that the craft pose environmental or safety problems and
said in newer models, noise and pollution have been reduced
significantly.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presses for Peace in India  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- President Clinton made an impassioned
plea to India's Parliament today to retreat from the nation's
growing nuclear weapons program and to reach out to rival Pakistan
to restart peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a nuclear standoff, there is nothing more dangerous than
believing there is no danger,'' Clinton said in a speech to both
houses of Parliament. He said the former Soviet Union and the
United States, despite their distance apart and their elaborate set
of safeguards, ''came far too close to nuclear war.''
</P>
<P>
   Although warmly applauded through other portions of his address,
Clinton's comments on nuclear weapons and on Pakistan drew mostly
silence from the legislators in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The speech wrapped up Clinton's visit to India's capital.
Afterward, the president was headed for Agra, where the Taj Mahal
is located, to mix tourism with a plea for environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to tour the 17th century white marble mausoleum
with spiraling minarets, then use it as a backdrop for a speech
focusing on the environment. Agra is also home to 150 iron
foundries and has some of the worst air pollution in India.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that the smog could be discoloring the Taj Mahal, the
city has embarked on a tree planting program with help from the
U.S. Parks Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new violence in the disputed northern territory of Kashmir,
where militants killed more than three dozen minority Sikhs earlier
this week, continued to cast a shadow over Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We grieve with you for the Sikhs who were killed in Kashmir,''
Clinton said. ''And our hearts go out to their families.''
</P>
<P>
   He told India's lawmakers that the violence ''reinforces the
need for dialogue'' between India and Pakistan, which both claim
the disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conceded India's resistance to any U.S. role in
mediating the dispute between India and Pakistan, and added: ''I
hope you will create the opportunity to do it yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't make peace with your friends,'' Clinton said.
''Engagement with adversaries is not the same thing as
endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton said he wasn't trying to tell India
what to do. ''It is not my place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would deliver the same message on Saturday when he
visits Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, for a meeting with the
country's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday with ABC News, Clinton suggested that
Pakistan is mistaken if it believes the United States, its past
ally, would become directly involved in helping to settle the
Kashmir dispute. India has rejected any U.S. mediation role.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to be dragged into something that ... India
doesn't want us to be part of,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   India contends the violence is being perpetrated by factions
loyal to Pakistan. Clinton said he didn't want to ''accuse Pakistan
of something it didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he told ABC, ''I believe there are elements within the
Pakistani government that have supported those who engaged in
violence in Kashmir.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's speech to Parliament, Clinton reiterated his view
that both sides must honor the ''line of control'' that separates
the two sides in the mountainous region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged the Parliament to sign and ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a global ban on all nuclear testing
-- a pact the U.S. Senate has so far refused to ratify. While the
treaty has been signed by more than 150 nations, only 20 of the 44
nations with nuclear capabilities have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton said, he hoped the pact would eventually be put
in force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued his overture for closer ties with India in the
first visit of an American president in 22 years. He told
Parliament that India and America ''are natural allies'' and that
he hoped his visit would both help the people of both countries
understand each other better.
</P>
<P>
   He also saluted India's recent commitment to economic growth and
its burgeoning computer software and high-tech industries. ''You
liberated your markets and now you have one of the 10 fastest
growing economies in the world,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to work with India ''to get our own economic
relationship right.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our job, as governments, is to create the conditions that will
allow them to succeed in doing so and reduce the remaining
investments in trade and investment between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving New Delhi, Clinton met privately with opposition
leader Sonia Gandhi, head of India's Congress Party and the widow
of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his six-day tour of South Asia, Clinton was also
planning to visit a game reserve to look for tigers, and perhaps
ride an elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joked to Indian lawmakers that there were two groups of
people in the world: ''Those who have seen the Taj Mahal and those
who have not.'' He said he would be happy to ''cross over to the
happier side of that divide.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton continues to question Giuliani's leadership style  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSLYN, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's actions
and comments following the city's latest fatal police shooting
demonstrate a leadership style punctuated by rush to judgment,
anger and divisiveness, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what we have here is a lot of anger and lashing out,''
Clinton said Tuesday after an appearance at Roslyn High School on
Long Island. ''I don't think that's appropriate leadership,
especially when he was the first one who said we should wait and
find out what the full facts are (about the shooting).''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''That was the right decision; I'm sorry that he
didn't abide by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani countered that Clinton was the one dividing the city,
and he accused her of projecting her feelings onto him.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a process called projection in psychology,'' Giuliani
said. ''It means accusing someone of what you're doing. That is
precisely what Mrs. Clinton is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dorismond, 26, was fatally shot by a plainclothes
officer following an early morning scuffle last week outside a
Manhattan bar. Clinton and others have criticized the mayor for
releasing information on Dorismond's brushes with the law,
including information obtained from the unarmed victim's sealed
juvenile record.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Republican rival for the U.S. Senate defended his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm making sure the public has the facts, and I'm doing it
against the media that knee-jerks as quickly and as fast as it can
against the police,'' Giuliani said at a news conference before a
fund-raiser in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   At a press availability earlier Tuesday, Giuliani gave reporters
new details about a March 7 incident in which Dorismond allegedly
punched his girlfriend in the head while she was holding the
couple's 1-year-old child. The girlfriend filed a domestic incident
report with police, but no charges were filed against Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am giving you facts that you resist printing,'' Giuliani
said. ''That Mr. Dorismond spent a good deal of his adult life
punching people is a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dorismond shooting came just weeks after four police
officers were acquitted in the fatal police shooting of Amadou
Diallo in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued her criticism of the mayor: ''You know, he has
repeatedly refused to issue the kind of statements and demonstrate
the kind of leadership that would make a difference in trying to
heal the wounds in the city and bring people together.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are positive actions he could take, starting today, that
would make a difference in how people are treated and how the city
works,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also answered critics in the Giuliani camp, who pointed
out that she had initially referred to the Diallo shooting as a
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a misstatement and I apologized,'' she said. ''One of
the differences between the mayor and me is that I actually admit
that I'm a human being who occasionally makes mistakes. And I'm
more than willing to admit that when it occurs, as it did in that
instance.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Clinton was cheered by a crowd of about 1,000
people at the Bethel AME Church in Harlem when she first attacked
Giuliani's leadership in the wake of the Dorismond shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Clinton's comments that day were tantamount to a
speech at a political convention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention the shooting in her remarks Tuesday
night at a Manhattan awards dinner of the National Association of
Women Business Owners.

<HEADLINE> Pope Visits Bethlehem  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- Kissing Palestinian earth and
welcomed by Yasser Arafat, Pope John Paul II embarked today on a
prayerful and politically sensitive pilgrimage to the West Bank
town of Bethlehem, revered as the place of Jesus' birth.
</P>
<P>
   Under chilly gray skies, the papal helicopter touched down at a
helipad near Arafat's presidential palace, where the white-robed
pontiff was formally received by Palestinian clerics, diplomats and
officials at the start of his only stop in Palestinian territory
during his weeklong Holy Land visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader, clad in his trademark checkered
keffiyeh, stepped forward to shake the frail 79-year-old pope's
hand. A Palestinian honor guard fired guns in salute and a band
played the Vatican anthem. As the pontiff moved slowly forward,
Arafat put a steadying hand on his stooped, bent back.
</P>
<P>
   When John Paul stepped off his Blackhawk helicopter, the
Palestinians -- in a gesture laden with symbolism for their
statehood hopes -- presented him with a golden bowl of soil, to
which the pontiff briefly touched his lips.
</P>
<P>
   Politics reared its head almost immediately upon John Paul's
landing Tuesday near Tel Aviv and quickly did so in the West Bank,
where Palestinians are eager to use the visit to bolster their
claims to independence.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is no doubt an act that says he recognizes the
sovereignty of Palestinians over this land,'' the Palestinian
parliament speaker, Ahmed Qureia, better known as Abu Ala, said of
the pontiff's kissing of Palestinian soil.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Arafat, the pontiff was to celebrate Mass in
Bethlehem's Manger Square, the traditional site of Christ's birth,
amid heavy security. Streets around the square were closed off, and
pilgrims' bags were checked at electronic security gates.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting the pope's appearance, some elderly nuns carried
stepladders in hopes of catching a glimpse of him. Other faithful
waved Vatican flags or wore the yellow-and-white Vatican colors.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of Palestinians shouted ''Long live Baba!,'' the Arabic
adaptation of the word pope, as they gathered in the open plaza,
which was draped with Palestinian and Vatican flags. Boy scouts in
khaki uniforms raised a din of bagpipes and drums.
</P>
<P>
   Later, independence aspirations were to be showcased at
Bethlehem's Dheisheh refugee camp, where the pope was to spend an
hour examining the cramped living conditions of 10,000 refugees
from the 1948 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has described the visit to Dheisheh as purely
humanitarian. But the refugees, who want to return to the homes
they were forced to flee when Israel became a state, see it as
backing for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred refugees, mostly schoolchildren, marched outside
the camp Tuesday, a pep rally for their brief but incalculably
important moment in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hold the keys to peace,'' they chanted in English for the
cameras, holding huge cardboard keys to symbolize the keys to their
ancestral homes. Schoolgirls in blue-and-white dresses with white
headbands in their hair raised banners saying ''The right to return
is sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We see the pope's visit as support for the rights of people
who live in suffering,'' said refugee Mohammad Laham, an organizer
of the papal visit to the camp.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the refugees believe an hour with the pontiff will
improve their fate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Talking is not enough -- he must do something for us,'' said
Majida al Khatib, a 30-year-old nurse and mother of two who was
born in Dheisheh. ''I don't think he will do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the residents of the camp are Muslims, not
Christians, adding: ''If we were Christians, maybe he would do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the entire top echelon of the Israeli government was
on hand as a fragile but alert and motivated pope began the first
official visit by a Roman Catholic pontiff to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   To a flourish of trumpets, the pope slowly descended steps of
his Royal Jordanian plane, then touched his lips to a bowl of
Israeli soil held before him. He addressed the dignitaries as his
''dear Israeli friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Welcome to the Holy Land,'' said a visibly moved Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, clasping John Paul's hand in greeting.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief remarks, the pope spoke words that would hardly
have seemed conceivable when Pope Paul VI made an unofficial visit
to the Holy Land in 1964. During that journey, three decades before
Israel and the Vatican established diplomatic ties, Paul VI didn't
even mention Israel's name publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ''May peace be God's gift to the land he chose as his own,''
John Paul said Tuesday, concluding with the traditional Hebrew
greeting, ''Shalom.''
</P>
<P>
   He then boarded a Blackhawk helicopter for the short flight to
Jerusalem, where he spent the night at the Apostolic Delegation on
the biblical Mount of Olives, in the disputed eastern sector of the
city.

<HEADLINE> 'You Mean We Got To Go With People?'  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weep for Mark McGwire's lost innocence.
</P>
<P>
   He just figured out that money makes the world go 'round.
</P>
<P>
   Bummer.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, McGwire made it all the way to 36 still believing
baseball was a game and little elves visited his house and left $10
million or so under his pillow -- every season. Now he knows better.
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes down to how much money can they make,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, ''they'' were the people who sign his checks.
''It's not what can we do for the good of the players,'' McGwire
added. ''That's what upsets me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Me, me, me, me. On the scale of silly utterances by out-of-touch
ballplayers, this one barely causes a ripple. It's not as
self-absorbed as Rickey Henderson's classic renegotiating rant --
''All I'm asking for is what I want!'' -- or as clueless as what
Henderson's one-time teammate, Oakland outfielder Willie Wilson,
said when informed the A's were flying commercial one night instead
of charter.
</P>
<P>
   ''You mean,'' Wilson asked, ''we got to go with people?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. Because the same rule applies to airplanes and
stadiums. The way to make money is to make sure as many of them are
as packed as can be.
</P>
<P>
   What apparently raised McGwire's ire is that the packed stadiums
in this instance are going to be in Tokyo. Looking for new
audiences to bleed dry, major league baseball has decreed two teams
will open the regular season in Japan, take three days off, then
resume playing on this side of the Pacific on April 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're telling me that we're going to fly two teams over
16-plus hours to play two games? You can't give me a good reason
for that,'' McGwire said. ''There's not a good reason. The only
good reason is money.''
</P>
<P>
   Now keep in mind baseball did this last season, to roaring
success, in Monterrey, Mexico. And remember, too, that McGwire's
team didn't go then -- the Padres and Rockies did -- and won't be
going this time, either. Those shorts straws fell to the Chicago
Cubs and New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, baseball's first choice for (Eye-) Opening Day in Asia
was the big redhead and his Cardinal teammates. But McGwire
apparently didn't need the frequent-flyer miles and led the
campaign to reject the invitation. Now, he apparently is objecting
as a matter of principle.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by what McGwire told The New York Times the other day,
baseball hasn't shown such blatant disregard for its players'
well-being since Jim Gray received a credential to cover the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get killed travelwise here in America,'' McGwire said. ''We
don't even have rocket scientists who know how to do our schedule
right. Now they're trying to do a schedule flying to Japan ... Are
you kidding me?''
</P>
<P>
   We hate to burst his bubble, but people fly back and forth for
work all the time. Not like the ballplayers, with a $25,000 bonus
already guaranteed by their union, and not on a charter, with
first-class appointments and lackeys to look after the luggage,
chase snacks, change money, mail postcards and stow the carry-ons.
</P>
<P>
   It's true those same people won't have to hit 95-mph fastballs
on either leg of the journey. But they don't have a choice about
doing whatever their job demands. That's why it's called work -- you
have to be lucky to get out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me,'' McGwire said, ''to go play worldwide doesn't turn my
crank.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but to borrow another cliche, baseball is desperately hoping
it primes the pump.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs won't be taking strikeout sensation Kerry Wood, and
current No. 1 starter Ismael Valdes was put on the disabled list
against his wishes. Glenallen Hill, Chicago's best pinch-hitter,
might follow Valdes onto the DL, and even Sammy Sosa is already
being used sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   But staging a competitive series isn't the No. 1 priority in
Japan; moving licensed merchandise is. Every cap, baseball,
T-shirt, pennant, mousepad, bobbin'-head doll, and beer-bottle
opener with a logo sold in Japan means St. Louis' owners, for
example, don't have to reach quite as deep into their pockets to
pay McGwire's way.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the connection he doesn't quite get; that the reason
baseball is trying to plant its flag in far-flung places is because
of the players' demands are already out of the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Over the winter, McGwire exercised a contract option to take
less from the Cardinals than his fair-market value. That, he
claims, proved he was not just about money.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can't be happy with $11 million,'' McGwire said,
''there's something wrong with you.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt.

<HEADLINE> Padres' Left Fielder Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. -- It's not the stuff usually associated with
spring training -- bigamy, a Las Vegas wedding, threats with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks after joining the San Diego Padres in a trade with
Pittsburgh, Al Martin was charged with exchanging punches with a
woman who claims she married him in a Las Vegas wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The outfielder, praised as a clubhouse leader, and Shawn
Haggerty-Martin were arrested on assault charges late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The police report contained accusations of bigamy, threats with
a gun and a wedding that Martin admits attending, but didn't think
was real.
</P>
<P>
   According to Clark County records, a Shawn M. Haggerty married
an Albert C. Martin in Las Vegas on Dec. 11, 1998. The police
report lists Haggerty's middle name as Michelle, but Martin's is
listed as Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Haggerty-Martin were released on their own
recognizance and told to stay away from each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone's shocked,'' third baseman Phil Nevin said Tuesday.
''He's a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Padres were playing the Chicago Cubs, owner John
Moores and general manager Kevin Towers met with Martin and his
wife, Cathy, at their Scottsdale home for about 1{ hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very emotional, very embarrassed,'' Towers said Tuesday.
''The last thing he wanted to do was be a distraction to this
ballclub before we start our season.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin released a statement through his agent, Jeff Moorad,
categorically denying the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night, I had an argument with a woman, Shawn Haggerty,
whom I have known for several years. This argument escalated and
eventually led to police intervention,'' Martin said. ''I take
these charges extremely seriously and will continue to cooperate
fully with the authorities investigating this incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Towers said the Padres want to hear Martin's side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before we come down on Al Martin, I want to make sure that we
have all the facts in place before we discipline him.''
</P>
<P>
   Towers has known Martin since his days as a scout with the
Pirates in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''This would be the last guy that I think this would ever happen
to,'' Towers said. ''He's always been a model citizen and a guy who
represents himself well.''
</P>
<P>
   Towers said Martin has known Haggerty-Martin for 4-5 years, and
that Cathy Martin is aware of her.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something that I think they've had some problems
(with) in the past,'' Towers said. ''He kind of got into a
situation where he really didn't know how to get himself out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale Justice Court, Martin was barefoot and wore the
same ripped white shirt, speckled with blood, that he had on when
he and Haggerty-Martin were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty-Martin was charged with assault-domestic violence, and
Martin was charged with assault-physical injury and threatening or
intimidating, all misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Police will investigate Haggerty-Martin's claim that Martin is
married to two women, Scottsdale police Sgt. Doug Dirren said.
</P>
<P>
   A judge entered innocent pleas for both, and a pretrial
conference was scheduled for April 12, the same day the Padres are
to play the Arizona Diamondbacks in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The argument at a Scottsdale home started when Haggerty-Martin
accused Martin of still being married to someone else, Dirren said.
Haggerty-Martin began hitting Martin, and he punched her in the jaw
at least once, Dirren said.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty-Martin had a swollen face, and he had scratches across
the bridge of his nose and behind his left ear, according to the
police report.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty-Martin told police she had a couple of glasses of wine
and took codeine and zanax, an antianxiety drug, for a headache.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty-Martin told police she did not know that Martin was
married to another woman when she and the ballplayer were wed in
Las Vegas on Dec. 11, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty-Martin said that at some point she realized that Martin
was still married, but he kept telling her that they were getting a
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Martin told police that he is not married to Haggerty-Martin,
but that she has been his girlfriend for about six years. Martin
told police that he attended a ceremony in Las Vegas a couple of
years ago, but didn't believe it was real.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty-Martin told police that Martin threatened her Monday
night and had been abusive several times before, including a few
months ago when he pinned her to the bed, choked her and stuck the
barrel of a gun in her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Martin also beat her severely enough a few years ago in Orlando,
Fla., that she went to a hospital for treatment, she told police.
</P>
<P>
   Two guns were confiscated, police said -- one that a nanny hid in
a dresser drawer when the couple started fighting and one that was
in the glove box of Martin's vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Film producer says Pequots stole her movie idea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. (AP) -- California film producer Debra
Bassett says the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe stole her movie script
about a 17th-century massacre of tribal members.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal appeals court has ruled that Bassett, 44, has no
right to sue the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   In a case broadening the legal scope of Indian sovereignty, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York ruled last
month that, regardless of what happened to Bassett's script, Indian
tribes can't be sued by private parties for copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling found that the Pequot tribe is exempt from private
lawsuits under U.S. copyright law-even if the alleged infringements
occurred off the tribal reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Bassett's lawyer, Richard Goren, Bassett has testified before
the U.S. Senate in support of a congressional rollback of tribal
immunity rights. He says the ruling means federally recognized
tribes can now violate copyright laws with impunity. Using a
hypothetical example, he says, Microsoft Corp. wouldn't be able to
recover damages if a tribe decided to bootleg the company's Windows
2000 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could copy it and distribute it to everyone who comes
into the casino,'' Goren told The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson King, general counsel for the Pequots, told The Journal
he doesn't believe that any tribe would use the cloak of sovereign
immunity to engage in copyright violations. Such reckless behavior,
he said, would doubtless lead Congress to strip tribes of their
cherished immunity rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not stupid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court did send back to a district court Bassett's
claims against individual defendants and the museum, telling the
lower court to re-examine whether she could sue them.
</P>
<P>
   Bassett says the Pequots plagiarized from her script in order to
create a film now being shown at the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe maintains it not only owns the script but that the
movie being shown in the museum is based on tribal history, not
plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot copyright historical facts,'' King told The
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1995, Bassett put a copyright symbol on her script.
She then sent it to museum officials for review. On Oct. 20, 1995,
museum officials terminated their contract with Bassett and hired
away two members of her creative team to complete the script.
</P>
<P>
   Bassett filed her lawsuit in September 1996 in U.S. District
Court in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The two team members were named in the original lawsuit but
settled out of court, paying her a total of $100,000, she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Pequots dismissed Bassett ''for cause,'' King, told The Wall
Street Journal. He said Bassett had been paid $168,000 for her
services.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bassett said she plan to ask the federal court to
halt the showing of the film, pending resolution of her complaint.

<HEADLINE> Publishing company accused of contributing to the death of formercommerce secretary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A company that publishes airport approach
charts is being accused in a federal lawsuit of contributing to the
crash that killed former U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown
and 34 others near Dubrovnik, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing the families of victims claim that Jeppesen
Sanderson, based in Englewood, Colo., published chart that was
confusing and understated the dangers of flying into the Dubrovnik
airport, which was set at the foot of steeply rising mountains by
the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Jeppesen denies any wrongdoing and says it merely publishes
approach data provided by civil aviation authorities around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Jeppesen has been sued in nearly a dozen jurisdictions by the
estates of 28 victims. The litigation was consolidated in Hartford
because the first suit was filed in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, the fourth anniversary of the crash, U.S. District
Chief Judge Alfred V. Covello, who also is an instrument-rated
pilot and flight instructor, is scheduled to hear arguments on a
key question: Whose law should guide the court in deciding if
Jeppesen is liable for alleged defects in its chart for Dubrovnik?
</P>
<P>
   Jeppesen is arguing that Colorado law, which would limit the
company's potential liability, should control.

   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- Kissing Palestinian earth and welcomed by Yasser
Arafat, Pope John Paul II embarked Wednesday on a prayerful and politically
sensitive pilgrimage to the West Bank town of Bethlehem, revered as the place of
Jesus' birth. Under chilly gray skies, the papal helicopter touched down at a

   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- President Clinton made an impassioned plea to

a nuclear standoff, there is nothing more dangerous than believing there is no
danger,'' Clinton said in a speech to both houses of Parliament. He said the
former Soviet Union and the United States, despite their distance apart and
their elaborate set of safeguards, ''came far too close to nuclear war.''

side. Although Bush won, about one-third of GOP voters supported other
candidates. Political analysts said the breakdown suggests that Bush is
vulnerable, while his campaign conceded that he still has some work to do to win
over supporters of former rival John McCain. With 90 percent of precincts
reporting in the Republican primary, unofficial returns showed Bush with 423,715

<HEADLINE> Risk Goes Up in Teen-Filled Cars  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Blaming ''foolishness and distractions,''
researchers reported today that the risk of a teen-age driver dying
increases with each additional passenger -- particularly with young
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Johns Hopkins School of Public Health researcher Li-Hui Chen and
her colleagues found that 16-year-olds carrying one passenger were
39 percent more likely to get killed than those driving alone.
</P>
<P>
   That increased to 86 percent with two passengers and 182 percent
with three or more. The rate for 17-year-olds was higher: 48
percent, 158 percent and 207 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The rate was as much as 21 times higher during early morning
hours when passengers were present, according to the study in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also found that the driver death rate increased
significantly when the passengers themselves were in their teens or
20s.
</P>
<P>
   While the death statistics relate specifically to drivers,
experts said other studies have shown that accidents involving new
teen drivers also often kill or seriously injure passengers and
people in other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is ''general foolishness and distractions'' for
drivers who are just getting to know the rules of the road, said
Robert Foss of the University of North Carolina Highway Safety
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will egg one another on to try to run a stop light or
say, 'Let's see if you can get it up to 70 miles an hour before the
next stop sign,''' Foss said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more often, he said, it's simpler things -- animated
conversation, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of it is things that are no problem for an experienced
driver,'' said Foss, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study
funded in part by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The findings -- coupled with numbers showing teen accidents rates
increasing after 10 p.m. and even more dramatically after midnight
-- are prompting safety experts to renew their calls for stiffer
restrictions on new drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty clear that states should not let them drive later
at night for a while and not let them drive with teen passengers,''
said Foss, who thinks the curfew should be 10 p.m. ''They need to
focus their attention entirely on driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten states -- most recently Washington -- restrict the number or
age of passengers who can ride with new teen drivers. Twenty-eight
states have driving curfews, most of them beginning at midnight.
New York, which imposes a 9 p.m. curfew on drivers under 18, is
among the states with the toughest restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies of young drivers in New Zealand, Canada and
Florida found that so-called graduated driver licensing reduced
crashes by 7 percent to 32 percent, Foss said. Graduated systems
impose passenger restrictions or curfews on young drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Foss said that in states with no such rules, ''parents of 16-
and 17-year-old drivers would be well-advised to impose the
restrictions themselves.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After his victory in the New Hampshire
primary, John McCain raised more money than any presidential
candidate last month. Bill Bradley, who lost, raised the least.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Election Commission reports show McCain raised $11.1
million in February, while Bradley raised just $710,294.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, one campaign was on fire and one had essentially
extinguished,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the
Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that studies
money and campaigns. ''It was pretty clear to the entire country
that the McCain campaign was getting all the attention in the month
of February and Bradley was dropping and dropping fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates abandoned their presidential bids following
the Super Tuesday primaries March 7, leaving the field to
Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's fund raising allowed him to outspend Bush in February.
McCain reported spending $13.5 million to Bush's $13.1 million. But
Bush ran more campaign ads, spending $7.6 million to McCain's $6.6
million. McCain also spent $1.4 million on direct mail and $989,000
on phone banks.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spent more than twice as much as Gore, $12.7 million to
$6.1 million. More than half of the amount, or $7.8 million, went
for commercials. Gore spent $3.8 million on radio and TV.
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Bradley also fueled their spending by borrowing
against their expected federal matching funds. McCain borrowed $3.2
million and Bradley borrowed $5.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has received $4.4 million of the $11.3 million in
federal funds he is entitled to and McCain has received $2.2
million of the $7 million he has qualified for. The government
matches the first $250 of each individual contribution to
candidates who agree to limit their spending.
</P>
<P>
   By conserving funds, Gore began March with more money on hand
than Bush, who set a new standard by raising $73.9 million and
spending $63.3 million. Gore had $10.4 million in the bank,
including $7.3 million in anticipated federal funds, and Bush had
$7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not accepting federal funds, therefore can spend as much
as he can raise.

<HEADLINE> Wrong Song Played for Mrs. Rodham  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- While President Clinton attended the
business of state, his daughter Chelsea kept everyone guessing
about her own program.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers at the upscale Santushti, a complex of boutiques,
prepared an elaborate welcome Tuesday for Chelsea, even inviting
the Air Force band to play while she shopped.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea never came. Instead, her grandmother, Dorothy Rodham,
slipped unrecognized into the complex's restaurant for a quiet
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   But word spread that Chelsea was there. When Mrs. Rodham stepped
out of the restaurant, the band struck up, ''Come on Barbie, let's
go party.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Agra, the city of the Taj Mahal, has been sprucing up for weeks
for the president's visit Wednesday. But the city fathers were most
concerned about the reeking odor of the Yamuna River, which runs
sluggishly behind the 17th century monument.
</P>
<P>
   The Times of India recalled a similar problem when the pop
musician Yanni gave a concert at the Taj three years ago. Officials
opened the sluice gates to pump more water into the river and
dumped bottles of scent into it.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton came to India to help boost trade and
business, but his first deal went on his personal Visa card.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after arriving Sunday night, Clinton strolled into a
shop in his hotel selling Kashmir-made silk carpets. He walk out 45
minutes later with three purchases, the Hindustan Times reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright --
apparently acting on Clinton's tip -- went to the same store and
left with an armload.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much the president spent, shopowner Manzoor Wangnoo
said, ''That's a trade secret.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Shores Up Bradley Support  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, N.J. (AP) -- Al Gore went to Bill Bradley's home state
to raise money for his campaign and join forces with supporters of
his former Democratic rival.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm grateful that we are all one team,'' the vice president
told Bradley backers who stood beside him Tuesday at a reception at
an Englewood restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign manager, Douglas Berman, and state Sen.
Richard Codey, the co-chairman of Bradley's campaign in New Jersey,
appeared with Gore at the reception and two fund-raisers and said
he is the best available choice for president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore has the leadership and experience to make a difference
for working families throughout New Jersey and America,'' said
Berman.
</P>
<P>
   Codey, the state Senate Democratic leader, told Gore, ''I don't
know any elected Democrat in New Jersey who was for Bradley who is
not going to vote for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore praised Bradley, the former U.S. senator from New Jersey
who based his campaign in the state, for his emphasis on racial
injustice, health care and campaign finance reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a good man and my friend,'' Gore said. ''I thought that
he brought a passion and eloquence to the issue of closing the
racial divide that is just unparalleled in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president pledged to take on many of Bradley's issues
and told New Jerseyans that he and his rival stood for many of the
same things. He recalled Bradley's prediction that the next
president would appoint three or four Supreme Court justices during
his term.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to see the Constitution interpreted one way or
another for the next 30 or 40 years, depending on who is elected
president,'' Gore said. ''The kind of justices I would appoint are
the kind of justices that Bill Bradley would appoint.''
</P>
<P>
   He later attended two fund-raisers at private Englewood homes,
raising $300,000 from the $1,000-per-person events. He had raised
$100,000 earlier Tuesday at a Manhattan luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   While aligning himself with Bradley, Gore said the choice for
president between him and George W. Bush is one between opposites,
saying two candidates have rarely been further apart on issues like
education, campaign finance reform and health care. He ridiculed
Bush's $483 billion, five-year tax-cut plan, which he said would
wipe out the projected federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ''This campaign is really one where the stakes are higher than
they've ever been,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was spending today in Washington, attending a morning
meeting of House Democrats at the Capitol building and a Democratic
National Committee reception in the evening. Bush was taking
another day off the campaign trail, spending it at home in Austin,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Gore challenged the Texas governor's concern
for minorities, saying they are shortchanged by a census that
congressional Republicans refuse to modernize in order to get the
most accurate population count.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to say to Governor Bush, if you really believe that
every American counts, it's time to stand up to the operatives in
your own party and support a census that counts every American,''
the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like Gore have long supported changing the census to
incorporate sampling, a way of statistically adjusting the actual
headcounts to account for populations with traditionally low
response rates, such as minority groups in cities.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers have fought sampling, which could lower
headcounts in GOP-heavy areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McLellan defended the headcount method, and
accused Gore of playing politics. ''Given the Clinton-Gore
administration's history of using nonpartisan government agencies
to further the political agenda of Democrats, subjecting the census
to the risk of partisan manipulation will do nothing to restore
public confidence in the ethics of this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore reacted similarly to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling
Tuesday that the federal government lacks authority to regulate
tobacco as an additive drug. Both called on Congress to pass
legislation to further restrict tobacco.

<HEADLINE> Underdog Orangemen Not Fazed  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Preston Shumpert has a few words for all
those bandwagon-riding experts who expect Michigan State to beat
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to watch out for those underdogs,'' said Shumpert,
who sent Syracuse into the round of 16 with a game-winning jumper
Saturday against Kentucky in the final minute of play. ''People
expect them to win, so we really don't have any pressure on us.
We're just going out and playing with reckless abandon.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-seeded Orangemen (26-5) will have a hostile crowd to
cope with. The game Thursday night against the top-seeded Spartans
(28-7) is at the Palace in Auburn Hills, Mich., a short drive from
the Michigan State campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's an advantage for them a little bit because
they're playing in their home state,'' said Syracuse point guard
Jason Hart, whose family is from Michigan. ''But once we step on
the court and the game starts, it should be an even match as far as
intensity, and that's the way games are decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim is trying to lead the Orangemen back
to the Final Four for the second time in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're playing the game where they tell us to play it,''
Boeheim said. ''We're going to go out and play. We're not worried
about something we can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse has defeated Samford 79-65 and Kentucky 52-50 so far in
the Midwest Regional. Iowa State (31-4) faces UCLA (21-11) in the
other regional semifinal on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said from the beginning that this is a tough bracket,''
Boeheim said. ''The way UCLA and Iowa State are playing, it looks
to me like the four best teams got to the finals of this region,
and I don't think that can be said anyplace else. We've got a tough
road.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure. The Spartans, led by point guard Mateen Cleaves, are
on a seven-game winning streak, with tournament victories over
Valparaiso (65-38) and Utah (73-61). Since the start of the new
year, they are 19-3 and playing as well as any team in the country.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, is not the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody understands it's a one-game situation,'' said Hart,
whose job will be to neutralize Cleaves. ''The pressure isn't just
on us. It's on them as well. They're supposed to do it. We're just
going to be right here as a stumbling block.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse is coming off a struggle against Kentucky. The
Orangemen, who had to play much of the second half without center
Etan Thomas because of foul trouble, were just 20-of-63 from the
field (32 percent) and 4-of-21 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shot pretty bad,'' said Shumpert, the only Syracuse player
to finish in double figures with 12. ''Sometimes that's going to
happen. We've just got to try to look forward to the next game and
try to get that out of our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Michigan State is soaring and Syracuse has gone 7-5
since starting the season with a flourish, the Spartans are
favored. That suits Syracuse just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are picking Michigan State to win it all. That doesn't
matter,'' Syracuse senior forward Ryan Blackwell said. ''All the
records from the past are thrown out. We weren't 19-0 and one of
the top four teams in the country (in January) for no reason. We
have high expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really feel we're underdogs,'' Hart added. ''I think a
lot of people say it because of our seeding. Early in the year we
were playing just as good as they are now, so I don't feel we're
overmatched. Pound for pound, we're just as good as they are.''

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga an Underdog No Longer  </HEADLINE>
By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Little Gonzaga is an underdog no more.
</P>
<P>
   Oddsmakers in Las Vegas installed the 10th-seeded Bulldogs as
1-point favorites over No. 6 Purdue for Thursday night's NCAA
tournament game. That turn of events is perhaps even more shocking
than Gonzaga's upset victory over second-seeded St. John's on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're beating people left, right and center,'' Gonzaga center
Axel Dench acknowledged Tuesday. But ''we like to think of
ourselves as underdogs. We've still got a chip on our shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   But these Bulldogs have enjoyed success their entire college
careers. They are the winningest team in the West Coast Conference
since 1992, and have won two consecutive league titles.
</P>
<P>
   A final eight team a year ago, Gonzaga is 5-1 in the NCAA
tournament the past two seasons, with the only loss coming to
national champion Connecticut last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who call Gonzaga a Cinderella team are ignorant of
what's going on in the basketball world,'' Purdue coach Gene Keady
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these Bulldogs are a complete team, featuring a mixture
of inside and outside shooters, a suffocating defense, solid
conditioning and a calm demeanor in the face of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just another business trip for us,'' captain Matt
Santangelo said Tuesday as the team prepared to board its charter
flight to Albuquerque. ''If teams don't get prepared for us, it's
to their disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, six players led the team in scoring for at least
one game. Seven players led in rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs are so deep in talent that they lost guard Mike
Nilson, the WCC defensive player of the year, to injury in the
first game of the league tournament and have won six games in a row
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And despite their relatively low-profile conference, the Zags
have played a big-time schedule in recent years. Last year, they
beat the likes of Memphis, Washington, Minnesota, Stanford and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   This season, they routed UCLA 59-43 in Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   But who are these guys who have lifted a tiny Catholic school of
4,800 students into the national spotlight?
</P>
<P>
   They are definitely a Northwest team. Of the 12 players on the
roster, 10 are from Washington or Oregon. Freshman guard Jimmy
Tricco is from Phoenix. Dench, the ''Thunder from Down Under,'' is
from Melbourne, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The leader is clearly Santangelo, a senior from Portland. The
point guard broke John Stockton's career and season school assist
records this year, and is the third-leading scorer in school
history.
</P>
<P>
   Against St. John's, he played all 40 minutes and had 26 points,
five assists, four rebounds and only two turnovers in the face of
the Big East team's swarming defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a warrior,'' first-year coach Mark Few said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpshooter Richie Frahm, also a senior, is from Battleground,
Wash. He led the WCC in scoring this season with 17 points per
game. In the first round against Louisville, he scored 31 points,
the top performance in the tournament so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Calvary, a junior from Tacoma, is the big banger inside,
leading the team in rebounds and blocks, while averaging 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Dench is the tallest player at 6-foot-11. He shot 54 percent
from the field in averaging 9.5 points. He also led the team in
3-point shooting percentage by canning 24-of-53 for 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Ryan Floyd, from Harrington, is starting in place of
Nilson.
</P>
<P>
   Not content to just be in the tournament, the Bulldogs aren't
planning to end their season in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hope to see you when we come to Indianapolis,'' Dench told
cheering students at a pep rally Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis is the site of the Final Four.

<HEADLINE> 'Canes Thrive Despite Small Support  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- From his office window, Miami
Hurricanes coach Leonard Hamilton can see the vacant lot where the
school's on-campus arena will someday be built.
</P>
<P>
   The plans have been drawn, the land has been cleared and the
majority of the money has been raised. But the ground-breaking has
yet to take place.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain when that will happen. It could be late summer
of early fall before the first shovel of dirt is turned.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton thinks the 9,200-seat facility, named the Ryder Center,
will be the first step in creating some basketball tradition in
South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes it will help recruiting players -- and fans -- for the
Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has taken the Hurricanes to a school-record three
consecutive NCAA tournaments. It is a remarkable task considering
Hamilton has done it with little talent and even less support.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (23-10), seeded sixth in the South Regional, is in the
third round of the NCAA tournament and will play seventh-seeded
Tulsa (31-4) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have work and opportunity in front of us,'' Hamilton
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years at Miami, Hamilton has had one player in the NBA
(rookie Tim James of the Miami Heat), two players drafted (James
and Constantin Popa) and four All Big East-Conference selections
(James, Popa, Johnny Hemsley and Mario Bland).
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, 51, continues to recruit players to Miami, where there
is no arena, no tradition, little media coverage and a small fan
base.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech wants to talk to Hamilton about succeeding Bobby
Cremins. But Hamilton said he isn't going to address the situation
until the season is over.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, he will continue to coach his hard-nosed style of
defensive basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't play defense, you'll be on the bench,'' forward
Elton Tyler said. ''It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes have embraced Hamilton's defensive philosophy.
This season, they led the Big East in scoring defense, field-goal
percentage defense and 3-point field-goal percentage defense and
ranked second in steals.
</P>
<P>
   Defense has carried them through two games in the tournament,
giving up an average of 66 points in wins over Arkansas and Ohio
State.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just like they say, 'Offense wins games, but defense wins
championships,''' forward Leroy Hurd said. ''Defense is what got us
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The defensive scheme is simple. The 'Canes challenge every shot
and try to force teams to take low-percentage shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strength of the pack is in the wolf and the strength of
the wolf is in the pack,'' Hamilton said. ''That's our
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely to surprise Tulsa coach Bill Self, who was an
assistant under Hamilton at Oklahoma State between 1986 and 1990.
This will be the first time they have coached against one another
since parting ways a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   With a win, Miami would be one step closer to the Final Four --
and maybe that much closer to getting a new facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt all along we could be a good basketball team, but
we've been reminded all along the way that we believe more in
ourselves than the general public does,'' Hamilton said. ''So we're
constantly feeling like we have to overcome another challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always appear to be the underdogs. These are just things
that keep us motivated all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Women's Groups Can Oversee Sex Cases  </HEADLINE>
By GINA CAPPELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In an extraordinary step, a special
committee of women will help city police classify sexual assault
complaints to make sure crime statistics are accurate and cases
don't fall through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new program, Women Organized Against Rape, the Women's
Law Project and other groups will oversee police investigators and
supervisors evaluating complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're putting together a committee of women ... and (will)
actually, quite literally, let this women's group be the final say
on our classification,'' Police Commissioner John Timoney said in
Tuesday's Philadelphia Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper has reported that sex-crimes investigators for
years deliberately mislabeled rapes and other offenses to make the
city appear safer, and rejected large numbers of complaints as
''unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, the newspaper reported, was that mislabeled crimes
were not given as much attention.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Johnson, executive director of Women Organized Against
Rape, said she believes the program will make victims of sexual
assault cases more willing to report the crime to police.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big step forward. We will be the only city in the
country with this type of program,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many women believe if police don't report the crime, it
doesn't matter,'' she said. ''We work for the victims and hopefully
that will encourage more victims to come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's groups and Timoney hope to meet in the next two
weeks to work out the details.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has its critics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a hard time believing this (program) will help improve
the situation,'' said Gerald Arenberg, a spokesman for the National
Association of Chiefs of Police.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure that private organizations should be involved in
this work,'' said Arenberg, a 40-year police veteran. ''You need
experts to decide whether or not there is a case. It sounds like
they are saying the police department is not able to cope with the
problem and they need outside help.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carol Tracy, executive director of the Women's Law Project
in Philadelphia, said the women's organizations will not be doing
police work.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just a public oversight of police work,'' Tracy said.
''We are there to make sure things don't slip through the cracks.
We are advocates. We are not becoming the police department.''
</P>
<P>
   If the program is modeled properly in Philadelphia, Johnson
believes other cities may be inclined to start their own program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to see more of this,'' said Lyn Schollett,
attorney for the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault.
''Hopefully, the program will help in getting more convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The only concern Schollett has is confidentiality. She said
volunteers should not know whose file they are reviewing without
permission from the victim.
</P>
<P>
   The Inquirer reported last year that the city police sex-crimes
unit put thousands of sexual-assault complaints -- about 30 percent
of its caseload -- in the ''investigation of person'' category from
1984 until late 1997, which kept the cases out of the city's
official crime tally.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the practice was the result of a steep
workload and pressure to keep crime statistics down. The practice
was not revealed to the public or to crime victims.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officals To Visit Libya  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost 20 years ago, not long after President
Reagan warned that Libyan ''hit squads'' might soon be on the loose
in the United States, U.S. restrictions were placed on American
travel to Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Now, amid signs that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi might be
mellowing, the Clinton administration is trying to determine
whether it is safe for U.S. citizens to visit the oil-rich country.
</P>
<P>
   Four State Department officials were traveling to Libya today to
make an assessment on whether the restrictions should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   During their 26-hour stay, the officials will assess security at
airports, hotels and hospitals and also will confer with foreign
diplomats resident in Tripoli. No meeting is planned with Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official who briefed reporters said the visit is
unrelated to the coming trial of two Libyan suspects indicted in
the December 1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, of Pan Am
flight 103. Starting May 5, the two will be tried by a Scottish
court sitting in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The official, asking not to be identified, said the decision to
send the assessment team was part of the administration's
responsibilities to the American traveling public.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on use of American passports to travel to Libya has been
renewed annually since it was first imposed.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said increased
non-American travel to Libya since U.N. sanctions against the
country were suspended last year has raised questions about whether
previous dangers still exist.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe an objective answer requires an on-the-ground
examination by consular officials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some families of Pan Am 103 victims were briefed on the Libya
visit before the official announcement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cohen, of Cape May Court House, N.J., whose daughter was
among 189 American victims, said she is appalled by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sends a signal to Gadhafi that we've changed our policy,
and we're ready to be friends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the administration has taken note of positive steps
by Libya to end involvement in terrorism. But, he said, the country
''has a very, very long way to go before it meets the standards
required to be removed from the terrorism list.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, administration officials have a somewhat more
benign view of Libya compared with the head-to-head confrontations
during the 1980's that featured American air strikes against Libyan
targets in 1981 and in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the bombing of Pan Am 103 in 1988 was
Libya's response to the U.S. bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi 2{
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The new mood here was outlined in a speech on Libya last Nov. 30
by Ronald Neumann, a top aide in the State Department's Middle East
bureau. ''Change can now be imagined,'' he said. But, he added, an
accommodation with Libya ''is not necessarily a near-term
likelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy toward Libya will be determined by whether it
complies with U.N. Security Council requirements growing out of the
Pan Am 103 bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements include payment of appropriate compensation to
families of the victims, cooperation with the Pan Am 103
investigation and trial, acceptance of responsibility for the
actions of its officials and a ''renunciation and end to support of
terrorism and terrorist groups.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Pan Am incident, all 259 persons aboard died plus 11 more
on the ground in Lockerbie.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drugs Adviser Reports Progress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey says
''substantial progress'' has been made in the fight against illegal
drugs during the past year, with declines in youth drug use and
drug-related crime.
</P>
<P>
   But in remarks prepared for delivery Thursday to a congressional
committee, McCaffrey says heroin has become more popular among
young people, and methamphetamines have a ''serious potential
nationally to become the next 'crack' cocaine epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of McCaffrey's statement on the first of what is to be an
annual report on the state of the nation's anti-drug effort was
made available to The Associated Press on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nation working together has made substantial progress in
confronting illegal drug abuse and drug trafficking,'' McCaffrey
said. ''In the report, we show that youth drug use dropped 13
percent last year, overall cocaine use is down, methamphetamine
seizures are dramatically up and drug crime and drug-related
murders are dropping.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said efforts to curb production abroad are working. Peru
and Bolivia, formerly the top two suppliers of U.S. cocaine, ''have
reduced coca cultivation by 66 percent and 55 percent
respectively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more must be done to combat heroin and methamphetamine
abuse, and ''we must confront skyrocketing drug production in
Colombia -- 90 percent of the cocaine in the United States and most
of the heroin on the Eastern seaboard originate in or transit
through that troubled nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Methamphetamine ''remains one of the most dangerous substances
America has ever confronted,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, ''For those who say this is a war, we are
winning.''

<HEADLINE> Video Games, Violence Said Linked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Kentucky woman wants Congress to know that
the boy who killed her daughter learned to shoot accurately by
playing violent video games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am here today to ask you not to be an obstruction that makes
it harder for parents to protect their children,'' Sabrina Steger
of Paducah said during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing Tuesday
on the impact on children of video game violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a nurse, I'm in the business of recognizing signs of
illness, and I see Americans addicted to violence and in denial of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steger asked lawmakers to ban sales to minors of mature-rated
video games and to finance a public awareness campaign aimed at
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Her teen-age daughter Kayce and two others died in 1997 and five
students were wounded when 14-year-old Michael Carneal opened fire
on students who had been praying.
</P>
<P>
   Carneal pleaded guilty but mentally ill and was sentenced to
life in prison last Dec. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses at a congressional hearing testified last year that
Carneal rarely fired a rifle and never shot a pistol but had plenty
of practice with arcade-quality point-and-shoot games at home.
</P>
<P>
   Steger and the parents of the two other slain children are suing
entertainment companies, saying the creators of popular films,
violent video games and sex-oriented World Wide Web sites
influenced Carneal.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Anderson, a psychology professor at Iowa State University,
said research shows video games can trigger aggressive and violent
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is good reason to think the effects of exposure to
violent video games will be even greater'' than to television and
movies, he told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing room audience watched a video game and heard
descriptions from committee Chairman Sam Brownback, R-Kan., of
several others. In one popular game, ''Duke Nukem,'' nude female
prostitutes, some bound to posts, beg to be killed, Brownback said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said video companies deliberately market mature-rated
games to children and expressed frustration that nine industry
executives rejected invitations for their companies to be
represented at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   David Walsh, president of the National Institute on Media and
the Family, said his group has forwarded to the Federal
Communications Commission documents that he said show video
companies target children.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Hollywood's
marketing practices for violent shows and games.

<HEADLINE> CIA: U.S. Vulnerable to Surprise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the Central Intelligence Agency
says the United States is more vulnerable than ever to surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than ever, we risk substantial surprise,'' George Tenet
told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Tuesday on
weapons proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not for lack of effort on the part of the intelligence
community. It results from significant effort on the part of
proliferators.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said efforts to halt proliferation of weapons are
complicated because most programs to make weapons of mass
destruction are based on technologies that have dual use -- for
civilian as well as military applications.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet also said U.S. cities will face ballistic missile threats
from a wider variety of countries -- ''North Korea, probably Iran,
possibly Iraq'' -- over the next 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Issue Back in Congress  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anti-smoking members of Congress promised to
move quickly and aggressively to revive legislation after the
Supreme Court ruled that current law does not allow the government
to regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who led the unsuccessful charge
for tobacco legislation two years ago, also cautioned that, as in
the past, overcoming resistance from the tobacco industry will not
be easy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, just returned to the Senate after his unsuccessful run
for the Republican presidential nomination, said he would like to
see tobacco regulated but worried that tobacco companies, major
sources of political contributions, ''are too powerful'' for that
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Until Congress enacts legislation to limit campaign spending, he
said Tuesday, ''I'm not optimistic we're going to get that done.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Rep. Henry Waxman, a leading proponent of
anti-smoking legislation, said he was reintroducing a measure that
would give the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate
tobacco as a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now our responsibility,'' Waxman, D-Calif., said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said he was introducing
legislation giving the secretary of health and human services the
authority to regulate the manufacture and distribution of tobacco
products. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said the Senate ''should be
able to act expeditiously to grant the FDA the full authority it
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also weighed in from India, urging Congress to
move swiftly. ''If we are to protect our children from the harms of
tobacco, Congress must now enact the provisions of the FDA rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, in its 5-4 decision Tuesday, said the FDA was
exercising an authority not granted by Congress when it reversed a
decades-old policy in 1996 and sought to crack down on cigarette
sales to minors.
</P>
<P>
   Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, an anti-smoking
crusader, today rejected a key point that Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor made in writing the court's decision. She noted the FDA
has concluded that smoking is dangerous and said that if the agency
had power over cigarettes, the law ''would require the FDA to
remove them from the market entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That is absolutely not true,'' Koop said on ABC's ''Good
Morning America.'' ''The Public Health Service knows that if we
were to take away tobacco from 49 million addicts right now, we
would have a medical problem of unbelievable proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish the Supreme Court knew a little more about addiction
and the federal government's Public Health Service,'' Koop said.
</P>
<P>
   Any effort to regulate the tobacco industry faces strong
obstacles in Congress, as witnessed two years ago when the Senate
defeated an ambitious plan championed by McCain that would have
raised $516 billion over 25 years from increased prices for
cigarettes, bolstered anti-smoking campaigns and given the FDA
authority to regulate nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain bill had majority support but fell three short of
getting the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. Many
Republicans said they couldn't accept it because the bill, by
increasing the price of a pack of cigarettes, violated their
promise not to impose any new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It may be even more difficult to pass a tobacco bill in this
presidential election year, although both major party candidates
favor congressional action to further restrict tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the campaign of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumptive GOP presidential nominee, said Bush believes
''decisions about tobacco regulation should be made by Congress and
state legislatures'' and ''that Congress should pass tough laws to
keep tobacco out of the hands of kids similar to strict anti-teen
smoking laws he advocated and signed in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   His presumed Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, said,
''It is time for the Republican Congress and George Bush to show
their independence from 'big tobacco' and do the right thing by
passing legislation that has had bipartisan support.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial reactions on Capitol Hill to the Supreme Court
ruling indicated that new anti-tobacco legislation would be far
more modest, focusing on giving the FDA regulatory power.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a physician who co-sponsored the 1998
bill with McCain, would consider introducing legislation based on
the FDA portion of the larger bill, said his spokeswoman, Margaret
Camp.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who has final say
about what gets to the Senate floor, said he was ''not one of
those'' who believes the FDA should have control over tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they do a very good job with what they're doing
now without more requirements being dumped on them,'' Lott said.

<HEADLINE> Former head of Marine Toys for Tots Foundation admits $1.8 millionfraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The founder and former president of the
Marine Toys for Tots Foundation has pleaded guilty to stealing $1.8
million from the organization, which was set up to help distribute
gifts to poor children at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lee King, 57, of Williamsville secretly funneled money
from the foundation into a bank account in Hong Kong while serving
as president from 1991 to 1993, United States Attorney Denise
O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   He allegedly used the money in toy-manufacturing businesses he
ran and for personal bills, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   King started the foundation in Buffalo in 1991 to raise money
and promote the Marine Corps Reserve's Toys for Tots program, a
separate program that handles the toy drive. He was forced to
resign as foundation president and chairman when he fell under
investigation by federal authorities. He was indicted on numerous
fraud counts in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   King, who served with the Marines in the Vietnam War, pleaded
guilty in U.S. District Court Tuesday to one count of wire fraud, a
charge which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. He
also admitted to a charge of making false statements on a tax
return, which carries a potential three-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing was scheduled for June 27.

apparently on the belief that the Fed may not need to do much more

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 45.30; Nasdaq Up 36.86  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed at the start of trading today
as investors digested the Federal Reserve's latest boost to
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 45.30 at 10,862.04.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 36.86 at 4,748.54 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 4.01 at 1,489.86.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher today, bouncing back from a
big decline last week.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus Inc. stock rose 70 27/64 to 337 after Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter said its shares could reach 500. An analyst with the firm
said the company could be earning $7 to $10 a share by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 2 to 140 7/16 and Yahoo! rose 4 to 195}.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was mixed following the Fed's latest
interest-rate increase. The central bank has now raised rates five
times since last June in an effort to slow the economy to a
sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's increase gave stocks an unexpected shot of strength.
Rising rates are generally bad for stocks because they cut into
corporate profits. This time, however, investors were hopeful the
Fed is nearing the end of its series of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert fell 2\ to 93\ after agreeing to pull its
diabetes drug Rezulin from the market. The Food and Drug
Administration said competing drugs offer the same benefits without
Rezulin's side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at
Goldman Sachs, raised her S&AMP;P 500 year-end target to 1,575 from
1,525, citing ongoing global economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 142.05 million
shares, compared with 129.80 million at the same time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.54 to 559.33.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Mandatory Student Fees  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public colleges and universities can use money
from mandatory student activities fees to finance campus groups
that engage in political speech some students find objectionable,
the Supreme Court ruled today.
</P>
<P>
   The court voted unanimously to uphold the University of
Wisconsin's student-fee system, which the justices said does not
violate any student's free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Had the justices ruled the other way, public colleges and
universities across America would have had to stop giving money to
controversial student groups or figure out some way to give partial
refunds to those students who wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The First Amendment permits a public university to charge its
students an activity fee used to fund a program to facilitate
extracurricular student speech if the program is viewpoint
neutral,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''When a university requires it students to pay fees
to support the extracurricular speech of other students, all in the
interest of open discussion, it may not prefer some viewpoints to
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the court's nine members joined in upholding
Wisconsin's fees but refused to join the decision's language
requiring viewpoint neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   ''I agree that the university's scheme is permissible but do not
believe the court should take the occasion to impose a cast-iron
viewpoint neutrality requirement to uphold it,'' Justice David H.
Souter wrote in an opinion joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and
Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   When Wisconsin's student-fees system was challenged in 1996,
about $15 of the $166.75 students paid in fees each semester was
earmarked for distribution to campus groups by the student
government. For a school with some 38,000 students, that created a
total fund each semester of about $570,000.
</P>
<P>
   Several law students with conservative political views objected
to having some of their money funneled to liberal organizations.
Their lawsuit identified as objectionable 18 of the 125 subsidized
campus groups, including the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender
Center and International Socialist Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Southworth, the lead plaintiff and now an attorney, said
in a recent interview, ''As a conservative and a Christian, it was
frustrating to see the money going to organizations I personally
disagree with.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge and a federal appeals court ruled against the
university, but the nation's highest court said they were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling will not affect private schools because the
Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech,
protects people against government actions only.
</P>
<P>
   When the case was argued before the justices in November,
Southworth's lawyer, Jordan Lorence, contended that ''Students have
a First Amendment right not to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Ullmann, a Wisconsin assistant attorney general,
referred to the school's long tradition of providing a forum where
many voices can be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy cited previous Supreme Court rulings that lower courts
relied on to rule that students cannot be forced to pay mandatory
fees that go to campus groups they do not support.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the court said unions cannot compel their members to
subsidize political advocacy through mandatory dues. And in 1995,
the justices prohibited bar groups from using portions of objecting
lawyers' mandatory dues for political lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yet recognition must be given as well to the important and
substantial purposes of the university, which seeks to facilitate a
wide range of speech,'' Kennedy wrote in today's decision.
</P>
<P>
   In another 1995 decision, the court said public universities and
colleges cannot create a ''public forum'' for students by supplying
subsidies and then refuse to fund some groups because of their
viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling was relied on by Kennedy to impose the neutrality
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the Wisconsin fee system was not upheld -- one that
appears to allow officials to ''defund'' a campus group if such
action is approved by a majority vote of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing a majority vote of students to cancel out a
university's commitment to neutrality when allocating student-fee
funds would be unconstitutional, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Board of Regents, University of Wisconsin vs.
Southworth, 98-1189.

<HEADLINE> PM-NY--Rooftop-Shots, 1st Ld-Writethru,480  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK J. ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DIX HILLS, N.Y. (AP) -- A father, despondent after receiving news
that body parts found in a Queens park may be his oldest son,
climbed atop his roof today toting two weapons and goaded police to
shoot him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shoot me, shoot me!'' one neighbor on Oakfield Avenue said she
heard him yell. ''What are you waiting for? Shoot me!''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor said she heard him telling police, ''I'm a
failure as a father.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The man on the roof apparently received bad news that his
son's remains had been found in Queens,'' said Suffolk County Chief
of Patrol Edwin Michel. ''NYPD detectives came to the house late
(Tuesday) to tell him this.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City Police Detective George Nagy said police found a
human skull and part of a foot inside two plastic covered
containers at Oakland Park in Bayside, Queens, shortly after 5 p.m.
Tuesday. The containers were inside a large plastic tub with rope
handles, sitting openly in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they had identified the remains as the son, Nagy said,
''We're not saying that. That's what they're (Suffolk police)
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police officers converged on 75 Oakfield Ave. around 7
a.m. after the distraught man called a news outlet on Long Island.
Neighbors reported hearing several shots fired, apparently into the
air. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The man, drinking and armed with a high-powered rifle and a
handgun, was still on the roof refusing to come down by midmorning.
Scores of police and FBI agents swooped down on the tree-lined
street, located some 50 miles east of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the neighborhood was evacuated. Those who live nearest
to the high-ranch house were told by police to stay in their
basements, Michel said.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk police also asked media organizations not to fly
helicopters over the scene for fear of further upsetting the man.
</P>
<P>
   Michel said the man's wife and another son were out of the house
and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's sitting on the chimney on top of his roof,'' a woman who
was watching him from her window said earlier in the morning. Like
the other neighbors, she asked that her name be withheld for safety
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   She described him as an older man who at times appeared relaxed,
leaning calmly against the chimney but at other times agitated,
pacing the perimeter of the roof with a rifle in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor said she first heard what she thought was a car
backfiring but realized it was more serious when she went to let
her dog out and was waved back inside by police, who had blocked
off the street.
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor told The Associated Press the man threw one gun
down to police but still had another. According to other neighbors
the man appeared intoxicated.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes drug taken off market due to safety concerns  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rezulin, which once was cheered as offering
new hope for some diabetes patients, has been withdrawn from the
market after being linked to at least 61 deaths from liver
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration requested the drug be removed
Tuesday. The agency said the drug's manufacturer, Warner-Lambert of
Morris Plains, N.J., agreed to the action. Shares of Warner-Lambert
fell $1.25 to $93.75 in early trading Wednesday morning on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin was prescribed for type 2, or adult onset diabetes
patients who had not responded to other therapies. It was used by
about 750,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent critic of the FDA, Dr. Sidney Wolfe, said the drug
should have been taken off the market long ago. He described
Rezulin as ''one of the most dangerous drugs'' on the market.
</P>
<P>
   According to an FDA announcement, a review of recent safety data
showed that Rezulin was more toxic to the liver than two newer
drugs, Avandia and Actos, which have similar action.
</P>
<P>
   ''Data to date show that Avandia and Actos, both approved in the
past year, offer the same benefits as Rezulin without the same
risk,'' the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now confident that patients have safer alternatives in
this important class of diabetes drugs,'' said Dr. Janet Woodcock,
director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
</P>
<P>
   The action comes just days after the FDA announced that at least
61 deaths had been linked to Rezulin and an FDA physician had sent
a letter asking Congress to help him persuade agency officials to
remove the drug from the market.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a
consumer advocacy group, said Rezulin ''should have been long
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The British government took it off the market a long time ago.
The question is, why did it take the FDA so long to take it off the
market?'' said Wolfe. He said if the agency had acted earlier, some
patients would still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is just another example of how low the standards have
gotten at FDA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin was well-received when it first went on the market in
1997 because it was the only drug available that restored the
body's sensitivity to insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Type 2 diabetes develops when the body no longer responds to
insulin, a hormone required to process sugar in the blood. Doctors
hailed Rezulin because it promised treatment for patients who
failed other therapies. Untreated diabetes can cause heart and
kidney failure, blindness and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   After Rezulin was on the market, the FDA began receiving reports
of patients suffering from liver failure after taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA ordered Parke-Davis to put stronger liver toxicity
warnings on the drug and an advisory committee recommended that the
drug be available to only a select group of patients -- those whose
diabetes was not well-controlled by other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, at least 61 patients died of liver failure while
taking Rezulin and another seven required liver transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Avandia, manufactured by SmithKline Beecham, and Actos, made by
Takeda Pharmaceuticals and marketed by Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., were
approved last year as alternative drugs to Rezulin. The agency said
Tuesday that after nine months on the market, it is clear that the
newer drugs ''have less risk of severe liver toxicity than
Rezulin.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Continued use of Rezulin now poses an unacceptable risk to
patients,'' said Woodcock.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said patients now taking Rezulin should contact their
doctors and discuss alternative treatments.

<HEADLINE> Federal appeal sought in house fire conviction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Arguing that a jailhouse informant lied
on the stand, a defense lawyer is seeking a federal appeal for a
man convicted of setting a house fire that killed his three young
children.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, a state appeals court upheld the murder conviction
of Mark Mastin, who is serving 25 years to life in prison for
burning down his house in a jealous rage against his wife and
killing the couple's children, Louis, 6, Cassandra, 5, and Douglas,
3.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking a federal review of the case, attorney Felix Lapine
maintained that the state Appellate Division ''failed to address
legitimate violations'' of Mastin's civil rights by police and
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Mastin was coerced by police into giving a confession and was
the victim of an unfair trial in which a jail inmate testified that
Mastin told of setting a fire with lighter fluid at the foot of the
stairs, Lapine contends.
</P>
<P>
   The informant, John Lewis, recently contacted Lapine and ''told
me he lied'' at the trial in hopes of an early release from jail,
the attorney said in today's Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Mastin confessed to setting the fire after
his unfaithful wife stayed out late at a bar on Dec. 9, 1995.
Neighbors in Aloquin, a hamlet about 20 miles from Rochester, said
he stood calmly outside while the fire raged.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Mastin escaped with severe leg burns by jumping from an
upstairs window.
</P>
<P>
   Mastin, now 31, was convicted of murder and arson.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Wins Kids' Clothing Suit  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today made it significantly
harder for companies to show that their product's design is
distinctive enough to qualify for trademark-law protection.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision was a victory for Wal-Mart, which had
been found by lower courts to have made more than $1 million by
selling so-called knockoffs after improperly copying designs used
by a children's-clothing manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Trademark protection is intended to promote competition by
allowing companies to make their products distinctive from other
products. It also is aimed at guarding against consumer confusion.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the Wal-Mart case was when a product's design, or
''trade dress,'' is distinctive enough to qualify for such legal
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled in 1995 that although the color of a product is
not ''inherently distinctive'' and therefore cannot not always
qualify for legal protection, it can qualify for protection only
when the color serves to identify a particular brand.
</P>
<P>
   In today's ruling, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, ''It seems to
us that design, like color, is not inherently distinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart hired a firm in 1995 to make children's clothing
modeled after a design used by Samara Brothers, a
children's-clothing manufacturer. Wal-Mart paperwork used in
planning for the order showed photos of garments bearing the Samara
label.
</P>
<P>
   Samara sued Wal-Mart, accusing it of infringing Samara's
copyright and its distinctive design. A jury ruled for Samara and
awarded it $912,856 in damages for copyright infringement and
$240,458 for trade-dress infringement.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the damages for
copyright infringement and all but $68,633 of the award for trade
dress violation. The appeals court said there was enough evidence
to show ''Wal-Mart's marketing of the knockoffs was willful piracy
with an intent to deceive consumers as to the source'' of the
product.
</P>
<P>
   Today's decision overturned the appeals court ruling and wiped
out Samara's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the case of product design, as in the case of color, we
think consumer predisposition to equate the feature with the source
does not exist,'' Scalia wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers are aware of the reality that, almost invariably,
even the most unusual of product designs -- such as a cocktail
shaker shaped like a penguin -- is intended not to identify the
source but to render the product itself more useful or more
appealing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Wal-Mart Stores vs. Samara Brothers, 99-150.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 53.98; Nasdaq Up 103.26  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rose today, but the broader
market was mixed as investors digested the Federal Reserve's latest
boost to interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 53.98 at 10,853.36.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 103.26 at 4,814.94 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 0.42 at 1,494.29.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher today, bouncing back from a
big decline last week.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus rose 69 59/64 to 336{ after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
said its shares could reach 500. An analyst with the firm said the
company could be earning $7 to $10 a share by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 5 3/16 to 143| and Yahoo! rose 5[ to 196~.
</P>
<P>
   Aclara Biosciences, which made its initial public offering of
stock Tuesday, rose 16~ to 49 in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of money left the sector last week over concerns that
valuations were just too high,'' said Barry Hyman, senior equity
analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ''But there's still a lot of
interest in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was mixed following the Fed's latest interest
rate increase. The central bank has now raised rates five times
since last June in an effort to slow the economy to a sustainable
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's increase gave stocks an unexpected shot of strength,
helping the Dow to a 227-point gain. Rising rates are generally bad
for stocks because they cut into corporate profits. This time,
however, investors were hopeful the Fed is nearing the end of its
series of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert fell 3{ to 92 after agreeing to pull its diabetes
drug Rezulin from the market. The Food and Drug Administration said
competing drugs offer the same benefits without Rezulin's side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at
Goldman Sachs, raised her S&AMP;P 500 year-end target to 1,575 from
1,525, citing ongoing global economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 334.05 million
shares, compared with 348.86 million at the same time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which has slumped
in recent sessions after reaching new records early this month,
rose 11.33 to 564.12.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Policy, Rights Weighed  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices struggled today over
whether states can express their objections to human rights abuses
in other countries by limiting purchases from companies that do
business there.
</P>
<P>
   States have the right to withhold ''tax funds from the indirect
support of brutal regimes abroad,'' said attorney Thomas A.
Barnico, representing Massachusetts, which passed a law limiting
state purchases from companies that do business in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is unlawfully interfering in U.S. foreign policy,
countered lawyer Timothy B. Dyk, arguing for the National Foreign
Trade Council, which challenged the state law. Congress' decision
to pass more limited sanctions against Myanmar, also known as
Burma, in 1996 bars states from enacting policies that go further,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dyk also contended the 1980s boycott by many states of companies
that did business in South Africa during that country's apartheid
era also was unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were widespread practices by states then, were they
not?'' asked Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Seth Waxman, supporting the foreign trade
group, said Congress actually authorized the South Africa boycott.
However, he added, ''what Massachusetts has done is interfere''
with U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Some justices expressed reservations about Massachusetts'
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter asked Barnico whether the state could
''clear your conscience'' by adopting a resolution opposing abuses
in Myanmar while not restricting its purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure it would clear our conscience,'' Barnico
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer wondered if states also could enact
purchasing policies intended to influence the actions of other
states. That could result in ''a kind of nightmare'' or ''chaos,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, ''For Massachusetts to go it
on its own when the United States is saying we want to get together
with world neighbors'' on a Myanmar policy, ''isn't there a
clash?''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Antonin Scalia suggested Congress could pass a law
that explicitly bars policies like the one in Massachusetts.
''Isn't that enough to solve the problem?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to issue a decision by July.
</P>
<P>
   Several state and local governments have restricted their
dealings with companies that do business in Myanmar as well as
other countries including China and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The military has ruled Myanmar, one of the world's poorest
countries, since 1962. Foreign donors including the United States
have heavily restricted aid to Myanmar-- also known as Burma -- since
a 1988 crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising in which the military
gunned down thousands of protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts law says a company doing business with Myanmar
can sell goods and services to the state only if its bid is 10
percent lower than all other bids. The law makes exceptions for
purchases of some medical devices and for news-gathering and
international telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Several months after the Massachusetts law was enacted, Congress
imposed its own more limited sanctions on Myanmar. Under the law,
President Clinton barred new U.S. investment in the country in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign trade council challenged the Massachusetts law in
1998. A federal judge ruled for the council, as did the 1st U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, which said the law interfered with
federal foreign policy and was pre-empted by the federal
government's own sanctions against Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' appeal is supported by 22 states: Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine,
Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Texas, Utah, Vermont and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign trade council is supported by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, American Insurance
Association and Chemical Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Natsios vs. National Foreign Trade Council, 99-474.

<HEADLINE> Overcrowded jail awaits Sharpton, who faces 10-day term forprotest  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) -- The Rev. Al Sharpton says he is more
than willing to submit to jail if it will get attention for his
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, 45, was to begin serving a 10-day jail term today for
leading a 1999 protest in Atlantic City over racial profiling by
New Jersey State Police. In a 15-minute speech to about 90
supporters there Tuesday night, he said he welcomed the opportunity
-- even if it comes with risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come from people who turned their jail cells into pulpits,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, 45, was convicted in November on two counts of
obstructing traffic, a disorderly persons offense, at a July 3
protest on the Atlantic City Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling in New Jersey came to national attention after
the 1998 shooting of three unarmed minority men by state troopers
on the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   The incident led authorities to examine practices of racially
discriminatory traffic stops, and last April the Attorney General's
office released a report acknowledging the practice of racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton and 75 others were arrested after backing up traffic
headed into the casino capital on the busy Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The jail is no Hilton: It's overcrowded, some inmates sleep on
mattresses on the floor and many are violent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll treat him like we treat every other inmate,'' said
County Executive Dennis Levinson. ''This is a guy who's all about
equal treatment for everyone, right? Well, he'll get the same
treatment as everyone else.'' He will be held at the Gerard L.
Gormley Justice Facility here, commonly known as the Atlantic
County Jail, which is about 12 miles west of Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entry, Sharpton will get an orange jail uniform, a cup, a
spoon and toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   Built for 470 inmates, the jail now holds about 970. They live
in 6-by-15-foot cells in which they share toilets. Some inmates
sleep on the floor on cracked vinyl mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   Up at 7 a.m., they have twice-a-day recreation opportunities and
time set aside for court appearances or doctor's appointments,
according to Richard F. Mulvihill, Atlantic County's public safety
director.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't say what Sharpton's accommodations will consist of,
saying only that he'll get no special consideration -- or protective
custody, which the Black Ministers Council had asked for on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is the purpose of protective custody, if they don't give
it to me?'' Sharpton said Tuesday. ''Gangsters are given that. It
says more about them than it does me. If they have it for anyone,
clearly, I fall into anyone's definition of high profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are allowed from 1 to 9 p.m. Saturday and Sunday and
from 5 to 9 p.m. Monday, and speak to inmates using a telephone as
they sit opposite each other, divided by a glass partition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not someplace you'd like to spend your vacation, let's
put it that way,'' Levinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton apparently doesn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, he fairly pressed Municipal Judge Bruce Weekes to
jail him, vowing never to pay a fine or the $21,233 in restitution
being sought by Atlantic City police as compensation for officers
who worked holiday weekend overtime for the protest.
</P>
<P>
   It's not his first time behind bars. Sharpton has been convicted
of criminal trespassing four times and served 30 days of a 45-day
term on one of the convictions in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to bring books to read. Among them: ''Pillars of
Fire,'' by Taylor Branch, about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., and several books by theologian Paul Tillich.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton has said he plans daily prayer vigils. He planned to
surrender after a noon rally outside the jail, accompanied by
Martin Luther King III and four minority men who were shot at by
state troopers during a 1998 New Jersey Turnpike traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson and NAACP leader Kweisi Mfume plan to
visit him while he's in jail, Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   He considers the jail term an opportunity to highlight racial
profiling and what he says are vindictive authorities punishing him
for bringing attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did what I did because I believed it was necessary and I'll
pay the price for it,'' Sharpton said.

<P>
   On Sunday, Bob Thomas will mark his 56th year covering the
Academy Awards for The Associated Press. Here he traces the history
of the awards and his memories of them.
By BOB THOMAS
Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It all began on a warm May evening in 1929
when members of the 2-year-old Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences gathered in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood Roosevelt
Hotel for a dinner of jumbo squab and lobster Eugenie.
</P>
<P>
   The first annual Academy Award presentations followed -- all
five, unsuspenseful minutes of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were no surprises, because the awards had been announced
three months before,'' Janet Gaynor, the first recipient of the
best actress award, remembered 50 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a lovely evening, with all the stars and the producers
and directors sweeping around on the dance floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor received her statuette -- it had not yet been dubbed Oscar
-- from Douglas Fairbanks Sr. None of the three nominees for best
actor was present. The winner, Emil Jannings, had departed for
Germany, where he became a Nazi propagandist for Goebbels.
</P>
<P>
   A portent of the future was sounded that year when Darryl F.
Zanuck, production head at Warner Bros., accepted a citation for
the first feature film with sound, ''The Jazz Singer.'' 1929 would
be the last year of awards for silent movies.
</P>
<P>
   This reporter began covering the awards for The Associated Press
in 1945, at Grauman's Chinese Theater, across the street from the
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   The awards had moved there the year before and done away with
the usual dinner and dancing; the war was at its height, and the
Academy decided it would be unseemly for movie stars to appear at a
lavish dinner when the rest of America was scrimping.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to describe the charge of excitement for a 23-year-old
cub reporter with a lifelong passion for movies to be assigned to
Hollywood's biggest event.
</P>
<P>
   It was the year of ''Going My Way,'' with Bing Crosby and Barry
Fitzgerald winning as the younger and older Catholic priests, and
Leo McCarey for producing, directing and writing the film.
</P>
<P>
   With customary insouciance, Crosby had planned to send his
parents to the awards in his stead. Paramount sent out a posse and
found the crooner on the golf course. He finally agreed to appear
at the last minute, and accepted his Oscar -- made of plaster
because of wartime metal shortages -- sans toupee.
</P>
<P>
   So many memories since then...
</P>
<P>
   The long-overlooked Humphrey Bogart getting his due for ''The
African Queen''... Jimmy Stewart sobbing as he paid tribute to the
absent Gary Cooper; it was the first hint that Cooper was dying...
Elizabeth Taylor, back from a near-death illness, winning for
''Butterfield 8,'' a film she hated... The hoots that met Sasheen
Littlefeather's rejection of Marlon Brando's Oscar for ''The
Godfather''...
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Bergman's triumphant second Oscar for ''Anastasia,''
after her seven-year purgatory for her ''illicit'' affair with
Roberto Rossellini... John Wayne at the end of his life winning his
peers' esteem for ''True Grit''... David Niven and the streaker...
The huge ovation for Charlie Chaplin, ending his exile to receive
an honorary award... The boos that greeted Vanessa Redgrave's
diatribe against Israel... Roberto Benigni climbing over chair
backs to claim his Oscar....
</P>
<P>
   In my second year covering the awards, the star was Joan
Crawford, in absentia. Nominated for her stunning comeback in
''Mildred Pierce,'' she claimed to be unable to attend because of
illness. This led to speculation that: 1. She was terrified of
losing; 2. If she won, she figured the illness would be a clever
publicity stunt; 3. She really was ill.
</P>
<P>
   She won, and photographers crowded her bedroom for pictures of
an ''ailing'' Crawford with Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   In the ceremony's early years, usually at the Ambassador or
Biltmore hotels, its formality was leavened by the addition of
comedians -- Will Rogers, Jack Benny and especially Bob Hope -- as
hosts. What a concept!
</P>
<P>
   Zanuck's son Richard, who is producing this year's show with his
wife, Lili, remembers attending those dinners with his father, who
had become chief of 20th Century-Fox:
</P>
<P>
   ''He was constantly being nominated, and he took me to the
awards starting when I was 7 or 8 years old. In those days the
ceremonies lasted only a half-hour; it was all about the awards, no
frills.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an affair that everyone wanted to be at, wouldn't be
caught dead not going to. Today, as Lili and I are finding out,
it's very rare that (stars) would come unless they are nominees or
presenters.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end of the Oscars as insiders' celebration
came in 1947. The awards moved to the Shrine Auditorium, a garish
and cavernous hall south of downtown Los Angeles, and the public
was allowed to buy tickets. So few did, however, that the empty
seats had to be filled by servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   There also was more drama backstage than on. After Olivia de
Havilland collected her Oscar for ''To Each His Own,'' her sister,
Joan Fontaine, rushed up to congratulate her. De Havilland turned
away and commented, ''I don't know why she does that when she knows
how I feel.'' The two sisters had not spoken for four years.
Friends believed the feud was caused by the outspoken Fontaine's
acid comments about her sister's then-husband.
</P>
<P>
   The nadir of the Academy's fortunes was reached in 1949. The
major studios, suffering the onslaught of television and the loss
of their theaters because of antitrust action, withdrew their
financial support of the awards. The ceremony was held in the
Academy's own theater, a shabby house on the edge of Beverly Hills,
capacity 950 compared to the Shrine's 6,700 the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The studios relented the next year, and the Academy returned to
the bigtime, spending the next 11 years back in Hollywood at the
Pantages Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1953, the Academy Awards ceremony underwent a sea
change: television!
</P>
<P>
   The awards had been broadcast on radio since the 1930s, but
television had been a no-no. Studio heads feared the upstart
medium, and forbade their stars from appearing in it. Living-room
scenes in movies contained no hint of a TV set, though millions of
American homes had them. Television was the monster that could
destroy the film industry; already it had caused thousands of
theaters to close.
</P>
<P>
   The first Oscar telecast emanated from the Pantages as well as
from a simultaneous ceremony at the Century Theater in New York,
where several of the nominees gathered. The NBC show was a ratings
success, and changed forever how the awards were presented.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy Awards were no longer solely a celebration of the
best achievements in motion pictures. They became an entertainment
for millions of viewers at home.
</P>
<P>
   Network officials urged visual gimmicks and dance numbers to
spice up the seemingly endless parade of award-giving. As
commercials were added too, the show grew longer and longer. (Last
year's broadcast lasted 4 hours and 5 minutes, ending after 1 a.m.
in Eastern times zones.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, the Oscars moved to the seaside Santa Monica Civic
Auditorium -- for no conceivable reason except, as Bob Hope
suggested, ''The losers can walk into the ocean'' -- and finally
settled into the sparkling new Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the
Music Center in downtown Los Angeles in 1969. There it has
remained, with occasional detours back to the venerable, more
capacious Shrine.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of years, the ceremony will move into its first
permanent home, a brand-new theater in a shopping and entertainment
center a block from the Hollywood Roosevelt, where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Academy Awards still exciting to me after so many years?
</P>
<P>
   Is Julia Roberts a superstar?
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars remain the biggest Hollywood story of the year, and
you can bet the adrenaline will be pumping once again when I report
to the Shrine Auditorium on Sunday night.

<HEADLINE> 'Nightline' Celebrates 20 Years  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Few things on ABC's thoughtful ''Nightline''
are ever left to chance. So it was with the program's invention,
even if legend suggests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The short story is that ''Nightline'' began in November 1979 as
a series of late-night special reports after 65 Americans were
taken hostage at the American embassy in Iran, and never really
went away.
</P>
<P>
   It suggests an opportunity seized. In fact, says host Ted
Koppel, it was an opportunity secretly planned for.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's affiliate stations then had no interest in ceding the
11:30 p.m. time slot, and its advertising revenue, to the network --
least of all for a news show. Then-ABC News President Roone Arledge
coveted it anyway, and would occasionally ''steal'' 15 minutes for
the network on nights when there was a big story.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was doing that with the full knowledge that one day a story
was going to come along that would last more than a week or two,
and when it came he was going to ride that puppy into the ground,''
Koppel said.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage crisis was just that story. After a few weeks of
running the nightly ''America Held Hostage'' reports, the
affiliates couldn't just refuse them. It would have been
unpatriotic.
</P>
<P>
   Arledge had his wish. And on March 24, 1980 -- Day 142 of the
hostage crisis -- the broadcast was rechristened ''Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the date Koppel considers its true anniversary, and ABC is
marking the 20-year milestone with a series of shows from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nightline'' has distinguished itself with a restless spirit
and probing intellect, a serious news broadcast when the network
appetite for serious news is fading. It has earned 41 Emmy Awards
over two decades, and still airs successfully in a time slot where
logic dictates most viewers want late-night laughs.
</P>
<P>
   With the same public face for two decades, ''Nightline'' has
become a fiefdom at ABC News. When network news President David
Westin appointed three new deputies this week, none were given
authority over ''Nightline.'' The show answers only to the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has left a magnificent legacy,'' said Marvin Kalb, director
of the Shorenstein Center on Press and Politics at Harvard
University. ''There ought to be many more serious programs of the
'Nightline' variety on television news, but that simply is not the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Koppel's blunt interviews were the show's early signature.
Through satellites, ''Nightline'' connected interview subjects for
freewheeling conversations, even leaders of warring nations.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising slogan, ''bringing people together who are
worlds apart,'' succinctly captured the idea. It has become such a
convention of television news that it's difficult to remember when
it was new.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nightline'' also brought the town meeting broadcast to
television, starting with an extraordinary four-hour session on
AIDS in 1987. In the 1990s, the show frequently used a ''day in the
life'' format to bring a narrative form to big stories.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has not stayed stagnant,'' said Rick Kaplan, CNN USA
president and ''Nightline'' executive producer from 1984 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan was brought in shortly after an effort to turn
''Nightline'' into an hour-long show dealing with a variety of
topics failed, proving that not every idea is a winner. The show
was cut back to 30 minutes and stuck to a single subject, a format
it holds to today.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bettag, executive producer since 1991, has presided over a
strong era for ''Nightline,'' keeping Koppel engaged when the
passage of time might dictate that his interest would flag. Bettag
has guided the occasional foray into prime-time, such as
correspondent Robert Krulwich's innovative ''Brave New World''
series last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the things we pioneered are old hat today,'' Koppel
said. ''That's why the challenge now is to look at the Internet, to
look at the arrival of broadband, to look at the potential of
interactivity, and to find ways to communicate that have never been
used before. Stories are always going to be the same, but the
modalities of telling them change.''
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of 20 years for Koppel are the shows that he
believes, in some small way, may have changed the world. In 1985,
before the ending of apartheid, ''Nightline'' did a week of
programs from South Africa that were also telecast in that country.
Foreign Minister P.W. Botha and Bishop Desmond Tutu appeared in a
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, a series of programs from Israel featured a
town meeting with Israelis and Palestinians talking about their
conflict. Former President Jimmy Carter told Koppel the program
helped nudge both sides toward peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to be remembered for the fact that those of us who
work here have a social conscience,'' Koppel said. ''We believe
that television news is more than simple accounting of the most
dramatic or most important events of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Koppel has returned several times in the 1990s to examine the
criminal justice system, particularly the dramatic increase in
prison population. As a story that has happened gradually, not
suddenly, it escapes the notice of many news outlets.
</P>
<P>
   He still shudders at the shows that didn't work, like a 1985
trip to Vietnam. Le Duc Tho embarked on an eight-minute answer to a
Koppel question, and his translator refused to interrupt. In his
earpiece, Koppel heard a producer say that Henry Kissinger, waiting
in a New York studio to speak, was threatening to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Koppel sat on the roof a Saigon hotel, hot sun and television
lights beating down on him, sweating.
</P>
<P>
   A 1987 interview with disgraced evangelists Jim and Tammy Faye
Bakker remains the highest-rated program in ''Nightline'' history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember staffers saying at the time, 'Does 'Nightline' want
to be doing this?''' Koppel said. ''I said, just because everyone
else in the country is interested in doing the story doesn't mean
it's the wrong thing for us to do. This was God's gift to reporters
-- a story about religion and money and sex and power.''
</P>
<P>
   Koppel, 60, and Bettag have talked about a new host. Koppel
would like to see someone from the current staff, like Chris Bury,
replacing him, but knows it isn't his decision. He wants an ''easy
and gradual'' transition that may take years.
</P>
<P>
   The program has established itself so solidly that it can
survive a change of hosts, Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're better than Ted is, that would be amazing,'' he
said. ''If you're not as good as Ted is, there's still a lot of
room to be great. I think Ted has created a program for the ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Koppel takes it year to year. He still enjoys the work -- some
nights more than others, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say that I get sweaty palms every night when I go down
there,'' he said. ''But when I go out on the road ... Yeah, I still
get juiced by that. The difference is now I'm seeing the kids of my
friends and colleagues on the road as producers and reporters. That
sort of reminds me of the passage of time.''

<HEADLINE> The Doctor Is Still In  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ROGERS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The records are still demented and the doctor
is still in.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years, Dr. Demento continues to play the strangest
music you can find on the radio, all of it drawn from the
half-million recordings he keeps at home.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't heard on as many radio stations as he used to be (about
100 around the country now), but fans who can't tune him in can
enjoy his 30th anniversary collection of 42 of his favorite songs --
''Dementia 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before any dementia set in, though, Barry Hansen was a
bookish, music-obsessed young man from the northern Plains, a
self-described nerd who grew up during the dawn of television but
whose family didn't own one until he was 12. So he listened to Tin
Pan Alley tunes on the record player each night -- and to the
classical music his father played on the piano each afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was collecting his own records, everything he could find
in stores, thrift shops, even places that sold scratchy old 45s
taken off jukeboxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, he figured, he'd end up running a college music
department somewhere, exposing young minds to a wildly eclectic
collection of songs including Spike Jones, Gustav Mahler and the
Boston Pops performing ''The Trish-Trash Polka.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he went on a friend's underground FM radio program in
the fall of 1970 and played some of his collection.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be demented to play that,'' the station's
receptionist shouted at him one day after hearing a guy named
Nervous Norvis sing ''Transfusion,'' a bouncy ballad about a
reckless driver who's his local blood bank's best customer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not a comment of approval,'' Hansen says, smiling
broadly as he recalls the day he became Dr. Demento.
</P>
<P>
   The persona would stick with him the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   While Hansen, with a bachelor's degree in classical music and a
master's in folk, waited for that college to call, he kept going on
the radio. And there, if Professor Hansen wasn't broadening the
musical knowledge of his young listeners, Dr. Demento was.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd play original old blues records that the Rolling Stones
had covered and I'd say, 'This is where they got this,''' he
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Then he might throw on some Spike Jones, and suddenly the
airwaves would be alive with the sounds of something like ''The
William Tell Overture'' being played on pots and pans, with horns
honking, whistles tooting, guns firing and cowbells ringing in the
background. And the phone lines would come alive as well.
</P>
<P>
   The songs, culled from modern-day CDs as well as homemade tapes,
old LPs, 45s, even 78s, all have two things in common: They are
different and they have endured.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Dr. Demento, who looks anything but demented.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day he's dressed in a tweed sportcoat, white,
open-collared shirt and dress slacks. His dark, curly hair has
whitened and thinned over the years, and the top hat and tails he
saves for personal appearances are nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   But the voice is instantly recognizable to anyone who has tuned
in the show. A reedy, sing-song twang that betrays its Minnesota
roots, it can quickly become as animated as it is on the radio when
the talk turns to music.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what the 58-year-old Demento has come to the West Los
Angeles offices of Rhino Records to talk about. The archival label
is releasing his new collection, and on it are such Demento
classics as the ''Lumberjack Song,'' Monty Python's paean to a
cross-dressing woodsman; Dr. Rock's ''I'd Rather Have a Bottle in
Front of Me (Than a Frontal Lobotomy)'' and Weird Al Yankovic's
''Another One Rides the Bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Demento discovered the song parodist when 16-year-old Alfred
Yankovic sent him a homemade tape back in the '70s, and that tape
is still in Demento's collection, along with all the others he
began collecting when he was 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was what you call today a nerd,'' he says of those days in
Minneapolis. ''Socially rather awkward. But by the time I was a
junior in high school everybody realized, 'Hey, if you invite Barry
to your party, at least you'll have good music.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, music was soon occupying every aspect of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He played piano in a Los Angeles jazz band in the late 1960s,
and worked as an usher at a folk music club so he could see the
likes of Lightnin' Hopkins and Mance Lipscomb perform.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote about rock 'n' roll for Rolling Stone in the magazine's
early years and wrote scholarly essays on the history of the blues.
He even worked as a roadie for two of the bigger rock bands of the
1970s, Canned Heat and Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I quickly realized that probably wasn't the life for me,''
he says, noting one of his jobs with Canned Heat ''was to score
dope for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Not that I have any kind of a puritan attitude about that,''
he quickly adds. ''But trying to buy drugs, illegal drugs, in a
city I didn't know that well wasn't my idea of something I wanted
to do the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead he became Dr. Demento. He got married, kept
collecting records and waited for that college to call.
</P>
<P>
   The call never came, but he has no regrets. He got to be a
musicologist anyway.

<HEADLINE> Memoirs of Slave Days Republished  </HEADLINE>
By JOE WHEELAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Jim Crow and the Ku Klux Klan were on the
rise when William Henry Singleton wrote in 1922 about his slave
days in North Carolina and Georgia and gave heartfelt thanks to the
government for allowing him to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps timing is why his memoir had such a brief shelf life. It
appeared in a weekly newspaper and as a pamphlet, then vanished
into obscurity for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton had plenty to tell. Born into bondage and sold twice
before reaching manhood, he organized a black Civil War regiment in
the coastal town of New Bern before black units were used by the
Union Army. He met Abraham Lincoln. Later, he was wounded in
battle. After the war, he learned to read, moved North and
prospered. He died at 95, outliving two of his three wives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all his successes, Singleton's plain narrative is tinged
with bitterness over how he once was regarded as ''but a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was bought and sold. I was whipped. Once I was whipped
simply because it was thought I had opened a book,'' he wrote in
''Recollections of My Slavery Days.''
</P>
<P>
   Long overlooked by scholars, Singleton's memoir was rediscovered
by historians Katherine Mellen Charron, a Yale University graduate
student, and David S. Cecelski, a University of North Carolina
historian who grew up near Singleton's birthplace. The North
Carolina Division of Archives and History recently republished the
memoirs with annotations by Charron and Cecelski.
</P>
<P>
   Cecelski said they found one of the two extant Singleton
pamphlets at the New York Public Library while researching maritime
history in the antebellum South and realized Singleton grew up only
a few miles from Cecelski's childhood home.
</P>
<P>
   Struck by the place names' authenticity and by Singleton's
determination to create a black fighting unit against all odds, he
and Charron decided to research Singleton and his unique memoir.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the only slave narrative that gives any firsthand
insight into organizing former slaves into African-American
regiments,'' Cecelski said.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton took his last name from the man he called his father,
but his paternity remained a mystery. He grew up on John Handcock
Nelson's plantation in Craven County along the lower Neuse River.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton, his mother and two brothers were among the
plantation's 26 slaves. One day when Singleton was 4, he was sold
to an Atlanta widow who ran a ''slave farm,'' where slaves were
raised like livestock and sold upon reaching maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ''That night when my mother came to get me and my brothers I was
not there,'' he wrote. ''I had been sold off the plantation away
from my mother and my brothers with as little formality as they
would have sold a calf or a mule.''
</P>
<P>
   His new mistress whipped him, and his bed was the dirt floor by
the fireplace. When he was 7, Singleton ran away and made his way
back to his family 600 miles away, a monumental feat for a child,
but things there weren't much better. He ran away again and was
sold again.
</P>
<P>
   He was a servant to a young Confederate officer early in the
Civil War, but switched sides after Union Gen. Ambrose Burnside
captured New Bern in 1862. Employing the martial skills he had
learned, Singleton raised and trained his own all-black Union
regiment.
</P>
<P>
   But the Union Army wasn't ready for blacks. Burnside, however,
was so impressed with Singleton's efforts that he took him along to
Fort Monroe, Va., to meet President Lincoln. According to
Singleton, the ''great emancipator'' assured him black soldiers
would fight one day.
</P>
<P>
   The time came in 1863, and Singleton's regiment became the 35th
U.S. Colored Troops, seeing action in South Carolina, Georgia and
Florida, where Singleton was wounded in the leg at the Battle of
Olustee.
</P>
<P>
   After mustering out in Charleston, S.C., he learned to read.
Then he went home to his family in North Carolina, but found
himself an object of hatred because of his Union Army service.
''The Ku Klux Klan said they would shoot me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He moved North -- to New Haven, Conn., and later Peekskill, N.Y.
He was a coachman, gardener, caretaker and an itinerant minister
for the AME Zion Church.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton died at the Grand Army of the Republic's 72nd
encampment in Des Moines, Iowa, in September 1938 after
participating in a 15-block parade in 90-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Recollections,'' he takes a veteran's pride in the
participation of black American soldiers in World War I, which had
ended just four years earlier: ''I saw the boys of my race take
their place in the armies of the Republic and help save freedom for
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Singleton marveled at the strides blacks had made during his
lifetime and at being permitted to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Think of it! I, who was once bought and sold, and whipped
simply because it was thought I had opened a book...,'' he wrote.
''It is a great thing to have lived to see this day come.''

<HEADLINE> National Gallery Has Jesus Exhibit  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- When William Holman Hunt painted ''The Light of
the World'' a century ago, there was little question that the
public would understand the figure of Christ knocking at a closed
door.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the painting was so popular that it went on tour to
Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, and was widely
reproduced.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of a new century, with religious observance in
Britain in steep decline, there is no longer the confidence that
the picture speaks to its audience. In the National Gallery's new
exhibition, ''Seeing Salvation,'' the curators feel obliged to
argue that you don't have to be a Christian to appreciate pictures
of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the hands of the great artists, the different moments and
aspects of Christ's life become archetypes of all human
experience,'' Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery,
writes in the exhibition catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Virgin nursing her son conveys the feelings every mother
has for her child; they are love. Christ mocked is innocence and
goodness beset by violence. In the suffering Christ, we encounter
the pain of the world, and Christ risen and appearing to Mary
Magdalene is a universal reaffirmation that love cannot be
destroyed by death.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are pictures that explore truths not just for
Christians, but for everybody,'' MacGregor writes.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which continues at the Trafalgar Square gallery
through May 7, ranges from simple carvings of the Good Shepherd
from Roman catacombs to Salvador Dali's ''Christ of Saint John of
the Cross,'' a powerful image of the crucified Christ floating
above the world, painted in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition explores how artists struggled with portraying
both man and God, as in Andrea Mantegna's portrait from about 1500,
which shows the young Jesus striking the pose of a Roman emperor.
One hand holds an orb, symbolizing worldly power, and the other
holds an olive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Another painting about 80 years later, by Ludovico Carraci,
shows St. Francis cradling the infant Jesus, whose evident
helplessness emphasizes his humanity.
</P>
<P>
   A 17th-century drawing by Jacopo Negretti of a bleeding Christ
standing in a chalice, supported by angels, graphically illustrates
the doctrine of the communion wine being his true blood.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking portrayals of Christ in the exhibition
doesn't show a human at all. ''Agnus Dei,'' Francisco de Zurbaran's
painting of about 1635, depicts a lamb lying on a bench, its four
hooves tied together. The lamb's chin rests gently on the bench and
its half-closed eye signifies its submission to the coming
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the images are filled with symbolism, including ''The
Light of the World,'' which was loaned to the gallery by St. Paul's
Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ''The closed door was the obstinately shut mind; the weeds the
cumber of daily neglect, the accumulated hindrance of sloth ... the
bat flitting about only in darkness was a natural symbol of
ignorance,'' Holman Hunt wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition of 79 images was mostly drawn from the National
Gallery's own collection. MacGregor notes that about a third of all
the pictures have Christian themes, with half of those portrayals
of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   MacGregor worked with the British Broadcasting Corp. on a
four-part television series, also called ''Seeing Salvation,''
which will air in Britain in April. The series moves outside the
gallery to examine images in context as objects of worship.
</P>
<P>
   John McEwen, art critic for The Sunday Telegraph, said the
exhibition has both religious and artistic significance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It affirms Christianity. It must be the most important show of
the year for that alone,'' McEwen commented. ''I think it is very
important because it re-establishes that pictures and objects of
art have content as well as form.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gas Additive May Contaminate Wells  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- About one-third of drinking water wells in 31
states may be contaminated with the gasoline additive MTBE,
according to a study released today. The federal government already
is acting to ban use of the chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers with the U.S. Geological Survey and the Oregon
Graduate Institute's Department of Environmental Study found about
9,000 of 26,000 wells looked at were within a kilometer of a
leaking fuel tank, head researcher John Zogorski said.
</P>
<P>
   But Zogorski said it's likely that not all of the 9,000 wells
are contaminated with MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether.
</P>
<P>
   ''We like to say a significant but currently unknown number of
community water supply wells may be at risk,'' he said. ''The
number 9,000 is so large that the number of wells that may be
affected may well be worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   The study omitted 19 states, including California and Texas,
because they lacked needed information on well sites. The study was
posted in the online edition of the journal Environmental Science &AMP;
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration announced Monday that it is moving to
ban MTBE from gasoline, but it will take at least a decade before
the possibly carcinogenic substance no longer poses a threat to the
water supply.
</P>
<P>
   The study and more than 50 others on MTBE and related issues
will be presented this weekend in San Francisco during the national
meeting of the American Chemical Society.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE has been used in gasoline for two decades to limit air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly the only carcinogenic pollutant to be found in
leaking underground fuel tanks. But other pollutants, like benzene,
''tend to absorb more toward soil and degrade much faster,''
Zogorski said.
</P>
<P>
   Many variables play a role in determining whether MTBE will make
it into a well, Zogorski said. Key among them is the rate at which
wells are pumped.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pumping excessively makes the situation worse,'' said
Zogorski, from the Geological Survey. ''It draws down contamination
into the well. If the pump rate is low, typically the plume (of
MTBE) passes right by.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 87.18  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rose today, but the broader
market was mixed as investors digested the Federal Reserve's latest
boost to interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 87.18 at 10,820.16.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 105.07 at 4,816.75 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 3.33 at 1,490.54.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher today, bouncing back from a
big decline last week.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus rose 67 21/32 to 334 15/64 after Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter said its shares could reach 500. An analyst with the firm
said the company could be earning $7 to $10 a share by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 4 13/16 to 143\ and Yahoo! rose 6 1/16 to 197 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Aclara Biosciences, which made its initial public offering of
stock Tuesday, rose 16~ to 49 in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of money left the sector last week over concerns that
valuations were just too high,'' said Barry Hyman, senior equity
analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ''But there's still a lot of
interest in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was mixed following the Fed's latest interest
rate increase. The central bank has now raised rates five times
since last June in an effort to slow the economy to a sustainable
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's increase gave stocks an unexpected shot of strength,
helping the Dow to a 227-point gain. Rising rates are generally bad
for stocks because they cut into corporate profits. This time,
however, investors were hopeful the Fed is nearing the end of its
series of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   But today a measure of caution had returned to the market, Hyman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market understands that there are still higher rates to
come, and that might prevent substantial gains in the next few
months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert fell 3 13/16 to 91 11/16 after agreeing to pull
its diabetes drug Rezulin from the market. The Food and Drug
Administration said competing drugs offer the same benefits without
Rezulin's side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at
Goldman Sachs, raised her S&AMP;P 500 year-end target to 1,575 from
1,525, citing ongoing global economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 484.35 million
shares, compared with 498.74 million at the same time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which has slumped
in recent sessions after reaching new records early this month,
rose 11.98 to 564.77.

<HEADLINE> Q-Tips Maker Relocating Production  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Unilever Home &AMP; Personal Care-USA
said Wednesday it is relocating production of its Q-Tips cotton
swabs to a plant in Puerto Rico, eliminating about 150 jobs here.
</P>
<P>
   But the company also plans to transfer the production of Suave
lotions to Jefferson City from its Chicago plant later this year.
No permanent jobs will be affected in Chicago, Unilever said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson City facility produces a variety of skin and oral
care products, including Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion, Aim and
Mentadent.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of the cotton swab production line should be
completed by the end of next year, the company said. The move will
consolidate all production of Q-Tips in a factory in Las Piedras,
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever's Jefferson City plant opened in 1966 with the
manufacture of Q-Tips, and the product line was expanded in later
years.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever Home &AMP; Personal Care-USA is part of the Anglo-Dutch
Unilever group, the third largest consumer products company in the
world. It operates in 88 countries with 255,00 employees and annual
sales close to $45 billion.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Agrees to Sex Bias Settlement  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government today agreed to a $508
million settlement of a 23-year-old lawsuit filed by women who
claimed a U.S. agency refused to hire them because of their gender,
Justice Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement came in a suit filed in 1977 by 1,100 women
against the now-defunct United States Information Agency. The
lawsuit charged the agency ''rejected employment applications from
women based on their sex'' in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed settlement, which is subject to approval by U.S.
District Judge James Robertson, comes 16 years after a federal
court found the government guilty of discriminating against women.
</P>
<P>
   The women had applied for jobs as international radio
broadcasters, radio electronic technicians, writers, editors and
production specialists at the USIA and Voice of America between
1974 and 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women who were denied jobs were experienced
broadcasters from the British Broadcasting Corp. or other national
and international news outlets, qualified writers and reporters, or
experienced technicians and producers for network television and
radio.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered the government to pay back pay and interest
totaling $22.7 million. Many of those women also were awarded job
relief and federal government retirement accounts. The $22.7
million in individual awards will be paid by the government in
addition to the $508 million settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1984, the government has filed and lost two appeals of the
case and was denied a hearing by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''After exhausting our legal remedies regarding the trial
court's finding of classwide liability and litigating the claims of
48 individual class members, we negotiated a classwide settlement
that is an equitable and fair resolution of the matter,'' said
Wilma A. Lewis, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The settlement amount is the result of the lengthy time period
involved, the relatively high-paying positions at issue, the number
of claimants and the accrual of prejudgement interest beginning in
1991,'' Lewis added.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Fredrickson, attorney for the women, said the trials
disclosed that the USIA and the Voice of America, the government's
radio broadcaster abroad, regularly manipulated the hiring process
to exclude women. The plaintiffs alleged that the agencies ''rigged
the system'' in favor of men and in some cases, resorted to test
fraud, altering test scores and destroying personnel and test
files.
</P>
<P>
   ''Highly qualified women with specific relevant experience were
routinely rejected in favor of men with fewer skills and less
experience,'' Fredrickson said.

<HEADLINE> Goldberg Unveils 'Battery Park'  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Gary David Goldberg was looking back and looking
ahead. He had come to share a sorrowful farewell, even as he neared
the launch of something new.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bewildering, I think, is a good word,'' said Goldberg,
struggling to label the moment as he sat at Chelsea Piers' Stage D,
where ''Spin City'' originates.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Los Angeles, the veteran producer came to New York last
week to be with ''Spin City'' star Michael J. Fox for rehearsal and
filming of the fourth-season finale -- which will air May 24 as
Fox's final appearance as a cast member on the hit ABC sitcom he
and Goldberg co-created.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, thanks to fate's counter-programming, Goldberg
was just days from the premiere of ''Battery Park,'' his new NBC
sitcom about a precinct full of NYPD zanies. Airing Thursday at
9:30 p.m. EST, the ensemble comedy stars Justin Louis, Elizabeth
Perkins, Bokeem Woodbine, Robert Mailhouse, Jacqueline Obradors,
Frank Grillo and Jay Paulson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Battery Park'' was shot in Los Angeles, where Goldberg had
just wrapped production of its initial seven-episode order.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Manhattan, he was re-entering the mythical world of New
York deputy mayor Michael Flaherty (Fox), who cracks the whip in
''Spin City's'' antic administration. The hour-long finale
(showcasing Flaherty's departure) would be filmed Friday, followed
in subsequent weeks by the two episodes building toward that
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after April 7, the 38-year-old Fox will turn full
attention to his real-life bout with Parkinson's disease, a
degenerative neurological disorder whose cure he aims to help find.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one could have foreseen it accelerating at the rate it
did,'' says Goldberg of his friend's affliction. ''Energy: That's
what I think of when I think about Mike. Pulsating with energy!
It's hard to have a sense of that being quieted down.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Goldberg looks up as a familiar figure whisks into the
room.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ace!'' he greets Fox, who fires back, ''Saying some bad things
about me?''
</P>
<P>
   It's their first encounter this particular day and they exchange
a warm hug, then a few words of show talk. Then Fox heads back to
rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to be here,'' Goldberg says simply. ''And I
thought I was prepared for it. But I wasn't. The other actors have
been reduced to tears -- I mean serious, wracking tears. The quality
of the man is such that people are just devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, now 56, thought back to the two seasons he spent
full-time here at Pier 61 as he and Fox got their show off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''We built the studio and all the backstage space,'' he recalled
fondly. ''At first, they wanted us to shoot at Kaufman-Astoria'' --
the Queens, N.Y., facility that ''Cosby'' and ''Sesame Street''
call home. ''I said, 'Look, I grew up in Brooklyn. I don't go to
Queens in the morning.'
</P>
<P>
   ''Here, my office had a view of the Hudson (River) and the
sunsets -- and too many sunrises. We put together a place that was
comfortable for us, because we were here 20 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the breakout star of Goldberg's longrunning '80s sitcom
''Family Ties,'' had specified that his return to series TV would
be filmed in New York, where he lives. Now, with his leave-taking,
''Spin City'' will leave, too, relocating to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   But with the signing of Charlie Sheen to play a new character at
City Hall, the show will go on.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key was Mike saying, 'That'd be great if it continued,'''
explained Goldberg, who a few weeks ago saw no future for the
series. ''We don't think we're replacing Michael Fox. It's clear
that this is Mike's show, it'll always be Mike's show. We're gonna
do a different version of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if ''Battery Park'' catches on and wins a pickup for
NBC's fall schedule, it might be lodged next door to ''Spin City''
when production resumes this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Without making any forecast of success (even with his track
record and cheerful outlook, Goldberg knows not to cop to
optimism), he explained that he created ''Battery Park'' as
''Barney Miller'' for a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had always been interested in that world: of high-stakes,
high-energy, on-the-edge police work,'' Goldberg said. ''It seemed
an interesting challenge to see if, after shows like 'Hill Street
(Blues)' and 'NYPD (Blue)' and 'Law &AMP; Order' and 'Homicide' -- which
were all after 'Barney Miller' -- you could go back to a cop comedy
and still get laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our show's good,'' he said, then reminded himself,
''I'm not gonna make the final judgment on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he mean to sit around waiting for the audience's
verdict. After this tough stretch, Goldberg and his wife, Diana,
were eager for a brief escape.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told everybody, 'If I get one phone call about ''Battery
Park'' -- you'll be fired!'''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled gently. ''And when I get back in the middle of April,
we'll be whatever we're gonna be.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in television ...
</P>
<P>
   '20/20': It's one of America's darkest secrets: the forced
sterilization of 60,000 to 100,000 American citizens, many of them
just children. ABC News correspondent Cynthia McFadden explores a
most un-American practice -- one lawful in 35 states, as well as
endorsed by the Supreme Court in 1927. McFadden's report also
investigates the public's wide acceptance of the practice, with
popular movies advancing the virtues of sterilization and even
advocating killing the ''genetically unfit.'' It airs on ''20/20''
Wednesday at 10 p.m. EST.

that body parts found in a Queens park may be his son, climbed atop
his roof today toting two weapons and goaded police to shoot him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shoot me, shoot me!'' one neighbor on Oakfield Avenue said she
heard the man yell. ''What are you waiting for? Shoot me!''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor said she heard him telling police, ''I'm a
failure as a father.'' Neighbors identified the man involved in the
hours-long standoff as John Fenrich, He lived in the house with his
wife and had two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The man on the roof apparently received bad news that his
son's remains had been found in Queens,'' said Suffolk County Chief
of Patrol Edwin Michel. ''NYPD detectives came to the house late
(Tuesday) to tell him this.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City Police Detective George Nagy said a passerby found
a human skull and other bones in a plastic container at Oakland
Park in Bayside, Queens, shortly after 5 p.m. Tuesday. Another
plastic container, this one empty, and a larger tub with rope
handles and elastic cords were nearby.
</P>
<P>
   NYPD investigators believe the remains were Steen Fenrich, 19.
The teen-ager's social security number was written on the skull,
police sources involved in the investigation told The Associated
Press. Racial and anti-homosexual epithets were also written on the
skull, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and high school friends said Fenrich was bi-racial.
His father, John, is white and his mother, Wanda, is black, said
neighbor, Karina Wahee, 21, who graduated a year ahead of the
younger Fenrich from Half Hollow Hills East High School.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just a very nice guy. I heard he wanted to go into the
military. He was always jogging or rollerblading through the
neighborhood,'' Wahee said. ''When I heard, I thought, ''No, it
just can't be them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Saper said he ran into Steen Fenrich on a Long Island Rail
Road train four months ago and learned he had gotten his own
apartment in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police officers converged on 75 Oakfield Ave. around 7
a.m. after Fenrich allegedly fired several shots into the air and
climbed atop the roof, toting at least two weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after police visited the house, the elder Fenrich called
News 12 Long Island, a cable television station, to tell them about
his son's remains being found.
</P>
<P>
   Around 6:30 a.m. police received reports of shots fired at the
house. Fenrich apparently fired them into the air and did not
injure anyone.
</P>
<P>
   By the time police arrived, Fenrich had climbed onto the roof.
Suffolk police said he was armed with a high-powered rifle and a
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of police and FBI agents swooped down on the tree-lined
street, located some 50 miles east of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the neighborhood was evacuated and the Ostego Elementary
School, about a half-mile away, was in lock-down mode, not allowing
anyone in or out of the building. Those who live nearest to the
high-ranch house were told by police to stay in their basements,
Michel said.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk police also asked media organizations not to fly
helicopters over the scene for fear of further upsetting the man.
</P>
<P>
   Michel said the man's wife and a younger, teen-aged son were out
of the house and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's sitting on the chimney on top of his roof,'' a woman who
was watching him from her window said earlier in the morning. Like
the other neighbors, she asked that her name be withheld for safety
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   She described him as an older man who at times appeared relaxed,
leaning calmly against the chimney but at other times agitated,
pacing the perimeter of the roof with a rifle in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor said she first heard what she thought was a car
backfiring but realized it was more serious when she went to let
her dog out and was waved back inside by police, who had blocked
off the street.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the birthday spotlight:
</P>
<P>
   On the syndicated TV series ''Xena: Warrior Princess,'' viewers
see Lucy Lawless fighting with sword, shiv, crossbow or a murderous
missile called the chakram. But Lawless says she's not physically
gifted. ''After a series of hard knocks, I've learned to be much
quicker on the uptake,'' said Lawless, who was born on March 29,
1968. ''People don't believe me when I say that if I can learn the
choreography of a large stunt fight in 20 minutes, anybody of
average intelligence can. You don't even have to be that
intelligent to succeed at it.''
</P>
<P>
   She missed out on playing the Unsinkable Molly Brown in
''Titanic,'' but Reba McEntire keeps sailing along with
million-selling albums, sold-out concerts and the occasional movie.
So why wasn't she in the blockbuster movie? You might call it
country values. ''They kept moving the (shooting) schedule and I
can't keep changing my concert dates,'' said McEntire, who was born
on March 28, 1955. ''I have too many people on the payroll to keep
juggling the schedule, so I had to pass on 'Titanic.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nation's funniest people have graduated from Second
City's minimalist stages, including Alan Arkin, who joined the
Chicago-based troupe in 1960. Arkin said that besides its
theatrical legacy, Second City has become a second home to
countless social misfits. ''Lots of mavericks and displaced people
wound up here,'' said Arkin, who was born on March 26, 1934. ''It's
become sort of a comedy orphanage.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Calvin Klein  </HEADLINE>
By CAROL DEEGAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hundreds of women of all ages and nationalities
showed up when designer Calvin Klein introduced his new line of
beauty products at Saks Fifth Avenue recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still worry that no one's going to show up,'' the designer
said later in an interview. ''I always think I'm going to be doing
it by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein said creating a full line of cosmetics is a natural
extension of the color statement he makes in fashion. ''For years,
cosmetic companies have taken their cue from what fashion designers
do. Now I can introduce a complete look for the face that reflects
the look and feel of the collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The Calvin Klein color cosmetics collection features products
for the lips, eyes, cheeks, face and skin. Suggested retail prices
range from $14 to $38. The collection also includes a full line of
brushes.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, 57, signed white-metal compacts, brush sets and other
products for Saks customers who lined up at his new Calvin Klein
beauty counter. ''People are really nice to come. It was very
touching to me to get the feedback. I want to know what people
think,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   1. How long have your new color and skin collections been in
development?
</P>
<P>
   Klein: We started discussing it four years ago, and I've been
actually working on the collection for 2{ years. So it's completely
unlike fashion because with fashion, every season, you're doing a
new collection. This is establishing a collection that will always
be the core of who we are in the cosmetic world. There's real
color, but it's more transparent, it's lighter. ... The overall
effect is one that's lighter. It's makeup for sure, but it's makeup
that should make you look younger, healthier, more beautiful,
rather than old. Because makeup can be very aging.
</P>
<P>
   2. This isn't the first time you've had your own cosmetics line,
is it?
</P>
<P>
   Klein: I did this many years ago, we did cosmetics, and we
stopped making cosmetics after two years because we weren't making
any money. And we decided to concentrate on fragrance. And I've
always wanted to come back and do the cosmetics. We had to
establish ourselves as a serious fragrance house before we thought
it was time to really expand, and so I'm thrilled because it's fun
to do and it's interesting, and we have something to say that's
different.
</P>
<P>
   3. How did you come up with so many shades of color?
</P>
<P>
   Klein: What I do is color, and it's so many different shades of
a color and sophisticated colors. ... I mean, every collection that
I do, that's all we do is work with color! And all of sudden, I see
in the swimwear collection amazing colors, and I start telling the
other design studios, 'Wait, you have to see what swimwear is
doing,' and it translates into cosmetics perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   4. How are you going to promote the collection?
</P>
<P>
   Klein: The advertising, unlike fragrance, it's a slower build.
We want to be word of mouth, we want people to discover it more
through experiencing it. No TV. Print is like, just a half a dozen
magazines. It's very small. It's different stores. In New York, it
will be in my store on Madison Avenue and Saks.
</P>
<P>
   5. No splashy billboards?
</P>
<P>
   Klein: The only way people will know is to try it. Or if you
write something, to read about it. Because this is more about
people getting to know the stuff, it's not like a fragrance where
you open up a magazine and you get a whiff of it and you know if
you like it or not, it's totally different. And you have to
experience it.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Elton John  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Don't talk to Elton John about slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very hard for me to sit still,'' the British entertainer
said as he embarked on a promotional campaign for a new album and
his Broadway musical ''Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Reginald Dwight on March 25, 1947, John has captivated
generations of fans, starting with baby boomers who watched him
strut the stage in outlandish wardrobes, including foot-tall
platform shoes and a Donald Duck suit.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of his 53rd birthday, the piano-playing singer of
''Pinball Wizard,'' ''Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,'' ''Candle in the
Wind,'' ''Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me'' and ''Can You Feel the
Love Tonight'' has mellowed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   That's due to either maturity or physical realities: He was
fitted with a pacemaker last year to overcome what he called ''a
minor imbalance in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   At home in Atlanta, he goes shopping, browses record stores and
stays accessible to fans and the media. He doesn't understand those
reclusive celebrity types.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's more of an American disease -- Barbra Streisand,
Michael Jackson, people like that. I like going out. People are
always very pleasant. I'm not going to shut myself off. It keeps
you grounded a bit,'' John said in a telephone interview from his
West Hollywood hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Although his outfits are now relatively conservative in black or
white -- and no glitter -- John is not resting on his numerous
laurels, including Oscar, Tony, Golden Globe and Grammy awards,
and, of course, that British knighthood bestowed by Queen
Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   But he's still energetic. The Broadway curtain rises March 23 on
Disney's ''Aida,'' with a pop score by John and Tim Rice. A week
later, John, Rice and composer Hans Zimmer's first collaboration
since ''The Lion King'' will be heard in theaters nationwide with
release of DreamWorks' animated feature ''The Road to El Dorado.''
</P>
<P>
   The soundtrack ''Elton John's The Road to El Dorado'' has six
songs from the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''I decided to write more and 11 made the cut,'' he said. ''It's
more like an Elton John album than a soundtrack, and I'm very happy
with the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides juggling his musical projects, he's also passionate
about charity work. The Elton John AIDS Foundation was formed in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I got sober and clean, I wanted to do something positive
with my life,'' said John, whose annual Oscar night party in West
Hollywood raises about $400,000. His annual tennis tournament
''Smash Hits'' also adds to the coffers.
</P>
<P>
   1. A month before your 53rd birthday, you were presented with
the Grammy Legend Award by the National Academy of Recording Arts
and Sciences. Does it make you think more about your mortality?
</P>
<P>
   John: Oh, I take these things with a pinch of salt. I've never
really taken them too seriously. What I take seriously is my work.
'The Lion King' was a piece of magic for me. It opened a lot of
doors for me, like the film score for 'The Muse' with Albert Brooks
and 'Aida.' I'm not finished.
</P>
<P>
   2. How's your health?
</P>
<P>
   John: I'm fine. I've never felt better. I play tennis every day
about eight in the morning. I always have to watch my weight. It's
always up and down. It will be 10 years this July that I'm clean
and sober. I stay away from alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   3. How does Hollywood react to your commitment to AIDS research
and your Oscar party?
</P>
<P>
   John: People here are very AIDS conscious. There's a fund-raiser
every night in this town, you know. The consciousness is always
there, though. We come away with about $350,000 to $400,000. It's
an evening where you meet and greet people and schmooze and have
fun. Everyone just walks across the street from the Vanity Fair
party. In Style magazine is our sponsor. We have dinner to watch
the ceremony, and then we wait for people to arrive after the show.
I'm busy making sure people are comfortable and providing sound
bites for people outside. I love it. I get to meet people I've
never met before. And we have www.eltonjohn.com to chat online.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''The Lion King'' won two Oscars and three Grammys and sold
more than 10 million albums. Is it tough to live up to those
expectations with your new ''El Dorado'' album?
</P>
<P>
   John: 'The Lion King' is what everybody aims for. But you can't
make another 'Lion King.' No one can. I think the songs on this
album are actually better than 'The Lion King.' But the movie is an
enigma, really. 'The Road to El Dorado' is a fun movie but it's not
'The Lion King.'
</P>
<P>
   5. You are awake at dawn to do this interview. Do you ever want
to sit back and relax?
</P>
<P>
   John: Well, I think about it. On my days off, I know how to
chill. It's very hard for me to sit still. I'm not one to sit still
and read a book, although I do read. Instead of reaching 50 with a
career and concerts, I've got my fingers in different pies. I can't
just sit down and write rock 'n' roll songs anymore. I've evolved.
This is fabulous.

<HEADLINE> Awards Mean Work for Pamela Dennis  </HEADLINE>
By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The week before a major Hollywood awards show
means a week of nonstop work for fashion designer Pamela Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   She flies to Los Angeles from her Manhattan office armed with
her most recent collection of evening wear and a dozen exclusive
gowns reserved for A-list stars.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis sets up shop in a hotel, meeting with actresses, stylists
and publicists -- all of whom will have an opinion on which dress
will look best.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the wait.
</P>
<P>
   Nominees and presenters often don't decide on an outfit until
the day of an event, leaving Dennis wondering until the last minute
whether any of her designs will make it to the red carpet. That's
why Dennis -- and other major designers -- won't reveal the names of
the stars who are considering their gowns.
</P>
<P>
   ''The awards are such hard work,'' said Dennis during a recent
interview at her showroom. ''I do it because I want to help match a
person's personality to what she is wearing to have her stand out
as herself.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her all-time favorite outfits was selected by ''Ally
McBeal'' star Calista Flockhart for last year's Golden Globe
Awards. Flockhart wore her black shell top and a white trumpet
skirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day she had decided to wear that skirt -- I didn't even
know she was going to wear it -- I had called Barneys and asked if
they had a black cashmere shawl to send over to the Bel-Air Hotel.
I didn't want her to get cold.
</P>
<P>
   ''When she showed up on the red carpet -- and I wasn't even
there, I was in New Jersey at my home -- I was shocked. That was the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said her relationship with her clients -- who include
Jamie Lee Curtis, Liv Tyler and Joan Rivers -- fuels her desire to
create a line of elegant and eye-catching gowns.
</P>
<P>
   She does not do it for her own celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be a complement to the star -- or a condiment. That
little thing on the side that makes the meal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis reserves most of the sexy beaded gowns for her customers.
</P>
<P>
   Her own daily uniform is black leather jeans with a black jersey
button-down shirt.
</P>
<P>
   When she is feeling daring, she adds a little charcoal gray to
her palette, and when her ''belly is behaving,'' she might swap her
shirt for a cropped top. That's as wild as it gets -- although a
little crocodile-skin top she paired with a stretch skirt helped
land her a booth at a trendy Paris restaurant recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pretty minimalistic,'' the 38-year-old designer said.
''Color actually looks better on me, but I'm basically a shy
person.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for her latest collection, filled with metallic
fabrics, leather, suede and beaded studs, came from her teen-age
nephew, who is a fan of heavy-metal music.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like having to look at something twice. You know when
someone walks into a room and you're not sure what it is. You say,
'Is it or isn't it?' I like that second look.''
</P>
<P>
   For this year's Oscars, stylists and actresses are clamoring for
bright red gowns, which are not part of her new collection. Her
latest designs are mostly brown, green and black, so she is sending
dresses in shades of cinnamon and brick.
</P>
<P>
   ''I listen to my customers with one ear and I hear what I want
with the other, and then I mesh the two together,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said the public has become interested in celebrity
fashion because people enjoy watching the stars step out of the car
looking their best and having dozens of flashbulbs go off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all so visual. We're all so fixated on what we see, and
Hollywood still is a fantasy. It's 'I want to be her' -- Cinderella
walking down the red carpet, Grace Kelly stepping out of the car,''
the designer said.
</P>
<P>
   She favors simple, modern shapes, particularly in black, and
says gold is more flattering than platinum, which is very popular.
Dennis would also like to see more stars wear a nude color, which
she describes as feminine with an edge.
</P>
<P>
   What are her Oscar fashion predictions?
</P>
<P>
   ''We probably won't see black and we won't see simple. And we'll
see platinum.''

<HEADLINE> Where's the Country Music on TNN?  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- These days, the folks at TNN tend to
downplay the words behind their abbreviation: The Nashville
Network.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. Country music no longer dominates the cable station
built on the backs of Nashville's singing stars.
</P>
<P>
   There's wrestling on Friday nights, action shows on Wednesday
nights, old TV movie-of-the-week tear-jerkers on Mondays nights.
</P>
<P>
   Reruns of ''Matt Houston,'' ''Alice'' and ''The Dukes of
Hazzard'' dominate the daily schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The original programming is a mix of roller derby, bowling,
rodeo and the weekly ''Eighteen Wheels of Justice'' (a combination
of ''Knight Rider'' and ''The Fugitive''), with G. Gordon Liddy as
the bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kind of take a tongue-in-cheek approach to the whole
thing,'' said Brian Hughes, head of TNN programming. ''This is not
brain surgery. We're in the business of entertaining people, and
it's kind of lighthearted entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   During its first two decades, TNN was the network that featured
low-key songwriter Bobby Bare talking shop with his famous friends,
Ricky Skaggs playing hot licks at the Ryman Auditorium, and Ralph
Emery having meandering conversations with country stars on
''Nashville Now.''
</P>
<P>
   The programming shift, which got under way in earnest in
January, was the result of several factors that threatened the
network. Chiefly, the audience for the country music programming
was older than advertisers prefer. There was also a growing problem
getting top country music stars to appear on TNN shows and the need
for TNN to differentiate itself from sister network CMT (Country
Music Television).
</P>
<P>
   ''I think to a great degree this network was taken for granted
(by the country music industry) for a long, long time,'' Hughes
said. ''I don't mean any disrespect with that. ... This surge of
popularity for country music beginning in the late 1980s, it opened
up avenues for people in network television, syndicated television
and other cable outlets. They had this plethora of opportunity out
there, which was good for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we saw them less.''
</P>
<P>
   So, out went ''Prime Time Country,'' country music's daily
''Tonight Show'' knockoff, and in came a series of theme nights
mostly directed to attracting males ages 12 to 34. Friday's lineup
is monster trucks at 8 p.m. EST, ECW Wrestling at 9 p.m., RollerJam
at 10 p.m. and Rockin' Bowl at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that although the number of viewers overall has
dropped by about 20 percent from last year, corporate parent CBS is
pleased with improvements in demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had success stories all around the network with regard to
ratings and demos, but the country music-related things had a
tendency to skew old for a long period of time,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   TNN isn't out of the music programming business, Hughes insists.
The Grand Ole Opry is still given an hour each Saturday. A new
music series is under development that is mostly country, but will
incorporate other styles to attract a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   Concerts by classic rock acts will probably be broadcast at some
point, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Music is going to be an element on this network,'' he said.
''As it relates to the country music side of things, I think we're
more focused on quality than we are quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   So, as TNN seeks its new identity, what grand theme unites
roller derby, ''The Waltons,'' Daisy Duke in short-shorts, The
Grand Ole Opry and Championship Bull Riding?
</P>
<P>
   ''Uniquely and distinctly American,'' Hughes said. ''The great
outdoors to the American West in the rodeo element that we have, to
American music, to even RollerJam and wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are a part of American culture, whether you're real proud
of it or not.''

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi May Team With Daimler  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT STODDARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- With Japan's once-indomitable auto industry hurting
from a decadelong economic slump, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. may soon
well become the latest Japanese automaker to fall into foreign
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi on Wednesday authorized its president to forge an
alliance with a foreign automaker, setting off speculation that
DaimlerChrysler AG was set to buy a controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report Wednesday in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun,
Japan's leading business daily, DaimlerChrysler and Mitsubishi hope
to ink an agreement by May under which the German automaker would
buy a 33.4 percent stake in Mitsubishi -- becoming its largest
shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Both DaimlerChrysler and Mitsubishi refused comment on the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers say DaimlerChrysler wants greater access to
Asian markets, while Mitsubishi needs a powerful partner to
shoulder the burden of investing in next-generation technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The possible deal also underlines the tough times Japanese
automakers have faced lately. Domestic auto production and sales
have plunged to their lowest levels in more than a decade.
Mitsubishi ended its last fiscal year with a small profit, but must
deal with about $15 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, United States and larger European automakers are
rich from strong domestic economies. U.S. sales of cars and trucks
soared to a record 16.9 million vehicles, surpassing the previous
high of 16.0 million in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had financial powerhouses being developed here, while at
the same time weakness has been continuing in Japan,'' said David
Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study
of Automotive Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the reverse had been the case, the reverse could have
happened,'' he said in a telephone interview from Ann Arbor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   If realized, the deal between Mitsubishi Motors and
DaimlerChrysler -- estimated to be worth about $1.2 billion at
Mitsubishi's closing stock price Wednesday -- would make Toyota
Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. the only independent automakers
left among Japan's five biggest car companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Motor Co., Japan's No. 2 automaker, sold a 37 percent
stake to France's Renault SA last May. Ford Motor Co., meanwhile,
owns a controlling 33.4 percent of Mazda Motor Corp., Japan's fifth
largest.
</P>
<P>
   By Japanese law, a company that owns more than a third of a
company's shares can veto management's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. owns 49 percent of Isuzu Motors Ltd. It
also owns 20 percent of Fuji Heavy Industries, which makes Subaru
cars, as well as 10 percent of Suzuki Motor Corp., Japan's biggest
maker of mini-vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A Mitsubishi-DaimlerChrysler alliance would create the world's
third-largest automaker with production at about 5.5 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   The world's No. 3 automaker now is Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. at
5.19 million vehicles. The biggest are General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''If an opportunity for growth arises in Asia we will take
advantage of it,'' DaimlerChrysler Chairman Juergen Schrempp said
Tuesday in Germany during an unveiling of the new Mercedes C-class
sedan. ''I assume that this will happen shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Usher, auto analyst with Jardine Fleming in Tokyo, said
Mitsubishi may have reservations about ''the extent to which
DaimlerChrysler would force a fairly radical restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Japan's deepest economic slump in decades has forced
many companies to cut costs, letting workers go runs counter to the
country's paternalistic corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mitsubishi Motors may not have much of a choice. The
company doesn't expect to turn a profit this year, although it
posted a modest profit for the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The company earned 5.67 billion yen, or $53 million, for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 1999, up from a loss of 101.85 billion
yen, $955 million, in fiscal 1997 when auto demand slumped in Japan
and other recession-stricken Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign management has meant change for debt-laden Nissan. Last
October, it announced factory closures and job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Nihon Keizai reported that DaimlerChrysler will buy a stake
in a joint venture Mitsubishi has in the Netherlands with Volvo, a
unit of Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi will buy Volvo's 50 percent stake in Nedcar and then
sell it to DaimlerChrysler, giving the alliance partners a common
European production base for subcompacts.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Motors last year split its truck and passenger car
businesses into separate divisions. The company has formed an
equity alliance with Sweden's Volvo AB to produce trucks and buses.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Wins Trademark-Law Case  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court made it significantly more
difficult Wednesday for manufacturers to win trademark-law
protection for a product's design.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision was a victory for Wal-Mart, which made
more than $1 million in profits selling knockoffs of a design used
by a children's-clothing manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see it as a clear victory for our customers,'' Wal-Mart
spokesman Tom Williams said. ''There are 100 million customers who
shop at Wal-Mart each week and we believe they deserve the latest
fashions at affordable prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Trademark protection is intended to promote competition by
allowing companies to make their products distinctive from others,
and also to guard against consumer confusion.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the Wal-Mart case was when a product's design, or
''trade dress,'' is distinctive enough to qualify for such legal
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled in 1995 that a product's color qualifies for
legal protection only when it serves to identify a particular
brand. Writing for the court Wednesday, Justice Antonin Scalia
said, ''It seems to us that design, like color, is not inherently
distinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the case of product design, as in the case of color, we
think consumer predisposition to equate the feature with the source
does not exist,'' Scalia wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers are aware of the reality that, almost invariably,
even the most unusual of product designs -- such as a cocktail
shaker shaped like a penguin -- is intended not to identify the
source but to render the product itself more useful or more
appealing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart hired a company in 1995 to make children's clothing
modeled after a design used by Samara Brothers, a
children's-clothing manufacturer. Wal-Mart paperwork used in
planning for the order showed photos of garments bearing the Samara
label.
</P>
<P>
   Samara sued Wal-Mart, accusing it of infringing on its copyright
and distinctive design. A jury ruled for Samara and awarded it
$912,856 in damages for copyright infringement and $240,458 for
trade-dress infringement.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld most of the award,
finding enough evidence to show ''Wal-Mart's marketing of the
knockoffs was willful piracy with an intent to deceive consumers as
to the source'' of the product.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court overturned the 2nd Circuit court's ruling and
wiped out Samara's victory.

<HEADLINE> Stepfather shoots himself on roof after son's remains found  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DIX HILLS, N.Y. (AP) -- A Long Island man perched on his roof for
several hours, then shot himself, a day after being told that his
stepson's grisly remains were found in a Queens park.
</P>
<P>
   The stepfather fell to the ground and was taken by ambulance to
Huntington Hospital at 1:25 p.m. today, hours after he climbed atop
the roof with two weapons, fired shots and begged police to shoot
him.
</P>
<P>
   He was alive when he was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in
West Islip but his condition was not known, according to Thomas
Murphy, chief of Suffolk County detectives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shoot me, shoot me!'' one neighbor on Oakfield Avenue said she
heard the man yell earlier in the morning. ''What are you waiting
for? Shoot me!''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor said she heard him telling police, ''I'm a
failure as a father.'' Police identified him as John Fenrich, 36.
He lived in the house with his wife and had two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The man on the roof apparently received bad news that his
son's remains had been found in Queens,'' said Suffolk County Chief
of Patrol Edwin Michel. ''NYPD detectives came to the house late
(Tuesday) to tell him this.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City Police Detective George Nagy said a passerby found
a human skull and other bones in a plastic container at Oakland
Park in Bayside, Queens, shortly after 5 p.m. Tuesday. Another
plastic container, this one empty, and a larger tub with rope
handles and elastic cords were nearby.
</P>
<P>
   NYPD investigators believe the remains were Steen Fenrich, 19.
The teen-ager's Social Security number was written on the skull,
police sources involved in the investigation told The Associated
Press. Racial and anti-homosexual epithets were also written on the
skull, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and high school friends said the family was biracial.
The stepfather is white and the mother, Wanda, is black, said
neighbor, Karina Wahee, 21, who graduated a year ahead of the
younger Fenrich from Half Hollow Hills East High School.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just a very nice guy. I heard he wanted to go into the
military. He was always jogging or Rollerblading through the
neighborhood,'' Wahee said. ''When I heard, I thought, ''No, it
just can't be them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Saper said he ran into Steen Fenrich on a Long Island Rail
Road train four months ago and learned he had gotten his own
apartment in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police officers converged on 75 Oakfield Ave. around 7
a.m. after Fenrich allegedly fired several shots into the air and
climbed atop the roof, toting at least two weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after police visited the house, the elder Fenrich called
News 12 Long Island, a cable television station, to tell them about
his son's remains being found.
</P>
<P>
   Around 6:30 a.m. police received reports of shots. Fenrich
apparently fired them into the air and did not injure anyone.
</P>
<P>
   By the time police arrived, Fenrich had climbed onto the roof.
Suffolk police said he was armed with a high-powered rifle and a
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of police and FBI agents swooped down on the tree-lined
street. Dix Hills, a community of middle and upper-middle class
homes, is located some 50 miles east of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the neighborhood was evacuated and the Ostego Elementary
School, about a half-mile away, was in lock-down mode, not allowing
anyone in or out of the building. Those who live nearest to the
high-ranch house were told by police to stay in their basements,
Michel said.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk police also asked media organizations not to fly
helicopters over the scene for fear of further upsetting the man.
</P>
<P>
   Michel said the man's wife and a younger, teen-age son were out
of the house and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's sitting on the chimney on top of his roof,'' a woman who
was watching him from her window said earlier in the morning. Like
the other neighbors, she asked that her name be withheld for safety
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   She said he at times appeared relaxed, leaning calmly against
the chimney, but at other times agitated, pacing the perimeter of
the roof with a rifle in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor said she first heard what she thought was a car
backfiring but realized it was more serious when she went to let
her dog out and was waved back inside by police, who had blocked
off the street.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 105.49; Nasdaq Up 112.80  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index rose today on the
strength of technology stocks, but the broader market was mostly
lower as investors digested the Federal Reserve's latest boost to
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 105.49 at 10,801.85.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 112.80 at 4,824.48 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 4.60 at 1,489.27.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher today, bouncing back from a
big decline last week.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus rose 63 51/64 to 330] after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
said its shares could reach 500. An analyst with the firm said the
company could be earning $7 to $10 a share by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 3 13/16 to 142\ and Yahoo! rose 7 13/16 to 199 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Aclara Biosciences, which made its initial public offering of
stock Tuesday, rose 16 1/16 to 48 3/16 in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of money left the sector last week over concerns that
valuations were just too high,'' said Barry Hyman, senior equity
analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ''But there's still a lot of
interest in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered biotech sector recovered today, helping the Amex
Biotechnology Index to a 9 percent gain. Human Genome Sciences rose
14 61/64 to 107 and Biogen rose 3{ to 81|.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology stocks fell steeply last week amid profit-taking
that gathered steam after President Clinton said he wanted genetic
data to be openly shared.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was mixed following the Fed's latest interest
rate increase. The central bank has now raised rates five times
since last June in an effort to slow the economy to a sustainable
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's increase gave stocks an unexpected shot of strength,
helping the Dow to a 227-point gain. Rising rates are generally bad
for stocks because they cut into corporate profits. This time,
however, investors were hopeful the Fed is nearing the end of its
series of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   But today, a measure of caution had returned to the market,
Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market understands that there are still higher rates to
come, and that might prevent substantial gains in the next few
months,'' he said. Many on Wall Street expect the Fed to raise
rates one more time, at its May meeting, before holding steady in
advance of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert fell 3[ to 92] after agreeing to pull its
diabetes drug Rezulin from the market. The Food and Drug
Administration said competing drugs offer the same benefits without
Rezulin's side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at
Goldman Sachs, raised her S&AMP;P 500 year-end target to 1,575 from
1,525, citing ongoing global economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues were nearly even with decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 717.76 million shares,
compared with 702.75 million at the same time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which has slumped
in recent sessions after reaching new records early this month,
rose 12.91 to 565.70.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton surrenders to begin serving 10-day sentence  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) -- Casting himself as a modern day Martin
Luther King Jr., the Rev. Al Sharpton surrendered to begin a 10-day
jail term today for leading a demonstration last summer in Atlantic
City.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, 45, rallied with about 600 supporters in a cold,
drizzly parking lot next to the Atlantic County jail before
marching a short distance and surrendering to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   He walked arm in arm with Martin Luther King III as well as the
victims of a 1998 New Jersey Turnpike shooting as he headed toward
the chain-link fence of the Atlantic County Justice Facility. He
was also accompanied by his wife and two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This comes out of a long tradition of the movement started by
Dr. King, which is why his son is here,'' Sharpton said. He added
that the people responsible for racial profiling in New Jersey
haven't served a day in jail, but that he was being jailed for
protesting it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,'' said
King, quoting his father. ''If my father were alive, he would be
right here next to Rev. Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the demonstration and march to the jail entrance,
Sharpton squeezed through an opening in the fence along with his
lawyer and walked to a waiting county car. After turning to the
crowd with his fist in the air, Sharpton climbed into the car and
was driven about 100 yards to the front door of the jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come from people who turned their jail cells into pulpits,''
he told about 90 supporters Tuesday night in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton was convicted in November on two counts of obstructing
traffic at the protest. He and 75 others were arrested after
backing up traffic headed into the casino capital on the busy
Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic County jail is no Hilton: It's overcrowded, some
inmates sleep on mattresses on the floor and many are violent
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll treat him like we treat every other inmate,'' said
County Executive Dennis Levinson. ''This is a guy who's all about
equal treatment for everyone, right? Well, he'll get the same
treatment as everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton will get an orange jail uniform, a cup, a spoon and
toilet paper. Built for 470 inmates, the jail now holds about 970.
Up at 7 a.m., inmates are allowed twice-a-day recreation
opportunities and visitors three days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Richard F. Mulvihill, Atlantic County's public safety director,
wouldn't say what Sharpton's accommodations will consist of, saying
only that he'll get no special consideration -- or protective
custody as requested by black ministers on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, Sharpton pressed Municipal Judge Bruce Weekes to
jail him, vowing never to pay a fine or the $21,233 in restitution
being sought by Atlantic City police as compensation for officers
who worked holiday weekend overtime for the protest.
</P>
<P>
   It's not his first time behind bars. Sharpton has been convicted
of criminal trespassing four times and served 30 days of a 45-day
term on one of the convictions in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling in New Jersey came to national attention after
the 1998 turnpike shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The incident led authorities to examine practices of racially
discriminatory traffic stops, and last April the attorney general's
office released a report acknowledging that minorities were far
more likely to be pulled over by police.

<HEADLINE> Tighter Animal Feed Rules Urged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission has proposed
tighter rules to tackle health scares stemming from contaminated
animal feed, like the recent ''mad cow'' and dioxin cases, it said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These new rules will make sure that the member states have an
improved structure to manage any emergencies,'' and give the
Commission power to take immediate action in the case of a serious
risk, EU Health Commissioner David Byrne said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules the EU executive body could quickly ban or
restrict sales of suspect feed products; producers and exporters
would be required to inform the authorities if they suspected
irregularities; and EU nations would be required to prepare
contingency plans for dealing with serious food risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''In an emergency situation, time is the critical factor,''
Byrne said in a statement. ''Immediate intervention to contain the
risk ... is vital.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules must be approved by the 15 EU national governments and
by the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission said it was putting forward the measures in light
of the ''poor management and coordination'' between national
authorities during last year's crisis in Belgium, where animal feed
was contaminated with toxic dioxin.

<HEADLINE> Stepfather fatally shoots himself on roof after son's remainsfound  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DIX HILLS, N.Y. (AP) -- A Long Island man perched on his roof for
several hours, then fatally shot himself in the head, a day after
being told that his stepson's grisly remains were found in a Queens
park.
</P>
<P>
   The stepfather fell to the ground and was taken by ambulance to
Good Samaritan Hospital at 1:25 p.m. today, hours after he climbed
atop the roof with two weapons, fired shots and begged police to
shoot him.
</P>
<P>
   The man, identified by police as John Fenrich, 36, was
pronounced dead at the West Islip hospital. He lived in the house
with his wife and had two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shoot me, shoot me!'' one neighbor on Oakfield Avenue said she
heard the man yell earlier in the morning. ''What are you waiting
for? Shoot me!''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor said she heard him telling police, ''I'm a
failure as a father.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The man on the roof apparently received bad news that his
son's remains had been found in Queens,'' said Suffolk County Chief
of Patrol Edwin Michel. ''NYPD detectives came to the house late
(Tuesday) to tell him this.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City Police Detective George Nagy said a passerby found
a human skull and other bones in a plastic container at Oakland
Park in Bayside, Queens, shortly after 5 p.m. Tuesday. Another
plastic container, this one empty, and a larger tub with rope
handles and elastic cords were nearby.
</P>
<P>
   NYPD investigators believe the remains were Steen Fenrich, 19.
The teen-ager's Social Security number was written on the skull,
police sources involved in the investigation told The Associated
Press. Racial and anti-homosexual epithets were also written on the
skull, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The stepfather is white and the mother, Wanda, is black, said
neighbor, Karina Wahee, 21, who graduated a year ahead of the
younger Fenrich from Half Hollow Hills East High School.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just a very nice guy. I heard he wanted to go into the
military. He was always jogging or Rollerblading through the
neighborhood,'' Wahee said. ''When I heard, I thought, ''No, it
just can't be them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Saper said he ran into Steen Fenrich on a Long Island Rail
Road train four months ago and learned he had gotten his own
apartment in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Shari Lawrence, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army personnel
command, said Steen Fenrich entered the army in July 1997 and was
discharged in April 1998. He had been assigned as food service
specialist at Fort Jackson, S.C. She gave no reason for the
discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police officers converged on 75 Oakfield Ave. around 7
a.m. after the stepfather allegedly fired several shots into the
air and climbed atop the roof, toting at least two weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after police visited the house, the elder Fenrich called
News 12 Long Island, a cable television station, to tell them about
his son's remains being found.
</P>
<P>
   Around 6:30 a.m. police received reports of shots. Fenrich
apparently fired them into the air and did not injure anyone.
</P>
<P>
   By the time police arrived, Fenrich had climbed onto the roof.
Suffolk police said he was armed with a high-powered rifle and a
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of police and FBI agents swooped down on the tree-lined
street. Dix Hills, a community of middle and upper-middle class
homes, is located some 50 miles east of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the neighborhood was evacuated and the Ostego Elementary
School, about a half-mile away, was in lock-down mode, not allowing
anyone in or out of the building. Those who live nearest to the
high-ranch house were told by police to stay in their basements,
Michel said.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk police also asked media organizations not to fly
helicopters over the scene for fear of further upsetting the man.
</P>
<P>
   Michel said the man's wife and a younger, teen-age son were out
of the house and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's sitting on the chimney on top of his roof,'' a woman who
was watching him from her window said earlier in the morning. Like
the other neighbors, she asked that her name be withheld for safety
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   She said he at times appeared relaxed, leaning calmly against
the chimney, but at other times agitated, pacing the perimeter of
the roof with a rifle in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor said she first heard what she thought was a car
backfiring but realized it was more serious when she went to let
her dog out and was waved back inside by police, who had blocked
off the street.

<HEADLINE> Commuter survey gives NJ Transit good and not-so-good marks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- As the number of rail commuters increase,
most riders say NJ Transit has done a good job with on-time
performance and station improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But commuters say more work needs to be done to add seats in
cars and communicate better with passengers during service
interruptions, according to a NJ Transit ridership survey taken
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''They gave high marks on reliability, on-time performance and
cleanliness,'' Stan Rosenblum, deputy director of NJ Transit, told
The Press of Atlantic City for Wednesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 surveys were handed out by 400 NJ Transit
volunteers and 58 to 60 percent were returned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the survey, including how it was conducted, are still
a month away but will be featured in reports to passengers in
April, Rosenblum said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, commuters seemed pretty content with the rail
system as they waited for their rush-hour trains at Penn Station
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   ''The on-time performance is pretty good,'' said David Isso of
Cranford as he watched other commuters board the 5:34 p.m. express
train last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Isso had to wait for the 5:46 p.m. train because it stops at
Cranford, unlike the previous train. ''They need to concentrate on
local trains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to have more seats available,'' said Glenn Skoog of
Scotch Plains while waiting for a Raritan Line train. ''Outside of
that, it's a good service.''
</P>
<P>
   As more passengers pack the trains, the biggest complaint heard
from commuters was the lack of seats, said Jeff Warsh, executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're aware of that and have a game plan,'' Warsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the survey come as the number of NJ Transit commuters
is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, NJ Transit set ridership records with rail ridership
increasing 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Figures for the first quarter of 2000 show continued growth on
the Raritan Valley, Northeast Corridor and Midtown Direct lines.
</P>
<P>
   Transit passengers who turned in their surveys said they've seen
improvements in stations, which Rosenblum credited to NJ Transit's
Star program, which renovates stations.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters also asked for improved communication between
conductors and passengers during service interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of it is pure communication, some of it is technological
improvements like public address systems to get information to them
quicker,'' Rosenblum said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas John Bowen, president of New Jersey Association of
Railroad Passengers, said he believed the survey results were
fairly accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mostly NJ Transit is being pretty straightforward,'' Bowen
said. ''Transit is trying to deliver its message that people are
riding for positive reasons other than high gas prices.''
</P>
<P>
   However, association officials have accused transit officials of
inflating the amount of time a train needs to make its trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always squabble about what is on-time performance. We get
into the issue of padding the schedule,'' Bowen said. ''If it takes
10 minutes in between stations in the schedule and in reality in
takes two minutes, you're fudging the definition,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen acknowledged that crowded rail cars are a sign of NJ
Transit's successful growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are problems of success and these are the problems we
like to have,'' Bowen said. ''There was a time where just the
Northeast Corridor was crowded. Now, everyone's crowded. It's a
legitimate problem.''

   DIX HILLS, N.Y. (AP) -- A man who had been told his stepson had

Wednesday, before fatally shooting himself in the head.

   The man, identified by police as John Fenrich, 36, was

<HEADLINE> Physicist Wins $940K Religion Prize  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING, AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Freeman Dyson, a physicist who has written about
religion's role in modern culture, won the $940,000 Templeton Prize
for Progress in Religion, one of the richest awards for achievement
in any field.
</P>
<P>
   In an acceptance speech Wednesday, Dyson, a 76-year-old
professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, N.J., said:
</P>
<P>
   ''Science and religion are two windows that people look through,
trying to understand the big universe outside, trying to understand
why we are here. ... Both views are one-sided; neither is complete.
Both leave out essential features of the real world. And both are
worthy of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   He criticized the ''arrogance'' of both religious creationists
and those who rule out religion in science.
</P>
<P>
   The British-born physicist first made his mark at 25 by
synthesizing three competing theories in quantum electrodynamics.
He joined the Princeton institute in 1948 to work with J. Robert
Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. Dyson worked on nuclear
applications in medicine and space travel but became an opponent of
the arms race.
</P>
<P>
   The interfaith religion prize was established in 1972 by mutual
funds entrepreneur John M. Templeton to highlight a field omitted
by the Nobel prizes. Past winners include Mother Teresa, Alexander
Solzhenitsyn, Charles Colson and Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson attends a Presbyterian church but is not a member, and
calls himself both a Christian and a religious agnostic.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, religion is a way of life, not a belief,'' he said. His
daughter Mia was ordained a Presbyterian minister last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this country, churches are the organizations that hold the
community together,'' Dyson said, and scientists should realize
that ''religion has a much more important role in human destiny
than science.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the two fields should join forces to help counteract the
gap between the world's rich and poor and deal with the perils of
human genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson's books include ''Disturbing the Universe'' (1979);
''Infinite in All Directions'' (1988); ''Imagined Worlds'' (1997);
and ''The Sun, the Genome and the Internet'' (1999).

<HEADLINE> James Hampton executed for kidnapping, beating death of woman  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SALTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- James Henry Hampton told anyone who would
listen that he didn't want to grow old in prison. So when police
cornered the two-time killer in New Jersey in 1992, Hampton put a
.38 revolver beneath his chin and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet blew upwards through his head, taking out an eye and
exiting through the frontal lobe of his brain. But it didn't kill
him. Over the next 7{ years, Hampton made it clear he wanted to be
executed, though death penalty opponents claimed the bullet wound
affected his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday morning, Hampton, 62, finally got his wish. He
died by chemical injection shortly after midnight at the Potosi
Correctional Center for the first of the two 1992 murders -- one in
which he used a hammer to beat a blindfolded and bound Missouri
woman to death.
</P>
<P>
   His last words: ''Take the phone off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to a life term in New Jersey for the other
murder, of a Sussex County woman.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first execution in Missouri this year and the 42nd
since the death penalty was reinstated here in 1989. Over Hampton's
objections, a group of death penalty opponents sought clemency from
Gov. Mel Carnahan, who rejected the request late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton refused interview requests from The Associated Press in
the days leading up to the execution. But two years ago, in
response to a court's question about why he wanted to die, Hampton
said:
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm 60 years old. I've confessed. I see prisoners down in
Potosi with 15 years on the row before they finally get to the
execution chamber, and I know that I don't want to go through that.
... I don't want to spend the rest of my life and die of old age in
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton grew up in a poor family in Louisville, Ky., one of 11
children. Court records indicate he was regularly beaten by his
father, though none of his siblings went on to a life of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was sent to reform school at age 11, and spent his adult
life roaming the country, committing one crime after another.
Before the killings, he was convicted seven times and served time
in 25 prisons for crimes ranging from assault to burglary to drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is just a mean, nasty person,'' Attorney General Jay Nixon
said prior to the execution.
</P>
<P>
   During one stint in the federal prison in Marion, Ill., in the
early 1970s, Hampton befriended Gary Gilmore. Gilmore in 1976 would
become the first American to be executed after a decade-long
national ban on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Linhardt of the Missouri Catholic Conference, one of the
groups that sought clemency for Hampton, said, ''It's like he's
almost wanting to be like Gilmore.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of getting out of an Indiana prison in 1992,
Hampton and a friend, a real estate agent from St. Louis County,
devised a plan to get money from Frances Keaton. The agent had
worked with Keaton and knew that the 58-year-old hairdresser had
$30,000 in the bank. She also gave Hampton a key to Keaton's home
in Warrenton, about 50 miles west of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   So on the evening of Aug. 2, 1992, Hampton drove his car to the
parking lot of a Baptist church in Warrenton and parked it there.
Leaving a note that read, ''Car trouble. Gone for help,'' and
signed with a fake name, Hampton got a bicycle out of the trunk and
rode it the three miles to Keaton's home.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton entered with a sawed-off shotgun and demanded money.
Keaton and her fiance, Allen Mulholland, said they didn't have it
available, but Keaton said she thought she could get $10,000 from
her pastor. Hampton tied up Mulholland and warned him not to call
police, then abducted Keaton, taking her car and heading west on
Interstate 70.
</P>
<P>
   While driving, Hampton learned from a police scanner that police
had been alerted to the kidnapping. Hampton testified at his trial
that he had decided in advance to kill his hostage if police
learned of the kidnapping before he received his ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton bound and blindfolded Keaton and took her to a wooded
area of Callaway County in mid-Missouri. Once there, he killed
Keaton with several hammer blows to the head and then buried her
body. It was found about two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton drove back to Warrenton and attempted to retrieve his
car. When he saw that police were keeping it under surveillance, he
fled to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   About a month later, during another failed kidnapping, Hampton
killed 48-year-old Christine Schurman, in a barn on her property in
Wantage Township, N.J. Her body was found by her husband, Dr. Alan
Schurman. She died of a single bullet wound to the head.
</P>
<P>
   For months, police searched for Hampton. Then on Dec. 18, 1992,
the Fox television show ''America's Most Wanted'' profiled his
crimes. A day later, a pastor from West Orange, N.J., contacted
police after seeing the show. The pastor, unaware of Hampton's
crimes, had taken him in and allowed him to work as a caretaker at
the church.
</P>
<P>
   As police moved in, Hampton shot himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted in New Jersey on Sept. 30, 1994, of murdering
Mrs. Schurman, and sentenced to life.
</P>
<P>
   At his Missouri trial in 1996, neurologist Dr. Jonathan Pincus
of Georgetown University testified that the brain wound affected
Hampton's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton never showed remorse for the killings. In an interview
with St. Louis Post-Dispatch columnist Bill McClellan, he blamed
the victims, saying he shot Schurman because she struggled. In the
Missouri case, he said he warned Mulholland not to call the police.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ought to ask him if he has any remorse,'' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   After the execution, Keaton's daughter, LaVon Bowling, said she
had just one regret -- ''maybe that he didn't suffer like our mother
suffered.''

<HEADLINE> Moment of decision: Rich and poor wait to hear from colleges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE: In just a few weeks, the agonizing wait will be
over. High school seniors across the country will know whether they
got into the college of their dreams. For many high-achieving
students who live in America's privileged suburbs, the past year
has been filled with worries about whether they will get into the
''right'' school. But the anxieties are of a different sort in
grittier parts of the nation, where some youngsters are the first
in their family to ever go to college -- and they are all too aware
of the many obstacles ahead. Here's a look at the mood at two very
different high schools, one in prosperous Westchester County, N.Y.,
the other on the impoverished West Side of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   ------, 
In well-to-do New York suburb, there's the 'right' school
</P>
<P>
By JIM FITZGERALD
</P>
<P>
   CROSS RIVER, N.Y. (AP) -- Paul Goldner has a 93 average, which
ranks him in the top 10 percent at one of the nation's most
rigorous high schools. He scored an impressive 1430 on his SATs.
And he has competed with the U.S. figure skating team as an ice
dancer.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't heard yet from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of tension at the high-achieving schools of
well-to-do Westchester County this time of year, but for most of
the students, it's not a question of whether they will get into a
school.
</P>
<P>
   It's whether they will get into the right school.
</P>
<P>
   Goldner, an 18-year-old senior, has been accepted at the
prestigious University of Chicago, but Chicago is a little farther
away than he wants to go. He has applied to Amherst, Brown and
several other New England colleges, in addition to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sort of a relief to know I'm in somewhere, but I'm still
a little worried,'' he says in an interview at John Jay High School
in Cross River.
</P>
<P>
   At John Jay, about 90 percent of the graduates go to college,
compared with 67 percent nationwide. At Fox Lane High in nearby
Bedford, it's in the high 90s. Starting sophomore year, students
are bombarded with unsolicited college brochures, catalogs, videos
and phone calls. And thanks to some universities' early-acceptance
or rolling-acceptance policies, many seniors know well before the
traditional April 1 date that they have a college they can go to.
</P>
<P>
   That first fat envelope is ''the icebreaker,'' says Alexa Lynch,
a senior at Fox Lane who has been accepted at Northeastern. ''At
least you have somewhere to go, even if it's not your top choice.
If you get rejected everywhere else, you still know you're going to
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who has a 94 average, is really hoping to get into
Middlebury College in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've wanted to go to Middlebury since I was a freshman,'' she
says. ''If I don't get it, I guess I'll cry, I'll be upset, but I'm
not going to go into my room and yell, 'My life is over!'''
</P>
<P>
   Her classmate Sumei Johnson already knows the pain of rejection.
Johnson, who has also been accepted at Northeastern and is still
waiting on Boston College, found out the hard way that applying for
early admission at Penn can also mean early rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ''Penn was a crusher,'' she says. ''It was the only school I had
applied to at the time, but now I think it's going to work out
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldner says Harvard is a long shot for him, partly because
''everyone who applies there has grades like mine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If I get into Harvard, it'll be because of the ice dancing,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Christina Dagostino, a Fox Lane senior, told colleges
about how she restarted the school's Safe Rides program, which
offers a ride home from parties to anyone worried about drunken
driving. Lynch spent a month in Nicaragua, helping to build a
church and a community center. And Amanda Ingrassia, a senior at
John Jay, coached fifth-grade girls basketball -- a challenge,
because ''they want to sit and braid hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleges are looking ''for students who are going to stand out
in their schools and are going to provide different things, not
just going there to learn and get an education, but going to add to
the community,'' Dagostino says.
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester seniors seem well aware of their good fortune
compared with many others around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very guilty, sometimes,'' Goldner says. ''I know I'm
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a majority of the students come from well-to-do families,
all but one of those interviewed say costs will play some part in
their final choice. Several say their parents expect them to
contribute in some way.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want me to work this summer and pay for some of the
necessities,'' Samuel Filler says. ''They also expect me to do well
if they're going to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingrassia so far has been accepted only at the State University
of New York at Binghamton, though she is hoping for Haverford,
Cornell and the University of New Hampshire. Binghamton, which
would cost less than half of what the other schools charge, has one
thing going for it, Ingrassia says.
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents told me, if I go there they'll buy me a car,'' she
says.

<HEADLINE> Panel Mulls Doctor Bargaining Rights  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors would gain new rights to bargain
collectively with health maintenance organizations under
legislation being considered by the House Judiciary Committee.
Critics say the move could drive up costs, but supporters see it as
a way to protect patients from HMO abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation amends antitrust laws to give health care
professionals the same rights to bargain collectively as union
workers when they negotiate with health plans over fees and other
contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   The committee began work on the bill last week. A meeting
Wednesday to vote on the measure was postponed because of
scheduling problems.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., the author of the legislation, said
it would allow health care professionals to join together to fight
gag rules, limits on testing and other restrictions imposed by
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has 207 co-sponsors, nearly half the House
membership, and the backing of groups such as the American Medical
Association, the American Dental Association and the National
Association of Community Pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also faces strong opposition from a coalition of health
insurance, HMO, hospital and business groups. They contend the bill
would lead to anti-competitive practices by doctors, driving up
private health insurance premiums by more than 10 percent and
adding to the ranks of the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doctor cartels are bad medicine for patients,'' the Antitrust
Coalition for Consumer Choice in Health Care writes in ads running
in Capitol Hill publications.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office last week came out with a report
predicting employers would pass on higher health insurance premiums
to their employees and that the bill would result in nearly $11
billion in lost tax revenues over 10 years as employers reduce
taxable benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell disputed the findings and argued that his bill actually
could produce savings if doctors work to improve HMO service and
more Americans turn to HMOs, which generally offer medical service
at lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Palmisano, a New Orleans surgeon and trustee for the
American Medical Association, said there was no valid evidence the
legislation would raise health care costs. He said the main purpose
of bargaining rights would be to make physicians better advocates
for their patients and stop HMOs from imposing contract provisions
that interfere with patient-physician relationships.
</P>
<P>
   About 180 million Americans are in managed care plans that are
dedicated to turning a profit for their investors, Palmisano told
Congress recently. ''There must be a counterbalance that emphasizes
quality care. And physicians are in the best position to act as
that counterbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's bill makes clear that the new bargaining power does
not give doctors the right to strike and takes out references to
Medicare and Medicaid as subjects for bargaining. It also limits
the life of the bill to three years, so that the effects of the
bill on health care costs can be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, most of the nation's 650,000 doctors are ineligible
to join a union because they are self-employed and antitrust laws
ban collective bargaining by the self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who are employed by a hospital or municipality may
unionize. The AMA says that as of last year about 40,000 doctors
belonged to a labor organization.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 1304.

<P>
   SALEM, Mass. (AP) -- Critics of a power plant are looking for a
little star power from the real Erin Brockovich.
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich, whose battle against Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. in
California is the subject of a new Julia Roberts movie, plans to
attend an April 18 fund-raiser for opponents of the Salem plant.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go to Salem Power Plant HealthLink's efforts to
persuade Gov. Paul Cellucci to make older power plants reduce their
emissions, said group member Lynn Nadeau.
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich, a legal investigator, helped win a lawsuit against
PG&AMP;E after alleging the PG&AMP;E plant in California was making people
sick. PG&AMP;E also owns the Salem station.
</P>
<P>
   Utility spokeswoman Lisa Franklin called Brockovich's visit a
''publicity stunt'' to put more pressure on Cellucci.

<HEADLINE> Man Indicted in Spielberg Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- A grand jury has indicted a man who
allegedly claimed to be the nephew of Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Anoushirvan D. Fakhran -- aka Jonathan Taylor Spielberg --
reportedly flashed money on his high school campus, parked his BMW
and its ''SPLBERG'' vanity plate in the principal's spot and
peppered conversations with remarks about ''Uncle Steven.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, who legally changed his name in 1997, was indicted on
forgery and uttering false documents charges. He was arrested Jan.
10 after police were alerted by Steven Spielberg's security firm
that a Paul VI Catholic High School student was misrepresenting
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's ruse ended after his school absences mounted and a
school official tried to reach the family through DreamWorks. The
call was routed to Steven Spielberg's security consultants in Los
Angeles, who alerted Fairfax City police.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments were unsealed Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> FCC Reviewing Rules on Media Owners  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission is
examining rules that could lead to greater deregulation in the
media marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Commissioner Susan Ness said Wednesday that the agency's
five commissioners have received staff recommendations evaluating
several key existing media ownership rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world has changed,'' Ness told the Senate Commerce
Committee at a hearing on her nomination for a second term. ''All
broadcasters and newspapers are trying to compete in a rapidly
changing world.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the rules being reviewed is a restriction against one
company owning a broadcast station and daily newspaper in the same
market. That ban complicates Tribune Co.'s $6.3 billion acquisition
of Times Mirror, which would give it newspapers in cities where it
already operates television stations.
</P>
<P>
   But Tribune-owned stations in Los Angeles and Hartford, Conn. --
the home of Times Mirror's The Hartford Courant, are not up for
renewal until 2006. Tribune Co.'s station in New York, where Times
Mirror operates Newsday, is up for renewal in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the FCC could act to alter the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also is considering whether to modify rules that
forbid companies from owning two or more networks in certain
combinations. The merger between CBS and Viacom, with its
half-interest in the UPN television network, would trigger this
restriction. The companies have asked the commission for a two-year
waiver in the event that they complete the deal but need to shed
properties to comply with commission rules.
</P>
<P>
   If the FCC decided to ease the dual network ban, it could pave
the way for the companies to complete their deal and retain the UPN
network.
</P>
<P>
   Also under review are rules that forbid one company from owning
stations that reach more than 35 percent of U.S. households.
Networks, including NBC, have lobbied heavily to see this lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC could decide to eliminate, modify or keep as is the
media regulations already in place, but must review them by
statute.
</P>
<P>
   Ness said the FCC could strike a balance between preserving a
diversity of voices in the marketplace, while not unduly
restricting companies from competing in a changing world. She said
some of the proposals now before the commission look at the size of
markets in determining the need for restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 42.51; Nasdaq Up 162.69  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index rose today on the
strength of technology shares, but the broader stock market was
mixed as investors digested the Federal Reserve's latest boost to
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq was up 162.69 at 4,874.37.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 42.51 at 10,864.83,
having recovered from a loss of as much as 118 points, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.04 at 1,498.91.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly higher today, bouncing back from a
big decline last week.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus rose 68 3/64 to 334| after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
said its shares could reach 500. An analyst with the firm said the
company could be earning $7 to $10 a share by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 4| to 143 1/16 and Yahoo! rose 9] to 201[.
</P>
<P>
   Aclara Biosciences, which made its initial public offering of
stock Tuesday, rose 16{ to 48| in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of money left the sector last week over concerns that
valuations were just too high,'' said Barry Hyman, senior equity
analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ''But there's still a lot of
interest in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered biotechnology sector recovered today, helping
the Amex Biotechnology Index to a 9 percent gain. Human Genome
Sciences rose 17 29/64 to 109{ and Biogen rose 4 1/16 to 82 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stocks fell sharply last week amid profit-taking that
gathered steam after President Clinton said he wanted genetic data
to be openly shared.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was mixed following the Fed's latest interest
rate increase. The central bank has now raised rates five times
since last June in an effort to slow the economy to a sustainable
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's increase gave stocks an unexpected shot of strength,
helping the Dow to a 227-point gain. Rising rates are generally bad
for stocks because they cut into corporate profits. This time,
however, investors were hopeful the Fed is nearing the end of its
series of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   But today, a measure of caution had returned to the market,
Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market understands that there are still higher rates to
come, and that might prevent substantial gains in the next few
months,'' he said. Many on Wall Street expect the Fed to raise
rates one more time, at its May meeting, before holding steady in
advance of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert fell 1 15/16 to 93 9/16 after agreeing to pull
its diabetes drug Rezulin from the market. The Food and Drug
Administration said competing drugs offer the same benefits without
Rezulin's side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at
Goldman Sachs, raised her S&AMP;P 500 year-end target to 1,575 from
1,525, citing ongoing global economic expansion. Cohen also raised
her target for the Dow to 12,600 from 12,300.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues were nearly even with decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 857.10 million shares,
compared with 840.63 million at the same time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which has slumped
in recent sessions after reaching new records early this month,
rose 16.76 to 569.55.

<HEADLINE> Court Examines State Laws, US Policy  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than a decade after the South Africa
boycotts, some Supreme Court justices questioned Wednesday whether
states can refuse to buy from companies doing business in countries
known for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign trade group and the Clinton administration argued that
Massachusetts unlawfully meddled in U.S. foreign policy by limiting
state purchases from companies that do business in Myanmar, also
known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Some justices appeared to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked, ''For Massachusetts to go it
on its own when the United States is saying we want to get together
with our world neighbors'' on a Myanmar policy, ''isn't there a
clash?''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer wondered if states also could enact
purchasing policies intended to influence the actions of other
states. That could result in ''a kind of nightmare'' or ''chaos,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Massachusetts, Thomas A. Barnico, told the
justices that states have the right to withhold ''tax funds from
the indirect support of brutal regimes abroad.'' The Constitution's
framers ''knew boycotts well'' and did not bar states from taking
such actions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyer Timothy B. Dyk, arguing for the National Foreign
Trade Council, said the 1996 Massachusetts law unlawfully
interferes in U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed more limited sanctions against Myanmar later in
1996, and that bars states from trying on their own to influence
that country's government, Dyk said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Barnico contended Congress' 1996 Myanmar sanctions did
not bar states from taking their own actions.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted that a number of states
boycotted companies doing business in South Africa during the 1980s
during the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were widespread practices by states then, were they
not?'' she said. ''The very purpose of it was to change something
going on in the South African government.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyk contended those boycotts were unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Seth Waxman, supporting the foreign trade
group, said Congress actually authorized the South Africa boycott.
But he added that because Congress has adopted its own policy on
Myanmar, Massachusetts' policy amounts to interference.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia suggested that Massachusetts' law could
be considered a neutral measure that says, ''we don't buy from
anybody that violates human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Free Burma Coalition rallied outside the Supreme
Court building during the hour-long argument.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the modern-day equivalent of the Boston Tea Party,''
coalition lawyer Tom Higdon said. ''We are saying we care about
human rights and we will not have corporations or the (European
Union) dictate to us what products to buy and who can buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen city governments also have enacted some type
of trade restrictions regarding Myanmar. Some have adopted similar
limits relating to China, Cuba and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The military has ruled Myanmar, one of the world's poorest
countries, since 1962. In 1988, the military gunned down thousands
of protesters during a crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts law says most companies doing business with
Myanmar can sell goods and services to the state only by if their
bid is 10 percent lower than all other bids.
</P>
<P>
   After the trade council challenged the law in 1998, the 1st U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled it interfered with federal foreign
policy and was pre-empted by the federal government's own
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> AM-NJ--Train Survey, 1st Ld-Writethru,579  </HEADLINE>
Commuter survey gives NJ Transit good and not-so-good marks
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- As the number of rail commuters increase,
most riders say NJ Transit has done a good job with on-time
performance and station improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But commuters say more work needs to be done to add seats in
cars and communicate better with passengers during service
interruptions, according to a NJ Transit ridership survey taken
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''They gave high marks on reliability, on-time performance and
cleanliness,'' said Stan Rosenblum, deputy director of NJ Transit.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 surveys were handed out by 400 NJ Transit
volunteers and 58 to 60 percent were returned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the survey, including how it was conducted, are still
a month away but will be featured in reports to passengers in
April, Rosenblum said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, NJ Transit set ridership records with rail ridership
increasing 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Figures for the first quarter of 2000 show continued growth on
the Raritan Valley, Northeast Corridor and Midtown Direct lines.
</P>
<P>
   Transit passengers who turned in their surveys said they've seen
improvements in stations, which Rosenblum credited to NJ Transit's
Star program, which renovates stations.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters also asked for improved communication between
conductors and passengers during service interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of it is pure communication, some of it is technological
improvements like public address systems to get information to them
quicker,'' Rosenblum said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas John Bowen, president of New Jersey Association of
Railroad Passengers, said he believed the survey results were
fairly accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mostly NJ Transit is being pretty straightforward,'' Bowen
said. ''Transit is trying to deliver its message that people are
riding for positive reasons other than high gas prices.''
</P>
<P>
   However, association officials have accused transit officials of
inflating the amount of time a train needs to make its trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always squabble about what is on-time performance. We get
into the issue of padding the schedule,'' Bowen said. ''If it takes
10 minutes in between stations in the schedule and in reality in
takes two minutes, you're fudging the definition,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen acknowledged that crowded rail cars are a sign of NJ
Transit's successful growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are problems of success and these are the problems we
like to have,'' Bowen said. ''There was a time where just the
Northeast Corridor was crowded. Now, everyone's crowded. It's a
legitimate problem.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- State-run schools can subsidize campus groups
with money collected from mandatory student activities fees without
violating the rights of students who find some of those groups
objectionable, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The justices unanimously upheld the University of Wisconsin's
student-fee system after finding the school does not pick and
choose which student groups to fund based on the views they
espouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''The First Amendment permits a public university to charge its
students an activity fee used to fund a program to facilitate
extracurricular student speech if the program is viewpoint
neutral,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment protects free-speech rights, and the mandatory
fees had been challenged by students who said their rights were
violated by forcing them to contribute to groups they oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Had the justices ruled the other way, public colleges and
universities across America would have had to stop giving money to
controversial student groups or figure out some way to give partial
refunds to those students who wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal groups praised the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''College and university campuses have a long tradition of
providing a forum where many voices can be heard,'' said Ralph Neas
of People for the American Way.
</P>
<P>
   But conservative groups said the decision shortchanged some
students.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court accorded little value to a student's right not to be
compelled to speak,'' said Liberty Counsel's Matthew Staver. ''This
decision takes away the rights of the objectors.''
</P>
<P>
   The court previously had allowed members of labor unions and bar
associations to opt out of paying mandatory dues that might
subsidize political advocacy. But Wednesday's ruling drew a
distinction by emphasizing what Kennedy called ''the important and
substantial purposes of the university, which seeks to facilitate a
wide range of speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The court had split 5-4 when ruling five years ago that public
universities and colleges cannot create a ''public forum'' for
students by supplying subsidies and then refuse to fund some groups
because of their viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 decision, involving a campus religious group at the
University of Virginia, divided the court along its ideological
fault line. That gap was not in evidence Wednesday, surprising
liberal and conservative advocates alike.
</P>
<P>
   When Wisconsin's student-fees system was challenged in 1996,
about $15 of the $166.75 that students paid in fees each semester
was earmarked for distribution to campus groups by the student
government. For a school with some 38,000 students, that created a
total fund each semester of about $570,000.
</P>
<P>
   Several law students with conservative political views objected
to having some of their money funneled to liberal organizations.
Their lawsuit identified as objectionable 18 of the 125 subsidized
campus groups, including the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender
Center and International Socialist Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Southworth, the lead plaintiff and now an attorney, said
in a recent interview: ''As a conservative and a Christian, it was
frustrating to see the money going to organizations I personally
disagree with.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge and a federal appeals court ruled against the
university, but the nation's highest court said they were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision preserves minority viewpoints because without
it, the ability of student groups to organize on campus would have
depended on how popular they are,'' said Matthew Coles of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been an organized attempt by conservatives around
the country to defund groups they oppose, and lesbian and gay
student groups always have been among their targets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the importance of a school's viewpoint neutrality,
the court refused to uphold an aspect of the Wisconsin fee system
that appeared to allow defunding of a campus group based on a
majority vote of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said allowing a majority vote of students to cancel
out a university's neutrality toward student groups' views would be
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling will not affect private schools because the
Constitution protects people against government actions only.

<HEADLINE> Exports News Helps Grain, Soybeans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices drifted higher Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade, supported by a bullish combination
of export and weather news.
</P>
<P>
   Corn ended a two-day fall from year highs as investors decided
that a selling spree had been overdone.
</P>
<P>
   The price rise was supported by the announcement in Washington
that China has eased rules that have limited imports of U.S. farm
products. The Chinese agreed a year ago to allow the importation of
certain U.S. commodities, but didn't put the changes into motion
with the necessary regulations until late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat also jumped higher late in the session on the trade news,
which should help sales of U.S. wheat to China.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans were supported by a private forecast calling for normal
to below-normal rainfall in the soybean belt over the next eight to
14 days.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery rose 1{ cent to $2.61} a bushel; May corn
rose 2{ cents to $2.34{ a bushel; May oats rose 1\ cent to $1.22 a

<HEADLINE> Richardson Predicts OPEC Consensus  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who is in
the midst of talks with OPEC nations, on Wednesday said he was
confident that the oil cartel will act to cut soaring prices next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets Monday
in Vienna, Austria, and Richardson now believes that most of its 11
members support increasing supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ''One month ago, most said that an increase in oil supply was
not needed,'' Richardson told reporters in Paris. ''Today, most say
that there is a need to increase output.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to specify how much additional supply he was
pressing for, but noted that there is an estimated 2 million
barrel-a-day shortfall, with global consumption running at 75
million barrels a day and production at 73 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Oil exporters inside and outside of OPEC cut production in 1998
and 1999 to boost prices that fell to a 12-year low. As a result,
the price for a barrel of crude went from $10.72 a barrel on Dec.
10, 1998, to a 9-year high of more than $34 earlier this month. It
has since settled at about $28 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans are finding it difficult to cover sharply higher
heating oil and gasoline prices. Western governments, fearful that
higher oil prices will cause inflation and slow economic growth,
have urged OPEC to raise output to bring prices down.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is holding a grueling schedule of meetings with
oil-producing nations.
</P>
<P>
   He has met with representatives from all OPEC countries, apart
from Iraq, Iran and Libya, with whom the United States has no
diplomatic ties. He also has seen officials in non-OPEC
oil-producing countries Mexico and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the energy secretary pleaded his case to Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo. On Wednesday, he met with Algerian
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Both Nigeria and Algeria are OPEC
members.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who spoke with reporters after meeting the 25
country ambassadors of the International Energy Agency, was to
travel to Norway on Thursday. Norway, which is not an OPEC member,
has cooperated with the cartel in reducing production to raise
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson insisted that his lobbying has been productive.
</P>
<P>
   ''American diplomatic efforts have made a difference,'' he said.
''There is agreement that prices are too high and that there needs
to be an equilibrium.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson added that in OPEC countries, ''there is a
recognition that current prices could threaten world economic
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   If OPEC doesn't cut prices, Richardson said that the U.S.
government would ''reserve'' the option of tapping its emergency
oil supplies.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 40.64; Nasdaq Up 152.71  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks reclaimed their leadership of
the stock market today, driving the Nasdaq composite index higher
as investors bought shares of chip makers, Internet companies and
beaten-down biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Nasdaq rose 152.71 to
close at 4,864.39.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 40.64 at 10,866.70,
having recovered from a loss of as much as 118 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 closed at a new record.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Nasdaq hit its last record on March 10, it has fallen
4 percent while the Dow Jones industrials have advanced more than 9
percent. The Nasdaq tumbled as investors eager to take profits from
its run channeled money into the blue-chip Dow.
</P>
<P>
   But robust performances by technology shares Tuesday and today
convinced Wall Street analysts that investors aren't quite ready to
give up the promise of high-growth stocks for the stability of blue
chips.
</P>
<P>
   ''While money managers can make a growth-to-value exchange
within their portfolios, the public must follow their lead to make
it a trend,'' said Gail Dudack, chief investment strategist at
Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus rose after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said its shares
could reach 500. An analyst with the firm said the company could be
earning $7 to $10 a share by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Intel and Yahoo! advanced. Aclara Biosciences, which made its
initial public offering of stock Tuesday, rose in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of money left the sector last week over concerns that
valuations were just too high,'' said Barry Hyman, senior equity
analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ''But there's still a lot of
interest in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered biotechnology sector recovered today, helping
the Amex Biotechnology Index to a 9 percent gain. Human Genome
Sciences and Biogen rose.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stocks fell sharply last week amid profit-taking that
gathered steam after President Clinton said he wanted genetic data
to be openly shared.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was mixed following the Fed's latest interest
rate increase. The central bank has now raised rates five times
since last June in an effort to slow the economy to a sustainable
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's increase gave stocks an unexpected shot of strength,
helping the Dow to a 227-point gain. Rising rates are generally bad
for stocks because they cut into corporate profits. This time,
however, investors were hopeful the Fed is nearing the end of its
series of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   But today, a measure of caution had returned to the market,
Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market understands that there are still higher rates to
come, and that might prevent substantial gains in the next few
months,'' he said. Many on Wall Street expect the Fed to raise
rates one more time, at its May meeting, before holding steady in
advance of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert fell after agreeing to pull its diabetes drug
Rezulin from the market. The Food and Drug Administration said
competing drugs offer the same benefits without Rezulin's side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at
Goldman Sachs, raised her S&AMP;P 500 year-end target to 1,575 from
1,525, citing ongoing global economic expansion. Cohen also raised
her target for the Dow to 12,600 from 12,300.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jets Strike in S. Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli jets struck guerrilla hideouts in
southern Lebanon on Wednesday, while their allied militiamen
exchanged mortar and rocket fire with guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The airstrikes and exchanges followed a morning roadside bombing
that Lebanese security officials said wounded two militiamen. Two
civilians and an off-duty Lebanese soldier were injured in the
militia shelling, the officials said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Israeli security sources said dozens of Katyusha
rockets and mortars had fallen on both sides of the border. The
military said there were no casualties or damage on the Israeli
side.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ground and air action occurred in the central sector
of the front line, where Israeli warplanes flew three sorties over
suspected guerrilla hideouts at Wadi Qaissiyeh, Lebanese security
officials said. There were no reports of injuries or damage from
the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, militiamen from the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army were on a routine patrol near the village of Kfar
Tibnit when Hezbollah guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb, the
Lebanese officials said. One militiaman was seriously wounded and
evacuated to Israel, while another suffered moderate injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, militiamen closed the Kfar Tibnit crossing, one of
several checkpoints linking the occupied area with the rest of
Lebanon. They also responded with artillery and machine gun fire,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The off-duty Lebanese soldier was struck in his home in Kfar
Tibnit village, suffering shrapnel wounds to the face from militia
fire, the officials said. Two civilians were also injured, one
seriously with shrapnel wounds to the head, in Kfar Tibnit, which
is about six miles north of the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli military and Hezbollah each accused the other of
violating 1996 guidelines agreed by all sides to protect civilians
from the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust 1,500 Israeli soldiers
and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the border zone held by Israel since
1985. Israel, which has said the zone is necessary to guard against
cross-border guerrilla attacks, has promised to would withdraw its
troops by July.

<HEADLINE> Nagorno-Karabakh Leader Wounded  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) -- Gunmen ambushed the president of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a separatist Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan,
seriously wounding him, his driver and a bodyguard on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The enclave's Interior Ministry said 28 suspects were arrested
in the attack on Arkady Gukasyan. Among them was the enclave's
former defense minister, Samvel Babyan, who was fired in December
after a dispute with the president. Babyan's brother, Karen, mayor
of the enclave's capital Stepanakert, also was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen opened fire at the car carrying Gukasyan through
Stepanakert shortly after midnight, a statement from the
Nagorno-Karabakh government said.
</P>
<P>
   Gukasyan was wounded in the legs and underwent surgery, and his
life didn't appear to be in immediate danger, a spokesman in the
enclave said. He said the driver was hit in the head and chest,
while the bodyguard was wounded in the spine.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia's health and social services minister, Ararat Mkrtchian,
said Armenian medical personnel flew to Stepanakert and were trying
to evacuate Gukasyan to Armenia's capital, Yerevan. He
characterized Gukasyan's wounds as moderately serious.
</P>
<P>
   Armenian President Robert Kocharian condemned the attack and
offered to help investigate, the Russian news agency Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that the people responsible for the terrorist attack
will be identified in the near future. They will face trial in
keeping with strict law,'' Interfax quoted Kocharian as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence from Azerbaijan in 1988,
igniting a war in which an estimated 15,000 people were killed and
about 1 million driven from their homes. The separatists, with help
from Armenia, eventually drove out Azerbaijani troops.
</P>
<P>
   A truce signed in 1994 ended the war, but tensions have
continued and clashes erupt sporadically.

<HEADLINE> Australia Demands NRA Retraction  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian officials accused the
National Rifle Association of misrepresenting the country's crime
statistics, and demanded Wednesday that the group pull a video on
Australian gun crimes off its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The video, presented as a TV news story, claims that Australia's
gun reform laws backfired and says gun-related crime rates rose
after the country banned semiautomatic rifles, semiautomatic
shotguns and pump-action shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   But Australia's Federal Attorney General Daryl Williams said the
NRA used inaccurate statistics, and urged the group to remove ''any
reference to Australia'' from its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it quite offensive that the NRA is using the very
successful gun reform laws introduced in 1996 as the basis for
promoting ownership of firearms in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA did not respond to attempts to get comment.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's gun-related homicide rate was 0.28 per 100,000
people in 1998, compared to 4 per 100,000 in the United States,
Williams wrote in letter sent Wednesday to NRA President Charlton
Heston.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many things that Australia can learn from the United
States,'' he wrote. ''How to manage firearm ownership is not one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia adopted the gun laws after an April 1996 rampage by
Martin Bryant, who opened fire with military-style rifles at the
Port Arthur historic site in Melbourne. Bryant, who killed 35
people and injured 19, is serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   South Australia's Attorney General Trevor Griffin -- who is seen
in the video talking about crime -- said he was not interviewed by
the NRA, and that a quote from him was taken from a previous
interview and used out of context.
</P>
<P>
   The video says that, after gun laws took effect, armed robbery
in Australia went up 69 percent, assaults involving guns rose 28
percent, gun murders increased 19 percent, and home invasions rose
21 percent. It does not give a source for the data.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Adam Graycar, director of the Australian Institute of
Criminology, said the statistics were misleading. The latest annual
crime figures, for 1998, showed that assaults had increased, but
that most did not involve guns, he said. Homicides decreased, and
were only rarely committed with guns, he told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.

<HEADLINE> German Co. Buys Formula One Stake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- A fast-growing German media group, EM.TV
and Merchandising is buying 50 percent of the holding company that
runs Formula One racing in a cash and share deal worth about $1.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   EM.TV, which made headlines last month when it purchased the Jim
Henson Co., said Wednesday it was in talks to acquire a further
stake in SLEC Holding, which owns the Formula One Administration,
within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition consists of a cash component of $712.5 million
and a stock component of about 10 million shares, EM.TV said.
EM.TV's share price on the Frankfurt-based Neue Markt was 90.30
euros ($88), down 5.30 euros.
</P>
<P>
   EM.TV bought 50 percent of SLEC Holding by buying out Speed
Investment Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Grenfell Private Equity, the investment arm of Deutsche
Bank, and Hellman and Friedman, a U.S. investment firm, had owned
Speed Investment. The latter had a 37.5 percent stake in SLEC, the
former 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The other 50 percent of SLEC will remain in the hands of the
family of Bernie Ecclestone, the principal administrator of Formula
One.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement certainly represents the single most important
deal in our company's history -- it means we will, through Formula
One, be involved in the marketing of one of the most interesting
and lucrative sports entertainment events in the world,'' EM.TV
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our know-how will help to exploit Formula One in the brand
development segment and on the Internet,'' the company added.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Abolish INS  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service
would be abolished under legislation approved Wednesday by a House
subcommittee. In its place, two separate bureaus would enforce the
nation's immigration laws and dole out benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The INS is broken and must be fixed,'' said GOP Rep. Lamar
Smith of Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
immigration and claims. ''The agency moves from one crisis to the
next, with no strategy on how to accomplish its missions
successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee, on a 4-3 party-line vote, approved the
restructuring measure by Smith and Reps. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., and
Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, neither of whom is on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The bill does not appear to be going anywhere in the Senate, one
subcommittee Democrat predicted. ''This is not going to become
law,'' said Rep. Howard Berman of California. ''This is not going
to pass the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, immigrant-rights advocates say GOP Sen. Spencer Abraham of
Michigan, chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on
immigration, has privately assured them that he has no intention of
taking up INS restructuring this year. A spokesman for the senator,
Joe Davis, said restructuring does remain a priority for Abraham,
who intends to move ahead with his own legislation later this year.
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread consensus, within and outside the INS, that
reform is needed. The agency has struggled to meet its mandate
because of internal divisions, outmoded technology and management
missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the House legislation say separating the INS'
sometimes competing missions is necessary to improve enforcement
and the delivery of immigration benefits such as citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans deserve better than Barnum and Bailey at the
border,'' Rogers, a persistent INS critic who is chairman of the
House Appropriations subcommittee that funds the agency, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would create separate bureaus of immigration
enforcement and services within the Justice Department, headed by
separate directors and funded by distinct budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend the plan will create new problems because it
does not allow for one manager to oversee both bureaus, whose
functions will overlap at certain points. They also worry that the
services bureau would be financially starved while the enforcement
operation, which has proved far more popular with congressional
appropriators, would be flush.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation fails to create a proper balance between
enforcement and services and does not provide an effective way to
direct, coordinate and integrate enforcement and service
functions,'' Assistant Attorney General Robert Raben wrote Smith in
a letter dated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and congressional Democrats are pushing a
rival plan, rejected Wednesday by the subcommittee, that would
establish an associate attorney general position to oversee the
enforcement and services operations.
</P>
<P>
   Just four months ago, the subcommittee approved a restructuring
bill that addressed some of the administration's concerns. But amid
Republican complaints that the administration had no intention of
restructuring the INS, Smith abandoned it.
</P>
<P>
   Smith accused the administration of ''dishonest negotiation'' --
a charge rejected by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither the administration nor Democrats on the subcommittee
have decided to back away from meaningful reform,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>

</P>

   EDITOR'S NOTE: The INS restructuring bill is H.R. 3918.

<HEADLINE> Incident Mars Pope Palestinian Visit  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DHEISHEH REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank (AP) -- A day of pride for
Yasser Arafat and encouragement for Palestinian aspirations ended
in a flurry of violence Wednesday, as hundreds of residents hurled
stones at security forces after Pope John Paul II left this dusty
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The melee was a show of dissatisfaction with Arafat's leadership
and the slow pace of peace with Israel. It marred an otherwise
festive occasion for the Palestinians, who heard the pope give
moral weight to their statehood claims as the world watched.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after the pope left Dheisheh, the volatility and
frustration of life here reared its head. Witnesses said police
trying to push back curious onlookers beat several of them with
clubs. In response, an angry crowd hurled stones at police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   In a battle that lasted for more than 15 minutes, police pushed
the protesters back, but then retreated under a hail of rocks. No
serious injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ates Faraj, a Dheisheh resident who was involved in the clash,
said it grew out of frustration with the governing Palestinian
Authority, led by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an expression of a deep feeling of frustration that
has been built up over the years because of the behavior of the
PA,'' said Faraj, 22, a casino worker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only because of the peace process,'' he said, referring to
what he saw as the disappointing state of negotiations with Israel,
''but also because of its maltreatment of the people in the camps.
The PA does not afford us the respect we deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees like those at Dheisheh, a shantytown of some 10,000
refugees from the 1948 war, feel the Palestinian leadership does
not invest enough resources in the camps. They complain of nepotism
and widespread corruption. They also fear the peace process will
not address their demand to return to the homes they were forced to
flee a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Following the scuffle, hundreds of camp residents gathered for a
protest march through the streets of Dheisheh. Three Palestinian
cameramen were detained by security forces and later released, and
their tapes of the incident were confiscated. The streets of the
camp remained littered with rocks Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit to Dheisheh began on a high-spirited note.
Hours before his arrival, residents thronged the main road outside,
watching a dance troupe perform traditional folk dances. Children
scampered through the crowd, wearing white T-shirts emblazoned with
the English words: ''We Have a Dream.'' Under that, in Arabic:
''The Right to Return is Sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight-year-old Mohammed Ahmed dutifully repeated what he had
been told by his elders about the pope's visit: ''He's going to
tell us we can all return to our homes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shaker Salim, 86, his skin brown and wrinkled from the sun,
tightened his black caftan and shook his head sadly. ''There will
be no benefits from this trip,'' he said. ''Muslims and Christians
have been saying for 50 years that we should be able to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that it will only happen when Allah wills it,'' said
Shaker, who has 30 grandchildren in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the courtyard of the boys' school, an eager,
invitation-only crowd of several hundred awaited. But the yard was
hardly full; tight security kept most of the refugees outside.
</P>
<P>
   A row of 19 elderly men wearing checked kaffiyehs, the
traditional Arab headdress, and long caftans trimmed with gold
thread sat on a curb, fingering carved wooden canes. They'd been
invited from other refugee camps to take part in the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I very much hope this visit will help us,'' said Hassan el
Jibri, 63, from the nearby El Aroub camp. ''We want the pope to
send a message to the world that we have been suffering too long.''
</P>
<P>
   When the pope finally arrived, holding Arafat's hand for balance
as he slowly made his way to the podium, he stopped short of
explicitly endorsing a Palestinian right of return. Nonetheless,
many heard the words they were hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   ''I greet each one of you and I hope and pray that my visit will
bring some comfort in your difficult situation,'' he said. ''Please
God it will help to draw attention to your continuing plight.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I plead with all who are sincerely working for justice and
peace not to lose heart,'' he said, raising his voice for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   As the pontiff finished, a beaming Arafat raised his arms in
vigorous applause.

<HEADLINE> Prisoner Loses Rosary Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A murderer failed to show his religious rights
were violated by prison guards who seized his rosary beads out of
concern the beads might be a sign of gang activity, the state's
highest court ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court ruled that Peter Kane, who had white
and black beads on his rosary, had been offered an all-black set of
beads at a prison worship service.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plaintiff offers no reason why he could not use the black
rosary beads that were offered to him at each religious service,''
the court said of Kane, who is a Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Kane's black-and-white rosary was confiscated during a shakedown
of his cell at the state prison in Shirley in July 1997. He had
used the beads since a prison chaplain gave them to him in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said they had to ban multicolored beads because
they were concerned that such beads could be used by gang members
to identify each other.
</P>
<P>
   Kane was convicted in the May 1980 murder of one of the sons of
his live-in girlfriend.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Criminal: I Opposed Nazis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILNIUS, Lithuania -- A former Lithuanian policeman considered by
Jewish groups one of the most significant living Nazi war criminals
claims in his memoirs that he actively backed the anti-Nazi
resistance and tried to foil the massacres of Jews, news reports
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 92-year-old Aleksandras Lileikis has been charged with
genocide for sending scores of Jews to their deaths during the
1941-44 occupation.
</P>
<P>
   But in his recently published memoirs -- titled In the Traces of
the Awakening Time -- he said he used his position as chief of the
notorious Vilnius security police to gather intelligence on
occupying Nazi forces on behalf of the resistance, the Baltic News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the country's 5,000-strong Jewish community dismissed
the claims and said Lileikis should face trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should crawl to a court and plead his innocence there,
instead of justifying himself with such a book,'' said Simonas
Alperavicius, chairman of the Jewish Community of Lithuania. ''He
should repent, because he's old, and he doesn't have much time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis was put on trial in 1998 in the first Nazi trial to
begin in a former Soviet republic. But the proceedings were
repeatedly delayed and finally halted on the grounds that the
defendant was too ill to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
   New laws allowing for trials in absentia, however, have opened
the way for the proceedings to begin again. Appellate judges this
week sent the case back to a lower court for a ruling on whether
the trial should resume.
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis said the resistance told him ''to keep contact with
state institutions, get information and give it to underground
leaders so they could ... organize activities better, and
distribute anti-Nazi underground press,'' the agency quoted him as
writing.
</P>
<P>
   He also insisted that he ordered his men not to take part in
Nazi atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nazis began forcing Jews into an old town ghetto to
prepare them for mass execution, Lileikis said he told his
subordinates ''to keep their hands off the dirty action,'' Lileikis
wrote, according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
   After regaining independence from Moscow in 1991, Lithuania
vowed to prosecute and convict Lithuanians who participated in the
massacre of some 240,000 Jews during Nazi rule. But so far not a
single trial has gotten successfully underway.

<HEADLINE> SEC Commissioner Johnson To Leave  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Norman S. Johnson, a member of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, will leave his position this summer, the
SEC announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Johnson, a Republican who was appointed by
President Clinton, leaves a vacancy on the five-member commission,
which regulates securities markets, mutual funds and investment
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 69, plans to return to Utah, his home state. Although
his four-year term expired last June, he could have stayed in
office until the end of Congress' current term.
</P>
<P>
   ''Norman Johnson has served the commission and America's
investors with great diligence, commitment and distinction,'' SEC
Chairman Arthur Levitt said in a statement. ''I will miss Norman as
a friend and colleague. His contributions to our varied policy
discussions over the years have been insightful and invaluable.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his appointment, Johnson had a 30-year career as a
securities attorney in private practice in Salt Lake City.

<HEADLINE> Sen.: Taiwan Leader Should Visit US  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If Taiwan's president-elect, Chen Shui-bian,
wants to visit the United States, there's probably no time like the
present, Sen. Frank Murkowski said Wednesday -- acknowledging a
similar trip five years ago enraged mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   ''I recognize it could cause a few ripples,'' the Alaska
Republican said. But he predicted a visit at this point would cause
less trouble than if Chen came after his inauguration in May.
</P>
<P>
   China canceled several official delegations to the United
States, postponed talks on technology sales and summoned the U.S.
ambassador in Beijing in 1995, when current Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui was allowed to visit for a class reunion at Cornell
University.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan split in 1949 when the communists took over the
mainland and Beijing maintains that the island is a province. Lee's
visit was the first by a Taiwan leader to the United States since
Washington and Beijing established diplomatic relations in 1979
under an agreement that downgraded Taiwan's diplomatic status.
</P>
<P>
   In an unsuccessful attempt to cool China's fury in 1995, the
Clinton administration assured China beforehand that Lee's visit to
New York would be handled in a manner that would make it clear it
was private and unofficial.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference Wednesday, Murkowski suggested the same
argument could be used for Chen, if he comes before he takes office
in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gentleman has not been inaugurated so he doesn't come as
head of state or head of the province,'' Murkowski said at Capitol
Hill news conference on a number of Taiwan-China issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's (a visit) quite appropriate and I would support
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1995 passed a resolution supporting Lee's visit,
prompting the Clinton administration to issue him a visa. Murkowski
was one of three senators who met Lee's plane in New York to
welcome him to the United States.

<HEADLINE> McCain Shows GOP Loyalty on Hill  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Juggling party loyalty with political
independence, Sen. John McCain promised House Republicans on
Wednesday he will campaign vigorously for them, then prodded former
GOP rival George W. Bush to support federal regulation of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the governor will take that position,'' he said in an
Associated Press interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who defeated McCain to lock up the Republican presidential
nomination, has declined to say whether he favors federal
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview in his Senate office, McCain said he intends to
board his campaign bus, the Straight Talk Express, one more time,
and ride it this summer from the Capitol to his party's national
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   He said he underwent a ''10-to-12 hour period of depression''
the night of Super Tuesday when he realized his campaign was over.
He lay awake for hours, he said, not because he lost, but because
''the ride was over.'' He said he was proud of the reform-based
campaign he ran, conceded some mistakes but defended one of his
most controversial acts, a speech strongly criticizing Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell in the days before the Virginia
primary.
</P>
<P>
   The speech ''needed to be given,'' he said. ''It would not have
been fair for me to have won the primary and then'' made the
comments, which many Republicans say triggered a backlash among
cultural conservatives that cost McCain dearly at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been grudging in his praise of Bush since returning
to Washington this week, although he has frequently said he will
support the nominee of his party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect the verdict of the voters,'' he said. ''I respect
Governor Bush, but I have to say in the interests of straight talk
I would not have run the campaign he ran under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bush lost the New Hampshire primary, he sharply attacked
McCain in the weeks that followed, relying on surrogates in South
Carolina and elsewhere as well as his own campaign television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, with his campaign over, has sought to re-enter the
Senate this week as a loyal Republican committed to maintaining the
GOP majority. At the same time, he has repeated his determination
to press the ''reform agenda'' that helped fuel his rise in the
presidential race and frequently brought him into conflict with his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   On tobacco, McCain said he will support an effort to pass
legislation this year giving the Food and Drug Administration
jurisdiction. The Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday the agency
currently lacks such power, a 5-4 opinion that renewed interest in
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we could pass a bill that would give the FDA the
authority,'' he said. He added, though, that ''when I see the huge
influence of the tobacco companies -- the Republican Party took $7
million from the tobacco companies -- then obviously I'm
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments put him at odds with Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, who opposes expanding the FDA's authority, and also
served as a challenge to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor sidestepped the question of FDA jurisdiction
in a statement issued on Tuesday, and again on Wednesday. ''He
believes that Congress should pass tough laws to keep tobacco out
of the hands of kids similar to strict anti-teen smoking laws he
advocated and signed in Texas,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain was parting company with his party on one issue, he
signaled his loyalty on another. In a closed-door meeting with
House Republicans, he promised to campaign for GOP candidates
without imposing conditions such as support for his key issue of
campaign finance legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may be Republican candidates that I campaign for who may
not totally agree with me on some issues of reform. Those are far
better people for me to deal with than Democrats on a broad variety
of issues because at least I share the same philosophy with these
Republican candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as McCain met with Republicans, Democrats sought to exploit
the issue. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., who chairs his party's
campaign committee, said McCain has put himself in an awkward
position of supporting lawmakers who oppose his bill. ''House
Republicans are controlled by the wealthy special interests -- and
not even the Straight Talk Express can get them back on track,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was warmly received by the House rank and file -- a
contrast to the derision that many Republican have heaped on his
call for a ban on campaign ''soft money.'' According to several
Republicans, one lawmaker who faces a tough race, Rep. Brian
Bilbray, publicly asked McCain to campaign on his behalf in his
district in California.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Rogan, another Californian who faces a strong
challenge, urged McCain to join the GOP ticket as vice presidential
running mate this fall, these Republicans added.
</P>
<P>
   In comments to fellow lawmakers, McCain demurred about joining
the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, he dismissed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he might ever run again for the White House, he
said he doubted it.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never rule anything out in life, except the vice
presidency,'' he laughed.

<HEADLINE> Analyst: Castro Remains Anti-U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Memo to the next U.S. president: Don't count
on Fidel Castro's advancing age to mellow his hatred of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Latell, who served as chief Cuba analyst for the Central
Intelligence Agency until several years ago, offered that advice
Wednesday as he talked about the Cuban leader at a gathering of
Cuba experts on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Latell said the next president should not be naive about
Castro's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not going to move an inch,'' Latell said of Castro, who
turns 74 this year. ''There will be no free press, and no
dissidents will be allowed to run for the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his soul, in his core he despises the U.S.,'' Latell said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the U.S. embargo against Cuba, Latell said Castro would
like to see key parts lifted but not if it means making political
concessions to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said that although Cuba has been weakened significantly since
the collapse of the Soviet Union, Castro still retains the option
of allowing another mass exodus of boat people as a means of
inflicting pain on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can unload another sea borne migration at almost any
moment, whenever he decides it is opportune for him,'' Latell said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the State Department took notice after an article in
the Communist Party newspaper Granma hinted that a new boat lift
was possible in response to Cuban complaints about U.S. immigration
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials subsequently warned Cuban diplomats against
any such action. Later, Cuban officials in Havana denied that a
mass migration was in the works although it is not clear whether
the denial was triggered by the U.S. warning.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30,000 Cubans fled the island in 1994, mostly in makeshift
rafts. An exodus in 1980 brought more than 125,000 Cubans to U.S.
shores, including many who were either violent criminals of
suffered from mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Latell predicted an outbreak of violence in Cuba once Castro
dies or is forced from office because of frustrations built up
among many in Cuba over the past 41 years.
</P>
<P>
   There is uncertainty over the short-term direction in Cuba once
Castro leaves the scene because the question of whether the Cuban
armed forces will remain unified is impossible to answer at this
point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Latell also raised the possiblity of Castro achieving martyrdom
by dying in a ''terrible blaze of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, Latell said there will be at least one
positive outcome in Cuba once the transition takes place: ''The
obsessive anti-Americanism of Fidel Castro will disappear.''

<HEADLINE> Mercantile Exchange Overhauled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's
third-largest futures market, disclosed a shake-up in its
management Wednesday and said it was part of preparations for
becoming a public company.
</P>
<P>
   Nine managing directors will now report to Jim McNulty, who took
over last month as president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Five current Merc executives were named managing directors, and
two specialists -- Satish Nandapurkar and Lewis Ting -- were hired
from outside for two of the posts. The other two positions have not
yet been filled, the exchange said.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange unveiled a demutualization plan in November to
transform the member-owned institution into a for-profit,
shareholder-owned corporation. The plan still needs approval from
the Securities and Exchange Commission and Merc members.
</P>
<P>
   ''These changes will enable us to adopt an intense customer
focus, enhance employee development and training opportunities,
achieve the highest standards of excellence in the technology and
systems area, and adopt a shareholder-value metric system that will
guide our decision-making in the future,'' McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   The Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, long the leaders in
futures trading, were both surpassed in volume last year by the
all-electronic Eurex exchange of Frankfurt, Germany. Both are under
pressure to de-emphasize the traditional ''open outcry'' method of
trading in favor of more -- if not total-- electronic trading.

<HEADLINE> Study: Holiday Weight Gain Not Bad  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans pack on fewer pounds over the winter holidays than
commonly believed. But the weight tends to add up over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Popular wisdom holds that most people gain five to 10 pounds
from Thanksgiving to New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   However, researchers at the National Institutes of Health found
the 195 volunteers they studied -- all of whom worked at or lived
near its Bethesda, Md., campus -- gained an average of only 1.05
pounds from September 1998 through March 1999. Most of that gain,
or 0.8 pounds, happened between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 percent of the subjects gained five pounds or more
over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Factors such as the number of holiday parties attended had
little effect. Lack of activity during the winter played a bigger
role.
</P>
<P>
   By the following September, the 165 volunteers who continued in
the study were an average of 1.4 pounds heavier than a year
earlier, indicating that rather than taking off their holiday
weight during the warmer months, they added a bit more.
</P>
<P>
   The research was reported in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity can contribute to heart disease, diabetes and other
serious health problems. According to the government, 55 percent of
Americans are considered overweight and 22 percent are obese.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Investment Firm Investigated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- A trustee has been appointed to find as
much as $35 million missing from a defunct Orange County investment
firm managed by two ex-convicts who allegedly lured clients,
including two former Los Angeles Rams players, with promises of big
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas H. Casey was appointed Tuesday by a federal judge at the
request of investors, including former football players Eric
Dickerson and Duval Love, who lost nearly $1 million with
Irvine-based DFJ Italia.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no evidence that the money was ever placed in
suitable or appropriate investments,'' Steve Katzman, the group's
attorney, said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court claim that DFJ lured
investors, including sports and Hollywood stars, by boasting the
firm had ties to Italian royalty and connections to the European
economic community.
</P>
<P>
   But documents show the two men who founded DFJ, Luigi DiFonzo
and Angelo Ales, were convicted felons who met while cellmates in a
federal prison. DiFonzo was convicted in 1989 of stealing $110,000
from a Minnesota widow and Ales served time for securities theft.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators had been looking into DFJ for months amid
accusations the firm ran a pyramid scheme that paid off old
investors with money from new ones.
</P>
<P>
   A group of five investors filed claims Monday to force the
company into Chapter 7 bankruptcy. On Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge John E. Ryan approved their request to appoint a trustee to
take control of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ales was arrested Monday for an alleged parole violation.
DiFonzo's whereabouts were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, a Costa Mesa bankruptcy attorney, said he would seize
DFJ's bank accounts, financial records and office property.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 700 investors, lured with promises of 24 percent
returns and a star-studded client list, were notified last week by
the company their money might be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality of it hasn't really set in,'' said Ken Meyers, who
lost $35,000 in the alleged scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were originally told DFJ had billions of dollars in
assets and a stake in an Italian royal family trust. But
investigators say the royalty turned out to be DiFonzo, who claimed
to be a descendent of a Sicilian royal family.
</P>
<P>
   Love, a former Los Angeles Rams lineman, said in a sworn
declaration he was introduced to a DFJ salesman in 1998 by another
football player. Love agreed not only to invest $8,200, but also
work as a part-time salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Among his clients were a schoolteacher and a retired custodian
who invested $164,000.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Love said he became aware the operation was
fraudulent in January when he tried to retrieve his clients money.

   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- A Spanish Air Force plane crashed Wednesday
night in bad weather and burst into flames, killing all seven
people aboard, the Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-built, twin-engine Aviocar plane went down in a
rural area of Guadalajara province in central Spain. The cause of
the crash was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   The Aviocar C-212 is a small turboprop plane used by Spanish
military intelligence for photographic reconnaissance and other
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second crash involving a Spanish military plane in
less than 10 days. On March 13, two F-18 fighter jets collided in
midair during night training near Zaragoza, leaving one pilot dead
and the other injured.

<HEADLINE> HMOs Cut Costs With Chopped Pills  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an effort to cut costs, three big HMOs are
asking people who take antidepressant medicines to buy higher-dose
pills and then chop them in half.
</P>
<P>
   Larger pills cost about the same as smaller ones, but some
pharmacists and consumer advocates worry that if patients forget to
split their pills or don't do it just right, the drugs may not work
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente and Foundation Health Systems, both based in
California, have been recommending the practice around the country
for several years while Minnesota-based United Healthcare has been
introducing it to new areas such as the Southeast this year.
WellPoint Health Networks, also based in California, is considering
it.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Waxman, spokeswoman for Families USA, a consumer health
group, opposes pill splitting unless it's done by the pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a great practice,'' she said. ''I don't think
patients should try this.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Pharmaceutical Association, which represents
pharmacists, said patients need to be cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really a decision that a patient needs to make in
consultation with their doctors and pharmacist,'' said spokeswoman
Susan Winckler, who is a pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   The rising cost of prescription drugs is one of the biggest
headaches facing health maintenance organizations, increasing by
nearly 20 percent per year for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Drug costs have soared as pharmaceutical companies stoke patient
demand through aggressive advertising of pricey new drugs that
replace older cheaper medicines.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs have adopted a slew of strategies to control costs,
including new limits on the choice of drugs they cover. So far, the
efforts have had mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs that promote pill splitting say it is optional -- the
customer can simply ask their pharmacist for the proper dose.
</P>
<P>
   But many patients may be tempted because it saves money.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Pfizer Inc.'s antidepressant Zoloft wholesales for
$1.87 for a 50 milligram pill versus $1.93 for the 100 milligram
pill. Retail prices range from 20 percent or more above wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   HMO members usually don't pay full price for prescriptions, but
they may save from pill splitting too since they usually pay a
copayment of $10 to $20 per prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns about safety, some doctors have recommended
pill splitting -- for some drugs -- for years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeremy Lazarus, an Englewood, Colo.-based psychiatrist said
it's fine for patients who have the dexterity, and for pills that
are designed to be split -- like those that are scored down the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I know it will save the patients money, then its fine,''
Lazarus said.
</P>
<P>
   United and Foundation promote pill splitting for certain
antidepressants, namely Zoloft, Celexa and Paxil. These pills were
made to be split.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser also promotes the practice for a wider range of
medications including some antibiotics and hypertension drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't force anyone to do this but it is an option for
certain pills for certain patients,'' said Dr. David Campen, a
Kaiser medical director.
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers, which stand to lose sales due to pill splitting,
generally oppose the idea, unless it's done in the drug store.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Goodman, president of Forest Laboratories, the maker of
Celexa, said pill splitting is not a good idea for patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''It simply makes dosing more complicated,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kuralt's Mistress Gets Property  </HEADLINE>
By BOB ANEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A judge Wednesday awarded the Montana
fishing retreat of the late CBS correspondent Charles Kuralt to his
longtime secret mistress.
</P>
<P>
   A letter Kuralt wrote to Patricia Shannon two weeks before he
died in 1997 clearly expressed his wish that she have the 90 acres
along the Big Hole River after his death, state District Judge John
Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the long and intimate relationship between Kuralt and
Shannon, the judge said, ''any other conclusion would not make
sense and defies logic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuralt's two children had argued that the letter merely
expressed Kuralt's intention to someday draft a will giving Shannon
the property, which includes a former one-room schoolhouse and was
valued at $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the fishing retreat began after the pudgy,
balding ''On the Road'' correspondent died at 62 of complications
from lupus. According to the judge, it was not until after the
funeral that Kuralt's widow, Suzanne ''Petie'' Baird Kuralt,
learned of the 29-year affair.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute was originally between Shannon and Mrs. Kuralt.
After Mrs. Kuralt died last October, Kuralt's two daughters from a
previous marriage took up the legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon has refused to be interviewed about her relationship
with Kuralt. But she said Wednesday in a statement: ''I hope that
the wounds of these past months can begin to be healed and that we
can now celebrate Charles' life the way he would have wanted us
to.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Kuralt's children, Todd Hillier, had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   At a nonjury trial last month, Shannon testified that Kuralt,
the traveling correspondent known for his folksy reports about
quirky Americana, played the role of husband and father for his
secret family while his wife lived in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the dispute was a note Kuralt sent to Shannon
the day he was hospitalized for the last time in New York City:
''I'll have the lawyer visit the hospital to be sure you inherit
the rest of the place in MT, if it comes to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months earlier, he had given Shannon 20 acres and the
fishing cabin the two of them had built on the banks of the fishing
stream. Shannon still lives there.
</P>
<P>
   The judge found that Kuralt went to great lengths to keep his
relationship with Shannon a secret. That desire for secrecy may
explain why Kuralt did not immediately contact a lawyer to draft a
will giving Shannon the disputed property, the judge said.

<HEADLINE> $508M Awarded in Gender Suit  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 1,100 women who were denied jobs with the
federal agency that disseminates U.S. government news and
information overseas won $508 million from the government Wednesday
in the largest-ever settlement of a federal sex discrimination
case.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which still requires approval from a federal
judge, comes 23 years after the first woman, the then-29-year-old
Carolee Brady Hartman, accused the now-defunct U.S. Information
Agency and its broadcast branch, the Voice of America, of turning
her down for a job as a writer because of her gender.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went for a job interview and the man who was interviewing me
told me that he was not going to hire me because I was a woman,''
said Brady, today a 52-year-old divorced social worker living in
San Francisco. ''At the time, I just didn't know how to respond.
Now, I have a way of responding, and this is the victory that we
all celebrate today. It is a delicious victory.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $508 million that must be paid to the women --
approximately $450,000 apiece before taxes -- the federal government
must also give them nearly $23 million in back pay and interest and
pay their attorneys' fees. Those fees will be at least $12 million,
because the lawyers intend to bill the government for approximately
90,000 hours of work over the 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message has to be sent to the United States government, to
employers in this country and to employers around the world: The
cost of discrimination is high. If you compound that with delay,
the cost of discrimination is enormous,'' said Bruce Fredrickson,
the women's lead attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said that although there have been larger
settlements involving other forms of discrimination, this was the
largest federal sex discrimination case since the Civil Rights Act
was signed into law in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, after many years of insisting on trying each
individual case in the courts, even though the suit had been
certified as a class-action case, government lawyers decided to
settle to save money; they had already lost 46 of the 48 cases that
had gone to trial, with each woman winning about $500,000. Those 46
will also share in Wednesday's settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took into account the prior court decisions of the trial
and appellate courts ..., the results of the individual class
members' hearings that had been conducted to date, as well as our
independent projections of the likely results of the remaining
hearings in the absence of a settlement,'' said Wilma A. Lewis,
U.S. attorney of the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The government had been dealt a series of legal blows over the
years. In 1984, the U.S. District Court here found the government
guilty of sex discrimination. Since then, the government filed and
lost two appeals and was denied a hearing by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The women applied for jobs as international radio broadcasters,
radio broadcast or electronic technicians, writers and editors, and
production specialists at the agency and the Voice of America
between Oct. 8, 1974 and Nov. 16, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women who were denied jobs had been experienced
broadcasters from national and international news outlets,
qualified writers and reporters, or experienced technicians and
producers for network television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the happiest days of my life. We have won the
war, a just war,'' said Jahanara Hasan, who was rejected for a
position broadcasting to the people of her native Bangladesh in
favor of a less qualified man. ''The United States, being one of
the greatest advocates of human rights, should not allow its
officials to bring dishonor to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hasan, 56, works in Washington as the assistant to the
ambassador from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women also were awarded job relief and federal
government retirement accounts. The USIA itself was absorbed by the
State Department in October.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Fredrickson said the trials revealed that the agency
regularly manipulated the hiring process to exclude women. The
plaintiffs alleged that the agencies ''rigged the system'' in favor
of men and in some cases, resorted to test fraud, altering test
scores, and destroying personnel and test files.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women was told, ''A woman's place is at the stove,
not on the air,'' Fredrickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the U.S. attorney, said the large settlement acknowledges
the length of time involved, the relatively high-paying positions
at issue, the number of women, and the accrual of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit started so long ago, in fact, that Fredrickson had
taken it as his first case out of law school. ''We've been fighting
for 23 years and it's literally, my very first case. I hope the
next one is going to be shorter,'' he joked.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Rules Vs. Russian Language  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- The government should never elevate Russian
to the status of an official language alongside Ukrainian, a top
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both are closely related Slavic languages and widely used in
Ukraine. But the government has tried to boost the currency of
Ukrainian by making it the official state language. The government
is considering a draft law to further increase the use of Ukrainian
in print and broadcast media, Deputy Premier Mykola Zhulinskiy told
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's government protested the proposal, saying it
discriminated against the country's ethnic Russians -- about 20
percent of Ukraine's 50 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhulinskiy said Russian speakers already benefit from having
more than 70 percent of Ukrainian print and broadcast media in
Russian and didn't need special legal protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm against even raising the issue of making Russian a state
language,'' Zhulinskiy said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, ''we should raise the issue of protecting our
national information space and of giving priority to
Ukrainian-language television and radio broadcasts, newspapers and
books.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Constitutional Court established Ukrainian as
the language that state officials must use during work and in
public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials who once spoke only Russian, including President
Leonid Kuchma, have taken pains to learn and speak Ukrainian.

   In other futures markets, gold slipped after a one-day surge and
grains and soybeans rose on word that China is moving to ease
import restrictions as promised.
</P>
<P>
   Oil investors saw further evidence that a crude rally which
dates to December 1998, when prices were languishing below $11 a
barrel, may have run its course. West Texas Intermediate crude for
May delivery fell 35 cents to $27.46 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   While that's still up 7 percent this year, higher prices no
longer appear to be oil's manifest destiny. Key nations have been
working out details of a production hike, and this week Rilwanu
Lukman, secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries, said the cartel's target price in setting
production levels is a modest $24 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Prices were volatile Wednesday, with nervousness over OPEC's
impending decision and temporary, ultimately minor problems with a
Tosco refinery in Bayway, N.J., causing an up-and-down trading day.
Department of Energy data showing a smaller-than-expected increase
in U.S. crude inventories last week of 1.7 million barrels also
supported the price.
</P>
<P>
   But barring a big surprise at Monday's OPEC meeting in Vienna,
the March 8 peak of $34.37 a barrel is looking increasingly like
the high-water mark of a price-tripling rally.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been riding oil's wave are still not quite ready
to pronounce it over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Market players have learned they can't take everything out of
OPEC at face value,'' said Scott Meyers, an oil trader and analyst
for Pioneer Futures Group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's already been a huge selloff,'' he said. ''There is still
room to the downside, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a
correction back to the upside.''
</P>
<P>
   In other energy commodities, April heating oil rose .91 cent to
69.67 cents a gallon, April unleaded gasoline rose .57 cent to
90.02 cents a gallon and April natural gas rose 4.3 cents to $2.794
per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   May Brent crude from the North Sea fell 32 cents to $25.40 a
barrel on London's International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A day after relieved investors bid up the price of gold
following the last of five trend-setting United Kingdom auctions,
they bid it back down again. Some market-watchers suggested that
some of the price weakness might have been linked to Tuesday
afternoon's quarter-percent hike in interest rates, which came amid
talk that the increase could be a half-percent.
</P>
<P>
   April gold fell $2.10 to $288.30 in mostly directionless trading
on the Comex division of the New York Merc.
</P>
<P>
   A mild rally in grain and soybean prices on the Chicago Board of
Trade was underpinned by the announcement in Washington that China
has eased rules that have limited imports of U.S. farm products.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese agreed a year ago to allow the importation of
certain U.S. commodities, but didn't put the changes into motion
with the necessary regulations until late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery rose 1{ cent to $2.61} a bushel; May corn
rose 2{ cents to $2.34{ a bushel; May oats rose 1\ cent to $1.22 a
bushel; May soybeans rose 4\ cents to $5.31 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Business Vies for N. Korea  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INCHON, South Korea (AP) -- It's hard to imagine a loftier
marketing spin for ''Hanmaum,'' or ''One Mind,'' a new cigarette
that blends tobacco from both sides of the divided Korean
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The plug? Get a dose of solidarity as well as nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   On a dock, South Korean partners in a joint venture with
communist North Korea dutifully puffed their product on Wednesday,
when the first containers of ''One Mind'' arrived by ship from the
North, where they are made.
</P>
<P>
   ''North Koreans and South Koreans feel together when they smoke
the same brand,'' declared Lee Sang-ik, spokesman for the
Seoul-based Korea Tobacco and Ginseng Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A yearning for reconciliation -- and publicity -- is not the only
motive behind South Korean firms' pursuit of deals in the North, an
often belligerent country where roads and power grids are decrepit,
food shortages are rife, payoffs are many and legal guarantees are
few.
</P>
<P>
   Though for now South Korean companies are vying for low returns
on restricted turf in North Korea, they are looking years, or even
decades, ahead to reunification and full access to a country rich
in minerals and cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two Koreas, which fought a war 50 years
ago, could derail the ventures at any time. Yet, at their
government's urging, entrepreneurs in the South are struggling for
footholds in the North.
</P>
<P>
   ''The scale of it all is basically very small,'' said Aidan
Foster-Carter, a Korea expert at Leeds University in Britain.
''It's a tiny proportion of South Korea's total trade.''
</P>
<P>
   North-South trade reached a record $340 million last year, a 50
percent increase over 1998. More than 100 small- and medium-sized
South Korean companies are dealing with the North, according to
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. The South is the North's
third-largest trading partner after China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is pursuing economic, cultural and other links with a
grudging Pyongyang, a policy that could reduce the risk of conflict
by fostering North Korea's dependence on the neighbor it vilifies.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, the North's economy shrank by one-half or
more during the 1990s, after the collapse of trading partners in
the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Deadly famine forced it to
appeal for outside food aid.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, runs the flagship
venture in the North: a $942 million project that sends cruise ship
tours to North Korea's Diamond Mountain, a scenic mountain range
just north of the Demilitarized Zone. Hyundai pays $8 million a
month to Pyongyang for the tours and is losing money on the
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung, another South Korean conglomerate, won approval from
Seoul this month for a $727,000 project to develop computer
software with a North Korean partner. The troubled Daewoo
conglomerate runs a textile factory there.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a South Korean motor company owned by the
Unification Church of Rev. Sun Myung Moon inaugurated an auto plant
near Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   Moon, 80, and Hyundai founder Chung Ju Yung, 84, were born in
what is now North Korea. It is unclear whether their successors
would pursue their ventures with similar passion.
</P>
<P>
   Labor in North Korea is cheap, but workers long used to a
command economy are unaccustomed to the ways of the capitalist
South.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they discover a problem in the plant, they tend to shy away
from it,'' said Oh Byong-kwon, the South Korean chief of a plant
near Diamond Mountain where 60 North Korean workers started
bottling water this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we complain, they smile meekly and say they did not tell us
about the problem because they were so sorry,'' Oh said. His
employees are also often called away by North Korean officials for
ideological classes or community work.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990's, the North has made some mild market reforms and
opened a free economic zone. Critics, however, view these efforts
as halfhearted, a sign of the regime's suspicion of any change that
could sabotage its authority.
</P>
<P>
   A trickle of European firms have dealt with Pyongyang. The
American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul wants to send a delegation to
the North after the partial lifting of U.S. sanctions in September.
</P>
<P>
   But decaying infrastructure will likely deter investment as much
as political uncertainty and an antiquated command economy.
</P>
<P>
   One South Korean businessman described how the lights went out
while he talked to government officials in a top Pyongyang hotel.
The unfazed hosts fetched lanterns and the meeting resumed.
</P>
<P>
   As for ''One Mind'' cigarettes, most North Koreans will never
get a chance to try them: In the North, they will only be sold for
U.S. dollars in hotels and other places visited by foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Ex-H. Rap Brown Fights Extradition  </HEADLINE>
By ASHLEY ESTES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A rifle found near the site of Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin's capture in rural Alabama is the same caliber as
one of the weapons used in the shooting of two Atlanta deputies
last week, an FBI agent said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Imfeld, an FBI agent involved in the search for the 1960s
black militant known as H. Rap Brown, said the .223 caliber rifle
also is believed to be the weapon used to fire at U.S. marshals who
confronted Al-Amin before his capture in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle and spent cartridge casings, found near where marshals
said they were fired upon Monday, were sent to an Atlanta lab for
ballistics testing and comparison, Imfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, 56, is accused of fatally shooting Fulton County, Ga.,
Deputy Ricky Kinchen and wounding Deputy Aldranon English last
Thursday in Atlanta when they tried to serve him with an arrest
warrant at his grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin was jailed in Montgomery on Wednesday, and his attorney,
Selma civil rights lawyer J.L. Chestnut, said he planned to fight
extradition to Georgia. He said Al-Amin is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he did not shoot anyone,'' Chestnut said in
Wednesday's Selma Times-Journal. ''He said he did not have a gun.
He fled Atlanta to save his life. He said they had been trying to
kill him for years. He said it was a real conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut did not immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's expected that Al-Amin will be held in Montgomery until
Georgia files an extradition request, which could come as early as
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The .223-caliber rifle was found about 500 yards from where
Al-Amin exited woods before his capture Monday, Imfeld said. A 9mm
handgun was also found further back in the wooded area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A black Cadillac watched by authorities prior to Al-Amin's
capture in Lowndes County, west of Montgomery, was being processed
for evidence Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillac, which is not registered to Al-Amin, was reportedly
seen Monday near the site where U.S. marshals claim they were fired
upon.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillac appeared to pick up the shooter and drive away,
Imfeld said, then pulled into a residence and stopped.
</P>
<P>
   After the car began a circuitous route on back roads in the
rural county, he said, agents pulled it over and detained four
adults for questioning about any possible harboring of the fugitive
Al-Amin or aiding in his flight to Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The four were released Wednesday, Imfeld said, but have not been
cleared.

<HEADLINE> Stepfather shoots himself on roof after teen's remains found  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DIX HILLS, N.Y. (AP) -- A man climbed on his roof and fatally
shot himself Wednesday after incriminating himself in his stepson's
grisly murder, according to police sources.
</P>
<P>
   John Fenrich Jr., 36, shot himself in the head a day after
police told him his 19-year-old stepson's remains were believed to
have been found in a Queens park.
</P>
<P>
   Fenrich called a local cable news station Wednesday morning and
said his stepson's dismembered body had been found, according to
police sources.
</P>
<P>
   But police had not given Fenrich any details about the remains,
suggesting that Fenrich had other knowledge of his death, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   A skull, foot and pulverized bone fragments believed to be the
remains of Steen Keith Fenrich were found by a passerby Tuesday
afternoon in a plastic container in Alley Pond Park in Bayside,
Queens. The teen-ager's Social Security number was scrawled on the
skull in marker, along with a racial epithet and derogatory term
for homosexuals, according to police sources. Steen's mother,
Wanda, is black. John Fenrich is white.
</P>
<P>
   After the stepfather, a self-employed carpenter, called News12
Long Island, the station called police to report that Fenrich was
distraught and considering suicide. News12 did not air the contents
of the conversation and would not confirm that Fenrich had
mentioned body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk police arrived at Fenrich's Long Island house in Dix
Hills at 5:20 a.m. An hour later, Fenrich climbed on to his roof
holding a handgun and a high-powered rifle and fired several shots
into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Fenrich's wife and 15-year-old son left the brown-shingled
split-level home a short time later. Neighbors were told to stay in
their basements while hostage negotiators tried to talk him down.
The elder Fenrich's brother, a sergeant in the New York Police
Department, was also at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor who refused to be identified said Fenrich told the
cops: ''Shoot me! Shoot me! What are you waiting for?''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, who also would not give her name, said she
heard him telling police, ''I'm a failure as a father.''
</P>
<P>
   At 1:25 p.m., Fenrich put the handgun to his head, pulled the
trigger and fell to the ground. He was pronounced dead at Good
Samaritan Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''He reached for the gun after someone screamed something from
the ground, then the shot went off,'' said Bill Paden, 25, who
lives across the street. ''He was just sitting there for most of
the morning and then it just got crazy the last 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenrich and his wife had a checkered background. According to
court records, they were indicted in 1998 in a bizarre insurance
fraud scheme that involved bilking insurance companies out of
hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Fenriches were charged with
filing false claims based on self-inflicted injuries, including
staged car accidents and phony slip-and-falls.
</P>
<P>
   In one claim submitted in 1998, John Fenrich said a son -- not
named -- was hit by a motorist while riding a bike. Fenrich also
claimed he lost his pinkie in a 1995 auto accident; an investigator
found evidence the finger had been amputated years earlier, the
papers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fenriches were out on bail while negotiating a plea bargain
in the case, according to Mrs. Fenrich's attorney Steven Keats.
</P>
<P>
   Shari Lawrence, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Personnel
Command, said available records showed Steen Keith Fenrich, the
stepson, entered the Army in July 1997, went through basic training
at Fort Jackson, S.C., and was later trained as a food service
specialist. He was discharged after nine months, but the reason and
his status at the time were not publicly released, Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Ray Saper, said he ran into Steen Fenrich on a Long
Island Rail Road train four months ago and learned he had gotten
his own apartment in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just a very nice guy. I heard he wanted to go into the
military. He was always jogging or in-line skating through the
neighborhood,'' said Karina Wahee, 21, a neighbor who graduated a
year ahead of Steen from Half Hollow Hills East High School. ''When
I heard, I thought, ''No, it just can't be them.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Fenrich home, surrounded by trees, is in a mixed
neighborhood of middle-class homes, million-dollar mansions,
brand-new developments and wooded lots.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle could still be seen lying on the roof near several
skylights late Wednesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Disaster Area Declared in Florida  </HEADLINE>
By NIALA BOODHOO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) -- U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman
declared an agricultural disaster area Wednesday in four Florida
counties where an incurable citrus disease is ravaging groves that
once provided nearly all of the nation's limes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This loss is just as devastating as a drought,'' Glickman said
at a grove that was bulldozed because it was infected with citrus
canker.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida lime growers have lost more than half of their $20
million-a-year crop, and officials fear the citrus canker could
threaten more of the state's $8 billion citrus industry if it
spreads north into Florida's orange, grapefruit and other citrus
groves.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster declaration makes growers eligible for government
aid.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has been fighting different strains of the imported
disease for decades, and the only way officials have found to
destroy it is to knock down infected trees and burn them. Citrus
canker causes lesions on the leaves and fruit, drastically reducing
the trees' output.
</P>
<P>
   Since the latest outbreak was discovered after Hurricane Irene
swamped South Florida last fall, officials have burned at least
500,000 trees in citrus groves and yards in a 70-mile swath from
Homestead to Boca Raton, and they expect to destroy another
500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The eradication effort is expected to cost the state $175
million.
</P>
<P>
   The state recently fought canker infestations near Tampa and in
southwestern Florida, and had hoped to have the disease contained.
Then inspectors found the new outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the grove Glickman visited, Mark Philcox, considers
himself one of the lucky ones: He lost only a third of his crop to
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Philcox and other growers, particularly those still paying off
federal loans after Hurricane Andrew devastated the Homestead area
in 1992, said they will need more than the usual federal
disaster-area loans to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our nightmare is that they miss one tree, and after another
tropical storm or hurricane it starts all over again,'' Philcox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman told the growers the USDA is working on providing
compensation, and more money could come from the Commodity Credit
Corp., a revolving fund for agricultural emergencies. Rep. Allen
Boyd, a Florida Democrat, is sponsoring a bill that would provide
$40 million to growers who have lost trees in the eradication
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA also is stepping up enforcement of import laws and
inspections and is trying to find ways to kill the canker without
destroying the trees, Glickman said. Officials have yet to pinpoint
the country where the latest outbreak came from.
</P>
<P>
   A quarantine barring citrus shipments is in effect for much of
the area, and the growers whose groves are infected must wait at
least two years to replant citrus trees, which take up to five
years to bear fruit. Many growers said they plan to grow avocadoes
in the interim.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Fans Shooed Away By Police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An Oscar tradition ended this week when
police cleared away fans who had camped out to get good seats near
the venue for Sunday's Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   But the story had a happy ending -- the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences handed the ousted stargazers numbered vouchers
giving them priority spots in the bleachers, where they can see
their favorite celebrities entering the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Police moved in Tuesday to clear away the ''tent people''
bivouac on 32nd Street that started building last weekend and kept
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Tony O'Brien said officers decided to enforce a city
ordinance that forbids sidewalks from being blocked. They told the
crowd to pack up and move out. The encampment was preventing
students from safely getting to a nearby school.
</P>
<P>
   Diehard fans had arrived with coolers, tents, barbecues and even
generators to power TV sets. At stake are 200 first-come,
first-served stargazer seats in the fenced bleacher section erected
outside the cavernous Shrine Auditorium.

<HEADLINE> R.I. Shooting Tests Race Relations  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Police were accustomed to being called
to Fidas Restaurant, a late-night diner where people gathered, and
often brawled, when the nightclubs closed.
</P>
<P>
   But one night in January, a disturbance didn't end with the
usual roundup of troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   An off-duty black officer rushed to aid two white officers, who
mistook him for a suspect and shot him to death.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over whether prejudice or bad judgment was to blame
has reached Washington, where Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., has
asked the Congressional Black Caucus to examine the case. On
Monday, he will introduce legislation that would create a task
force to study racism in police departments and other government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This not a problem with Rhode Island. It is a national
problem,'' said Joseph Almeida, a black state representative and
former Providence police officer. ''Somebody should not have to
have died to bring this up.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Sgt. Cornel Young Jr., 29, was the son of Maj.
Cornel Young, the highest-ranking black member of the Providence
force. Maj. Young has said he has reached no conclusion about the
case. But the slain officer's mother has.
</P>
<P>
   ''Racism exists,'' said Leisa Young, a community college
counselor. ''Is it as blatant as the Ku Klux Klan burning their
cross on your lawn? No. But people have their perceptions of
things. Because of where it was, the side of town, and the fact
that my son was black affected what those officers saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was one of 33 blacks on a police force of 470, which puts
their percentage in the department at 7 percent. In the 1990
census, blacks made up nearly 15 percent of Providence's 161,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The officers' defenders say inexperience played a big role in
the shooting. Officer Michael Solitro had been on patrol just seven
nights. His partner, Officer Carlos Saraiva, had been on the force
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Saraiva's attorney, Joseph Penza, said the shooting wasn't
racially motivated. But he said he couldn't comment further because
a grand jury is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leaders have pointed out that Saraiva graduated in
the same 48-member Police Academy class as Young and have said the
officer should have recognized him.
</P>
<P>
   Young was in street clothes when he stopped at the diner after
midnight on Jan. 28. Two women started to fight, and the night
manager ordered everyone outside. When the two officers arrived,
they said they saw a man with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Young apparently saw the confrontation unfolding, drew his own
gun and rushed outside to confront the suspect, Aldrin Diaz. The
officers said Young did not identify himself as a policeman and did
not respond to their repeated calls to drop his weapon, so they
shot him.
</P>
<P>
   When news of Young's death spread through the city, civil rights
leaders and others began questioning, first quietly then through
protests and vigils, whether Rhode Island law enforcement could be
trusted to investigate two of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the critics' suspicions, Diaz was charged with murder
because prosecutors said he displayed a gun in the confrontation
that ended in Young's death. Diaz's lawyers say police used their
client as a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse has created a
commission to study police relations with minorities. But
Whitehouse has refused to appoint an independent investigator,
angering many community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It all came at an especially sensitive time. State police were
objecting to a just-introduced bill that would study racial
profiling. Another lawmaker drew criticism for proposing
eliminating the word ''plantations'' from the official state name --
State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. He said
''plantations'' conjures up images of slavery.

<P>
   Since the shooting, Mayor Vincent Cianci Jr. has proposed
creating the position of deputy commissioner for community affairs,
probably filled by a minority, to field complaints against the
police.
</P>
<P>
   The Providence police union has denied the entire force is
racist and insists Young's shooting was a case of a bad
split-second decision, not prejudice. Still, it has supported City
Council resolutions calling for minority officers and more
sensitivity training for the department.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Euro After Rate Hike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro on Wednesday,
gaining for a second day after the Federal Reserve's decision to
boost U.S. interest rates again. The dollar was little changed
against other major currencies.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading in New York, the euro was quoted at 96.02 cents,
down from 96.41 cents at the same point on Tuesday. The dollar also
was quoted at 106.90 Japanese yen, down from 106.93 yen.
</P>
<P>
   There were no major economic reports to steer traders in the
aftermath of Tuesday's expected rate hike by the Fed, which widened
the gap in short-term lending rates in the United States and Europe
after the European Central Bank boosted its rates last week.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Wednesday, the dollar also was quoted at 1.6756
Swiss francs, up from 1.6721; and 1.4700 Canadian dollars, up from
1.4684. The British pound rose to $1.5775 from late Tuesday's quote
of $1.5733.
</P>
<P>
   The currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are
no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed
rate. Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0370
German marks, up from 2.0285 on Tuesday; 6.8318 French francs, up
from 6.8031; and 2,016.63 Italian lire, up from 2,008.18.

<HEADLINE> Fox TV's Entertainment Chief Is Out  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox entertainment president Doug Herzog, who's
suffered through disastrous ratings and fallout from the ''Who
Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire'' fiasco, quit after 14 months on
the job Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog has reportedly been trying to leave Fox since soon after
one of his predecessors, Sandy Grushow, was installed last November
to supervise the network and Fox's television studio.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog, 40, was president of the Comedy Central cable network
before starting at Fox in January 1999. He was Fox's fifth
entertainment president in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't immediately return telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   His slate of new programs for last fall, including the
critically-praised comedy ''Action'' and the drama ''Harsh Realm,''
all failed in the ratings. Fox's average prime-time viewership has
slumped from 11.2 million last year to 9.3 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   The promising performance of midseason replacement comedies
''Malcolm in the Middle'' and ''Titus'' has given Fox hope
recently. Yet two stalwarts of its schedule, ''Beverly Hills,
90210'' and ''Party of Five,'' are in their last season and Fox
still isn't sure that ''The X-Files'' is coming back for another
year.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has also taken heat for its reality specials with car chases
and attacking animals. Grushow said the network is leaving that
genre behind.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives say privately that Herzog's departure has nothing
to do with last month's ill-fated TV marriage of Rick Rockwell and
Darva Conger. The special attracted a storm of criticism when it
came out that a former fiancee had served Rockwell with a
restraining order and Conger quickly moved for an annulment.
</P>
<P>
   The network's internal investigation into that special is
expected to be complete by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow will assume Herzog's duties through this spring, when
Fox must present a new schedule to advertisers, and search for a
successor this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doug has made important and lasting contributions to the
success of the network, particularly in the area of live action
comedies,'' Grushow said. ''We wish him the same success in his
future endeavors that has always characterized his career.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what Herzog will do next.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the network will finish up this season in a strong
position, and I'm proud to have contributed to its success,'' he
said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Officials Check Stasi Links in Death  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE BOEHMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- With new evidence emerging about the
lengths East Germany's secret police were willing to go to against
suspected enemies, Berlin prosecutors said Wednesday they may
exhume the body of a soccer star who died in a mysterious auto
accident after defecting to the West.
</P>
<P>
   An initial investigation into the death of Lutz Eigendorf and
suspected links with the communist secret police -- or Stasi as they
were known -- was dropped in 1993 ''for lack of evidence,'' said
Martin Steltner, spokesman for the prosecutors' office.
</P>
<P>
   Police reopened the case in 1998 after new information was found
in other Stasi files. Prosecutors are now following up on witness
information and have reason to suspect he may have been poisoned.
''It is also being checked if possibly an exhumation of the
deceased might promise success,'' Steltner added.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation comes days after the government office
reconstructing secret police files said the Stasi used radioactive
chemicals to track dissidents' movements.
</P>
<P>
   On March 5, 1983, the 26-year-old Eigendorf left his usual bar
and crashed his Alfa Romeo into a tree. He died three days later.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are trying to determine if someone caused him to
get intoxicated with alcohol and later shined a ''sudden blinding
light'' into his eyes while he was driving to cause the accident,
Steltner said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Berliner Zeitung newspaper on Wednesday said tests
showed he had a blood alcohol content far above the legal limit.
But the newspaper, quoting an investigative report being broadcast
by ARD national television late Wednesday, said a recently found
Stashi document mentions using chemicals during soccer games,
''such as gas or poison.''
</P>
<P>
   The document continues by mentioning something that ''leads to
death in the long run.'' And a few lines later it cryptically
mentions ''accident statistics? made unconscious from outside?
blinding light?''
</P>
<P>
   Eigendorf who played for BFC Dynamo in East Berlin, defected to
West Germany in 1979 during a match in Kaiserslautern in
southwestern Germany. He played there until 1982, when he switched
to Braunschweig, about 50 miles west of the old East German border.

<HEADLINE> Rapist spent days out of jail traveling nation on Greyhound buses  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- A rapist who prosecutors say was
improperly released from prison two weeks ago spent his days of
freedom traveling around the nation nonstop on Greyhound buses,
authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County prosecutors had no reports that Raymond Alves,
whose release sparked fears that the state had set a violent
criminal free, had committed any crimes during his odyssey, which
included trips to Las Vegas, San Antonio and four trips each to
Jacksonville, Fla., and Fayetteville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But Alves, 57, was held without bail Wednesday after his
arraignment on charges that he violated Megan's Law by giving a
false Massachusetts address after his March 9 release from prison.
</P>
<P>
   The crime is punishable by up to 18 months in prison, but
Attorney General John Farmer is considering whether to keep Alves
in custody by arguing he is a dangerous sexual predator, Assistant
Bergen County Prosecutor Ike Gavzy said. Farmer spokesman Chuck
Davis declined comment, saying such matters are confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were angered when they learned from the state
Department of Corrections of Alves' release one day after it
occurred. The state is required by law to notify prosecutors of
convicted sex offenders' release dates 30 days in advance to give
prosecutors the chance to file objections.
</P>
<P>
   The state fired two psychologists who evaluated Alves and
Corrections officials admitted the late notification was ''a
serious mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Alves was captured Tuesday night in a telephone booth of NJ
Transit's Annandale station in Clinton Township after getting off a
train from Newark, authorities said. He had no weapons and $500 in
cash, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County Prosecutor William Schmidt said the office had
received a tip that Alves would be getting on a 6:24 p.m. NJ
Transit train to Annandale. Detectives from the office boarded the
train and searched it, but Alves wasn't on the train, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said authorities believe Alves got on an earlier train,
then caught up with the 6:24 p.m. train at a later stop. ''He got
on the wrong train headed in the right direction,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   When Alves arrived, Schmidt said, ''he thought that his ride was
there for him.'' Instead, he was arrested by FBI agents waiting at
the station.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were able to produce a near minute-by-minute
itinerary of Alves' travels over the past two weeks because Alves
kept all his bus tickets from around the country, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, Alves was released from Southern State Prison in
Cumberland County after serving less than half of a 47-year
sentence for the 1976 rape of one teen and the assault of another.
He was released early for good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Alves and another released inmate, Shawn Woodward, got a ride to
the Vineland bus station from a third prisoner the morning of March
9, authorities said. He cashed a $1,554 check at a Vineland bank
and took a bus to Atlantic City with Woodward, where he spent two
hours, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   He then took another bus to Newark and told Woodward he would
probably go visit a daughter or a sister in Florida, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alves spent one night in a Little Ferry motel and the next
night, boarded a Greyhound bus from New York City to Fayetteville,
N.C. He then kept getting on buses crisscrossing the country,
usually leaving less than an hour after he arrived. He traveled to
Florida, Texas, Arizona, Alabama and Virginia, spending the longest
period, about 8 1/2 hours, in Tampa, Fla., on March 18. He also
spent 6 1/2 hours in Las Vegas on March 14 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, he took a bus from Richmond, Va., to Newark,
and then three hours later boarded a bus that went back to
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Alves used his name for all but the last bus trip he made, from
Richmond to Newark on Tuesday, Schmidt said. Prosecutors had asked
Greyhound to check to see whether Alves had boarded a bus but were
told they couldn't track tickets purchased in cash, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt declined to comment on an investigation into several
murders of young Bergen County women that were reopened after
Alves' release. Alves, who once bragged he had raped and killed a
dozen women, was a longtime suspect in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge William A. Meehan entered a not guilty plea
on Alves' behalf at a hearing, then postponed a bail hearing until
Monday because Alves did not have an attorney. Alves tapped his
middle fingers on the table before the judge, stated his name and
said he understood the charge against him.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Expects Normal Flights  </HEADLINE>
By KARREN MILLS, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northwest Airlines began evaluating its
backup systems Wednesday after a utility crew severed a cable and
knocked out a vital link in the airline's computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the backlog was cleared by midnight Tuesday and the
Eagan, Minn.-based carrier was fully operational Wednesday, said
airline spokeswoman Kathy Peach. The cost of the disruptions have
yet to be calculated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although passengers aboard planes were not in danger during the
3{-hour outage, reservations, baggage information, electronic
ticketing and digital links between the airline's dispatch center
and its cockpits were affected, according to Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, canceled about
130 of its 1,700 daily flights systemwide Tuesday and hundreds of
flights were delayed as employees resorted to manual backup
procedures and the system clogged up.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you move to manual procedures, that's a very labor
intensive endeavor for us,'' Peach said. ''We kept our employees on
for extra shifts and asked airport restaurants to stay open. We did
some hotel bookings.''
</P>
<P>
   She said a majority of passengers were able to travel. There
were no charges for rebooking flights.
</P>
<P>
   The problem began when contractors for McLeod USA, a Cedar
Rapids, Iowa-based telecommunications company, cut through two U S
West fiber-optic cables in Eagan that link Northwest's mainframe
computers to airport facilities globally, U S West said. U S West
has a backup arrangement for Northwest, but it failed because of
the extensive cable damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very unfortunate accident, and we're sorry on behalf of
McLeod for whatever problems and confusion it caused for Northwest
Airlines and travelers,'' McLeod spokesman Bryce Nemitz said.
</P>
<P>
   No decision had been made on whether to sue over the cable cut,
Peach said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That certainly needs to be discussed. This was a severe
disruption of our service and our operations, particularly our
vulnerability on the way the backup system is set up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're real concerned that people understand that this was
totally out of our control and not our fault,'' Peach added.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also was evaluating the way it handled the emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a new one for us,'' Peach said. ''We want to make
sure that if we're ever in a situation like this again, that we can
act quickly and appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwest shares fell 18} cents to $18.93} in trading Wednesday
at 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Body Linked To Carwash Suspect  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- A body that might be that of a woman who
vanished in November was found Wednesday after police questioned
the man suspected of killing five car wash employees this week.
</P>
<P>
   The body was found in a grass-covered ditch near Lone Star Park
in Irving, a Dallas suburb, said David Tull, a spokesman for the
Irving Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wayne Harris has been arraigned on a capital murder
charge in connection with the deaths of five Mi-T-Fine Car Wash
employees early Monday morning. A sixth victim remains in critical
condition at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was fired from the car wash just days before the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Information from Harris helped lead detectives to the body found
Wednesday, Tull said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Gaye Scott was reported missing Nov. 29 and her pickup
was found Dec. 3. Harris was linked to her disappearance because
his phone number was the last number on her pager, police said. He
was questioned after she vanished but at the time there was not
enough evidence against him, police have said.
</P>
<P>
   A positive identification on the body has not been made because
of the advanced state of decomposition. Charles Gaylor, a field
agent for the Dallas County medical examiner's office, said dental
records will be used to determine if the body is Scott's.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's her,'' Gaylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Scott's family were at the Irving Police Department
and at the scene where the body was found.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 28, remained in custody Wednesday. His brother, William
Harris, told The Dallas Morning News in Wednesday's editions that
the suspect broke into tears as he admitted to the car wash
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ''They got into an argument about the job and one of the
employees grabbed his arm and someone hit him in the back of the
head,'' William Harris told the newspaper. ''He said he lost it. He
felt sorry for doing what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris was fired from the car wash Friday after being arrested
for allegedly exposing himself to two women at the business. He had
been freed Sunday on $500 bail.

<HEADLINE> IMF Official Predicts Reforms  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund likely will
endorse reforms proposed by the Clinton administration and reject
more sweeping recommendations from a congressional commission, a
top official of the lending agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer, who has run the agency
since Michel Camdessus stepped down as in February, said the
administration's reform blueprint has gotten a positive response at
the 182-nation organization.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has suggested reforms aimed
at refocusing the IMF and its sister lending agency, the World
Bank, on their primary missions.
</P>
<P>
   But the recommendations are not as broad as those from a
congressionally appointed advisory commission led by Allan Meltzer,
an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University.
</P>
<P>
   The commission recommended restricting the IMF to supplying
short-term loans to countries in financial crisies. Summers
proposed ending the IMF's long-term development loans to poor
countries but not its long-term loans dealing with poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said long-term development loans should be the
sole focus of the World Bank. Still, it recommended the World Bank
halt about 70 percent of its current lending to developing
countries such as China and Brazil that have access to global
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer told reporters he had some questions about certain
aspects of the U.S. recommendations, but believed ''the general
approach suggested by Secretary Summers will be accepted by the
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Horst Koehler, a former top German finance
ministry official in line to become the IMF's new chief on
Thursday, has ''made it clear that he believes we should move in
that direction as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler's nomination was expected to win easy approval by the
IMF's 24-member executive board, which is anxious to put behind it
a messy battle over the top job. The United States rejected the
first candidate from Europe, Germany's Deputy Finance Minister Caio
Koch-Weser, saying he lacked the stature for the post.
</P>
<P>
   Summers and members of Meltzer's advisory commission were to
testify Thursday before the House Banking Committee. While several
Democrats denounced the Meltzer recommendations as too radical, top
Republicans in both the House and Senate have embraced the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer also took issue with critics who have complained the IMF
has been too slow in adapting its procedures to a rapidly changing
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I keep hearing people say nothing is happening. There is in
fact an enormous amount happening,'' Fischer said. ''It dominates
our work product.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said the agency has put on the Internet enormous amounts
of once-secret information, including its assessments of individual
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, some outdated loan programs have been
eliminated and a pilot program is under way to examine selected
countries' banking systems and recommend improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF assembled more than $100 billion in emergency rescue
packages from 1997 through 1998 as it struggled to contain a
spreading currency crisis that saw investors fleeing country after
country, sending currencies and stock markets crashing.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charged the IMF loans did nothing to stop the contagion
from spreading from Asia to Russia and finally South America. Much
of the money wound up bailing out private investors who had made
risky bets in developing countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> $508M Awarded in Gender Suit  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 1,100 women who were denied jobs with the
federal agency that disseminates U.S. government news and
information overseas won $508 million from the government Wednesday
in the largest-ever settlement of a federal sex discrimination
case.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which still requires approval from a federal
judge, comes 23 years after the first woman, the then-29-year-old
Carolee Brady Hartman, accused the now-defunct U.S. Information
Agency and its broadcast branch, the Voice of America, of turning
her down for a job as a writer because of her gender.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went for a job interview and the man who was interviewing me
told me that he was not going to hire me because I was a woman,''
said Brady, today a 52-year-old divorced social worker living in
San Francisco. ''At the time, I just didn't know how to respond.
Now, I have a way of responding, and this is the victory that we
all celebrate today. It is a delicious victory.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $508 million that must be paid to the women --
approximately $450,000 apiece before taxes -- the federal government
must also give them nearly $23 million in back pay and interest and
pay their attorneys' fees. Those fees will be at least $12 million,
because the lawyers intend to bill the government for approximately
90,000 hours of work over the 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message has to be sent to the United States government, to
employers in this country and to employers around the world: The
cost of discrimination is high. If you compound that with delay,
the cost of discrimination is enormous,'' said Bruce Fredrickson,
the women's lead attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said that although there have been larger
settlements involving other forms of discrimination, this was the
largest federal sex discrimination case since the Civil Rights Act
was signed into law in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, after many years of insisting on trying each
individual case in the courts, even though the suit had been
certified as a class-action case, government lawyers decided to
settle to save money; they had already lost 46 of the 48 cases that
had gone to trial, with each woman winning about $500,000. Those 46
will also share in Wednesday's settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took into account the prior court decisions of the trial
and appellate courts ..., the results of the individual class
members' hearings that had been conducted to date, as well as our
independent projections of the likely results of the remaining
hearings in the absence of a settlement,'' said Wilma A. Lewis,
U.S. attorney of the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The government had been dealt a series of legal blows over the
years. In 1984, the U.S. District Court here found the government
guilty of sex discrimination. Since then, the government filed and
lost two appeals and was denied a hearing by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The women applied for jobs as international radio broadcasters,
radio broadcast or electronic technicians, writers and editors, and
production specialists at the agency and the Voice of America
between Oct. 8, 1974 and Nov. 16, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women who were denied jobs had been experienced
broadcasters from national and international news outlets,
qualified writers and reporters, or experienced technicians and
producers for network television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the happiest days of my life. We have won the
war, a just war,'' said Jahanara Hasan, who was rejected for a
position broadcasting to the people of her native Bangladesh in
favor of a less qualified man. ''The United States, being one of
the greatest advocates of human rights, should not allow its
officials to bring dishonor to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hasan, 56, works in Washington as the assistant to the
ambassador from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women also were awarded job relief and federal
government retirement accounts. The USIA itself was absorbed by the
State Department in October.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Fredrickson said the trials revealed that the agency
regularly manipulated the hiring process to exclude women. The
plaintiffs alleged that the agencies ''rigged the system'' in favor
of men and in some cases, resorted to test fraud, altering test
scores, and destroying personnel and test files.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women was told, ''A woman's place is at the stove,
not on the air,'' Fredrickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the U.S. attorney, said the large settlement acknowledges
the length of time involved, the relatively high-paying positions
at issue, the number of women, and the accrual of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit started so long ago, in fact, that Fredrickson had
taken it as his first case out of law school. ''We've been fighting
for 23 years and it's literally, my very first case. I hope the
next one is going to be shorter,'' he joked.

<HEADLINE> Pope Deplores Plight of Palestinians  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- Journeying to the cradle of
Christianity, Pope John Paul II knelt and prayed Wednesday at the
traditional spot of Jesus' birth. He also kissed a golden bowl of
Palestinian soil -- one of several gestures the Palestinians saw as
recognition of their dreams for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   As a beaming Yasser Arafat looked on, the 79-year-old pontiff
proclaimed Palestinians' ''natural right to a homeland'' and
visited a crowded, dusty camp for refugees exiled from their homes
since the 1948 Mideast War. But soon after he left, Palestinian
frustrations turned violent: Hundreds of camp residents hurled
stones at baton-wielding Palestinian police in a battle that lasted
for nearly half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Police at the Dheisheh camp pushed the protesters back, then had
to retreat under a hail of rocks. Some minor injuries were reported
in the melee, a show of dissatisfaction with Palestinian leadership
and the slow pace of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, John Paul called for international action to
end Palestinian suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your torment is before the eyes of the world,'' he declared.
''And it has gone on for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the day in Bethlehem -- the city John Paul said was at
the heart of his pilgrimage -- also had a strong spiritual note. In
Manger Square, near Jesus' traditional birth grotto in the Church
of the Nativity, a golden-clad pontiff leaning on a silver staff
celebrated Mass before thousands of faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he descended into the grotto and knelt before the star
marking the spot where Mary is believed to have given birth. In the
soft glow of candles, the pope sat in silence as his aides
respectfully slipped out of the grotto.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Vatican's portrayal of the papal trip as purely
spiritual, the pope touched on contentious issues of clear
consequence to the region. The Palestinians, in turn, lost no time
driving home the message of their aspirations of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Welcome to our land,'' Arafat told the pope at a formal
reception that kicked off the only day the pope was spending in
Palestinian territory. He called the pope an ''esteemed guest of
Palestine, and its eternal capital, Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel claims all Jerusalem as its capital, while Palestinians
want the city's eastern section as the capital of a future
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   In his arrival speech, the pope referred to ''legitimate
Palestinian aspirations'' and the need for peaceful negotiations to
realize them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Holy See has always recognized that the Palestinian people
have a natural right to a homeland,'' the pope said, speaking in a
slurred voice -- a symptom of Parkinson's disease, a progressive
neurological disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls parried suggestions the
pope was endorsing a Palestinian state, saying such a state has not
yet been proclaimed and that the Vatican would consider the issue
when that happened.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Arafat, the pope traveled in his bulletproof
popemobile to Manger Square for an ecstatic welcome. Along the
route, Palestinian girls hurled flowers, festooning the hood of the
popemobile. In the square, draped with Palestinian and Vatican
flags, shouts of ''Viva Baba!'' rang out. Baba is the Arabic
adaptation of the word pope.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in a golden robe, John Paul waved his hand in greeting and
blessed the crowd, saying ''Peace be upon you'' in Arabic. As organ
strains signaled the start of Mass, he leaned heavily on his silver
staff, bowing his head in solemn prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Hands trembling as he preached from a tent-like altar between an
ancient church and a modern mosque, the pope said Bethlehem lay
''at the heart'' of his millennium pilgrimage -- a visit he had
hoped to make as far back as Christmas 1978, two months after he
assumed the papacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a place that has known the yoke and the rod of
oppression,'' John Paul said. ''How often has the cry of innocents
been heard in these streets?''
</P>
<P>
   As the pope finished his homily, the Muslim call to prayer rang
out from a mosque in the square, the first such interruption of a
papal Mass. The crowd and the pontiff alike waited silently for the
call to prayer to end. A few fidgeted uncomfortably, and a nun
shook her head in apparent disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, the crowd applauded when Jerusalem's Latin
Patriarch, Michel Sabbah, spoke of the juxtaposition of Islamic and
Christian prayers as symbolizing unity between the two faiths.
Navarro-Valls later said the overlapping of prayers in the square
was ''mutual and respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Palestinians greeted John Paul with conscious
symbols of statehood as his Israeli Blackhawk helicopter touched
down under chilly gray skies near Arafat's presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians presented him with a golden bowl of soil, to
which the pontiff briefly touched to his lips. Along with the
Vatican anthem, a band played the Palestinian national song.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said the government had ''no
problem'' with the soil gesture, because Bethlehem was the town of
Jesus' birth. Navarro-Valls sounded a similar note.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be strange if the pope didn't kiss the earth of the
place where Jesus was born,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Independence wishes were also being showcased at Dheisheh, where
the pope spent an hour examining the cramped living conditions of
10,000 refugees from the 1948 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   The visit sounded a cheerful note. A crowd of several hundred,
gathered in a courtyard of a boys' school, cheered and applauded as
the pope and Arafat walked hand-in-hand onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence erupted after they left. Witnesses said police
trying to push back curious onlookers beat several of them. In
response, an angry crowd hurled stones at police officers, who beat
stone throwers with clubs. Some officers hurled stones back during
the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Rahman Ahmar, a leader of a radical PLO faction, said the
camp's anger was directed both at Arafat and at the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, from which he said refugees have
reaped no benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not Palestinians against Palestinians,'' Ahmar said.
''This is Palestinians against the Palestinian Authority.''
</P>
<P>
   While Arafat has permitted some dissent, he has cracked down
hard on direct expressions of criticism of his leadership,
arresting opponents and closing down newspapers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gives Iraqi Opposition Money  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has approved its
first direct grant to an Iraqi opposition group it hopes will help
overthrow President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State Edward Walker said Wednesday that
the State Department is scheduled to sign a contract giving about
$250,000 to the Iraqi National Congress, mostly to help it
organize.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee,
Walker said the group eventually will get more money to set up
offices in the Middle East, set up security so it can operate
safely inside Iraq and establish a ''free Iraqi'' information
program of televison and radio broadcasts inside and outside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Two senators told Walker the United States wasn't doing enough
to see Saddam removed from power.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saddam should be removed, it really is as simple as that,''
said Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas. ''We just aren't pressing the
issue forward at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Saddam isn't going anywhere unless we do something relatively
drastic,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The INC, made up of Iraqis from Europe, Northern Iraq an
elsewhere, has been trying for about a year to organize itself into
a credible umbrella for opposition to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Money could not be given directly to the group until now, Walker
said, because it did not meet government requirements as
''credible, grant-worth'' organization that would be accountable
for the funding.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has been funding the INC's efforts
heretofore, to the tune of millions of dollars, by paying approved
''subcontractors'' who did the work of getting hotel rooms and
paying other bills for the group's organization meetings, another
state department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the Iraqi opposition is now better organized
and unified and able to start working on its programs -- and to
handle direct grants. Administration officials had said in the past
that opposition groups were fragmented and spending a lot of time
feuding with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why it has taken so long to get the INC moving, Walker
said: ''You need to have the foundation solidly built in order to
move forward in any campaign that would have a hope of
</P>
<P>
   unseating Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   The money to be awarded, possibly as early as this week, is from
an $8 million appropriation that Congress made late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also has approved another $97 million for the
opposition to receive goods and services from surplus Pentagon
stocks, but little of that has been given.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton serves two hours on 10-day jail term in New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) -- Less than two hours into a 10-day jail
term, the Rev. Al Sharpton was freed Wednesday after supporters
persuaded a judge to reconsider the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, 45, of Brooklyn, N.Y., was released after two of his
supporters convinced Atlantic City Municipal Judge Bruce F. Weekes,
who had imposed the sentence, that Sharpton's work in raising
public consciousness about the police practice of racial profiling
outweighed the harm of his July 3 protest on the Atlantic City
Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   ''We told him that because of that act of civil disobedience, he
had helped to bring local, state and national attention to racial
profiling,'' said the Rev. Collins Days, pastor of Second Baptist
Church. ''It was a catalyst to eradicate the practice of racial
profiling in New Jersey. The good of that outweighed the act of
blocking the Expressway. He took a look at those things and
agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   Days appeared before the judge with William Marsh, president of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's
Atlantic City branch.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton had been handcuffed, fingerprinted and issued prison
clothes but was incarcerated in the Atlantic County Justice
Facility for less than two hours. While he was being processed at
the jail, Marsh and Days were appealing to Weekes to release him in
a courtroom in Atlantic City, about 12 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Weekes, communicating with Sharpton via videoconference, told
Sharpton of the development. Sharpton maintained his innocence and
refused to pay a $500 fine or sign his own release papers,
according to Sharpton spokeswoman Rachel Noerdlinger.
</P>
<P>
   A payment agreement allowing the NAACP to pay the fine was
issued and he was released about 3:55 p.m. Weekes was not speaking
to the media, court director Carole Cummings said. Assistant
Municipal Prosecutor Michael Mosca declined comment on Sharpton's
release.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising turnabout came after Sharpton, invoking the name
of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said he was more than
willing to do jail time to stand up against racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Martin Luther King III, three young men who were
shot at by New Jersey State Police during a traffic stop and about
600 sign-waving Sharpton supporters, Sharpton marched to the gates
of the jail to turn himself in.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to use his time in jail to bring attention to racial
profiling, or the pulling over of motorists based on their skin
color. He said he planned to read, fast and pray to pass the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just like Martin Luther King paid the price for my generation,
we've got to pay a price for this generation,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling in New Jersey came to national attention after
the 1998 shootings of three young men stopped by police on the New
Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   The incident led authorities to examine practices of racially
discriminatory traffic stops, and last April the attorney general's
office released a report acknowledging that minorities were far
more likely to be pulled over by police.
</P>
<P>
   On July 3, Sharpton and 200 others participated in a protest on
the Atlantic City Expressway that backed up traffic headed into the
resort for miles. He and 75 others were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted of two counts of obstructing a highway, the
equivalent of a disorderly persons offense, and sentenced to 10
days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, 10 busloads of enthusiastic, rain-drenched
supporters chanted and waved signs as they awaited his arrival in a
parking lot adjacent to the jail complex. One man used a bullhorn
to lead the chants, which focused on racial profiling and the fatal
shooting of African immigrant Amadou Diallo by police in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Police training, 101,'' the man shouted. ''It's a wallet, not
a gun,'' the crowd chanted back, many holding up their wallets. It
was a reference to Diallo's shooting, which came when he reached
for his wallet and officers believed he was wielding a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Once Sharpton arrived, his wife and two daughters in tow, he
walked arm in arm with King and the Turnpike shooting victims
toward the chain-link fence of the jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''This comes out of a long tradition of the movement started by
Dr. King, which is why his son is here,'' Sharpton said. He added
that the people responsible for racial profiling in New Jersey
haven't served a day in jail, but that he was being jailed for
protesting it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,'' said
King, quoting his father. ''If my father were alive, he would be
right here next to Rev. Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as his supporters sang ''Amen, Amen,'' Sharpton and his
lawyer squeezed through the fence outside the jail and walked to a
waiting county sedan. Then he stood up on the ledge of the car's
rear door, turned to face his supporters and raised one fist into
the air before climbing in for a 100-yard drive to the front door.
</P>
<P>
   His release was considerably lower-key. Most of the newspaper
photographers, reporters, TV crews, radio newscasters and others on
hand for the surrender had left. Sharpton was unavailable for
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sharpton will discuss why he feels this is victory for the
movement tomorrow (Thursday) at the House of Justice'' in New York,
Noerdlinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton was to get no special treatment in the jail, which
houses more than twice the 470 inmates it was designed for.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic County Executive Dennis Levinson said the release
wasn't jail officials' idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''Atlantic County was going to hold its ground. It was
understood that there was going to be no special treatment for Rev.
Sharpton,'' Levinson said. ''The county doesn't make those
decisions. The county has to follow the court's order.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Senate Seat Up for Grabs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A former state legislator and a retired Air
Force lawyer have advanced to a runoff in the Democratic primary
for the Senate seat held by Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison, party
officials determined Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial returns had determined that Charles Gandy, who served
one term in the Texas house in the mid-1980s, finished second in
the March 14 primary to the lawyer, Gene Kelly. But Gandy's margin
over the third-place finisher was so close that officials waited to
formally announce the runoff contenders Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had 35.7 percent of the vote, Gandy had 22.7 percent, and
the third candidate, Don Clark, had 22.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff will be held April 11.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison won her Senate seat in a 1993 special election and was
elected to a full term in 1994. She has said a bid for governor
remains an option if Gov. George W. Bush is elected president.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Would Abolish INS  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service
would be abolished under legislation approved Wednesday by a House
subcommittee. In its place, two separate bureaus would enforce the
nation's immigration laws and dole out benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The INS is broken and must be fixed,'' said GOP Rep. Lamar
Smith of Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
immigration and claims. ''The agency moves from one crisis to the
next, with no strategy on how to accomplish its missions
successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee, on a 4-3 party-line vote, approved the
restructuring measure by Smith and Reps. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., and
Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, neither of whom is on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The bill does not appear to be going anywhere in the Senate, one
subcommittee Democrat predicted. ''This is not going to become
law,'' said Rep. Howard Berman of California. ''This is not going
to pass the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, immigrant-rights advocates say GOP Sen. Spencer Abraham of
Michigan, chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on
immigration, has privately assured them that he has no intention of
taking up INS restructuring this year. A spokesman for the senator,
Joe Davis, said restructuring does remain a priority for Abraham,
who intends to move ahead with his own legislation later this year.
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread consensus, within and outside the INS, that
reform is needed. The agency has struggled to meet its mandate
because of internal divisions, outmoded technology and management
missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the House legislation say separating the INS'
sometimes competing missions is necessary to improve enforcement
and the delivery of immigration benefits such as citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans deserve better than Barnum and Bailey at the
border,'' said Smith, who is a persistent INS critic.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would create separate bureaus of immigration
enforcement and services within the Justice Department, headed by
separate directors and funded by distinct budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend the plan will create new problems because it
does not allow for one manager to oversee both bureaus, whose
functions will overlap at certain points. They also worry that the
services bureau would be financially starved while the enforcement
operation, which has proved far more popular with congressional
appropriators, would be flush.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation fails to create a proper balance between
enforcement and services and does not provide an effective way to
direct, coordinate and integrate enforcement and service
functions,'' Assistant Attorney General Robert Raben wrote Smith in
a letter dated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and congressional Democrats are pushing a
rival plan, rejected Wednesday by the subcommittee, that would
establish an associate attorney general position to oversee the
enforcement and services operations.
</P>
<P>
   Just four months ago, the subcommittee approved a restructuring
bill that addressed some of the administration's concerns. But amid
Republican complaints that the administration had no intention of
restructuring the INS, Smith abandoned it.
</P>
<P>
   Smith accused the administration of ''dishonest negotiation'' --
a charge rejected by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither the administration nor Democrats on the subcommittee
have decided to back away from meaningful reform,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>

</P>

   EDITOR'S NOTE: The INS restructuring bill is H.R. 3918.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks reclaimed their leadership of
the stock market Wednesday, driving the Nasdaq composite index
higher as investors bought shares of chip makers, Internet
companies and beaten-down biotech firms.

   The Nasdaq rose 153.07 to close at 4,864.75.

<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 40.64 to 10,866.70,
having recovered from a loss of as much as 118 points.
</P>
<P>
   Strength in technology also helped the broad Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 to a new record. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 6.77 to 1,500.64, capping a
steady advance in recent weeks that was often overshadowed by the
volatile swings of the Nasdaq and Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P's gains rewarded the millions of investors who have
sought the diversity of the broad market by pouring money into
mutual funds that mirror the index's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Nasdaq hit its last record on March 10, it has fallen
4 percent while the Dow has advanced more than 9 percent. The
Nasdaq tumbled as investors eager to take profits from its run
channeled money into the blue-chip Dow.
</P>

   Rambus rose 83 51/64 to 350] after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter

</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 5 9/16 to 144 1/16 and Yahoo! advanced 5 7/16 to 197

<P>
   ''A lot of money left the sector last week over concerns that
valuations were just too high,'' said Barry Hyman, senior equity
analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ''But there's still a lot of

</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered biotechnology sector recovered, helping the Amex
Biotechnology Index to a 10 percent gain. Human Genome Sciences
rose 13 25/64 to 105 7/16 and Biogen rose 3] to 81{.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stocks fell sharply last week amid profit-taking that
gathered steam after President Clinton said he wanted genetic data
to be openly shared rather than sold from company to company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gains, the broad market was still digesting the
Fed's latest interest rate increase Tuesday. The central bank has
now raised rates five times since last June in an effort to slow
the economy to a sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's rate increase gave stocks an unexpected shot of
strength, helping the Dow to a 227-point gain. Rising rates are
generally bad for stocks because they cut into corporate profits.
This time, however, investors were hopeful the Fed is nearing the
end of its series of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Wall Street expect the Fed to raise rates one more time,
at its May meeting, before holding steady in advance of the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert fell 1] to 93| after agreeing to pull its
diabetes drug Rezulin from the market. The Food and Drug
Administration said competing drugs offer the same benefits without
Rezulin's side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist
at Goldman Sachs, raised her S&AMP;P 500 year-end target to 1,575 from
1,525, citing ongoing global economic expansion. Cohen also raised
her target for the Dow to 12,600 from 12,300.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the

</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which had slumped
in recent sessions after reaching new records early this month,
rose 18.40 to 571.19.

   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Touts Her New Role  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL BECK, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Enough with the talk about the president, Monica
Lewinsky has embarked on her next calling in life: Businesswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky has put an ''Inc.'' after her name and is selling a
line of high-end handbags on the Internet and at one of New York's
toniest designer shops.
</P>
<P>
   But she still faces skeptics who wonder if she can build her
name into a respected brand or will quickly fall from notoriety
like other celebrities-by-scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does Monica represent a bad girl, a heroine, a victim?'' said
John Grace, executive director of the marketing consulting firm
Interbrand Group. ''She has to figure out what she wants to be, and
run with it ... of course, there are no guarantees how long she
will last.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's image of Lewinsky is mostly of camera-shy young
woman who tried to avoid publicity once her trysts with Clinton
made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's seeking the spotlight -- to a point.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky agreed to an interview Wednesday, but only if no
questions about Clinton were posed. Her bags have been on the
market since September, but she wouldn't disclose any sales
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her reticence, Lewinsky still hopes her fame brings her
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people relate to me,'' she said. ''While some of their
situations might have been different and my experiences might have
been different, the feelings that I had as a result of them were
very similar to the feelings that a lot of people have.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky attracted a curious crowd Wednesday during a personal
appearance at Henri Bendel, a Fifth Avenue department store known
for offering edgy fashions to New York's ultra rich.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people -- from giddy tourists to cynical locals --
jammed into the store to catch a glimpse of the woman who almost
brought down a president.
</P>
<P>
   Many were willing to pay nearly $200 for one of her
square-shaped, fabric bags, which Lewinsky says she designs
herself. They are sold only at Bendel's and on her Web site,
http://www.therealmonicainc.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is neat that Monica could take all of the bad
things that happened to her and turn it around. I really respect
her for everything,'' said Jill Kesler, a 20-year-old from Clovis,
N.M., who was one of the first waiting on line and bought a bag.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky first started stitching the bags the while being cooped
up at home during the Clinton mess.
</P>
<P>
   The bags, made of silk, velvet and other fabrics, have a label
on the outside that says ''Made especially for you by Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Bendel's general manager Ed Burstell, said early indications are
that her line will be a hot seller. During the holiday season, the
store stocked 100 bags and sold all of them quickly without a word
of advertising, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said she hopes to expand into new areas, such as
accessories and products for mothers-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her new business, Lewinsky also continues to act as a
commercial spokeswoman for the weight loss center Jenny Craig. She
reported receiving a lot of positive feedback from people who laud
her for being open about her weight problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky's apparent early success doesn't guarantee anything
for the future.
</P>
<P>
   There is a long list of people -- from Gary Hart's mistress Donna
Rice to Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss -- who used their scandalous
fame to gain more notoriety, and ended up fading from the public
eye.
</P>
<P>
   ''People can become brands, look at Martha Stewart and Oprah
Winfrey. Everyone knows what they stand for and their brands will
last longer because of that,'' said Michael Halloran, president of
Optimum Group, a marketing firm in Cincinnati. ''But I'm not sure
that Monica can be as effective in selling and promoting herself as
a brand. Her past is tough to forget.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Casts Away China-Trade Problem  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore relegated two priorities to the wings
Wednesday -- the administration's longstanding trade agenda with
China and fund-raising reforms newly trumpeted in his presidential
race -- as he papered over Democratic differences on trade and
pledged his gratitude to $10,000 campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
   In a private morning caucus with congressional Democrats, Gore
spoke on the House floor about what Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
called the party's ''seamless agenda'' for education, HMO patients'
rights, a minimum wage increase and campaign finance reform, an
issue Gore skipped at a fund raiser three hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not, he acknowledged, press the case for permanent
trade benefits or World Trade Organization membership for China.
The Clinton administration has made those top goals despite fierce
opposition by some Democrats and by labor unions that are
contributing considerable footwork and financing to Gore's
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''The subject did not come up. ... We did not get into a
discussion of too many issues,'' Gore told reporters in a Capitol
corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was more of a reunion and a discussion of where we go from
here. But I, of course, support China (trade benefits) and am happy
to confirm that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for earlier pledges to lobby for the trade measures, Gore
said: ''I've talked with undecided members and I intend to continue
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   On campaign finance reform, which he has seized since Republican
John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley, both vocal reformers,
dropped from the presidential race, Gore said the issue was the
reason ''why so many of the voters in both parties -- not to mention
independents -- are supporting my campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Republicans solidly backing Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, whom Gore now calls ''the titular head of the Republican
Party,'' and independents roughly splitting between the two, if not
leaning toward Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If the trade dispute made for an awkward meeting in the House
chamber, Gephardt, who has been in the vanguard of opponents to the
administration's trade agenda with China, did not let on. ''You're
never going to find two human beings in the world that agree on
every last issue,'' said Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   He focused on his party's political unity and noted Gore's
fund-raising help for Democratic candidates aiming to take control
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will do more. We're really helping one another. This is a
mutual admiration and mutual aid society that we're involved in,''
Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   To wit, Gore's next stop was the opulent St. Regis Hotel near
the White House, where 70 people contributing $10,000 apiece inched
the Democratic National Committee closer to its $100 million
fund-raising goal for the year.
</P>
<P>
   With five more DNC fund-raisers -- in Cincinnati, Detroit and
Houston -- on Gore's Thursday and Friday schedule, his take on
behalf of the party this week was expected to top $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Each guest on Wednesday received with his lunch of seared beef
fillet a silver-plated picture frame tucked into a gift box stamped
with the gold vice presidential seal. Their donations would be
split, DNC officials said, between so-called ''hard money'' and
''soft money'' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties use unrestricted soft money donations to
run ads promoting their candidates and knocking down the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a big fight looming in the next 7{ months,'' Gore
told the contributors. ''If we do it right, then the future opens
up with bright vistas for all of our people. We need to keep our
prosperity going, make sure nobody is left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   He tweaked Bush for considering school improvements a local
matter, saying they should be a national priority commanding
national resources. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer responded:
''Governor Bush and other education reformers nationwide have
proven that excellence in education comes from high standards,
strict accountability and local control.''
</P>
<P>
   In his luncheon address, Gore never mentioned campaign finance
reform, but did promise to remember his donors' largesse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am grateful beyond my ability to tell you in mere words. But
I will demonstrate it to you by working my heart out during this
campaign to lay out this contrast (with Republicans) as a message
of hope that I believe is justified by the solid proposals and
policies that can help us create this bright future,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, at a meeting with defense reporters, Gore's national
security adviser, Leon S. Fuerth, said the vice president does not
have a blueprint for allowing gays to serve openly in the military,
as he has promised to do if elected. ''That's one of the things he
needs to work out very quickly upon taking office,'' Fuerth said,
adding it will take ''an honest dialogue with the people he has to
lead as commander in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Current policy permits gays to serve in the military as long
they keep their sexuality private.

<HEADLINE> More witnesses appear before Camden grand jury  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- A federal grand jury investigating
allegations of corruption in Camden city government heard from more
witnesses Wednesday, including several former city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury ordered two of them to bring records and files,
witnesses said. All the witnesses arrived at the federal courthouse
in the morning and did not return in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors, however, met for more than an hour past their regular
dismissal time, which has been 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Grand jury proceedings are secret, but witnesses and jurors can
be seen entering the grand jury room from a public hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Attorney Renee Baum would not speak to reporters
during the session, and refused to comment when the grand jury was
dismissed for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Martir, attorney for Mayor Milton Milan, has said his
client is the target of a federal probe and that he expects Milan
to be indicted soon. Milan has denied any wrongdoing or criminal
activity.
</P>
<P>
   But the grand jury has subpoenaed Milan's payroll records and
requested information about political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, city lawmakers have been subpoenaed to appear
and questioned about a wide range of issues including city
contracts, organized crime and contractors who performed repairs on
Milan's East Camden home.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, FBI agents raided Milan's home and City Hall Office
and carted away boxes of documents.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses at the recent federal trial of two men convicted of
running a multimillion-dollar cocaine cartel in Camden said Milan
sold cocaine in the 1980s and tipped off drug dealers about
upcoming raids after becoming mayor in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's witnesses included former City Councilman William
Spearman, now an official with the Coopers Ferry Redevelopment
Corporation. Spearman said he was told to bring several files with
him, but would not say what those files were.
</P>
<P>
   Spearman did say the grand jury asked him to be available to
answer questions next week.
</P>
<P>
   Another official from the city's planning commission brought
several boxes of documents Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   And Democratic fund-raiser Mike DiFilippo, a one-time member of
the Milan administration, also appeared. He would not comment after
his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Also appearing was restaurateur Mario Longo. His lawyer, Jeffrey
Zucker, said Longo owns several Italian Bistro franchises in
southern New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Runaway Van Kills Student  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, N.C. (AP) -- A van unexpectedly shifted into reverse
then plowed backward into students waiting for classes to begin at
a middle school Wednesday. A 10-year-old boy was killed and six
other children and the driver were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The minivan's driver had just dropped off two children at
Smithfield Middle School when the vehicle suddenly lurched into
reverse, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden, we saw a van going really fast in reverse,''
said Brittany Sherman, 14. ''It hit a student, and he went
flying.''
</P>
<P>
   As students frantically tried to get out of its path, the van
crossed a sandy yard, knocked down a flagpole and finally stopped
when it hit the school's brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   One student was trapped beneath the van, and others were briefly
pinned between the van and the building, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put my hands on my face and started crying and praying,''
said Melissa Cockrell, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Byrone Murray died a short time later at Johnston Memorial
Hospital, said spokeswoman Susan Phillips. An 11-year-old student
and the driver were in stable condition. Three other students were
treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   At UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill, a 12-year-old boy was in
critical condition with head injuries, and an 11-year-old student
was in serious condition with broken bones, pelvic injuries and
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at 7:45 a.m. outside the school's front
door.
</P>
<P>
   Police were still trying to determine why the minivan
unexpectedly shifted into reverse.
</P>
<P>
   A crisis team of social workers, counselors and psychologists
was sent to the school but classes continued as scheduled.

<HEADLINE> NASA Chief Admits To Problems  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- NASA, trying to do more missions with less
money and fewer people, made management mistakes that contributed
to a string of recent failures in space, the chief of the agency
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We probably cut too tight'' in reducing the NASA work force
from 25,000 to 18,500 over the last seven years, Daniel S. Goldin,
NASA's administrator, told the Senate Commerce subcommittee on
space. ''We found we were really too thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said the agency lost many veteran engineers over those
years, and there was inadequate training and mentoring for young,
inexperienced workers who were hired.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, he said, there was a failure in communication
between engineers and technicians doing the work and the management
personnel overseeing it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no good communication feedback,'' Goldin said.
''People were talking and we weren't hearing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., chairman of the subcommittee, said he
called the hearing to get an explanation for what he called a
''very difficult'' year for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   During 1999, two NASA probes to Mars were lost without a trace;
shuttle missions were delayed because of damaged or troublesome
equipment; workers accidentally threw away tanks built for the
International Space Station, and an urgent mission to repair the
Hubble Space Telescope was required.
</P>
<P>
   ''For $14 billion a year, the American taxpayers deserve
better,'' said Frist.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. said that in reports examining the
1999 problems of NASA ''the extent of mismanagement ... is very
startling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the past year, I have continually been amazed by the
reports coming out of NASA about mission failures and program
delays,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In his response, Goldin said that since 1992 NASA has launched
146 payloads valued at $18 billion and experienced only 10
failures, worth about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that NASA had ''some severe disappointments and
problems'' in 1999, but added: ''We are paying close attention to
these failures, examining them, searching for root causes, and
recommending changes.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the problems, said Goldin, is a change in the
culture at NASA. Whereas once the agency mounted only a few
missions at great expense, it is now emphasizing a ''faster,
better, cheaper'' philosophy that calls for more, but smaller and
less costly missions.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier years, NASA launched two planetary probes a decade,
each costing billions of dollars, he said. Now the agency is
sending missions to other planets each year at a fraction of the
cost.
</P>
<P>
   But the new management philosophy does have flaws, including
stressed, overworked employees who lack the experience or the time
to do jobs properly, said Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somehow, it is not working,'' said Frist.
</P>
<P>
   ''I agree,'' said Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   The administrator said NASA is in the process of hiring 2,000
new workers, establishing a formal training program for young
engineers, and conducting a top-to-bottom evaluation of the space
agency systems.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin was repeatedly asked about a published report that NASA
engineers knew of a rocket engine flaw in a Mars-bound probe. The
report said that NASA conducted flawed tests on ground models of
the rocket engines, and then tried to cover up information about
the problems. The Mars probe disappeared after firing its braking
rockets while approaching the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are very, very great irregularities in that press
report,'' said Goldin. He said the rocket problems were identified
and discussed publicly a month before the mission failure. He said
that engineers conducted honest tests, and that they believed the
problem was solved.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee also asked Goldin about a press story that a
report critical of the agency was being withheld until it could be
evaluated by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin denied this, saying that the report will be released next
week. He said the report has not been changed by NASA and that the
White House is not involved.

<HEADLINE> DNA Doesn't Link Jefferson, Woodson  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A DNA test has again failed to link
a descendant of Monticello slave Tom Woodson to Thomas Jefferson,
according to a retired pathologist who performed the test.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson's descendants claim he was the son of the third
president and slave Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene A. Foster, a former pathologist, conducted the DNA test
on the Rev. Thomas Woodson of Dayton, Ohio, a descendant of Tom
Woodson's third son. The analysis did not find a match with the
Jefferson family Y chromosome, which passes unchanged from son to
son.
</P>
<P>
   Previous DNA tests by Foster showed similar results with other
descendants of Tom Woodson, but they have linked the Jefferson
family's Y chromosome to descendants of Eston Hemings, the youngest
son of Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Golden of Pittsburgh, president of the Woodson Family
Association, said Tuesday that ''our oral history is still with us
and our family research is ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation said a
panel of scholars had concluded that Jefferson likely fathered at
least one, and possibly all, of Hemings' children.

<HEADLINE> Robertson Reaffirming Vows  </HEADLINE>
By SONJA BARISIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson
plans to celebrate his 70th birthday by reaffirming the ordination
vows he gave up when he ran for president in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson was ordained in 1960 as a Southern Baptist minister in
the Freemason Street Baptist Church of Norfolk. He will reaffirm
those vows Monday at Regent University, the evangelical Christian
school he founded in Virginia Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a recognition of the fact that his ministry has become
worldwide,'' Vinson Synan, dean of Regent's School of Divinity,
said Wednesday. ''This will restore him to the ministry to become a
clergyman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Donald J. Dunlap, pastor at Freemason when Robertson's
ordination was terminated, said the reaffirmation will have no
standing -- at least within the Southern Baptist Convention.

<HEADLINE> Parts of Plane Found in Panama  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY (AP) -- The remains of a Panamanian plane missing for
five days were spotted on a mountaintop Wednesday. The plane
apparently crashed, killing all 10 people on board, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials initially thought the twin-engine plane, missing since
Friday, may have been hijacked, possibly by Colombian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Security and Defense director Pablo Quintero Luna told reporters
that a search helicopter had spotted the remains of the plane on
top of the Pico Carreto mountain, just south of Puerto Obaldia, the
port city near the Colombian border where the plane was heading.
</P>
<P>
   Upon closer inspection, investigators determined that there were
no survivors, Quintero said. He did not reveal any other details
about the state of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to recover the bodies were called off for the day but
were to resume early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Twin Otter plane had left from Panama City, 180 miles to the
west, with eight passengers and two crew members.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had believed the plane had been hijacked because
there were no reports of noise, smoke, radio transmissions or other
evidence that it had crashed. In November, Colombian guerrillas
disguised as tourists stole two private helicopters in the Puerto
Obaldia area.

<HEADLINE> 100 Arrests Made in London Slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Police cracked down on racial intolerance,
arresting three men in connection with the 1993 killing of a black
teen-ager, and picking up 100 suspected racists in separate raids
around the capital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The brutal murder of Stephen Lawrence, 18, by a gang of white
youths and the failure of the police to investigate adequately
prompted a national debate on racism and how police handle such
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Five white youths were identified as suspects after the April
1993 killing in east London. None has been successfully prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The two new arrests Tuesday night came as Lawrence's family
appealed on a British Broadcasting Corp. program for anyone with
information about the slaying to contact police. A third man was
arrested on Wednesday, and all three were released on police bail.
Their identities were not made public.
</P>
<P>
   Police said none of the arrests resulted from the television
appeal, but that it had prompted more than 70 telephone calls, some
of which were useful.
</P>
<P>
   A separate series of police raids Wednesday resulted in the
arrest of 100 people on suspicion of offenses that included threats
to kill and racially aggravated criminal damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our aim is to create a hostile environment for those who,
because of racism and prejudice, wish to undermine communities and
destroy the principle of justice for all,'' said Detective Chief
Superintendent John Godsave.
</P>
<P>
   He said none of the arrests appeared to be linked to any
far-right racist group or the Lawrence case.
</P>
<P>
   A public inquiry after the Lawrence case found London police
institutionally racist, prompting a government pledge to take a
more active role in combating racial intolerance. Wednesday's raids
stemmed from the work of units set up in June in each of the
capital's 32 boroughs to target those responsible for racist
crimes.

<HEADLINE> Ocean County districts winners, so far, in school constructiondebate  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The ongoing multi-billion dollar school
construction debate was already fraying legislative nerves when GOP
Assembly sponsors quietly inserted special language that would
benefit a half dozen Ocean County school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the amendments, these districts would either move ahead of
other suburban districts in the line for zero interest loans, or
get a crack at both state aid and loans for new building projects.
Under the original bill, districts could either apply for state aid
or building loans, but not both.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins defends the move, but it remains
to be seen whether other lawmakers will douse his enthusiasm with
special requests of their own, or whether Gov. Christie Whitman
will go along with the plan if it reaches her desk intact.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how the school construction bill treats Barnegat
Township, Brick Township, Jackson Township, Lakewood, Ocean
Township and Toms River school districts, compared to other,
similar districts in the same lower-moderate income class.
</P>
<P>
   Language granting the lucky six preferential status was written
by the Ocean County legislative delegation, and was included on
page 60 of 66 pages of amendments that were quietly slipped into
the bill minutes before an Assembly Education Committee hearing
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are particular districts that have particular
problems,'' Collins, the bill's sponsor, said after word of the
special language spread. ''Supporters of that amendment put forth
these ideas and ... I'm comfortable with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnegat schools Superintendent Robert L. Hornbelt believes his
district is deserving. The fast-growing K-8 district sends more
than $9 million a year, about one third of its budget, to Southern
Regional High School to educate its 930 pupils. Hornbelt said his
district cannot afford to build its own much-needed high school and
Southern cannot afford to lose the Barnegat students without the
special bill language.
</P>
<P>
   If other districts believe they, too, warrant special treatment,
they should have gotten their lawmakers to do their bidding in
Trenton as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They should have addressed their issues for their districts
years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The special language may not have a long shelf life, however.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard H. Bagger,
R-Union, this week said he opposes the amendment because it opens
the door to more legislative mischief.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very natural reaction,'' he said of the likelihood of
other lawmakers seeking additional amendments. ''But as this bill
moves toward enactment, a decision needs to be made about whether
to allow a growing garden of special provisions or to put something
in there ensuring that school districts share equally.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials and lawmakers are worried that there is not
enough loan money squirreled away in the approximately $10 billion
bill for the roughly 250 districts that are too affluent to qualify
for direct state aid. Bagger said he has some ideas, none of which
involve special treatment for specific districts.
</P>
<P>
   Bagger said he won't reschedule an Appropriations Committee
hearing on the bill until Collins, Whitman and Senate President
Donald DiFrancesco work out larger philosophical questions
surrounding the level of school construction funding for the
state's 30 so-called special needs districts. DiFrancesco and the
governor favor full state funding for these poor districts; Collins
wants to fund only those projects that address safety concerns or
overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   A lobbyist who works for a coalition of middle class school
districts shares Bagger's fears that other lawmakers may jump on
the Ocean County bandwagon, possibly dooming the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is so much of a red flag that one wonders if it's a red
herring,'' said Lynne Strickland of the Garden State Coalition of
Schools. ''Not in terms of these districts needing aid, but in
terms of what's going on here in the legislative process.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has no objections to Collins including the towns in the
bill -- if he can get it through both houses. But she expressed
doubt earlier this week that that would happen, noting that once
lawmakers start singling out a few districts, others are sure to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to veto it because of that,'' said Whitman.

<HEADLINE> Radiation Records Being Investigated  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is investigating whether
officials at federal uranium enrichment plants falsified radiation
exposure records for workers, the Department of Energy's top safety
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have heard those allegations and we're pursuing them,''
said David Michaels, assistant secretary for environment, safety
and health.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels made his comments after Jeffrey Walburn, a guard at the
Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio, told Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee members not to believe anything they
read about exposure levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The records are not accurate or believable,'' said Walburn,
who suffers from respiratory problems. ''They can make your
dosimetry (radiation measurement) a tailor-made reading of what
they want it to reveal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Orick of Knoxville, Tenn., showed senators a copy of a
medical report her husband -- a co-worker -- received after a 1973
accident at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Tennessee. The
handwritten document has two parts blacked out where plant
officials hid the identity of the red-and-white powder with which
he came in contact.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Orick said her husband suffers breathing problems and said
her family is frustrated they cannot find out what caused the
ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I bet we can,'' replied committee chairman Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., prompting an ovation from what had been a hushed audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can they treat him properly if they don't know what
they're dealing with? We need to do something about that,'' he told
Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels said the Clinton administration is working on
legislation to compensate sick workers. Thompson warned the bill
should not rely on questionable documents or force workers to
demonstrate exposure levels that cannot be proven.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson already has said
''that the burden of proof should not be on workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, urged speedy action.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer we wait the worse it gets,'' he said. ''A lot of
people need some medical care (and) some real compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has proposed offering medical
benefits, lost-wage reimbursement, optional job retraining or a
single $100,000 cash payment to workers suffering illnesses caused
by exposure to beryllium. In addition, the administration has
proposed compensation of $100,000 apiece to workers at the Paducah
plant exposed to radioactive materials known to cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But other workers remain in limbo. Thompson's committee heard
from some of them.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer victim Sam Ray of Lucasville, Ohio, said he worked at
Portsmouth for decades without any protective clothing. Walburn,
who lives in Greenup, Ky., said he does not believe he was told the
truth about what he inhaled during a 1994 accident at Portsmouth
that permanently damaged his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Plant officials) testified in a federal deposition in 1994
that we were only exposed to low levels of (the toxic chemical)
fluorine,'' he said. ''I beg to differ. ... My wife held me in her
arms and watched my lung lining bubble out my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the illnesses suffered by workers are real and
should be acknowledged by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for the federal government to stop automatically
denying any responsibility and face up to the fact that it appears
as though it (the government) made at least some people sick,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Medicine Blamed for Plane Incident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A bad reaction to prescription blood
pressure medicine may have caused a man to barge into the cockpit
of an Alaska Airlines jet and attack the crew, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bradley, 39, remained jailed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, of Blue Springs, Mo., is charged with interfering with
crew members and attendants on a March 16 flight from Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said he lunged for the controls, cursing and shouting
''I'm going to kill you,'' and was wrestled away by the pilot and
subdued by fellow passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a carpenter with no criminal record or history of
mental health problems, stood quietly in court while a federal
prosecutor argued for his detention without bail until trial. He
could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Jerrold Ladar told reporters that Bradley has
little recollection of the incident and that tests after the arrest
turned up no signs of illegal drugs or alcohol. He said Bradley may
have had a reaction to prescription drugs he takes for high blood
pressure.

<HEADLINE> Herbs With Diabetes Drug Recalled  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two herbal preparations found to contain a
blood sugar-lowering drug have been recalled by two California
firms, the Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled products are Dianolyn Capsules, made by Diabetic
Capital of Alhambra, Calif., and Dimelstat, manufactured by
SciQuest Lab Inc. of Brea, Calif. Both are said to contain
''dangerously high'' amounts of glyburide, a drug used to lower
blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   SciQuest and Diabetic Capital announced the recalls in
statements released by the FDA. The announcements are on company
letterheads, but they have virtually identical wording and were
based on a model drawn up by the FDA, according to agency spokesman
Brad Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who have low blood sugar or those with diabetes run the
risk of serious or life threatening complications if they consume
these products,'' the announcements said.
</P>
<P>
   The statements urged consumers to stop using Dianolyn Capsules
and Dimelstat and to seek medical advice, ''especially if they are
currently being treated with other anti-diabetic drugs or if they
have symptoms of fatigue, excessive hunger, profuse sweating, or
numbness of extremities.''
</P>
<P>
   Diabetic Capital said it was recalling all Dianolyn Capsules
distributed prior to Wednesday. It said the product is sold
nationally and promoted in Chinese language radio commercials and
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Dianolyn Capsules are light brown and packed in blister packs,
with 30 capsules per box. The boxes are printed with pictures of a
man with green leaves in the background. The label claims the
product contains only natural herbal ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Dimelstat capsules are packaged in a white bottle. Each capsule
contains a brown powder and they are sold 60 to the bottle. The
product lot number is 0915, the company said. SciQuest sells the
product by mail order and through specialty herb stores.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies said consumers could receive refunds if the
products are returned to the place of purchase. And both companies
claimed there have been no reported illnesses from the products.
</P>
<P>
   The recall action comes just two months after the FDA issued a
warning about five other herbal products that contained blood-sugar
lowering drugs. That warning came after a diabetic herb user in
California suffered hypoglycemia after taking the products.
</P>
<P>
   California investigators found that those five products
contained either glyburide or another suger-lowering drug, even
though makers of the products said they contained only natural
Chinese herbs.

<HEADLINE> 50 Killed in Nigerian Pipeline Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- A pipeline fire killed at least 50 people
who were siphoning off gasoline in southeastern Nigeria, state-run
television reported.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what sparked the blaze in the early
hours of the morning Wednesday in a remote part of Abia state.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters from nearby Umuahia and Aba cities rushed to the
scene, but were unable to contain the flames which raged on into
the night.
</P>
<P>
   The charred remains of the victims -- who included men, women and
children -- were scattered around the pipeline, along with
motorbikes, shoes, clothing and fuel containers, television
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 28 people suspected of being vandals.
</P>
<P>
   Pipeline sabotage is common in this poverty-wracked West African
nation, and vandals have triggered several explosions in the past.
</P>
<P>
   A massive explosion and deadly fire killed at least 700 people
in October 1998 in the Niger Delta town of Jesse, including many
who had gathered around the area to try to collect spilling fuel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Lawmakers have moved to make Mississippi
the second state in the nation with a law banning homosexual
couples from adopting children.
</P>
<P>
   The ban easily cleared the House 107-8 Wednesday. The bill now

</P>
<P>
   Only Florida has a law forbidding gay adoptions.

Republican Rep. Bobby Howell, who had proposed the prohibition this
year for the first time at the urging of family groups.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi Baptists and the Tupelo-based American Family
Association support the proposal. On the other side are the
American Civil Liberties Union, which has threatened a lawsuit, and
homosexual groups.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Trooper accused in fatal 1998 collision admits drinking nine beers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- A state trooper accused of drunken
driving and aggravated manslaughter in a 1998 crash admitted
drinking nine beers before the crash, but said it was the other
driver who ran a red light.
</P>
<P>
   At times crying, Detective Sgt. Mark J. Murphy testified Tuesday
in his own defense, telling jurors that victim Darrin Cranmer was
at fault for the June 5, 1998 wreck on U.S. 9 in Beachwood.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 37, of Pine Beach, said he worked an early shift June 4,
then stopped at a hospitality tent near the Statehouse and drank
two beers. At 6 p.m., he drank another two at a sergeant's union
meeting in Hamilton Township, followed by four or five in a lodge
immediately after that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he drove to a promotion party in Mansfield, where he had
another beer before getting in his unmarked State Police cruiser to
drive home.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he had a clear state of mind as he drove south in
Beachwood. He said Cranmer, 27, of West Creek drove through a red
light at Surf Avenue and that Murphy tried unsuccessfully to swerve
to avoid him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy ran the light,'' he said he told a woman who came to
his aid as he sat by the side of the road after the collision.
Crying on the stand, Murphy said ''I was upset,'' when told that
Cranmer died.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Murphy had a blood-alcohol level of .14.
Cranmer's was .24.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy suffered a broken collarbone in the wreck. Cranmer died
at the scene. Cranmer's girlfriend, Cherilyn Saxen, 25, of
Waretown, suffered a broken arm and lacerated liver.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year veteran of the State Police, Murphy is currently
suspended without pay. Jurors considering aggravated manslaughter
and vehicular homicide charges against him deliberated for about
two hours Wednesday before quitting for the night. They are to
resume at 9 a.m. Thursday.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Waterfront Eyed for Improvement  </HEADLINE>
By CANDACE SMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dirty and polluted Anacostia River
waterfront in the nation's capital is in line for a face-lift.
</P>
<P>
   Goals for the area include a job service center, national parks,
a 55-acre federal center, 5,000 new jobs for the Navy Yard, a river
walk, improvements of Robert F. Kennedy Stadium, and restoring the
environmental health of Heritage and Kingman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, Mayor Anthony A.
Williams, D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and other federal and
city officials boarded a 4,000-ton Navy destroyer in the Washington
Navy Yard Wednesday to sign an agreement in which they pledged to
work together to revitalize the historic river and its banks.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in our history, we will have a coordinated
plan for our waterfront,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said more than $25 million in proposed federal funding
and $100 million in private investment would be used to revitalize
the long-neglected waterfront communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''For centuries, the Anacostia River has served the people of
this Capital City -- and even before that, the Native Americans who
made their home along its banks. As our nation's capital has
prospered and grown, some regions have been left behind,'' Slater
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy Yard on the banks of the river, established in 1799, is
one of the oldest continuous operating federal facilities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has gotten much of the blame for
polluting and neglecting the river and surrounding area. Slater
said the agreement reaffirms the federal government's commitment to

<HEADLINE> Cocaine, Heroin Prices Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The prices of cocaine and heroin have fallen
to record lows and the drugs remain widely available, federal
officials say, while insisting that progress is being made against
drug use in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for presentation Thursday before a House
Appropriations subcommittee, White House drug control policy
director Barry McCaffrey cites declines in youth drug use and
drug-related crime during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But he also notes that heroin has become more popular among
young people and says methamphetamines have a ''serious potential
nationally to become the next 'crack' cocaine epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   While use of cocaine itself has stabilized, it continues to be
readily available in nearly all metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of McCaffrey's statement and his office's annual report
for 2000 were obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   After an upward trend between 1992 and 1997, heroin use appears
to be declining, the report said. But, it added, ''unprecedented
retail purity and low prices in the United States indicate that
heroin is readily accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said small buys of heroin averaged $1,798.80 per pure
gram, a record low. In bulk, it averaged $317.97 a gram. A gram is
about the weight of a paper clip, or about 0.036 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to cocaine, the report indicates the average price per
pure gram of cocaine, for buyers of one gram or less, was $169.25
in 1998, the second lowest price on record back to 1981. Only in
1996 was it cheaper, at $159.05 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   For buyers of 10 to 100 grams, the price per pure gram fell to
an average of $44.51, the report added.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the report estimated that there were 454 metric tons of
cocaine shipped to the United States in 1998, up from 396 metric
tons a year earlier. A metric ton is 2,205 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana remained the most readily available illegal drug, the
report added. It said prices ranged from $400 to $1,000 per pound
in the Southwest to between $700 and $2,000 per pound in the
Midwest and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Methamphetamine ''remains one of the most dangerous substances
America has ever confronted,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   His report estimated that 4.7 million people have tried this
drug and said its use is spreading. The average price per pure gram
was estimated at about $140, down from more than $225 in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Electric Chair on Death Row in Ga.  </HEADLINE>
By RUSS BYNUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia lawmakers voted Wednesday to phase out
the electric chair and make lethal injection the state's primary
means of execution.
</P>
<P>
   The vote comes two months after a similar move in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   If Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes approves, Alabama and Nebraska would
be the only states still using the electric chair as their sole
means of execution.
</P>
<P>
   ''This makes it a humane sort of thing that will give dignity,
even to the families,'' said Democratic Rep. E.C. Tillman, the
bill's sponsor, who believes electrocution is cruel and unusual
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia passed its current death penalty law in 1973. A decade
passed before the first execution, but since then, there have been
23, all by electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   The switch to lethal injection -- approved by wide margins in
both houses of the Legislature -- was proposed because lawmakers
feared the U.S. Supreme Court might strike down electrocution in
response to lawsuits from inmates. The high court recently rejected
one such appeal and canceled its review of the other, but a similar
challenge is pending before the Georgia Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation sent to Barnes on Wednesday, death row
inmates convicted of crimes committed May 1 and thereafter would
die by injection. The 127 inmates already on death row would still
die in the electric chair. The phase-out is to prevent reopening
their cases, since some death sentences specify the executions be
carried out by electrocution.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a death penalty supporter, plans to review the bill
before deciding whether to sign it into law, a spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Subway Shove Case  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A schizophrenic man was convicted of murder
Wednesday after his second trial for shoving a woman to her death
in front of an oncoming subway.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Goldstein faces 25 years to life in prison when he is
sentenced in April for the second-degree murder of Kendra Ann
Webdale. He will likely serve the sentence in a state prison that
can give him psychiatric care.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's first trial ended with a deadlocked jury.
</P>
<P>
   He showed no emotion after the verdict was read, but members of
Webdale's family wept and hugged each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been such a nightmare that I wouldn't want to use the
word happy, but I feel like jumping for joy,'' said her mother,
Patricia Webdale.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no comment,'' Goldstein's attorney, Kevin Canfield,
said as he left the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, 30, was charged with murder in the Jan. 3, 1999,
death of Webdale, 32, who aspired to a career in the recording
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Canfield admitted that Goldstein pushed Webdale in front of an
oncoming train at the 23rd Street-Broadway station, but says he did
it because he is mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant District Attorney William Greenbaum argued that it
was revenge, not mental illness, that drove Goldstein. Rebuffed by
one blonde woman on the platform, he targeted Webdale to get even,
Greenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Goldstein attacked Webdale while refusing to take his
anti-psychotic medicine, the case led to a law last year that
allows violent mental patients to medicated by force. It is called
''Kendra's Law.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The jury verdict ends a sad chapter for the Webdale family but
the reforms they championed will help all New Yorkers long into the
future,'' Gov. George Pataki said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> 1st Fla. Citrus Shipped to China  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ROYSE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A trade deal with China has borne fruit
for Florida farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Chinese will get their first taste of Florida
oranges and grapefruit as shipments of fresh citrus to China begin
reaching that nation under a recently signed trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford will personally take the
first shipment of Florida citrus to China this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the most populous nation on Earth, China offers abundant
opportunities to our growers,'' said Crawford. ''The doors have
opened to China, and Florida citrus is going to soon be on the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   China has a population of 1.2 billion and the state Agriculture
Department estimates that up to 300 million of them might buy
Florida citrus.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement follows talks last year in which China agreed to
move toward opening its markets to a number of U.S. agricultural
products that had long been banned in the Asian nation because of
worries over plant diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Barriers to sales of U.S. wheat and beef also have been eased
recently.
</P>
<P>
   For Florida citrus growers, the deal could mean more than $300
million in extra sales in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's excitement, a great deal of excitement about this,''
said Wendy Bourland, a spokeswoman for Lakeland-based Florida
Citrus Mutual, the state's largest citrus grower's group. ''This is
a major development and a long time coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a 40 percent tariff will be imposed on anyone shipping
Florida citrus to China. Some growers think that means they won't
be able to afford to ship there.
</P>
<P>
   If China is accepted into the World Trade Organization, or is
accepted as a normal trading partner with the United States, that
surcharge would likely be reduced to about 12 percent, said
Agriculture Department Spokesman Terry McElroy.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has opened an office in Beijing to promote citrus and
Crawford sent a delegation last fall to meet with officials on how
to best market Florida's agricultural products there.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials came here in January to see how Florida deals
with agricultural pests and how it inspects fruit for export. Their
primary concern was medflies, said Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   ''We brought their scientists to Florida to show them we do have
the protections, to show them there won't be any diseased fruit,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Florida and California, citrus growers in Texas
also will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Florida grows more than 50 percent of the world's grapefruit and
about 20 percent of the world's oranges, according to agriculture
officials. The top foreign importer of Florida citrus currently is
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The world's second-most populous nation, India, also agreed last
year to lift restrictions on Florida citrus, but it, too, has a 40
percent tariff.

<HEADLINE> Big Dig Foreman Charged With Theft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A supervisor at a massive downtown Boston highway
project known as the Big Dig pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges
of selling tons of steel stolen from the project and pocketing the
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Mark S. Elliott, 40, was released on his own recognizance after
his arraignment in Boston Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Suffolk County prosecutor Gerry Stewart said
other suspects could be involved. He refused to detail the amount
of stolen steel, but other officials said tons had been taken. It
was not clear how much money Elliott allegedly received.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who refused comment as he left the courtroom, was
accused of selling steel purchased and used by his employer --
contractor J.F. White/Slattery/Interbeton/Perini -- to local scrap
yards.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Big Dig spokesman Jeremy Crockford said the theft
was an employer-employee matter that involved ''absolutely no
public money.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Dig, the $12.2 billion effort to bury Interstate 93 beneath
the city's business district, has come underfire for cost overruns.
The original price tage was $2.6 billion when ground was broken in
1991.

<HEADLINE> Cops To Favor Cooperative Gun Cos.  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Maintaining pressure on gun manufacturers, the
Clinton administration announced that 28 cities and counties will
give preference to gun makers that follow the lead of Smith &AMP;
Wesson -- producing safer firearms and adopting a code of
responsible conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''Government at every level should use their procurement
policies to support manufacturers who take responsible steps to
make guns safer and to keep guns out of the wrong hands,'' said
Andrew Cuomo, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who
announced the new gun-safety coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo urged communities of every size to join the effort and
said preferential buying can force the gun industry to fall in line
behind the Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement because sales to law
enforcement agencies represent 20 percent to 30 percent of the U.S.
gun market.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's common sense from police to buy guns from a company that
makes it harder for criminals to get hold of guns that can be used
against police and civilians,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, introduced legislation to block lawsuits by
the federal government against gun makers, calling such suits
''extortion'' and an attempt to impose gun control over
congressional objections.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch acted as the administration moved to capitalize on the
Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement which was reached by dropping the threat
of legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said his legislation would call a halt to ''frivolous and
burdensome lawsuits against law-abiding manufacturers, dealers and
firearms owners.'' He said it would also require ''the immediate
destruction of background check records in order to protect the
privacy rights of firearms owners'' and would bar the government
from charging fees for such checks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe that the administration ever really intended
to see its lawsuit against the firearms manufacturers to verdict,''
Hatch said. He said he suspected it was simply a bargaining ploy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Smith &AMP; Wesson, the largest U.S. manufacturer of
handguns, agreed to quickly install gun locks on all the weapons it
sells, to introduce ''smart gun'' technology permitting weapons to
be fired only by their owners and to block gun sales at gun shows
without a background check.
</P>
<P>
   The company broke industry ranks and changed its policy in
exchange for an a promise that a lawsuit against it would be
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Two gunmakers -- Glock Inc. and Browning -- have already announced
they will not sign voluntary gun-safety agreements similar to the
one agreed to by Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said Wednesday's announcement was an undisguised attempt
to keep the pressure on those and other gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers want a safer America'' Cuomo said. ''Because of
Smith &AMP; Wesson's agreement we now know a safer America is possible.
And we demand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining the coalition were the attorneys general of Connecticut,
Maryland and New York and mayors or county officials in California,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas and
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The list included Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta, St.
Louis, Boston and Florida's Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the capacity to squeeze manufacturers like a pincers
and hurt them in the marketplace.,'' said Democratic Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer of New York. ''We are bigger than the NRA
(National Rifle Association).''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has been harshly critical of gun initiatives in general.
NRA executive Wayne LaPierre discounted the Smith &AMP; Wesson deal's
importance, saying there was not much new in it.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta said he had just attended the
funeral of Fulton County, Ga., deputy sheriff Ricky Kinchen, a
shooting victim.
</P>
<P>
   ''Atlanta buys about a million dollars (worth) of guns each
year,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   When the purchasing power of other cities is added the gun
manufacturers ''will comply or they will cease operations,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., applauded the effort and said he
will shortly introduce legislation to instruct federal law
enforcement agencies who buy guns to give preference ''to those
manufacturers who sign on to the Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he will offer similar but separate legislation
dealing with gun purchases by the police force which protects the
Capitol complex.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we are seeing a real sea change here in how America
regards guns,'' Schumer said. ''And now there is a chance in
America to do something about guns.''

<HEADLINE> Elian Relatives Fight Judge's Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Attorneys for Elian Gonzalez's great-uncle said
Wednesday they would go to the Supreme Court if necessary to keep
the 6-year-old boy in the United States, while Cuban-American
groups met to discuss the tactics they would use if the boy is sent
back to the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   ''This an extraordinary case that could reach the highest levels
of our court system,'' said Kendall Coffey, an attorney for Elian's
great-uncle. ''I've never seen a more compelling or dramatic story
in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffey's comments came as Attorney General Janet Reno met in
Washington with Greg Craig, an attorney for the boy's father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it is time for Elian to be reunited with his
father.'' Reno said. ''I told Mr. Craig that we will work with
everybody concerned to achieve this goal in an orderly, fair and
prompt manner,''
</P>
<P>
   The legal team for Elian's great-uncle, meanwhile, is focusing
on the next step. The attorneys filed a notice of appeal with the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Tuesday, hours
after U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore dismissed the Miami
family's lawsuit and affirmed the government's decision to send
Elian to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian has been saying over and over again that he doesn't see
why he has to go back,'' said the boy's cousin, Georgina Cid Cruz.
''I don't think sending him back is in his best interest. We want
his father to be here. We love our family in Cuba and for us it's
tearing us apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the center of an international custody dispute
and a power struggle among his relatives since he was found
clinging to an inner tube off Florida on Nov. 25. His mother and 10
others drowned when their boat capsized during an attempt to reach
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the boy
to be reunited with his father in Cuba, but his relatives in Miami
have sued to prevent that, saying he deserves the opportunity to
live in America that his mother sought for him.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of 17 Cuban-American groups -- which have often
protested the government's decision to send Elian home -- met
Wednesday in Miami to discuss measures they would take if the boy
is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Should a decision come where something happens, that the
people don't like, let's demonstrate so that our message can get to
Washington,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez of the Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has not set a deadline for Elian's return, and Justice
officials have made clear that they want to avoid anything that
would traumatize the boy or provoke a confrontation with Miami's
large Cuban exile community.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said on NBC's ''Today'' that Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, would come to the United States immediately to pick up
Elian, but only if he were certain the boy would leave with him.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa on Wednesday, Cuba's foreign minister said Elian
was being manipulated by forces that think only ''about revenge
against Cuba'' and ''dream of a war between Cuba and the United
States.'' The minister, Felipe Perez Roque, would not elaborate,
but it was clear he was speaking about the Cuban community in South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family's appeal focuses on a provision of U.S. asylum
law that says any alien has a right to apply for asylum. ''Any
alien also means Elian Gonzalez,'' Coffey said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore rejected that argument, upholding the Clinton
administration's stance that only Elian's father can make an asylum
petition for the boy.

<HEADLINE> Blues 2, Hurricanes 1  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Al MacInnis scored a power-play goal with
2:13 left as the St. Louis Blues tied a franchise record with their
47th victory, beating the Carolina Hurricanes 2-1 on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   With Carolina's Gary Roberts off for holding, MacInnis' shot
from the point was accidentally tipped through the legs of Arturs
Irbe by Hurricanes defenseman Marek Malik.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues won their NHL-best 25th road game and tied the
franchise victory mark set in 1990-91. St. Louis is 13-1-1 in its
last 15 road games.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was MacInnis' ninth of the season and the 1,100th point
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's Jeff O'Neill scored his team-leading 24th goal of the
season two minutes into the second period after St. Louis
defenseman Marc Bergevin failed to clear the zone. O'Neill's shot
from the top of the circle beat Roman Turek through the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Irbe kept the Hurricanes in front with a pair of spectacular
saves less than two minutes apart on MacInnis and Jamal Mayers. But
a shot by Todd Reirden midway through the second came off the back
wall and right to Marty Reasoner, who easily beat a helpless Irbe.
</P>
<P>
   Irbe played in his 67th game, breaking the franchise record for
appearances for a goalie, previously set by Sean Burke in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis killed four Carolina power plays. The Blues have
killed 75 of their last 79 shorthanded chances.

<HEADLINE> Richardson: OPEC Will Hike Output  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson expressed
confidence Wednesday that oil-producing nations will increase
production in a move likely to reduce soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''One month ago, most said that an increase in oil supply was
not needed,'' Richardson said during a break in talks with
representatives of OPEC nations. ''Today, most say that there is a
need to increase output.''
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets March 27
in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC cut production by 4.3 million barrels a day more than a
year ago after prices plummeted to below $11 a barrel. Since then,
prices have soared as high as $34 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Richardson has embarked on a grueling schedule of
meetings with oil-producing nations. He has already met with
representatives from all OPEC countries, apart from Iraq, Iran and
Libya, with whom the United States has no diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
   He also was meeting with representatives of Mexico and Norway,
countries that are not OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the energy secretary made his case to Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo. On Wednesday, he met with Algerian
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
   ''American diplomatic efforts have made a difference,''
Richardson said. ''There is agreement that prices are too high and
that there needs to be an equilibrium.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had gleaned from talks with OPEC leaders that Iran is
also ready to boost production.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson declined to specify what amount of extra supply he
was pressing for, but said global consumption was running at 75
million barrels a day and production at 73 million barrels a day.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Snow, Mirabelli Hurt  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The injury and illness bug hit the
Giants again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, catcher Doug Mirabelli and first baseman J.T. Snow
were sidelined by injuries and right fielder Ellis Burks was
knocked out by a flareup of his stomach ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   It's already been a tough spring for the Giants because of a
rash of injuries disrupting the rhythm of spring training. Shawn
Estes is being brought along slowly because of a shoulder problem,
closer Robb Nen is trying to regain his form after offseason elbow
surgery, and second baseman Jeff Kent missed the early portion of
spring training while recovering from a strained rig cage muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabelli was lifted from Tuesday's game against Colorado at
Tucson because of back spasms and Snow bruised his ribs sliding
into home in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Snow and Mirabelli missed Wednesday's game against the Chicago
Cubs and Giants manager Dusty Baker said he was uncertain when they
would return. Burks was removed after the second inning, when he
was overcome with abdominal pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've dealt with stomach ulcers for the last five years and I
just had a serious flareup,'' Burks said before leaving to see a
doctor. ''Right now it feels like there's a fire in my stomach. I'm
all messed up, my stomach, my knees, my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirabelli, who is competing with Bobby Estalella for playing
time at catcher, said he didn't think his back problem was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a muscle spasm. I'm just taking today to rest it a
little bit,'' Mirabelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Snow also said he didn't think his rib problem was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably just bruised or something,'' Snow said. ''I
don't think it's a big deal. Hopefully, it's just a bump in the
road. We'll just take it day by day and see how I feel.''

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 109, Celtics 106  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Anthony Peeler's 3-point basket with two-tenths of
a second left and Kevin Garnett's career-high 40 points gave the
Minnesota Timberwolves a 109-106 win over the Boston Celtics on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce had tied the game at 106 with a 3-pointer with 6.7
seconds remaining. Terrell Brandon then dribbled the ball up court
and passed to Peeler, who shot from the left corner as a stumbling
Pierce ran toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's only hope was slim -- tap the inbounds pass in for a
3-pointer. It disappeared when Garnett tipped the ball away from
Antoine Walker.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough defeat for the Celtics, who had won seven of
their previous nine games to move 1{ games behind Orlando for the
final Eastern Conference playoff spot. It also ended their
five-game home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, whose previous high was 37 last Jan. 17 against
Indiana, hit 16-of-23 shots with eight rebounds. It followed a
29-point, 14-rebound performance in an overtime win Tuesday night
over Cleveland in which he went 12-for-16 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Sealy added 24 points, including two free throws that
ended a five-point run and gave Minnesota a 106-103 lead with 18
seconds to go. He made all 13 of his free throws. Peeler scored 16.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce led Boston with 25 points and Walker added 22.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 101-97, Boston went on a 6-0 run. Walker tied the game
with two free throws after missing his previous four, then put the
Celtics ahead 103-101 with a driving layup with 1:01 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett followed with a layup, was fouled by Tony Battie, and
completed the three-point play for a 104-103 Timberwolves lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a close game all the way as neither team led by more than
seven.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's jumper from the right corner had given the Celtics a
93-89 lead with 6:25 left. Then the Timberwolves scored the next
eight points. They tied the game at 93 on Brandon's 14-footer and
Garnett's two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Steals set up Minnesota's next two baskets, dunks by Peeler and
Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics led 56-55 at halftime and the third quarter was a
series of streaks -- 9-0 by Boston, 7-0 by Minnesota and 7-0 by
Boston. When it was over, the Celtics led 85-80 as Battie made a
three-point play with two-tenths of a second remaining.
</P>
<P>
Notes:@Minnesota trailed after the first quarter, 26-25, for only
the second time in its last 16 games. It won 13 of them. ... Boston
is only the fifth of Minnesota's last 19 opponents to score more
than 100 points. ... The Timberwolves' 19-14 road record is the
fourth best in the NBA. They're 18-7 in their last 25 games away
from home.

<HEADLINE> Clinton says Giuliani writes off black community  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday
that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her opponent in the U.S. Senate race,
has ''basically written off'' New York City's black residents.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the mayor's statement that he felt no responsibility
to reach out to the black community after the latest police
shooting of an unarmed black man, Mrs. Clinton said, ''He's
basically written off whole communities in the city that he's
supposed to lead. What does that say about how people would be
represented by him?''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's campaign spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum, said, ''It
sounds like Mrs. Clinton is still reading off the same script
prepared by (black activist) Al Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said the mayor's actions after last week's
killing of Patrick Dorismond -- releasing the victim's police record
and his girlfriend's complaint that he'd hit her -- ''have
aggravated tensions in the city and have helped drive a wedge
between the police and the communities they serve.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a statement released a few hours earlier, she asked,
''How can the mayor of the largest city in America possibly claim
that he has no responsibility to reach out to the African-American
community and its elected leadership?''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide polls on the Senate race have routinely shown the
Republican mayor getting less than 10 percent of the black vote,
while Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, gets more than 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the mayor was asked if he felt any responsibility to
talk or meet with black people after the third fatal shooting of an
unarmed black man in 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I don't think so,'' he said. ''I think this is a situation
that clearly had nothing to do with race. The three police officers
were Hispanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the mayor has an ''enormous trust chasm'' and ''has
presented a false choice to New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not necessary to choose between effective policing and
respectful policing,'' she said. ''It is not necessary to give up
trust and good relations between the police and the communities
they serve in the pursuit of lowering the crime rate.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a black Democrat,
called on Gov. George Pataki to appoint a commission to study the
New York City Police Department's use of street crime units, deadly
force and racial profiling, plus its recruitment of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   He said Giuliani apparently believes ''you put out a fire by
throwing gasoline on it.''
</P>
<P>
   NAACP President Kweisi Mfume echoed the tone of Clinton's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than trying to demonize Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed
Haitian American killed during a police encounter, Giuliani should
be reviewing police training standards to see what steps the
department can take to avoid the unnecessary use of lethal force,''
Mfume said in a statement from the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to reporters in White Plains after talking about
schools with a crowd of about 250 educators, parents and students
at the YWCA. She repeated her calls for national education
standards and for linking teachers' pay with students' performance.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she is a supporter of charter schools, but
that New York's law was ''guaranteed to cause problems'' because it
recognized two different chartering authorities -- the Board of
Regents and the State University -- and because it does not properly
enforce the separation of church and state.

<HEADLINE> Cyanide Leak In Papua New Guinea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) -- Up to 330 pounds of deadly
cyanide has likely contaminated a jungle water system in Papua New
Guinea, prompting authorities to warn villagers against drinking
the water.
</P>
<P>
   A one-ton box of the chemical accidentally dropped from a
helicopter on Tuesday about 55 miles north of the capital, Port
Moresby, and mining officials said some of it probably escaped into
the surrounded water system.
</P>
<P>
   Dome Resources NL said it sent cleanup teams sent to the site,
and expected to recover most of the material. But as much as 330
pounds had probably washed into nearby streams, managing director
Michael Silver told Sky News television in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   He said he couldn't guarantee that the cyanide didn't pose a
threat to anyone drinking the water. Even small quantities of
cyanide can be lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Papua New Guinea's National Disaster and Emergency Service
issued a warning for people not to drink from rivers and streams in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups worried that villagers in the remote area
may not get the warning.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said Dome would monitor all waterways in the region for
cyanide contamination, adding that the dissolved cyanide ''would be
diluted very substantially and fortunately the area in which it has
landed is very sparsely populated.''
</P>
<P>
   The cyanide was destined for the Australian-owned Tolukuma gold
mine, which uses the chemical to extract gold in the mining
process.

<HEADLINE> Accusations in Congo Cease Fire  </HEADLINE>
By KAMANGA MUTOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- The government on Wednesday denied rebel
accusations that it has launched attacks on all fronts, claiming
the rebels were the ones violating a shaky cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel Congolese National Army claimed in a statement Tuesday
that government forces and their Zimbabwean allies had launched a
counteroffensive a week after the Rwandan-backed rebels took
Idumbe, 375 miles east of the capital, Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not launched a total offensive,'' Foreign Affairs
Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia said at a news briefing, countering that
rebel forces had occupied four cities in government territory since
March 18. He did not identify the cities.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the government's, nor the rebels' claims could be
independently verified.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council warned Wednesday that cease-fire
monitors promised in the deal that sealed the cease-fire couldn't
be deployed in the midst of new hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   The council president, Bangladeshi Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury,
said ambassadors wanted to send a message that such violations
would have serious implications for the mission, known as MONUC.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want deployment of MONUC, hostilities must stop,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The council has said in the past that deployment of the
5,500-strong U.N. Mission in Congo, including 500 military
observers, depended on the willingness of all sides to respect last
year's cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was signed July 10 by President Laurent Kabila and his
allies -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- and by Rwanda and Uganda,
who are backing the rebels. The main rebel factions signed on in
the weeks that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting continues, however, with both sides repeatedly accusing
each other of violating the accord.

Liberals Declare Truce in Chretien-Martin Leadership Contest
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- After 10 days of bickering, federal Liberals
appeared ready Wednesday to call a truce in the leadership spat
between Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Finance Minister Paul
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Electoral self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   MPs emerging from a party caucus meeting insisted everybody is
united behind Chretien and ready to start organizing for the
election he has promised within 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who wants to go to the doorstep and say we've got doubts about
leadership?'' asked Toronto backbencher John Godfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ''That doesn't make any sense for anybody, whatever they think
about who might possibly in the future succeed Mr. Chretien.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who spoke on condition of anonymity said Chretien
matter-of-factly reminded MPs that he has never discouraged
anybody's future leadership ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   But he made it clear that he is leading the party into the next
election and there will be no leadership contest until he has
retired.

Reform Leadership Jockeying Up to the Last Minute
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- With just days left before Reformers vote on a
merger with the Canadian Alliance, the splintering of leadership
support in the party's caucus continues.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia MP Gary Lunn announced Wednesday he is
supporting Ontario government whip Frank Klees as the head of the
new political coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Klees hasn't formally announced he will take on Reform Leader
Preston Manning and Alberta Treasurer Stockwell Day in the race to
lead the Alliance, but he has been engaged in a campaign-style
tour.
</P>
<P>
   He is better equipped to help the Alliance sweep up support in
Ontario, where Reform was unable to win seats, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klees was a major organizer in Premier Mike Harris's successful
Common Sense Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Lunn will act as Klees' campaign co-chairman, joining a growing
group of Reform MPs who are actively promoting alternatives to
Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kenney, Maurice Vellacott, Myron Thompson and Randy White
are among the members that are promoting Day for leader.
</P>
<P>
   MP Gerry Ritz is backing Toronto-based Joe Peschisolido.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Martin, the caucus Health critic, is expected to announce
Thursday that he intends to run.
</P>
<P>
   Manning still commands a significant group of faithful
supporters, such as Finance critic Monte Solberg.

B.C. Judge Strikes Down Ban on Smoking in Bars and Restaurants
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Patrons requested ashtrays
and contentedly puffed indoors in British Columbia bars and
restaurants for the first time this year after a court struck down
part of the toughest anti-smoking policy in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sunni Stromberg-Stein of the British Columbia Supreme
Court concluded in a ruling released Wednesday the ban was enacted
by the Workers Compensation Board without proper consultation and
is therefore null and void.
</P>
<P>
   The judge rejected board claims that the hospitality industry
was notified of the decision to expand the ban to include hotels,
bars and other establishments used for public entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Some have angrily stayed away from favorite watering holes
altogether, which the hospitality industry says has led to more
than 700 layoffs and some bar closures.

Pay Equity Recipients Will Give Up to Half Back to Ottawa in Taxes
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Federal public servants have waited 17 years for
pay equity worth $3.6 billion, but the tax man will want his cut on
time.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,600 pay-equity recipients attended tax information
sessions held Wednesday by Revenue Canada.
</P>
<P>
   They were warned to seek professional advice on how to manage
the money, to begin arriving next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are the benefits of getting a windfall,'' said Revenue
Canada spokesman Chris Kealey. ''But without some proper tax
planning it's not much of a prize.''
</P>
<P>
   About 230,000 current and former clerical, secretarial and other
workers -- most of them women -- will receive back pay plus interest
dating from 1985 to July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After a 13-year wrangle with the government, they won a major
victory in July 1998 when the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled
they were paid less than men doing work of equal value.
</P>
<P>
   Equity payments will average $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''For that person who's a clerk or a secretary making $30,000,
their income for the year 2000 will be doubled to $60,000,'' said
Kealey. ''As a consequence of that, they'll likely go from the
lowest tax bracket to the highest tax bracket.''
</P>
<P>
   He's heard stories of people splurging on home renovations or
new cars without realizing how much of their checks will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   And people might not know their bolstered incomes could push
them beyond eligibility for child tax benefits, goods and services
tax credits and subsidized housing or child care, Kealey said.
Higher bank rates mean higher costs for consumers
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Interest rates were nudged up again Wednesday, but
analysts say it won't be enough to choke off the consumer spending
spree that has helped fuel economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Canada raised its trend-setting bank rate by a
quarter percentage point to 5.5 percent as a pre-emptive strike
against inflation.
</P>
<P>
   That matched an increase the day before in the United States and
marked the bank's third rate hike in four months.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer borrowing costs quickly began to rise in lockstep.
</P>
<P>
   The big banks immediately bumped their prime rates to seven
percent. Short-term mortgage costs started to climb as well.
</P>
<P>
   At least one and possibly two more quarter-point increases are
expected later this year.
Chretien To Meet With Alberta PM Klein To Discuss Health
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The stage is set for political fireworks as Prime
Minister Jean Chretien and Alberta Premier Ralph Klein meet
Thursday in Calgary to discuss Klein's plans to expand the role of
for-profit health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say Chretien will be walking through a minefield as he
tries to defend medicare without setting off Albertans' traditional
reflexes against federal interference.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien sounded a fiery tone Wednesday in the Commons, warning
he is prepared to cut transfer payments to Alberta if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   He avoided saying Alberta's bill violates the conditions of
medicare as set out in the Canada Health Act. If it does violate
the act, Chretien would be required to move beyond rhetoric.

<HEADLINE> Opposition: New Elections in Albania  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Thousands of opposition party supporters
gathered Wednesday at Tirana's main Skenderbeg Square to demand new
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only free and fair elections can bring Albania back to the
road of democracy,'' opposition leader and former president Sali
Berisha told the crowd of about 8,000, many of whom held up
antigovernment signs and Democratic Party flags.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkan nation last held parliamentary voting in 1997, which
ended years of rule by Berisha's party. Since then, the premiership
has changes hands twice within the ruling Socialist Party without a
new ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition demands national balloting, while the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is engaged in
talks with all the parliamentary parties to reach a consensus over
a new electoral law for local elections due in late September or
early October. But partisan disputes have held up an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Catastrophe is in store for you, if there are no elections,''
Berisha said, directing his comments at the government.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago to the day, tens of thousands of opposition
supporters gathered at the same square to celebrate the first
election victory of the Democratic Party in post-Communist Albania.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after the victory, the democratic forces were embroiled
in infighting amid a series of crises, including nationwide riots
in 1997 that broke out when pyramid investment schemes collapsed
and bankrupted thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is also one of the reasons why Albania has not
received much aid or investments from abroad, even though it was
the country most affected by last year's refugee crisis in Kosovo,
when it played host to almost a half million refugees.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Lifts Ban on Private Radio  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -- Following media protests, the Liberian
government on Wednesday lifted a ban on one of two leading
independent radio stations it shut down last week.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to allow the Roman Catholic-run Radio Veritas to
resume broadcasting was taken after the ministers of information,
telecommunications and justice met Wednesday with the station's
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The meeting resolved that the government and Veritas will from
now on cooperatively ensure that all tenets of professionalism are
adhered to,'' an information ministry statement said without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on Swiss-funded Star radio, however, remained in place.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from the directors of the two
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberian press responded to the bannings last Wednesday with
a news blackout on government activities that remained in effect
until this week.
</P>
<P>
   The government said both stations posed a security threat to the
nation and demanded a written commitment by Radio Veritas'
management that it would limit itself to religious broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether such an undertaking had
been given, though the Liberian Roman Catholic Church has
previously said it would not agree to restrict its broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia was wracked by a brutal civil war from 1989 until 1996,
and President Charles Taylor headed one of the most powerful
factions.
</P>
<P>
   Since being elected president in 1997, Taylor has frequently
come under fire from pro-democracy and human rights group, who
charge him with heavy handed tactics against his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Star Radio and Veritas, considered the country's most credible
and independent radio stations, frequently host phone-in shows
during which views critical of Taylor and his government are
expressed.

<HEADLINE> Hornets 119, Nets 103  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Eddie Jones scored 26 points and Derrick
Coleman and David Wesley added 22 apiece as the Charlotte Hornets
shot a season-best 56 percent in a 119-103 victory over the New
Jersey Nets on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Mason contributed 17 points as the Hornets recorded
their highest point and assist (37) totals of the season and ended
a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury paced New Jersey with 23 points, while Kendall
Gill and Keith Van Horn had 17 each as the Nets lost for only the
second time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   An 8-0 run midway through the third quarter gave Charlotte an
81-65 lead. The advantage reached 21 points three times in the
quarter, the last at 96-75 on Wesley's 3-pointer with 1:07 left.
</P>
<P>
   With a season-high 65 points, the Hornets built a nine-point
halftime lead on 63 percent shooting (24-of-38).
</P>
<P>
   Wesley hit all five of his shots, none from closer than 18 feet,
in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn kept New Jersey within range with 15 first-half points
on 6-of-7 shooting. Late in the second period, the Nets twice
trimmed Charlotte's advantage to four, the last coming at 57-53 on
a Van Horn layup with 1:53 left.
</P>
<P>
   But with two baskets from Coleman, who led Charlotte with 14
points in the first half, the Hornets closed the first half with an
8-3 run.
Notes: Coleman was fined $7,500 by the NBA on Wednesday for a
flagrant foul against Philadelphia's Toni Kukoc in the second
quarter of the Hornets' 102-96 Monday night loss to the Sixers. ...
Van Horn failed to reach 20 points for only the third time in 10
career appearances against Charlotte. Marbury reached 20 for the
seventh time in eight games against the Hornets.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Tim Raines Plans To Retire  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Rather than search for another team, Tim
Raines began telling New York Yankees' teammates Wednesday that he
intends to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Raines, fifth of the career steals list at 807, was with the
Yankees this spring as a non-roster player, partly to showcase
himself after missing the final 2{ months of last season because of
Lupus.
</P>
<P>
   After Darryl Strawberry was suspended for a positive cocaine
test, there were some who thought he had a chance to make the
Yankees as a part-time left fielder/designated hitter. But manager
Joe Torre told Raines in the past week that was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Raines, 39, is likely to announce his retirement as early as
Thursday, according to a person familiar with his thinking who
spoke on the condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 games with New York this spring, Raines hit .293
(7-for-24) but he has just two extra-base hits, a double and a home
run. For now, the Yankees are comfortable using Ricky Ledee and
Shane Spencer in left field, and a combination of Ledee, Spencer
and Jim Leyritz at designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Kelly, also in camp on a minor league contract, was
viewed ahead of Raines as a backup outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   During a stint with the Yankees from 1996-98, Raines won World
Series rings in his first and last seasons. He then signed with
Oakland as a free agent after the 1998 season, but on the disabled
list last July 19 with kidney inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week later, he was diagnosed with Lupus, a
connective tissue disease in which the immune system turns against
a person's body. The disease affects the skin, joints, blood and
kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Raines, who made seven straight All-Star game appearances from
1981-87, compiled a .295 career average in 21 seasons with
Montreal, the Chicago White Sox, the Yankees and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   He finishes with 168 homers and 1,290 RBIs, and in steals trails
only Rickey Henderson (1,334), Lou Brock (938), Billy Hamilton
(937) and Ty Cobb (892).
</P>
<P>
   Raines swiped 70 or more bases in each of his first seven
seasons. He hit a career-low .215 last year with just four steals.

<HEADLINE> Bush Sharpens Attack on Gore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sharpening the attack on his rival, Republican
George W. Bush says Democrat Al Gore is an ''obstacle to reform''
who is too partisan to be president, much less fix Social Security
or enact meaningful changes to the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday with the Washington Post, Bush pledged
to stick with his plan for a sizable tax cut despite polls showing
tepid voter interest in one. He also said he would make saving
Social Security a focus of the fall debate against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Returning repeatedly to Gore's credibility and ethics, Bush said
the vice president has a ''major credibility problem'' that goes
beyond the campaign finance matter, and that he plans to make it a
central campaign issue as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to keep the pressure on,'' the Texas governor said,
adding: ''If I'm not, who will?''
</P>
<P>
   He called Social Security a ''fundamental issue'' and said Gore
was wrong to suggest that major changes aren't needed to keep the
retirement program afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hasn't offered a plan for fixing the program and he refused
to promise to issue one before the November election. More
important than specific proposals, he said, is his promise to use
his political capital as president to bring Republicans and
Democrats together to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   Touting his ability to bring the parties together in Texas,
where he is in his second term as governor, Bush said voters want a
president who will ''put issues ahead of partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   His approach, he said, ''stands in stark contrast to my
opponent, who I view as an obstacle to reform, as somebody who is
so partisan that it's going to be impossible to get major
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush pledged to stand by his biggest proposal, to cut taxes by
$483 billion over five years. He acknowledged having ''a lot of
work to do'' yet to sell the package to voters, but predicted the
issue would help lead him to victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   Gore criticizes it as ''risky tax scheme'' that would consume
the projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane rejected the charge that
the vice president is an obstacle to reform, saying Bush's tax plan
is more of a problem. ''In addition to that, it's been his cronies
in Congress who have resisted efforts to shore up Social
Security,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   After several days off the campaign trail, which he spent at the
Governor's Mansion in Austin, Texas, or his ranch in Waco, Texas,
Bush heads out Thursday for a two-day swing to Florida and Arkansas
before returning home for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The interview will appear in Thursday editions of the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Baja Lagoon To Be Preserved  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A southern Baja California lagoon, whale
breeding grounds that had once been targeted for a salt plant, will
be preserved as part of a world heritage site that will benefit
residents, Mexico's environmental secretary announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Carabias Lillo said ecotourism and nature-friendly
businesses, such as fishing, will take the place of the proposed
$150 million salt plant addition at the San Ignacio lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo halted the plant earlier this month
after five years of controversy and protests from environmental
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have to do is help the 45,000 people who live in this
area live well, with dignity,'' Carabias said during a meeting with
a legislative commission. ''We are going to work on a development
process involving productive projects that will allow the people to
improve their living conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Carabias said specific development plans for the area would be
announced in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The San Ignacio lagoon, a pristine site where gray whales breed,
forms part of the Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, which UNESCO declared
a world heritage site in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   On March 2, Zedillo halted plans to construct the salt plant
addition proposed by Exportadora de Sal, S.A., or ESSA, a joint
venture between Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. and the Mexican Commerce
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups vehemently opposed the project, saying that
among other things it could threaten the gray whale.
</P>
<P>
   But Zedillo, citing extensive environmental studies indicating
that the whales were not at risk, said the project was being halted
because it would have altered the natural beauty of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Zedillo's decision to halt the plant said the area
was losing more than 200 desperately needed jobs. But Carabias said
the 250 jobs created by the salt plant addition would have
benefitted outside specialists more than local residents.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached on Switched Va. Girls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- The families caring for two children
who were switched at birth have reached an agreement to keep the
girls with the families raising them and give both sides regular
visitation, said lawyers in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, which still requires court approval, was
disclosed Wednesday by Ken Mergenthal, an attorney for Paula
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   It means that Johnson has dropped her bid to adopt Callie
Conley, the child she has raised since taking her home in 1995 from
the University of Virginia Medical Center. Instead, she will become
Callie's permanent legal guardian, Mergenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Groot, a lawyer for one of the families raising the
other child, Rebecca Chittum, confirmed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, it maintains the status quo before all the
litigation,'' Groot said.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford Circuit Judge James W. Haley Jr. will conduct a hearing
March 31 on whether to approve the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was sent home from the state-operated hospital in
Charlottesville with the biological daughter of Kevin Chittum and
Whitney Rogers, who took home Johnson's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The switch was discovered in July 1998 when DNA tests were
performed in a child-support dispute between Johnson and her
ex-boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Chittum and Rogers were killed in a car crash about the same
time without ever learning of the switch. Their parents have taken
turns caring for Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   The families at first agreed the girls would stay with the
families that had been raising them and the biological relatives
would have liberal visitation. But the relationship between the two
sides broke down, and Ms. Johnson sought custody of both Rebecca
and Callie.

<HEADLINE> Blues Try Keep Hitting High Notes  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no time for the St. Louis Blues to savor what could
become their best regular season ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Red Wings are keeping the Blues, who lead the NHL
with 103 points, hungry for more, more, more.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings tied Calgary 2-2 Wednesday night and trail the
Blues by six points for first overall, and more important, for the
Western Conference lead, entering the final nine games of the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The team that wins the race gets home-ice advantage at least
until the Stanley Cup finals. The team that loses gets saddled with
the fourth seed, behind the other Western Conference division
winners.
</P>
<P>
   So there's plenty of incentive for the Blues, even if they have
one of the league's best road records.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're coming every night,'' center Craig Conroy said of the
Red Wings. ''You watch them on TV and it's like, 'Are they ever
going to lose?' And they're probably saying the same things about
us.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Blues, it's just like driving for one of the final
playoff berths.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, with Detroit chasing us it's been kind of a rat
race right to the finish,'' captain Chris Pronger said. ''We've got
to keep our nose to the grindstone and keep that lead growing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably not a bad thing, as long as the duel doesn't
wear them out for the playoffs. Considering the situation, coach
Joel Quenneville can't afford to rest any of his stars until the
issue is settled.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a competitive conference and I think that's going to
make us a better team,'' checking center Mike Eastwood said. ''In a
way it's good because it's keeping us honest, game in and game
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues topped 100 points for only the third time in franchise
history with a 2-1 victory over the Washington Capitals, the
hottest team in the NHL since January, on Monday night. After
beating Carolina 2-1 Wednesday night on Al MacInnis' power play
goal with 2:13 to go, they were only four from tying the franchise
record of 107 set in 1980-81.
</P>
<P>
   The victory over Carolina also tied the franchise season record
of 47 in 1990-91, the only other season they hit the century mark
in points.
</P>
<P>
   They've done it despite injuries to stars Al MacInnis and Pierre
Turgeon, who has missed more than a month with a thumb injury. The
scoring touch of Turgeon, who could return next week, hasn't been
missed because of the prolific season from the ''Slovak Pak'' line
of Pavol Demitra, Michal Handzus and Lubos Bartecko.
</P>
<P>
   Demitra leads the team in scoring with 28 goals and 74 points,
Handzus is third with 51 points and Bartecko is fifth with 37
points. The trio patiently waits for openings, and has combined for
12 game-winning goals.
</P>
<P>
   The countrymen have combined for 68 points in the last 24 games.
Their chemistry seems to overcome the various defensive strategies
used against them.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get to know each other and where we're going to be,''
Bartecko said. ''It just comes to us. We know what to do and we
just do it on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Another big reason for the Blues' success is 6-foot-3 goalie
Roman Turek, who fills the net and leads the NHL with a 1.93
goals-against average in his first season as a starter. Last
season, he backed up Ed Belfour on the Stanley Cup champion Dallas
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Turek made four big saves in the final minute to preserve the
Blues' victory over the Capitals, running their record to 32-0-2
when leading after two periods. He's the closer for a team that has
outscored the opposition 85-39 in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, playoff series are won by goaltending,'' Pronger
said. ''He's probably at the top of his game right now. If he's
not, we're in for a treat in the playoffs.''

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Racing Association and its mutuel

Wednesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Agent: Twins' Radke Mum on Contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The agent for Twins right-hander Brad Radke
said Wednesday that Radke is done negotiating on a contract
extension until after the season, increasing the possibility the
Twins will trade him or lose him to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Simon told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis that Twins
general manager Terry Ryan contacted him in recent days about
resuming contract talks. Simon said he told Ryan he doesn't want to
talk during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm concerned about Brad being in a happy environment,'' Simon
said. ''The conversation was very brief.''
</P>
<P>
   The sides have been negotiating a deal since December. The
Twins' last offer was for $21 million over three years. Radke wants
$26 million over three years and also has insisted on a clause
allowing him to demand a trade during the contract if he feels the
team is doing poorly. The Twins have refused.

   DETROIT (AP) -- Pat Verbeek became the 28th player in NHL history
to score 500 career goals, scoring twice in the Detroit Red Wings'
2-2 tie with Calgary on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek reached the milestone with 5:22 remaining, taking a pass
from Steve Yzerman and firing the puck past goalie Fred Brathwaite
from the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek opened the scoring with a power-play goal in the first
period. He took a pass from Nicklas Lidstrom just outside the
crease and slid a shot under Brathwaite's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Lidstrom also assisted on Verbeek's tying goal. The defenseman
has scored or assisted on 19 of Detroit's last 30 goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings fell six points behind St. Louis for the top seed
in the Western Conference playoffs. The Blues beat Carolina 2-1 on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Shannon and Brad Werenka scored for Calgary, which was
2-1-1 against Detroit this season.
</P>
<P>
   Werenka's first goal in 31 games gave the Flames a 2-1 lead with
8:25 remaining in regulation. His shot from the point deflected off
Nicklas Lidstrom and over goalie Chris Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon tied it midway through the second period, scoring off of
Jarome Iginla's cross-ice pass.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood made 31 saves, and Brathwaite stopped 30 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Red Wings star forward Brendan Shanahan missed the game because
of the flu.

<HEADLINE> Wednesday's Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the start of the baseball season approaching, teams closed
in on finalizing their starting pitching rotations.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets gave Glendon Rusch their fifth starter's job,
Jason Dickson appeared close to regaining his spot in Anaheim's
rotation and John Halama might have pitched himself out of
Seattle's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch, acquired from Kansas City last season, beat out Bill
Pulsipher, Bobby M. Jones and Dennis Springer to earn the fifth
spot in the Mets' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of quality pitching not making this team,''
Rusch said. ''I think I threw the ball well and stayed consistent
throughout the camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusch's numbers were far superior to his competitors. He was 1-0
with a 3.24 ERA in 16 2-3 innings this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was simple, Rusch pitched the best this spring,'' general
manager Steve Phillips said. ''You tend not to want it to be a
competition during camp but it became a competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson, who missed the entire 1999 season because of shoulder
surgery, pitched 5 2-3 strong innings in Anaheim's 6-3 victory
Wednesday over the San Diego Padres in Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson allowed one run and five hits and earned his first win
with clearly his best outing of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had the command today,'' manager Mike Scioscia said.
''That's the way Jason Dickson can pitch and that's the way he
pitched when he was on the All-Star team. That was very encouraging
to see him step up.''
</P>
<P>
   The start, Dickson's third of the spring, was his longest of the
exhibition season. He allowed seven hits and four runs in his
previous outing March 17 against Milwaukee and entered Wednesday's
game with a 9.35 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today was one of those days that I felt on top of my game,''
Dickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Halama might be on the verge of losing his starting job for
Seattle after allowing two home runs in five innings of a 4-3 loss
to the Milwaukee Brewers in Peoria, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In three spring starts, Halama has given up five home runs and
has an 11.13 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Brett Tomko to the Mariners' staff,
Halama's job is in jeopardy. Halama allowed home runs to Jose
Hernandez and Henry Blano.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not looking at my stats right now,'' Halama said. ''If
that was the case then I probably wouldn't make any of the 30
teams. I've got an ERA of who knows how high.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
</P>
<P>
Expos 2, Dodgers 0
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Carl Pavano and four relievers combined on a
four-hitter and Vladimir Guerrero homered and drove in two runs.
</P>
<P>
Indians 11, Braves 2
</P>
<P>
   At Winter Haven, Fla., John Rocker got a mixed reaction in his
third appearance of the spring and Jim Thome, Mark Whiten and
Russell Branyan homered for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
Twins 2, Pirates 1
</P>
<P>
   At Bradenton, Fla., Cristian Guzman's bad-hop triple led to a
two-run Minnesota first inning and Pittsburgh starter Francisco
Cordova's first spring loss in two years. Cordova was 6-0 over his
last nine spring starts until yielding two earned runs and five
hits and walking two in five innings.
</P>
<P>
Astros 3, Devil Rays 0
</P>
<P>
   At St. Petersburg, Fla., Matt Mieske hit an RBI double and
Richard Hidalgo homered. Chris Holt, Doug Henry, Kip Gross, Trever
Miller and Jose Cabrera combined on the shutout for Houston,
limiting Tampa Bay to eight singles.
</P>
<P>
Reds 10, Red Sox 6, 11 innings
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Hal Morris doubled in the go-ahead run to
lead Cincinnati. Aaron Boone and Gookie Dawkins homered for the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
Diamondbacks 9, Rockies 6
</P>
<P>
   At Tucson, Ariz., Arizona scored four runs in the eighth inning
to overcome two homers by Larry Walker.
</P>
<P>
White Sox 9, Athletics 8
</P>
<P>
   At Phoenix, Chris Singleton's two-run single highlighted a
seven-run rally in the seventh for Chicago. Paul Konerko had three
hits, scored twice and drove in a run as the White Sox won their
fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
Giants 13, Cubs 5
</P>
<P>
   At Scottsdale, Ariz., Barry Bonds homered twice, driving in five
runs, and four other Giants also hit home runs. Marvin Benard added
a go-ahead three-run homer in the fourth and Rich Aurilia, Bobby
Estalella and Russ Davis each had solo shots.
</P>
<P>
Mets 4, Orioles 0
</P>
<P>
   At Port St. Lucie, Fla., Mike Hampton allowed one hit in six
innings and Edgardo Alfonzo drove in two runs. Rich Rodriguez,
Dennis Cook, John Franco and Armando Benitez finished the shutout.
</P>
<P>
Blue Jays 7, Phillies 5
</P>
<P>
   At Dunedin, Fla., Raul Mondesi and Carlos Delgado homered, and
Chris Carpenter made his longest outing of the spring. In his third
start of the spring, Carpenter allowed two runs and four hits in
four innings, striking out four.

<HEADLINE> Magic 103, Hawks 90  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Darrell Armstrong had 27 points and 10
assists and the Orlando Magic maintained their hold on the eighth
playoff position in the Eastern Conference with a 103-90 victory
over the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta closed Orlando's lead to 89-80 on a layup by Dion Glover
with 6:24 remaining, but the Magic maintained a double-digit lead
the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   John Amaechi scored 16 points and Ron Mercer added 15, while Ben
Wallace had 16 rebounds for Orlando. The Magic shot 45.5 percent
from the field and made 21 of 28 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks center Dikembe Mutombo only played 14 minutes after
getting two fouls in the first quarter. His replacement, Lorenzen
Wright, scored 18 points on 8-of-12 shooting to keep Mutombo on the
bench. Glover and Chris Crawford also came off the bench to score
18 points each for Atlanta. The Hawks were just 1 of 12 on 3-point
attempts and 17 of 30 on free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has lost 12 of its last 15 games. The Magic improved to
19-13 at home, where it plays its next seven consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando used a 25-15 third quarter to pull ahead 80-70.
Armstrong sparked the Magic with 13 points in the quarter,

lead, 79-67. Armstrong made six of nine attempts in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic began the game on a 13-2 run and led the entire way
until Glover made a layup with 24.4 seconds remaining before the
half that tied it, 55-55. Atlanta trailed by as many as 10 points
in the second quarter but made 15 of 23 field goal attempts to
close Orlando's lead.
Notes: Orlando had 28 fastbreak points while Atlanta had 17. ...

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Urges China, Taiwan Peace  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Praising the island's vibrant democracy, a
U.S. envoy began a mission to Taiwan on Wednesday in hopes of
learning how serious the newly elected president is about avoiding
war with China.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Hamilton came to Taipei hours after a U.S. diplomat wrapped
up talks with Chinese leaders in Beijing, saying he was encouraged
by China's cautious attitude with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic missions followed opposition leader Chen
Shui-bian's stunning victory in Taiwan's presidential election
Saturday. Beijing distrusts Chen, 49, because his party supports
Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
   China views the island to be a sacred part of the motherland.
Since a civil war split the two sides in 1949, Beijing has
threatened to use force against the island if it seeks
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The United States could quickly get dragged into a China-Taiwan
war. For decades, American has been one of Taiwan's closest friends
and has sent in warships during times of high tension. The United
States is also one of the few nations that sells Taiwan defensive
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton met with Chen for about an hour on Thursday, but both
men declined to comment on the meeting. Hamilton said he would
issue a statement when he departs Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement at Taipei's airport on Wednesday, Hamilton
praised the ''strength and vitality of Taiwan's democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I also wish to congratulate President-elect Chen and look
forward to meeting him and learning more about the policies he
seeks to carry out,'' said the former Democratic congressman from
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ruling Nationalist Party was still struggling to
recover from its embarrassing defeat in the Saturday vote. Blaming
himself for the loss, President Lee Teng-hui planned to resign from
his top party post on Friday, the state-run Central News Agency
said, citing unidentified high-ranking party members.
</P>
<P>
   Lee announced on Sunday that he would step down as party
chairman in September, but this was not soon enough for many party
members, who have protested outside the Nationalist headquarters
since the election loss.
</P>
<P>
   The retiring president would hand his job over to Vice President
Lien Chan, who finished a distant third in the election, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, an expert on Chinese affairs, is a presidential
emissary to Taiwan in everything but name. He was traveling as a
private citizen because Beijing would fiercely protest an official
U.S. visit.
</P>
<P>
   Washington did send an official envoy to Beijing. Richard
Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, spent two
days meeting with Chinese leaders, including President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving on Wednesday, Holbrooke said he was encouraged by
China's ''wait-and-see attitude'' following Taiwan's election.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt there was a constructive atmosphere on the question of
Taiwan,'' Holbrooke said. ''What is mildly encouraging is that
everyone has reacted to the new circumstances with prudence and
caution.''
</P>
<P>
   During his talks, Holbrooke urged the rival governments to
negotiate and also repeated U.S. support for Beijing's position
that Taiwan and the mainland are part of ''one China.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan conveyed to Holbrooke
China's wish that America recognize the ''sensitivity and
complexity'' of the Taiwan problem and avoid interfering in China's
internal affairs, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua also quoted Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji as saying China
would never negotiate with independence supporters -- remarks
apparently directed at Chen.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Chen tried hard to play down his party's
support for an islandwide vote on whether Taiwan should declare
independence. Late in the race, he said he would not call a
referendum on the issue unless China attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, leaders of Chen's Democratic Progressive Party
began considering possible changes in the pro-independence parts of
its platform.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who takes office May 20, already has offered to travel to
China, invited Beijing leaders to visit Taiwan and said he was
willing to discuss anything with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing replied by insisting that Chen must agree to the
''one-China'' principle before talks can happen. The principle
holds that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.
</P>
<P>
   Chen and Taiwan's current leader, Lee Teng-hui, object to the
''one China'' principle because they fear that if they accept it,
they would have to agree that the ruling government is in Beijing.
This would mean Taiwan was ruled by a local government unequal to
the undemocratic, communist regime.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Gore Too Partisan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sharpening the attack on his rival, Republican
George W. Bush says Democrat Al Gore is an ''obstacle to reform''
who is too partisan to be president, much less fix Social Security
or enact meaningful changes to the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday with the Washington Post, Bush pledged
to stick with his plan for a sizable tax cut despite polls showing
tepid voter interest in one. He also said he would make saving
Social Security a focus of the fall debate against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Returning repeatedly to Gore's credibility and ethics, Bush said
the vice president has a ''major credibility problem'' that goes
beyond the campaign finance matter, and that he plans to make it a
central campaign issue as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to keep the pressure on,'' the Texas governor said,
adding: ''If I'm not, who will?''
</P>
<P>
   He called Social Security a ''fundamental issue'' and said Gore
was wrong to suggest that major changes aren't needed to keep the
retirement program afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hasn't offered a plan for fixing the program and he refused
to promise to issue one before the November election. More
important than specific proposals, he said, is his promise to use
his political capital as president to bring Republicans and
Democrats together to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   Touting his ability to bring the parties together in Texas,
where he is in his second term as governor, Bush said voters want a
president who will ''put issues ahead of partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   His approach, he said, ''stands in stark contrast to my
opponent, who I view as an obstacle to reform, as somebody who is
so partisan that it's going to be impossible to get major
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush pledged to stand by his biggest proposal, to cut taxes by
$483 billion over five years. He acknowledged having ''a lot of
work to do'' yet to sell the package to voters, but predicted the
issue would help lead him to victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   Gore criticizes it as ''risky tax scheme'' that would consume
the projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane rejected the charge that
the vice president is an obstacle to reform, saying Bush's tax plan
is more of a problem. ''In addition to that, it's been his cronies
in Congress who have resisted efforts to shore up Social
Security,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   After several days off the campaign trail, which he spent at the
Governor's Mansion in Austin, Texas, or his ranch in Waco, Texas,
Bush heads out Thursday for a two-day swing to Florida and Arkansas
before returning home for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The interview will appear in Thursday editions of the newspaper.

Cops To Favor Cooperative Gun Cos.
</SUBHEAD>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Maintaining pressure on gun manufacturers, the Clinton

makers that follow the lead of Smith &AMP; Wesson -- producing safer firearms and
adopting a code of responsible conduct. Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development Andrew Cuomo urged communities of every size to join the effort and
said preferential buying can force the gun industry to fall in line behind the
Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement because sales to law enforcement agencies represent 20
percent to 30 percent of the U.S. gun market.

<HEADLINE> Pharmacy Network, DEA Settle Claims  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SUNDHEIM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A company supplying drugs to nursing homes
will pay at least $6.35 million to settle a federal complaint over
shoddy record-keeping that allowed an employee to steal
prescription tranquilizers and painkillers for street sales,
federal officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is the largest that the Drug Enforcement
Administration has reached involving mishandling of federally
controlled drugs, said acting U.S. Attorney Tim Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   NCS HealthCare of Indiana Inc. will pay the federal government
$4.1 million to settle civil claims and spend $2.25 million to
improve its compliance with federal rules on narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement came more than three years after the NCS
employee, Shirley Newsom, and her boyfriend, Chad Sloan, were
murdered by two men involved in a scheme to sell stolen Valium and
Vicodin pills intended for nursing home residents.
</P>
<P>
   The company was accused of violating provisions of the
Controlled Substances Act, which requires companies handling
pharmaceuticals to keep records that account for all drugs when
they are received, stored and distributed.
</P>
<P>
   NCS HealthCare did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement.
The company did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of the violations was prompted, in part, by Indiana
State Police, who made an undercover purchase of Vicodin, a highly
addictive pain-killer, and Valium, a tranquilizer, from Sloan.
Sloan told a police informant that he got the drugs from Newsom.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan and Newsom were found murdered in their Indianapolis home
Jan. 22, 1997. Franklin Dennis, who owed Sloan money for a drug
debt, later pleaded guilty to Newsom's murder and was sentenced to
life in prison. An accomplice, Curtis Holtsinger, was convicted in
Sloan's death and also sentenced to life.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Judge Issues Stay in Execution  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID FREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A federal judge blocked the execution of
a condemned child killer Wednesday, hours before he was to become
the first person to be put to death in Tennessee in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Glen Coe, 43, was to die by lethal injection at 1 a.m.
Thursday for the 1979 kidnapping, rape and murder of 8-year-old
Cary Ann Medlin.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Aleta Trauger blocked the execution to
consider a petition by Coe's attorneys contending he is not
mentally competent for execution.
</P>
<P>
   Coe's attorneys say he is insane and executing him would violate
the 8th Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The state
Supreme Court has found him sane for execution.
</P>
<P>
   Trauger did not set a deadline for when she would rule on the
petition. However, she set a Monday deadline for state and defense
attorneys to file motions concerning another matter -- whether Coe
can have an attorney present for his execution.
</P>
<P>
   That deadline indicates the execution may be delayed at least
until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Attorney General's office filed a motion with the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to vacate the stay of execution,
but both the 6th Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court denied the
motion.
</P>
<P>
   As all the legal wrangling went on in Nashville, the girl's
family held a memorial service at her grave in Greenfield, about
100 miles north of Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   They had planned to travel to Nashville to witness Coe's
execution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I keep hearing the words 'due process' and 'I have to be
fair.' I understand all that with my head, but my heart doesn't
really hear it. I want it to be over,'' said Charlotte Stout, the
girl's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee last executed an inmate in 1960.

<HEADLINE> Paper: US Revives Pinochet Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is reviving a
long-dormant investigation aimed at indicting Gen. Augusto Pinochet
for the 1976 car bombing that killed former Chilean ambassador
Orlando Letelier, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   In a story posted Wednesday night on the newspaper's Web site,
the Post said that a team of American law enforcement officials
arrived in Santiago, Chile, on Wednesday for court proceedings
involving 42 potential witnesses subpoenaed by Chile's Supreme
Court on behalf of the U.S. government. All are to be interrogated
using lists of questions provided by U.S. law enforcement officers,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigative steps we are currently taking in
coordination with the FBI are a sign that we are serious about
getting all of the facts,'' Justice Department spokesman Myron
Marlin told The Associated Press on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Post said the chances that Pinochet would be extradited to
the United States from Chile if indicted were remote, but that an
indictment could increase the pressure on Chile to try Pinochet for
human rights abuses during his 17 years as the country's president.
</P>
<P>
   Six people were sent to prison for the Letelier bombing, which
took place on a busy street along Embassy Row in Washington, but
the U.S. government had not targeted Pinochet for ordering the
murder until the former dictator was arrested in Britain 16 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 84, returned to Chile earlier this month from London
after successfully fighting extradition to Spain, where a judge
wanted to try him for human rights abuses during his 1973-90
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Britain released Pinochet after an independent team of four
doctors determined he was physically and mentally unfit to stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted Letelier's widow as saying she received
assurances last week from a senior Justice Department official that
the U.S. government is ''vigorously'' pursuing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said last year that the case ''was
never closed'' in the United States and that the department was
reviewing whether Pinochet could be tried in the United States for
the Letelier killing.

<HEADLINE> Towers on Martin: 'He's Scared'  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Now comes the hard first step for Al Martin
-- facing his San Diego Padres teammates and the media following his
arrest on charges that he exchanged punches with a woman who claims
they were married in Las Vegas nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Martin remained in seclusion Wednesday, the day after he was
charged with assault on Shawn Haggerty-Martin. But, general manager
Kevin Towers said Martin will be back in camp Thursday following
the bizarre turn of events that led to Martin and Haggerty-Martin
spending Monday night in jail in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ''He needs to get back here and in uniform,'' Towers said. ''I
think he needs to get back with his players. He's got support here
from this ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Towers knows that's it's going to be hard for Martin, the
Padres' new leadoff hitter and left fielder, to get on with his
life and career.
</P>
<P>
   Towers and Padres owner John Moores met with Martin and his
wife, Cathy, for about 1{ hours on Tuesday afternoon, following his
initial court appearance. Towers described Martin as ''very quiet,
very set back.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure a lot of things are going through his mind. I think
he's scared,'' Towers said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Tuesday afternoon was the first time Martin met
Moores, who ended up helping to counsel the player and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kind of brought him over as a leader, and for this to
happen, I'm sure he's questioning what the organization's thoughts
are about, what his teammates think about him, what's going to
happen with the rest of his career, how his wife and kid feel about
him,'' Towers said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, things like how hard it's going to be to play in front of
50,000 people and to hear the inevitable comments from fans. The
Padres, by the way, open the season at Shea Stadium against the New
York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Towers said Martin also needs to face the media. Martin,
obtained in a trade with Pittsburgh on Feb. 23, issued a statement
Tuesday night through his agent, Jeff Moorad, categorically denying
the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's made the statement, but he's going to have to face this
head on,'' Towers said. ''It's not going to be easy. I think he
realizes that. Until he gets an opportunity to face you all and
tell his side of the story, it's not going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Martin is due back in court on April 12 for a pretrial
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was charged with assault-physical injury for allegedly
hitting Haggerty-Martin in the face, and with threatening or
intimidating. Haggerty-Martin was charged with assault-domestic
violence for allegedly starting the fight after confronting Martin
over their marital status. All are misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale police are investigating Haggerty-Martin's contention
that Martin is married to two women, Sgt. Doug Dirren said
Wednesday. Bigamy is a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Towers briefed the Padres on Wednesday morning. He told them
that Martin was embarrassed and had asked Towers to apologize on
his behalf for his actions. Martin plans to speak to his teammates
when he returns, Towers and Moorad said.
</P>
<P>
   The GM said the key factor for Martin is to get emotional
support from his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Infielder Ed Sprague, who played with Martin last year in
Pittsburgh, said players shouldn't jump to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he'd run through a brick wall for this team,'' Sprague
said. ''I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. I know his wife and
kid are standing by him, so I don't see why we shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Martin said he has known Haggerty-Martin for
several years, and that he and wife Cathy ''have been working
through some very personal issues that are best kept private
between a husband and wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Martin denied the charges, the police report said
Martin admitted to hitting Haggerty-Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Towers said the situation is ''strange.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't just a domestic violence or simple battery
incident, it takes all kinds of twists and turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Las Vegas wedding that Haggerty-Martin describes in the
police report. She said it occurred on Dec. 11, 1998, and that at
the time, she didn't know Martin was already married. Martin said
the couple had a ceremony in Vegas, but that he didn't think it was
real.
</P>
<P>
   The police report quoted Haggerty-Martin as saying the fight
started because she was ''sick and tired'' of Martin not divorcing
his other wife.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres could terminate Martin's contract if any of the
charges prove true. Towers said it wasn't fair for him to address
that issue now.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bruce Bochy said the Martin case hasn't been a
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not even talking about it,'' he said after a 6-3 loss to
Anaheim at Tempe. ''We hope it all gets resolved, but we've got to
go on. We're getting close to the season.''

<HEADLINE> Islanders 5, Maple Leafs 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Claude Lapointe and Maruisz Czerkawski each
scored two goals as the New York Islanders beat the Toronto Maple
Leafs 5-2 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Isbister added a goal and two assists for New York and
Kevin Weekes made 27 saves, including 20 in the third period when
the Islanders were outshot 21-4.
</P>
<P>
   New York, eliminated from playoff contention last week, scored
on two of four power-play opportunities in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Karpovtsev and Sergei Berezin scored for Toronto,
which remained tied with Washington for fourth place in the Eastern
Conference. The Maple Leafs have lost three of four games since
losing defenseman Bryan Berard with a serious eye injury March 11.
Before that, Toronto had won nine of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Weekes stopped Berezin on two close-range chances in the first
period, and snared Steve Thomas' 40-foot blast to protect a 1-0
lead in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Lapointe opened the scoring at 6:23 of the first period on a
power play when he one-timed a centering pass from Dmitri Nabokov
past goalie Glenn Healy. Evgeny Korolev, playing in his 11th career
game, assisted on the goal for his first NHL point.
</P>
<P>
   Czerkawski and Karpovtsev exchanged goals early in the second
period, and Lapointe got his second of the game and 15th of the
season when he banged in a rebound on a power play at 13:09.
</P>
<P>
   Isbister and Czerkawski added goals in the third period.
Czerkawski leads the Islanders with 28 goals. Isbister has a
career-high 20 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders center Dave Scatchard left the game early in the first
period because of a concussion after colliding with a Toronto
defenseman.

<HEADLINE> 2002 World Cup Ticket Price Doubles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The average ticket price for the 2002 World Cup in
Japan reportedly will be almost twice as much as tickets sold for
the 1998 tournament in France.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of about 1.5 million tickets, allotted for
sale in Japan, will be around $160, the Yomiuri newspaper said
Thursday, quoting unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
   Japan will be co-host of the tournament with South Korea. Each
nation will stage 32 matches.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiaki Koyama, spokesman for the Japan Organizing Committee,
said officials are still working to set ticket prices, which will
be decided at its board of directors meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing, including special seats sold to sponsors, will be
coordinated with the South Korean side, Koyama said. The Japanese
plan to start accepting orders for some tickets in October.
</P>
<P>
   Koyama said the cost of staging the games in Japan is estimated
at $468 million.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Lawmaker Seeks Coach Pay Cap  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa State men's basketball coach Larry
Eustachy's contract has prompted a state lawmaker to call for a
salary cap for college coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Fallon said he's prepared an amendment to a giant
education spending package that would prohibit Iowa State from
offering deals larger than $300,000 to athletic staff or coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The school signed Eustachy this month to a 10-year contract with
total yearly compensation of $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Eustachy led the Cyclones to the conference regular season and
tournament titles and has his team among the final 16 in the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   A fight over education spending is central to legislative debate
over the $4.9 billion state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given this acknowledged crisis in budgeting, it is
unconscionable to enter into a contract with any state employee
with a compensation level that is obscene compared to the wages of
an average working Iowan,'' Fallon said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Eustachy's salary is bigger than the combined pay of the
governor, lieutenant governor, chief justice of the Iowa Supreme
Court and the presidents of the three Regents' universities.
</P>
<P>
   Eustachy's contract calls for a base salary of $160,000 and a
guaranteed $640,000 in outside income from camps, endorsements,
radio and television shows and shoe contracts. There is also an
annual $100,000 longevity bonus.

<HEADLINE> NAACP head decries Giuliani's defense of ''trigger-happy'' police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) -- NAACP President Kweisi Mfume criticized New
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Wednesday for his defense of what
the civil rights leader called ''trigger happy police.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume made the comments in a statement on the police shooting of
Patrick Dorismond in New York last week.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Dorismond, 26, a Brooklyn native of Haitian
descent, has become racially
</P>
<P>
   charged. City officials' decision to defend the shooting by
making public his record of petty crime has outraged black
activists, the victim's family and members of the city's Haitian
community. It also has fueled political sniping between Giuliani
and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in their race for the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kaiser, an off-duty security guard who was with Dorismond
at the time of the shooting said at a news conference Tuesday that
a scuffle started between plainclothes police and Dorismond was
shot after he refused to buy marijuana from undercover police
officers. Police say Dorismond was shot after he swung at the
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than trying to demonize Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed
Haitian American killed during a police encounter, Giuliani should
be reviewing police training standards to see what steps the
department can take to avoid the unnecessary use of lethal force,''
Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His continued strategy of defending police action regardless
of the evidence and his unfair character assassination of Mr.
Dorismond, including the questionable release of his juvenile
record is reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume said Giuliani's behavior was unethical, ''if not illegal''
and called for a national code of conduct for police.

<HEADLINE> Spurs 103, Clippers 78  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Tim Duncan scored 30 points in his best game
since returning from an injury, and the San Antonio Spurs rebounded
from an embarrassing loss to Dallas with a 103-78 victory over the
Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Samaki Walker came off the bench to tie his season high with 18
points for the Spurs, who blew a 22-point to Dallas in Tuesday
night's 97-96 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Spurs forward Sean Elliott scored six points in 19 minutes,
marking his best production in his five games since returning from
a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan had an easy time handling Los Angeles defenders Keith
Closs and Michael Olowokandi. Duncan, who missed for games from
Feb. 25-March 4 with an abdominal injury, hit 12-of-20 shots and
also grabbed 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers took a 16-9 lead and held the advantage midway
through the second quarter. But the Spurs, keyed by Walker, went on
a 20-8 run to close the half and lead 53-42.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers played without leading scorer Maurice Taylor, who
missed the game with a sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson led the Clippers with 17 points, while Olowokandi
added 14 points and six rebounds.
Notes: Spurs guard Antonio Daniels had the highlight of the night
when he stole the ball on the Clippers' end of the floor, dribbled
the length of the court and dunked over Closs, who at 7-foot-3 is
almost a foot taller than the 6-4 Daniels. ... Spurs guard Steve
Kerr had surgery on his right knee on Wednesday. Kerr, who was
placed on the injured list March 6, is expected to miss at least
four weeks. ... The Spurs are 21-9 when playing back-to-back games.
... The Clippers haven't beaten the Spurs since Dec. 4, 1997, when
they won 100-96 in overtime in Los Angeles.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell scored 21 points and New York
produced its best defensive effort of the season in a 78-67 victory
over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The victory snapped a two-game losing streak for New York and
was the eighth consecutive loss for the Bulls, who have dropped 16
of their 17. The 67 points were the fewest surrendered by the
Knicks this season.
</P>
<P>
   New York led 61-55 entering the fourth quarter, but Sprewell and
Larry Johnson each scored four points in an 8-0 run that put the
Knicks in control at 69-55.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, which made just one field goal in the first 11 minutes
of the fourth period, was never able to cut the Knicks lead to less
than nine the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls missed their first 12 shots and fell behind 9-0. But
the Bulls hung in and trailed by 10, at 49-39, on a short jumper by
Elton Brand late in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing and Charlie Ward answered with baskets for the
Knicks, but Chicago closed to 47-41 at the half on Chris Carr's
jumper two seconds before the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing added 12 points and Allan Houston had 11 for the Knicks,
while Brand led Chicago with 22 points and 13 rebounds.
Notes: The Knicks host Atlanta on Friday and then head West for a
nine-day, five-game trip that includes games with Portland and the
LA Lakers. ... At game time, there were still no takers for former
Knicks guard John Starks, who was released by the Bulls on Tuesday.
... Knicks forward Marcus Camby and assistant coach Don Chaney both
celebrated birthdays Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Giuliani Writes Off Blacks  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday
accused Senate rival Rudolph Giuliani of essentially ignoring New
York City's black residents.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the mayor's statement that he felt no responsibility
to reach out to the black community after the latest police
shooting of an unarmed black man, Mrs. Clinton said: ''He's
basically written off whole communities in the city that he's
supposed to lead. What does that say about how people would be
represented by him?''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's campaign spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum, responded,
''It sounds like Mrs. Clinton is still reading off the same script
prepared by Al Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said the mayor's actions after last week's
killing of Patrick Dorismond -- releasing the victim's police record
and his girlfriend's complaint that he'd hit her -- ''have
aggravated tensions in the city and have helped drive a wedge
between the police and the communities they serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide polls on the Senate race have routinely shown the
Republican mayor getting less than 10 percent of the black vote,
while the Democratic first lady gets more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the mayor was asked whether he felt any
responsibility to talk or meet with black people after the third
fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man in 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I don't think so,'' he said. ''I think this is a situation
that clearly had nothing to do with race. The three police officers
were Hispanic.''
</P>
<P>
   He also defended his decision to release information about the
shooting victim, saying, ''I'm making sure the public has the
facts, and I'm doing it against the media that knee-jerks as
quickly and as fast as it can against the police.''
</P>
<P>
   NAACP President Kweisi Mfume echoed the tone of Clinton's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than trying to demonize Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed
Haitian American killed during a police encounter, Giuliani should
be reviewing police training standards to see what steps the
department can take to avoid the unnecessary use of lethal force,''
Mfume said in a statement Wednesday from the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to reporters in White Plains after talking about
schools with about 250 educators, parents and students at the YWCA.
She repeated her calls for national education standards and for
linking teachers' pay with students' performance.

<HEADLINE> Penn St. 81, Kent 74  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KINNEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- It might not be a trip to the NCAA
tournament, what Penn State's Jarrett Stephens wanted most. But it
does seem appropriate he's returning to Madison Square Garden for
the NIT semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Nittany Lions' last trip to the semifinals,
Stephens tore his knee when he was fouled on a breakaway. He missed
the championship game, and without him, Penn State lost to
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   With his team on the verge of returning for the second time in
three years, Stephens played very much like he wanted to make up
for that. In his final game at home Wednesday night, Stephens had
24 points and 10 rebounds as the Lions beat Kent 81-74.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really excited about it,'' said Stephens, who missed all
but two games of the 1999 season rehabilitating his knee. ''I have
some unfinished business at Madison Square Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He definitely deserves it,'' said Joe Crispin. ''He's worked
hard to come back even better than he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Crispin added 18 points against Kent, including eight free
throws in the final minute for the Lions (18-15), who are fast
forgetting their ninth-place finish in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Thomas had 18 points, while Andrew Mitchell and Demetric
Shaw added 15 each for the Golden Flashes (23-8). Their leading
scorer, Trevor Huffman, had just two points on 1-for-5 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions go to New York on Tuesday to face Notre Dame, which
beat Brigham Young 64-52.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way we're playing right now, it's going to be tough to
beat us,'' said Gyasi Cline-Heard.
</P>
<P>
   To those shocked that Penn State is going to New York, coach
Jerry Dunn says his team hung in when things looked dim last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think this team ever really thought they were out of
postseason play,'' Dunn said. ''I'm just extremely, extremely
elated for these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent led by as much as seven points early, but the largest
margin for either team in the second half was four until Penn State
pulled ahead in the final four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lions up 54-53, Cline-Heard tipped in a miss. On the
next play, he stumbled, then recovered to nab a pass inside. At the
other end, he scored inside to make it 58-53. Then, after
Cline-Heard grabbed another miss by Kent, Crispin hit a 3-pointer
that gave Penn State a 61-53 lead with 2:38 to play, its biggest
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was due,'' said Crispin, who finished 2-of-13 from the
field. ''I think I was overdue. I just kind of relaxed and floated
it in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cline-Heard's dunk on a fast break made it 67-59.
</P>
<P>
   Kent cut the lead to 77-74 on Thomas' 3-pointer with 7.1 seconds
left, but Crispin hit two free throws and Stephens stole the
inbounds pass and scored as Penn State held on.
</P>
<P>
   Crispin went 13-of-14 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   For the second game in a row, fans stormed the court. This time,
''New York, New York'' blared over the loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big improvement over Monday's finish against Siena,
when Penn State gave up an eight-point lead in the final 1:46 and
had to hit a buzzer-beater to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach did a good job of reminding us what happened on Monday,
which was in the back of our head,'' Crispin said. ''We did a good
job of holding them off.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State had no trouble with Kent's press, and the Lions' 10
turnovers were well off the average (18) for the Flashes' opponents
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Home-court advantage smoothed Penn State's road to Madison
Square Garden this time. Despite only barely qualifying for the
tournament and bringing in the worst record in the field (15-15),
the Lions had the luxury of being at home for all three of their
games.
</P>
<P>
   Kent coach Gary Waters said one or two plays turned the game in
Penn State's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know where that happens? That happens at home,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Rips Fed Interest Rate Hikes  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE DUNFORD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Former Republican presidential candidate Steve
Forbes said Wednesday that Alan Greenspan's ''bogus'' policy of
slowing economic growth by raising interest rates is like a doctor
purposely making a healthy person sick.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the closing meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic
Council, Forbes took repeated snipes at the Federal Reserve
chairman and his decision Tuesday to raise short-term interest
rates by a quarter of a percentage point for the fifth time since
June.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prosperity does not cause inflation,'' the publishing magnate
said. ''That's a bogus idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Greenspan has a new idea ''that somehow we have to fear
productivity ... because if we have greater productivity, he would
say: 'Gee, stocks would go up because companies would earn more
money and if stocks go up people would have more to spend, and
that's inflationary,''' said Forbes, clad in a red, white and blue
Hawaiian shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost as if he went to a doctor and the doctor says
you're very healthy and we have to make you sick a little bit,''
Forbes said. ''In medicine, you'd get sued for malpractice. In
economics, they put you in the Federal Reserve and the IMF
(International Monetary Fund).''
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire publisher believes government's role in the
accelerating age of information and technology essentially should
be to stay out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Governments must maintain an environment in which the
extraordinary innovations in information and technology can
flourish by following five basic principles of economic growth, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those principles are ensuring equality before the law and
property rights, a steady value in money, low taxes on capital
gains, minimal regulation on new businesses and reducing trade
barriers, Forbes said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Higher at Midday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen Thursday
morning, buoyed by the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision earlier this
week to boost interest rates. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index
gained.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 107.54 yen, up 0.90 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 106.90 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 23.43
points, or 0.12 percent, to 19,757.02 at the end of the morning
session. On Wednesday, the average closed up 131.23 points, or 0.67
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar initially rose on buy orders
from foreign players out of Hong Kong, with Japanese life insurers
reportedly joining a dollar-buying spree later.
</P>
<P>
   The greenback has attracted investor demand since the U.S.
Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates increase the value of U.S. fixed assets
such as bonds, making them more attractive to foreign investors and
thereby strengthening the nation's currency.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 103.22 yen, up from
102.36 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, traders said the Nikkei was briefly lower
on profit-taking early in the session, but moved into positive
territory as investors bought issues at dips.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 40.64
points to 10,866.70 at Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.53 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,652.79.
The TOPIX closed down 14.23 points, or 0.85 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond
stood at 1.8450 percent, unchanged from Wednesday's finish. Its
price remained unchanged at 100.47.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A suspected computer hacker made his first
court appearance Wednesday after being indicted on charges of
breaking into computers belonging to NASA and the U.S. departments
of energy, defense and transportation, said federal prosecutors.
</P>
