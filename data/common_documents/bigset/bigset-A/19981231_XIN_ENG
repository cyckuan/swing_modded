<HEADLINE> No Plan to Negotiate Gas Supply to Israel: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi
Al-Banbi said Wednesday that Egypt has no plans to negotiate
natural gas supply to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Al-Banbi's words came in response to the statements by Israeli
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon Tuesday that talks will be
held for importing natural gas from Egypt, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
All gas produced by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation
(EGPC) is being consumed domestically and Egypt plans to buy more
from international companies operating in the country, Al-Banbi
said.
</P>
<P>
The EGPC has signed a number of agreements with foreign
companies to buy gas in the years to come to meet increasing
domestic demands for natural gas, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said international companies working in Egypt,
including the U.S. Amoco and the Italy's Agip, have been trying
for years to secure their shares in the world market.
</P>
<P>
They have been in contact with several countries in the region,
including Israel, Al-Banbi said. The two companies have received
positive responses from all the states except Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, also foreign minister, has prevented Israel's
electricity suppliers from contacting the companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979, maintains cold ties with the Jewish state due to
Israel's intransigence in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have few business or economic ties.

<HEADLINE> Money Supply Growth in Euroland Remains Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Two days before the launch of the
single euro currency in 11 "Euroland" countries, the latest data
showed money supply growth in the 11 countries remaining within
moderate limits.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt said on Wednesday
that the money supply showed 4.5 percent annual growth in
November, compared with 5.0 percent in October and 4.5 percent in
September. The average for the three months was 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The data showed that monetary expansion was "very close to the
reference value of 4.5 percent" which the ECB board of governors
had set during their December 1 meeting.
</P>
<P>
In absolute terms, the money supply in the 11 Euroland
countries - all 15 European Union members except for Britain,
Greece, Denmark and Sweden - came to just under 4.33 trillion ECUs
(5.07 trillion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Turkey Opposes Missile Deployment on Greek Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said here Wednesday that Turkey opposes the possible
deployment of the Russian-made S-300 missiles on the Crete island
of Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Cem said that the deployment of
the surface-to-air missiles in Crete, rather than on Cyprus within
the framework of "joint aggression doctrine" between Greece and
the Greek Cypriot side, will add a new problem to the already
problematic relations between Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey does not consider the missiles an issue of bargaining,
even negotiation in this regard is out of the question, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides announced Tuesday that he
had decided not to deploy the S-300 missiles in Cyprus and would
negotiate with Russia on possible deployment of the missiles in
Crete.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said on Tuesday that his
country supported Clerides' decision.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus struck the missile deal with Russia in January 1997, in
a bid to cement its air defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, the close ally of independence-seeking Turkish Cypriots
in northern Cyprus, has threatened to launch preemptive strikes on
the missiles if they are brought to the divided island.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the missiles in Cyprus had already been put off
several times under Turkish and international pressures.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north after Turkey landed
its troops on and took over the northern third of the country in
1984 in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fires Missiles Again on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S.
administration official confirmed on Wednesday that U.S. fighter
planes fired missiles and laser-guided bombs on a defense site
in southern Iraq early in the day after a British warplane
observed six to eight missiles being fired from the Iraq missile
site.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton is to be briefed by National Security
Council advisers later on Wednesday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a Pentagon official said a British Bomber reported the
activity at about 9:30 a.m. local time (0630 GMT) southwest of
Talil, Iraq, and observed that there were several surface-to-air
missiles fired from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. F-16 fighter planes patrolling the area responded
and fired two HARM anti-radar missiles and a number of
precision-guided bombs onto the site at 10:15 a.m. local time
(0715 GMT). The Pentagon official said that "there is no
assessment of the damage."
</P>
<P>
The aircraft safely returned to their bases in southwest
Asia about a half hour later.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman David Leavy said that U.S. and British
aircraft "will continue to enforce the no-fly zones vigorously,"
"as the president has said, they are a key element of our
containment policy."
</P>
<P>
It was the second clash this week between U.S. and Iraqi
forces in the northern and southern Iraqi no-fly zones, which
Baghdad has declared illegal and does not recognize.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.S. warplanes exchanged missile fire with Iraqi air
defenses when the planes were fired upon by Iraqi surface-to-air
missiles.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 30 (Xinhua) -- President of the Zimbabwe
Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) Gibson Sibanda said Wednesday
that the size of country's cabinet must be reduced and the
government should control runaway inflation currently pegged at
45.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to have a big cabinet with all the luxuries
while the nation starves to death with more than 50 percent of
the population out of employment," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to Sibanda, the deepening economic crisis
Zimbabweans went through in 1998 was a time bomb despite the
government allegations that the ZCTU had a political agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Trade unions do not merely represent workers, they are a
major representative of civil society and as such they have a
special responsibility," Sibanda noted.
</P>
<P>
He said hard choices had to be made to create a better future
for the country.
</P>
<P>
"Through a social contract agreement, all social partners can
put their heads together beyond their traditional interests for
the survival of our nation," he added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Civil Servants Reject 25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARATE, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Goverment Staff
Association wednesday rejected the 25-percent salary increase
which the government awarded to civil servants last monday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the association Leonard Nkala told the Zimbabwe
News Agency that there was no way civil servants could accept the
25-percent increase because a consensus was not reached during
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Wage talks between the government and the association for a
salary increment broke down on wednesday last week after a
government negotiator said the state had no money to offer a
higher increase.
</P>
<P>
"If our employer does not review our situation, then we would
have no choice but to take drastic action as a way of pursuing
our grievances and that would be early next year," Nkala said.
</P>
<P>
He said civil servants would not be deterred by the
Presidential Temporary Measures Act which amended the Labor
Relations Act to make strikes illegal.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared for anything because that is a matter of life
and death and after all there has never been a legal strike in
this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nkala's statement was in support of Public Service Association
executive secretary Charles Chiviru who wednesday said civil
servants still demanded a 20-percent cost of living adjustment in
addition to the 25-percent salary increase they were awarded by
the government on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Does Not Bow to Turkish Pressure: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said Wednesday that Cyprus' decision to
cancel missile deployment was not bowing to Turkey's pressure.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem's
statement that Cyprus' decision was a result of pressure from
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Rather, he said the deployment of S-300 missiles on Greece's
Crete island is in line with the 1993 Cypriot-Greek defense pact.
under which Greece, the close ally of Greek Cypriot-dominated
government, will provide military assistance to Cyprus if it is
attacked.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides also said Cypriot government believes the decision
offers the opportunity for a smooth European Union (EU) accession
course kicked off last March.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides announced Tuesday night that
he has decided not to deploy the missiles in Cyprus and will
negotiate with Moscow to ship them to Greece's Crete island.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after his talks with Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis and a three-hour session of the National Council,
the top advisory body to the president on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered the surface-to-air missiles in January 1997 in a
bid to cement its air defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, the close ally of the independence-seeking Turkish
Cypriots in northern Cyprus, has threatened to launch a preemptive
strike on the missiles if they are deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., the U.S. and Britain all have expressed opposition to
the missile deployment, which they said will increase tensions on
the east Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government has said that if there is substantive
progress toward a settlement to the Cyprus problem or if talks for
reduction of tensions and disarmament begins, leading to
demilitarization on the island, the deployment can be canceled.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island, in the
wake of a abortive pro-Greece coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula. But the peace talks have
been stalled since last year.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said that even though the preconditions were not
met to the full, the decision was taken in view of today's
international situation and to the benefit of Hellenism.
</P>
<P>
He added that the decision "also offers the international
community the opportunity to decide to tackle Turkish
provocations and intransigence in a substantive way that would
bring results."
</P>
<P>
Last week the U.N. Security Council adopted two resolutions
urging Secretary-General Kofi Annan to step up mediation efforts
between Greek and Turkish Cypriots and to secure a "staged
process" of reduction of troops and armaments in Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Moldova: Foreign Trade Drops 14 Percent in 11 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The foreign trade dropped
14.3 percent to 1,532 billion U.S. dollars in the Republic of
Moldova, in the eleven months of the outgoing year, showed the
latest official statistics reached here.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Economics and Reforms, the
Moldovan exports decreased in average by 22.5 percent during this
period, while the imports by 8.4 percent. In September and
November the decline was "very felt": 51.8 and 50.6 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attributed the decline to the financial crisis
in Russia, Moldova's number one trade partner with the 51 percent
share of all imports and 77 percent share of all exports.
</P>
<P>
Trade with the Commonwealth of Independent States in January
through November reduced by 26.1 percent, while with the West it
increased by 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The exports towards Romania, Italy, Austria, France, Canada and
the United States increased due to surpluses of sugar, meat, apple
juice, nuts, clothes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics data also showed Moldova with a trade deficit of
366.3 million dollars by December 1, which is 81.5 million up
compared with 1997.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania Wednesday
destroyed 121 kilograms of mandrax worth 240 million Shillings
(about 353,000 U.S. Dollars) under tight police guard.
</P>

The drug destruction has been the biggest since 1994, when 319
bags of drugs worth 600 million Shillings were intercepted at the

<HEADLINE> Iraq Claims to Have Shot down Enemy Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 30 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi military spokesman
announced on Wednesday that Iraqi air-defense force has shot down
an enemy warplane flying over southern Iraq's no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 9:00 a.m. local time (0600 GMT),
formations of enemy warplanes approached Iraqi air-defense
positions in the southern no-fly zone, then Iraqi air-defense
force fired surface-to-air missiles and forced those planes to
flee.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that Iraqi air-defense force was "almost certain" that they have
downed an enemy plane.
</P>
<P>
He said another formation of enemy planes then came and fired
missiles at a farm village, leading to the death of a farmer and
injury of another two.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi statement came almost eight hours after the incident
happened. Western military sources said an Iraqi air-defense site
in Talil in southern Iraq fired surface-to-air missiles at British
Tornado planes and was retaliated by U.S. F-16s with HARM missiles
and several 500-pound (225-kilogram) precision-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
The sources said all U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the
northern no-fly zone returned safely to their base, again
contradicting the Iraqi claim.
</P>
<P>
This conflict was the second such in a week. In the previous
case on Monday, the Iraqis also said they shot down an enemy plane
that violated its air space in the northern no-fly zone, but
failed to produce evidence. The U.S. and Britain, however, said
they did not lose any jets in the clash.
</P>
<P>
The northern and southern no-fly zones in Iraq were imposed by
the U.S. and its allies in 1991 and 1992 respectively, with
claimed aims of protecting Kurds and Shiite Muslims from troops of
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan has declared that his
government does not recognize the no-fly zones, set up "illegally"
by the U.S. and its allies without U.N. authorization, and
demanded that the U.N. discuss this issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are operating normally" in these zones, said Ramadan,
meaning Iraqi planes will defy the fly ban and challenge the
U.S. in the areas.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British forces gathering in the Gulf carried out four
consecutive nights of air strikes against Iraq December 16-19 to
punish Baghdad for not cooperating fully in U.N. weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
With their hope for an early lifting of crippling U.N.
sanctions dashed by the air raids, the Iraqis seemed to have
changed their tactics by barring the return of U.N. weapons
inspectors and challenging the U.S. in the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
This threatens to turn U.S.-Iraq confrontation into a daily
occurrence.

MOSCOW, December 30 (Xinhua) -- In a 30-minute telephone
conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday Russian
President Boris Yeltsin said that the use of force against Iraq is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin confirmed the Russia's position that the U.S.-British
air strikes on Iraq were "unacceptable from the point of
international law, the UN Charter, the principles of partnership
and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation Yeltsin called for restoring
the unity of the U.N. Security Council and returning the Iraq
question to a political channel.

<P>
According to the Russian presidential press service, Yeltsin
and Clinton agreed on the need to preserve and develop the
positive potential accumulated in Russian-U.S. relations over the
past few years.
</P>

The two leaders discussed preparations for the next regular

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urged to Apology for Invasion of Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Arab
League Esmat Abdel-Meguid suggested Wednesday that the Iraqi
crisis might have been resolved if Iraq had apologized for its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The latest developments of the Iraqi crisis are "part of a long
chain of events that started with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,"
Abdel-Meguid said in an Egyptian television talk show.
</P>
<P>
"This crisis could have been solved if the Iraqi regime
officially apologized for its aggression on a sisterly state," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid did not elaborate, but he appeared to be implying
that a formal Iraqi apology might convince Kuwait and its Gulf
allies to take reconciliatory steps.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief expressed regret over the postponement of
an Arab foreign ministers meeting to discuss a proposal for an
Arab summit on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting has been put off to January 24 at the
request of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia have not forgiven Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
for the invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which led the multinational forces in the
1991 Gulf War to oust Iraqi troops out of Kuwait, launched a
four-day missile attack against Iraq on December 16-19 in what
Washington called a retaliation to Baghdad's defiance of the
United Nations arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
U.N. arms inspectors have been overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction since the end of the Gulf War.
They must certify that Iraq has destroyed all its banned weapons
before the U.N. Security Council lifts the sanctions imposed
on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait.

JOHANNESBURG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Banned parties in
Swaziland have warned that the country is turning into a total
dictatorship because of a new administration order.
</P>
<P>
Legislation, signed last week by Swazi King Mswati III, aimed
to give chiefs power to arrest and try people in their areas,
Southern African Broadcasting Association quoted Swazi opposition
sources as reporting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mario Masuku of the People's United Democratic Movement said
that his party believed the law was made to suppress the poor.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the law also gave traditional leaders
authority to evict from their land any citizen who did not comply
with the rules. It also enabled chiefs to act as attorneys,
judges and police officers.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions
Jan Sithole said the new law was a crime and an abuse of human
rights, noting that it would encourage confrontation between the
government and the people.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, a traditional monarchy with less than one million
population, is the only country in Southern Africa which has not
introduced multi-party politics.

<HEADLINE> Annan Dismayed by Angolan Failure to Cooperate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Wednesday that he is "deeply dismayed by the
continuing failure of the Government of Angola and UNITA to
provide access for a search-and-rescue team to the site of the
crash of a United Nations plane on Saturday."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here by his spokesman, Annan said,
"There can be no justification for not facilitating full and
immediate access to the crash site.
</P>
<P>
"United Nations staff have long risked -- and sacrificed --
their lives in their efforts to bring peace to Angola," the
statement said, "The Secretary-General expects the responsible
leaders to honor those efforts by guaranteeing the safety and
security of all United Nations staff" in the African Country.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General therefore reiterates his appeal to the
Angolan Government and UNITA to extend all possible assistance
to enable the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MOUNA)
to reach the crash site and to assist in search and rescue
operations for any survivors," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came one day after a presidential statement of
the Security Council, which on Tuesday urgently called on the
Angolan Government and the rebel UNITA to "cooperate immediately
and fully" with U.N. peacekeepers in search and rescue of 14
people aboard a U.N.-chartered cargo plane that crashed near war
zone in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, a MONUA statement, issued in the Angolan
capital of Luanda, said, "There could be survivors" aboard the
plane, which went missing on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The special representative of the U.N. Secretary-General in
Angola, Issa Diallo, "appeals in the strongest terms" to the
Angolan Government and UNITA to stop fighting around the crash
site, so that U.N. peacekeepers can visit the site of the accident
and try to save lives of the 14 persons, including four crew
members.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government and the rebel UNITA, the National Union
for Total Independence of Angola, are currently locked in a fierce
fighting in the central highland area of the country, the crash
site of the U.N.-chartered cargo plane.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Spokesman's Office Tuesday disclosed a list of
nationalities of the missing passengers and crew members.
Passengers included three Angolans, an Australian, two Russians, a
Cameroonian, an Egyptian, a Namibian and a Zambian. The crew was
made up of an Angolan, a Bolivian, a Filipino and a South African.
</P>
<P>
The C-130 aircraft crashed 10 minutes after takeoff near the
central highland city Huambo, about 480 kilometers southeast of
Luanda.

UNITED NATIONS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday welcomed Cyprus President's decision not
to deploy S-300 missiles on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides decided on Tuesday not to
deploy the surface-to-air missiles ordered from Russia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman's office, Annan
said the decision is a tangible, positive response to U.N.
Security Council resolutions 1217 and 1218 of December 22, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Annan said it is also a positive response to the appeal in his
letter of December 14, 1998, addressed to the President of the
Security Council to avoid any actions which might increase
tension, including by further expansion of military forces and
armaments, on the island.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief reiterated his full commitment to the
initiative which he took on September 30, 1998, to ask his Deputy
Special Representative, Dame Ann Hercus, to begin a process of
on-island talks with both sides with a view to reducing tension
and promoting progress towards a just and lasting settlement.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The defense side in the
U.S. embassy bombing case Wednesday urged Tanzanian police
authorities to complete investigations of the two suspects as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The defense advocate, Abdul Mwangera, told the Dar es
Salaam-based Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court that he has grown
tired of endless investigations without giving reasons.
</P>
<P>
Mwangera also requested the Federal Bureau of Investigations
(FBI) and local police to hand back the clothes of the suspects
which were taken away for investigations, saying that such kind
of acts are unfair, illegal and against human rights.
</P>
<P>
He urged the police to adopt modern ways of investigation
rather than using the shirts of his clients.
</P>
<P>
On the prosecution side, Senior Superintendent of Police
Reinhard Lisapita, insisted that the clothes being held by the
police is one way of conducting investigations as the case is
serious.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of United States embassy in Dar es Salaam on
August 7 this year killed 11 people and injured more than 70
others. The suspects in the case are Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed,
an Egyptian national, and Rashid Saleh Hemed, a Tanzanian. Both
are charged with murdering 11 persons.
</P>
<P>
The presiding magistrate, Principal Resident Magistrate
Projestus Lugazia, urged the prosecution side to disclose how far
they have gone in investigating the case.
</P>

The case is expected to come up for another mention on January
15 as the investigations are still incomplete.

<HEADLINE> Ramadan Slams Continued U.S., Britain Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan on Wednesday accused the U.S. and Britain of
"still continuing their aggression against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egyptian and the United Arab Emirates TV,
Ramadan said the U.S. and Britain continued violating Iraqi air
space and launched missiles at Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Iraqi News Agency, Ramadan said he
would not rule out a new aggression by Washington and London
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was bombarded for four consecutive nights On December
16-19 by the U.S. and Britain in "Operation Desert Fox," which
killed at least 25 people and wounded more than 70 others.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said the mission of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) overseeing Iraq's disarmament and its chairman Richard
Butler was over, for they "served the scheme of the U.S.-British
aggression against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said Iraq reserves the right to demand compensation for
human and property damages caused by U.S.-British air strikes,
adding that Iraq would submit relevant documents for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iraq does not recognize the two no-fly
zones set up in the north and south of the country, saying they
were imposed on Iraq unilaterally by the U.S. and Britain and
without authorization from the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The vice president pointed out that the violations of Iraqi air
space by the U.S. and Britain "is a direct encroachment of Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity," saying Iraq would be
firmly against and resist this encroachment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, an Iraqi military spokesman announced that
enemy planes violated the country's air space in the south and
fired missiles at a village, killing one farmer and injuring two
others.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Iraq air-defense force fired surface-to-air
missiles at the planes and were "almost certain" that an enemy
plane was shot down.
</P>
<P>
Western military sources said two British Tornado fighter jets
patrolling the southern no-fly zone, which stretches from the 33rd
parallel to the Gulf, was targeted by Iraqi air-defense radar and
fired at with six to eight surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
American F-16 fighters retaliated with HARM missiles and bombs
that hit the Iraqi air-defense site. All U.S. and British
warplanes reportedly returned safely to their base.

<HEADLINE> Pak Govt Announces Textile Quota Management Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
announced Thursday the Textile Quota Management Policy for the new
year aimed at increasing export income.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Thursday evening, Finance
Minister Ishaq Dar said the policy is aimed at full utilization of
the quota, value addition, and it will have a positive impact in
increasing exports by about 400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that after detailed meetings with textile associations,
it has been decided to allow 100 percent allocation of quota on
the basis of quantity exported by each exporter.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the exporters fetching higher value during
this year will be compensated from the quota available with the
government, said Dar.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the new policy will ensure maximum
unionization of textile quota as 90 percent will be allocated from
January 1, 1999, enabling the exporters to plan their exports well
in advance. Previously, 60 to 65 percent quota was allocated.
</P>
<P>
The First-come First-Served procedure for allocation of quota
has been further simplified as exporter can get it after making
shipment as well as advance reservation against bank guarantee, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The exporters will be allowed to use flexibilities available
under different bilateral agreements in January each year, he
said, adding that this will help exporters to plan their export
commitments well in advance.
</P>
<P>
Other features of the policy include strengthening of role of
private sector in textile quota management, expansion of Quota
Supervisory Council and entrusting of responsibility of
allocation, authentication of textile quota to textile
associations.
</P>
<P>
The minister hoped that the new policy will facilitate growth
of the weaker segments of the textile sector and will generate
more employment and investment.

<HEADLINE> Sick Elephant in Henan Has Healthy New Year's Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 31 (Xinhua) -- With best wishes from zoo
employees and local residents, Luweng, an aged female elephant in
the zoo of this capital of Henan Province, today observed the last
day of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Watching Luweng grab a piece of holiday cake with her trunk,
the people around cheered for her health after she had been fed
with an infusion of medicine and nutrients for 12 days, and
Luweng's keeper burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
Still lying on the ground, Luweng looked calm and peaceful, but
had little appetite for the many delicious foods in front of her,
including watermelon and sugarcane, her favorites.
</P>
<P>
Babu, Luweng's mate, had been moved to a neighboring
elephant-shed and watched lovingly, touching and attempting to
help Luweng stand up with his trunk. But Luweng was in a bad
temper and frightened Babu away with a sudden roar.
</P>
<P>
Luweng has been suffering from pancreatitis and other
complications since December 20, and has struggled to survive with
her strong will to live and and the great concern of the people
around her. She has been receiving infusions of 50,000 milliliters
of medicine a day since she became ill, said one zoologist.
</P>
<P>
To aid her recovery, Luweng, who has lived at the zoo for 12
years, will be taking large doses of traditional Chinese medicine
beginning today, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Monthly Inflation Rate Up By 4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's monthly inflation
rate for December has been recorded at 5.6 percent as compared
with November, representing an increase of 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency ZANA Thursday quoted David Diangamo,
director of census and statistics, as saying that the level of
inflation observed in December was mainly due to continued price
increases in food items such as 25-kilogram bag of mealie meal
which has risen from 17,632 to 18,769 Kwacha (one U.S. Dollars
equals 2,500 Kwacha).
</P>
<P>
Prices for other items including fuel, charcoal, electricity
charges and clothing had also gone up, said Diangamo.
</P>
<P>
A 20-liter tin of maize grain which was selling at 7,225
Kwacha last month is now selling at 8,589 Kwacha, reflecting an
increase of 19 percent, according to Diangamo.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the year-on-year inflation rate for the
composite group stood at 30.6 percent for December compared with
26.1 percent for November.
</P>
<P>
For the metropolitan low and high income groups, the
year-on-year inflation rate was recorded at 31.1 and 30 percent
respectively and for the non-metropolitan group, it stood at 30.7
percent, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Produces Over Two Million Tons of Oil, Gas in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The output of oil and gas at
the Qinghai oil field in northwest China hit a record two million
tons in 1998, according to figures released by the Qinghai
Petroleum Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Qaidam Basin of the northern Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, the Qinghai oil field has so far produced 15.5 million
tons of crude oil and 2.1 billion square meters of gas since
exploration began there in 1954.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Petroleum Bureau officials attribute the output growth
to new oil extraction technologies, and said crude oil output
increased to 5,170 tons a day in 1998, compared to 4,500 tons by
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, three gas pipes were installed in the field, and the
1998 gas output of 262 million square meters laid a solid basis
for the total output of oil and gas of over two million tons, said
the officials.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the oil and natural gas reserves in the
Qinghai oil field will be found to be 600 million tons (1,000
square meters of natural gas equals one ton of crude oil) by the
end of this century, with an annual oil and gas output of three
million tons.

<HEADLINE> Euro Feature: Monetary Union Finally A Reality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Yet another welcome
changeover in Europe: sure.
</P>
<P>
But it is poles apart in scale and significance from such
previous ones as the change from old French franc to the new and
from Britain's old pounds, shillings and pence to decimal
currency.
</P>
<P>
The New Year will usher in the biggest transfer of financial
sovereignty in history with the establishment of a single
currency for 290 million people in 11 countries.
</P>
<P>
The change affects not merely these 11 countries. Any country
in the world that has financial links with the countries that are
scheduled to use the common monetary system known as the euro
will feel the impact.
</P>
<P>
Hailed as the keystone of European integration, the single
currency was finally born after years of hectic preparation, both
by the countries participating and by the institutions that
administer the welfare of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the euro, though officially the final phase of
the economic and monetary union, is seen rather as the start of a
far-reaching and profound undertaking that got underway four
decades ago in the form of a common market on the European
continent.
</P>
<P>
The bloc has transformed itself from a six-nation group into a
15-nation league that now has 12 more countries applying for
membership.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Jean Monnet, the founding father of the European Union,
the integration engineers in his wake now have to take into
account the internal and external adaptation so as to make their
union capable of accommodating 27 and maybe even more countries,
not to mention dealing with an assortment of problems.
</P>
<P>
Barely will the launch of euro have passed than the European
Union will face up to at least three problems pinpointed in its
reform program, Agenda 2000.
</P>
<P>
The interlocked problems are enlargement, an improved common
agricultural policy and a tighter budget for the period from 2000
to 2006.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government from the 15 member states
failed to redress any of these problems during their Vienna
summit two weeks ago and only agreed to deal with them in a
special summit next March.
</P>
<P>
The euro will thus have to brace itself against the pressure
and trials from both within and outside the union, and all the 11
participating countries in the single currency will have to
practise austerity so as to help make the euro a success.
</P>
<P>
To avoid failure, euro zone governments, no longer having to
juggle with exchange rates to render their countries' goods and
services competitive, will have to become more efficient and have
to cooperate in taxation and social policy to deal with
persistent problems such as unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Though the structural reform of the European Union has lagged
somewhat behind schedule, the launch of the monetary union went
ahead exactly in accordance with planning. European Commission
President Jacques Santer said that the launch of euro was not
just economic. It was of great importance to the envisaged
political integration, he added.
</P>
<P>
Though the European Union countries of Britain, Denmark and
Sweden are staying out of the monetary union by choice, while
Greece failed to qualify, the combined efforts of Germany,
France, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Spain,
Portugal, Ireland, Finland and Austria, must turn the euro into
the anticipated keystone of a process many have striven to
achieve by means of both force and peace.

<HEADLINE> San Tome President Refuses to Accept Some New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- San Tome &AMP; Principe President
Miguel Trovoada Thursday refused to accept some of the candidates
for the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
However, the Sao Tome &AMP; Principe Liberation Movement -- the
Social Democratic Party (MLSTP-PSD) has agreed to put forward a
new list for cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Former foreign minister Guilherme Posser da Costa who was
appointed Tuesday as the country's new prime minister handed in a
list of cabinet members to the president who refused to accept
former justice minister Amaro Couto as foreign minister, or Jose
Viegas as state secretary for youth and sport.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Trovoada did not agree with the plan to set up a
ministry of interior by the MLSTP-PSD, insisting that interior
affairs and national security should be administrated by the
existing defense ministry.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Vaz, spokesman of the MLSTP-PSD, told the press that
the party does not understand why the president fails to trust
some of the candidates on the cabinet list, since the government
is not run by the president, but by the MLSTP-PSD which had won
the parliamentary elections in early November.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman also said it is the hope of his party
to lead a stable government. Therefore, it decided to hand in a
new list of cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
But Vaz insisted that interior ministry be separated from
defense ministry, which he noted is its promise made during the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Under Sao Tome &AMP; Principe constitution, the president has the
right to lead the country's diplomatic, defense and security
policies, therefore, he has the right to interfere with the work
of the above-mentioned ministries.

<HEADLINE> 123 People Killed in South Lebanon in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A total of 123 Lebanese and
Israelis were killed in conflicts in south Lebanon in 1998, the
Orient radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of those killed, 24 were Israeli soldiers, 34 militiamen from
the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army, 42 Lebanese anti-Israeli
guerrillas and 23 Lebanese civilians, the radio quoted security
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that over 200 others were wounded in south
Lebanon, where Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been
spearheading a guerrilla war against Israel's occupation.
</P>
<P>
It launched a total of 1,300 attacks on Israeli posts inside
the zone with heavy machine guns, grenades and remote-controlled
bombs in the outgoing year.
</P>
<P>
In return, Israeli warplanes made 116 raids on Hezbollah's
targets across Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Though the death toll of Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon
dropped this year compared with last year's 39, calls in Israel for
a withdrawal from Lebanon are mounting.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli government has to date insisted that any
withdrawal from Lebanon follow a negotiated security agreement
with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the Israeli demand, asking it to leave the
country without any condition, as stipulated in the
U.N. Resolution 425.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Pledges to Implement Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Thursday called for a proper implementation of the
political reform agenda and assured that the present government
has no intention of maintaining the political status quo.
</P>
<P>
"We will consistently implement the political agenda we have
agreed upon. In the near future, we will complete the
deliberations on a number of political bills," the president said
in his year-end speech.
</P>
<P>
Habibie expressed the hope that next year's general election
scheduled for June 7 would proceed honestly, democratically and
fairly. "We must wholeheartedly accept whatever is the outcome of
the general election," he said.
</P>
<P>
Through a smooth, honest and fair general election, the next
government will hopefully reflect the people's wish, which in turn
will end the present political crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
On economic issues, Habibie said the government will get on
with economic recovery measures.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis that hit the country in mid-1997 has not
yet been overcome completely and it has increased unemployment
which automatically raised the number of poor people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged crisis has also led to social and political
instability, such as riots and lootings. 1998 was full of
difficulties, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The president also called on all components of the nation to
strengthen unity and integrity.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be able to restrain our passions in facing
situations that are filled with challenges. Avoid a rash attitude
which could only make the situation worse," he said.
</P>
<P>
After his speech, President Habibie launched 1999 as the year
of "skills and engineering."
</P>
<P>
"Kriya (skill) is manifested in the Indonesia's will and work,
which must be supported by engineering to enable the people to
produce only the best for the country," Habibie said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Central Bank Calls for Promotion of Self-Reliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) has underscored the need for promoting self-reliance by
encouraging national savings and promoting consumption austerity
so that Pakistan can live within its means.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report for 1997-98 released Thursday, the SBP
said Pakistan's balance of payments has been vulnerable for quite
some time as large current account deficit has been financed
largely through debt creating short-term inflows which caused
foreign debt burden.
</P>
<P>
It called for direct foreign investment and medium-term debt
instruments to meet balance of payments. The Bank said that to
achieve medium-term goals, the government must broaden the tax
base.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank said the nuclear explosion conducted by
Pakistan in May this year and subsequent sanctions had large
fallout effects on the economy.
</P>
<P>
It affected the investors' confidence, the external sector came
under great pressure and during the first five months
(July-November) of the current fiscal year, the exports declined
by 12.4 percent, heavy borrowing by the government caused pressure
on fiscal position of the government, tax collection fell short of
the target while corporations failed to fully meet debt service
obligation.
</P>
<P>
According to the report the home remittances by overseas
Pakistanis declined by 39 percent and foreign investment by
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
The external sector came under great pressure. During the first
five months (July-November) of the current fiscal year, exports
declined by 12.4 percent and imports by 20.1 percent over the
corresponding period last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
These declines have obvious implications both for the
government revenue and the tempo of economic activity in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, despite these developments, the balance of payments on
current account (excluding resident foreign currency deposits)
from July to November showed improvement compared with the same
period last year, largely because of decline in imports.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the trends so far, current account balance for
the year is likely to decline from 3.2 percent of the GDP during
1997-98 to three percent in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Bank said that total national debt at
the end of June this year had reached 2,518 billion rupees (54.7
billion U.S. dollars) or 91.2 percent of the GDP. Serving of the
debt has become a major national problem.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank said the size of the debt needs to be
contained to manageable limits through various policy measures,
including debt retirement through the use of privatization
proceeds and sale of government property, and by offering shares
of public sector enterprises to holders of debt.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, dependence on foreign debt should be reduced by
encouraging inflow of direct foreign investment and substituting
short-term loans with medium-term debt instruments, the Bank said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Economy to Recover in Next 6 Months: SBP Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) has forecast that Pakistan's economy will recover
substantially in the second half (January-June) of the current
fiscal year from the adverse developments since May this year.
</P>
<P>
The SBP said in its annual report for 1997-98 issued Thursday
the agriculture sector is expected to achieve a growth rate of
five percent, industrial revival in the second half of the year is
expected to push up the overall growth of the industrial sector
close to that of last year.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of inflation is expected to remain in a single
digit and deficit in the current account of the balance of
payments is expected to decline from 3.2 percent of the Gross
Domestic Product in 1997-98 to three percent in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
All external payments are expected to be regularized soon, and
foreign exchange reserves are projected to increase to the range
of 1.4 billion U.S. dollars to 2 billion dollars by the end of the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The SBP said that by the end of June 1999, conditions of
normalcy must be re-established, investors' confidence should come
back and conditions could begin to be restored for stabilization
and resumption of high growth.
</P>
<P>
However, the Central Bank report said, the restoration of
confidence and achievement of growth and stability would require
careful handling of the economy on a sustained basis.
</P>
<P>
Relief in external debt payments and resumption of resource
inflows from international financial institutions would provide a
breathing space for the restructuring of the economy so as to
achieve self-reliance and reduce the need for large external
assistance or debt on a continuous basis.

<HEADLINE> Unity, Key to Successful Economic Recovery: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday that preserving the prevailing
stability, peace and the cooperation among Malaysians is the key
to ensuring the success of Malaysia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
1999, the final year of the second millennium and the 20th
century, is poised to test the resilience of Malaysians and as
such they should be prepared to take on the challenges, Mahathir
said in his New Year message aired over radio Television Malaysia
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
He said: "If we persevere, if we preserve the stability and
peace in the country and if we work together to carry out the
strategies for recovery which we have planned together, we'll
achieve success and give continued meaning to our independence."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said although 1998 was a problem-ridden year, it was
also a year of successes for the country. He cited the opening of
the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, reputedly the world's most
beautiful and most modern airport, the completion of the world's
tallest building -- the Petronas Twin Towers, hosting of the 16th
Commonwealth Games as successes.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, however, reminded Malaysians to continue to be
vigilant against enemies out to recolonize the country, saying
certain powers would use whatever weapons and equipment they have
to divide Malaysians and take control of the country.
</P>
<P>
He also said outsiders would not cease trying to destroy the
Malaysian economy by scaring away not only the investors but also
the tourists through adverse reports.
</P>
<P>
He said it was crucial that the Malaysia Incorporated Concept,
which emphasized cooperation between the government, workers and
the private sector, be adhered to in handling eventualities.
</P>
<P>
He said economic recovery efforts would require support from
all Malaysians by way of their preserving the prevailing peace and
harmony.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: HK's External Economic Ties Expanding After Handover (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The economic and trade
relations between Hong Kong and the rest of the world have been
further strengthened and developed after it became a special
administrative region (SAR) of China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Before the handover, some people worried that Hong Kong's
external relations would contract after its return to China, but
facts have proved that Hong Kong's external relations have enjoyed
an obvious expansion after July 1, 1997, said Michael Suen,
secretary for constitutional affairs of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Just as many SAR government officials and Hong Kong businessmen
have said, because Hong Kong is a small-sized economy and lacks
natural resources, external economic and trade relations are vital
for it to maintain its status as an international trade, financial
and shipping center.
</P>
<P>
The smooth and continuous development of Hong Kong's external
economic relations is based on the concept of "one country, two
systems" and guaranteed by the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, Hong Kong remains a separate
Customs territory, has no foreign exchange control, continues the
free market economic principle, and maintains a free port.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law also stipulates that representatives of the HKSAR
government may participate in international conferences as members
of the Chinese government delegations and the HKSAR may, on its
own, using the name "Hong Kong, China," maintain and develop
relations and conclude and implement agreements with foreign
states and regions and relevant international organizations.
</P>
<P>
After the handover, Hong Kong, in the name of "Hong Kong,
China," maintains its full membership in the World Trade
Organization, of which China as a whole is still not a member, and
in the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference (APEC), of which China is
also a member.
</P>
<P>
During the conferences that Hong Kong representatives
participated in, either as members of the Chinese government
delegations or on their own in the name of "Hong Kong, China,"
they may express their own views on behalf of and in the interest
of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
In some conferences, for example the APEC, HKSAR
representatives may even express views different from that of the
Central government of China.
</P>
<P>
During the past 18 months, the SAR has signed more than 20
bilateral agreements with foreign countries in various areas
including mutual legal assistance, air services, air transit and
investment promotion and protection. Nearly 80 more agreements are
being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreements has provided convenience for the
expansion of ties between Hong Kong and these countries in the
fields of economy, trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Under the accords for the promotion and protection of investors
concluded with 15 countries, Hong Kong and these countries agreed
to mutually provide for equal treatment of investors and for the
settlement of investment disputes in accordance with international
norms.
</P>
<P>
Through these agreements, the interests of investors are fully
guaranteed and Hong Kong's position as a financial and trade
center has been strengthened.

<TEXT>
<P>
The overseas visits by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and other
senior government officials to dozens of countries and regions
around the world have played an important role in expanding Hong
Kong's external economic ties.
</P>
<P>
One of the tasks of Tung's overseas trips is to persuade these
countries and regions to grant visa-free access to HKSAR passport
holders.
</P>
<P>
Now 56 countries and regions have agreed to grant visa-free
access to HKSAR passport holders, bringing convenience to Hong
Kong businessmen to do business or to invest in these countries
and regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong has granted visa-free access to passport
holders of 170 countries and regions. The move has helped attract
foreign businessmen and tourists to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Almost each of the overseas visits was accompanied by a group
of Hong Kong businessmen, and issues about economic and trade
cooperation between Hong Kong and these countries were listed
on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
During Tung's visit to the European Union in October 1997, a
new business forum, the Hong Kong/EU--EU/Hong Kong Business
Cooperation Committees were set up.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang made a three-week mission to
Europe and the United States in September this year to exchange
views with the world's financial leaders on the restoration of
order and stability in the international financial market.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Tsang explained the rationale behind the SAR
government's counter measures against the manipulators in Hong
Kong's stock and futures markets and convinced the world financial
leaders that Hong Kong is still pursuing the free market policy.
</P>
<P>
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan and Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority Joseph Yam had participated in the
exhibitions organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(TDC) in New York and Tokyo to promote Hong Kong's financial
services.
</P>
<P>
While senior officials went out to promote Hong Kong around the
world, heads of state and government of many foreign countries
have come to Hong Kong, usually on the last leg of their visits to
China.
</P>
<P>
Among the distinguished visitors were presidents of the United
States, Bulgaria, the Philippines and South Korea, the King of
Norway, vice president of South Africa, prime ministers of Britain
and France and many other foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
These high-level exchanges of visits have helped strengthen and
develop the economic and trade relations between Hong Kong and
these countries.

Hong Kong has also hosted a series of large scale international
conferences after its return to China.
</P>
<P>
Conferences held in Hong Kong in 1997 included the annual
meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank (WB), the International Investment Funds Conference, the 57th
Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 24 Developing Countries, the
World Economic Forum's Sixth East Asia Economic Summit, and the
28th General Assembly of the World Trade Centers Association.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 Hong Kong hosted the Ninth Annual International
Corporate Conference of the Asia Society and the Asian Regional
Symposium '98 of the World Intellectual Property Organization.
Various medium and small-scale international conferences and
exhibitions had never stopped in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Even after the Asian financial turmoil struck Hong Kong in
October 1997, Hong Kong's status as a city of international
business is still there.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, over 25,000 foreign companies have set up their
regional headquarters or offices in Hong Kong and most of them are
optimistic about the long-term prospect of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Trade Development Council has conducted nearly
400 business and trade promoting activities (including
exhibitions, business conferences and seminars) in over 40
countries and regions around the world in the past one and a half
years.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 trade delegations from all over the world
(excluding China's mainland) have paid visits to Hong Kong in the
past two years. The number of trade delegations from the mainland
has added up to 282.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has kept and developed close
relations with central banks of other countries and regions and
international organizations such as the IMF, WB and the Asian
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, the Bank of International Settlement (BIS)
set up a representative office in Hong Kong. It is the first
overseas office for the BIS, headquartered in Basal, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
With the support from the central government of China, Hong
Kong had beaten its rivals -- Japan and Singapore -- to win the
trust of the BIS by its business-friendly environment.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the office of the BIS in Hong Kong reinforces
the status of Hong Kong as a leading international financial
center and has demonstrated that the international financial
community had cast a vote of confidence in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Williams, White honored "Gongs" in Britain New Years List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Frank Williams, owner of the
Formula One team that bears his name, and snooker's most popular
player, Jimmy White, were honored on Thursday in Britain's
traditional New Year's List.
</P>
<P>
Williams received a knighthood, the highest honor awarded to
the nine people associated with sport on the list, meaning he
should now be addressed as Sir Frank.
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised and very happy that I received such an
important honor," he said in a statement. "Additionally, I am
truly delighted that the team's achievements in grand prix racing
have been recognized in this way."
</P>
<P>
Williams formed Williams Grand Prix Engineering in 1977 and
the team have since won seven formula one titles.
</P>
<P>
White, nicknamed Whirlwind for his fast, almost insouciant
style of snooker, was awarded an MBE (Member of the British
Empire), the lowest rung on the "gongs" ladder, along with
heptathlete Denise Lewis, boxer "Prince" Naseem Hamed, cricketer
Angus Fraser and soccer player Stuart Pearce.
</P>
<P>
"I've had a bit of a year," said White, whose son Tommy Tiger
was born recently. White, who has lost six Embassy world finals,
said he planned to play on for another five years in an attempt
to win the elusive championship.
</P>
<P>
The honors list is prepared by Prime Minister Tony Blair but
ordinary Britons are encouraged to propose names for inclusion.

<HEADLINE> Jordanians Stage Protest Before U.S. Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 31 (Xinhua) - Over 200 Jordanians staged a
sit-in protest in front of the U.S. embassy in Amman Thursday
morning, demanding an immediate end to U.S. military actions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Riot police did not intervene in the peaceful protest, which
went on from 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes had reportedly clashed on Monday and Wednesday
with Iraqi air defense units in the no-fly zones, imposed by the
U.S. and British forces in northern and southern Iraq after the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The protest was organized by the non-governmental Popular
Committee for Supporting Iraq, which had also called for lifting
the sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Jordanian government also urged the
U.S. to stop its military actions against Iraq, and to pursue a
diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy in Amman had been cordoned off since December
16, when the U.S-British forces began to launch four consecutive
rounds of air raids on Baghdad, which were triggered by what the
U.S said Iraq's failure to cooperate fully with U.N. inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1998: Bangladesh in Retrospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The year 1998 ends in Bangladesh
with unprecedented havoc created by the century's worst flood and
events which have either made people depressed or brought them new
hopes.
</P>
<P>
The beginning of the year saw the start of surrender of the
tribal insurgents in the southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts
following the signing of a government-rebel peace treaty in
December 1997, and the completion of the return to the hill region
of nearly 60,000 tribal refugees from the bordering Indian state
of Tripura.
</P>
<P>
An atmosphere of peace is prevailing in the hill tracts after
more than two decades of armed struggle in which thousands lost
their lives.
</P>
<P>
The year was marked by a devastating flood between July and
September, which lasted more than 11 weeks inundating two-thirds
of the country and affected one-third of the total population
claiming over 1,100 lives.
</P>
<P>
The flood caused enormous losses of property and human lives,
and mental sufferings to the Bangladeshi people, whose hopes of
eradicating poverty and achieving prosperity would have to remain
dreams for years to come.
</P>
<P>
In the political arena, the return to parliament of the
opposition law-makers in March gave many people the hope of a
political reconciliation, but their hopes were smashed when the
opposition launched in June a "long march" movement toward the
hill region "to safeguard the country's independence and
sovereignty," and to press their demand for the scrap of the peace
treaty which it accused of "violating the Constitution" and
"ignoring the interests of the nation."
</P>
<P>
Hopes of political stability in the country revived when the
ruling Bangladesh Awami League decided in November to renounce
hartal "either in power or in opposition" following an
opposition-called three-day countrywide strike and the opposition
responded by listing conditions for an end to hartals.
</P>
<P>
The judgment in November of the killing case of former
president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was one of the country's major
events of the year. The verdict, which "strengthened the
foundation of the rule of law in the country," came 23 years after
Mujibur Rahman, father of incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,
was assassinated in a plot on August 15, 1975.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka successfully hosted the first business summit of
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan in January this year, and a
ministerial meeting of the BIMST-EC (Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri
Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation forum) in December, playing a
significant role in strengthening regional cooperation,
particularly in the field of economic development.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh managed to resume the repatriation of some 21,000
Myanmar refugees staying in southeastern Cox's Bazar district in
November, and signed agreed-upon minutes with India the same month
on border-related issues, including the demarcation of a nearly
6.5-kilometer stretch of border which remained unfinished.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the positive signs and progress in 1998, there
exist problems unsolved, such as India's reportedly attempt to
push Bengali-speaking "Indian nationals" into Bangladesh, the slow
repatriation process of the Myanmar refugees, and more
importantly, a slow economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh scored an unprecedented 5.9 percent economic growth
during the last fiscal year ending on June 30, 1998 and set an
ambitious target of 6 percent for the current 1998-99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The target was slimmed down to 4 percent following the
protracted deluge and a drop in export earnings, which registered
a 5-percent negative growth during the first four months of the
current fiscal year compared with that of the same period of the
previous year, and 14 percent short of the target.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 also witnessed the successful hosting by
Bangladesh of the Wills International Cup Cricket Tournament in
late October and early November and the opening in June of the
950-million-dollar multi-purpose Jamuna Bridge, the longest bridge
in the country and in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
All these have brought excitement to the Bangladeshi people who
hope that the coming New Year would be a better year for them with
fast economic growth and a stable political situation.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebel Group Builds up Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), the major rebel group in the Philippines, has built
up its forces to 11,990 guerrillas now from 8,200 two years ago, a
military report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Muslim rebel group has added 3,790
fighters to its forces in the past two years in the Southern
Philippines, mostly in Central Mindanao, where the MILF has
established its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the military report said, the MILF also
acquired additional fire power and has 8,240 assorted firearms
now, up by 1,275 from the 6,965 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The buildup of firepower and recruitment activities occurred
while a ceasefire agreement between the government and the MILF is
in place, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted that gunbattles between the government and
the MILF had gone down from 369 in 1997 to 293 in 1998 because of
the existing truce.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the ceasefire, fatalities from both sides had
decreased drastically since 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has recently threatened to escalate the fighting if
the government would not accept its demand for an independent
state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But President Joseph Estrada rejected the demand last Monday,
saying that the demand of the MILF for an Islamic state in

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Extends New Year's Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper the
"People's Daily" will carry an editorial in its January 1, 1999
issue, calling on the nation to make concerted efforts and to
strive for new achievement in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Extending a new year message to the Chinese people of all
ethnic groups, the editorial cites 1998 as a significant year,
when China managed to successfully fight the impact of the Asian
financial crisis and overcome the severe floods which struck the
country.
</P>
<P>
China is now politically and socially stable with sustainable
growth of the national economy continuing, the editorial notes.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 will be more extraordinary in Chinese history,
the editorial says, noting that China will celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and
Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also says 1999 will be a year full of
opportunities and challenges, adding that the multi-polarization
of the world and the globalization of the economy brings China
closer to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China's reform and opening-up is coming to a critical
period after 20 years since it was first introduced. Meanwhile,
the development of modern science and technology and the
knowledge-based economy will all offer China the most exciting
opportunities as well as risks, it emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
Experience in the past year proves that adherence to the basic
theory, line and programs of the Chinese Communist Party is
a prerequisite and decisive factor in overcoming difficulties and
becoming successful, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Finally, it calls on the people to hold higher the great banner
of Deng Xiaoping Theory, unite closer around the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, grasp the opportunities on
offer and work hard for further development.

<HEADLINE> Star Singer Lures Chinese Pop Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese pop music fans are
waiting excitedly for the arrival of American singer Richard Marx,
who will perform his first concerts in China in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
Chicago-born Marx has been at forefront of the pop music
business for many years and is one of the earliest western
singers introduced to Chinese music fans ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that he has the biggest Chinese fan club of any
European or American singer.
</P>
<P>
So, while New Year movies and Christmas sales might offer
attractions for many, the prospect of a Marx concert is a big
event for the young Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Already boys and girls are seeking tickets for the two shows on
January 15 and 16.
</P>
<P>
Subway stations in downtown Beijing and roadside billboards are
decorated with giant posters of the 35-year-old rock and roll
star. Song Jing, a woman in her twenties who is studying at
Beijing Broadcasting Institute for her master's degree, said, "I
can hardly wait to see Richard at his concert."
</P>
<P>
"But I don't know if I'll be lucky enough to get his
autograph," she added.
</P>
<P>
Richard Marx, a thundering good name for a pop star, recently
caused a new fad in the Chinese capital. His latest album Days
With Love has become a big hit with his fans who have besieged
Beijing's music stores for copies.
</P>
<P>
The Cultural Entertainment Company under China's Performance
Abroad Agency (CPAA), the shows' organizer, said that the concerts
have sold well even though the most expensive tickets are priced
at 500 yuan (60 U.S. dollars), the average monthly wage of a
worker here.
</P>
<P>
Marx, who likes wearing jeans, shot to worldwide fame with his
song Right Here Waiting, which took the highest position in the
U.S. Billboard's Top Ten for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Richard will give us something exciting and bring a
real carnival here," said Wang Beibei, a Beijing music fan.
</P>
<P>
The twice Grammy Awards nominee also plans to perform in
Shanghai on January 20.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar bubbled
higher Thursday, gaining nearly a third of a U.S. cent to end
local trade for 1998 on a positive note.
</P>
<P>
Buying interest came from offshore as British pound sterling
was exchanged for Australian dollars ahead of the weekend
introduction of the euro, said Dale Felton, foreign exchange
manager with HSBC Markets.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange market was quite active during the early
half of the day, in contrast to thin trading in recent days, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished Thursday at 61.43 U.S. cents,
its intra-day high, and fell as low as 61.06 U.S. cents. It
closed at 61.12 U.S. cents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A year ago Thursday the Australian currency finished trading at
65.24 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished trading at 70.55 Japanese yen
from Wednesday's close of 70.48 yen and 1.0298 German marks from
1.0224 marks.

<HEADLINE> China Tackles Pollution in Taihu Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials have vowed
to clean up the highly polluted Taihu Lake, China's third largest
freshwater late in the south, in the coming new year.
</P>
<P>
All factories in the area failing to meet new waste water
emission standards will be shut down tonight and there will be no
bargaining, according to Xie Zhenhua, director of the State
Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
The tough measures are expected to cut the area's industrial
water pollution by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 85 percent of the major polluters each producing more
than 100 tons of waste water a day in the lake valley have
installed treatment facilities to clean up the water disposal.
Another 143 polluters have been closed down not acting fast enough
to tackle the pollution problem.
</P>
<P>
SEPA officials say that the anti-pollution campaign launched in
the area in 1998 has been quite successful. However, they pointed
out that the bulk of the waste water comes from urban sewage.
</P>
<P>
"To clean up the lake properly, urban sewage must be
controlled," they stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to a government plan to clean up Taihu Lake, 33 urban
sewage plants with a daily treatment capacity of more than 1.6
million tons of water would have been completed in the lake valley
by the end of 1998. However, only two have so far come into
operation, with 14 still under construction and another 17 still
in the planning stage.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of funds is the major problem," said a SEPA official, who
explained that although the central government has earmarked
certain funds for the projects, local governments and financial
organizations have not shown similar enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, from tomorrow discharging phosphoric detergents in
the lake will be banned. Shu Jinhua, a research fellow with the
Chinese Academy of Sciences said that the measure will cut
phosphoric emissions by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zang Yuxiang, vice-director of SEPA's Pollution Control
Department, added that tonight's crackdown on industrial polluters
will cut phosphoric emission by a further 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
"If tough measures are taken against agricultural polluters, we
can reduce the pollution level by another 15 percent," he added.
</P>
<P>
The phosphoric materials in the lake are attributed to an
over-abundance of algae in the water, causing serious pollution
problems.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the state's clean up target can be achieved
only under the condition that phosphoric emissions are cut by 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
Chinese environmental expert Qian Yi said that China should be
fully prepared to engage in a protracted war with those polluting
the lake.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight's action is just a beginning," he warned.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Zemin Delivers New Year's Message (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expressed hope today that people in all nations will make further
progress in the realm of peace, stability and development during
1999.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the comment in his New Year's Eve message broadcast
live by China Radio International, China Central People's
Broadcasting Station and China Central Television.
</P>
<P>
The message -- "Working Hard Together to Ensure a Bright Future
for the World" -- represented Jiang's great confidence in the
future of China and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee, noted that 1998 marks the 20th
anniversary of China's reform and opening policies. He said China
has scored great achievements and accumulated valuable experience
in the construction of socialist modernizations over the past two
decades under the leadership of the CPC and the guidance of Deng
Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese people are more confidently marching to the future, "
said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said cross-century state leaders and the leaders of the
CPPCC National Committee were elected during the First Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) and the First Session
of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
China maintained comparatively rapid development in 1998 thanks
to correct measures the Chinese Government adopted in face of the
financial crisis which continues to engulf many countries in Asia,
according to the president.
</P>
<P>
He noted that progress has been made in enterprise, financial
and government institutional reforms, and Chinese citizens have
marked improvements in terms of living standards.

<TEXT>
<P>
The monumental victory the Chinese army and people won this
year in fighting against the most serious flooding in some four
decades exhibited the indomitable heroic spirit of the Chinese
nation, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, which returned to the montherland last year, has
since maintained stability and prosperity in spite of the adverse
impact of the Asian financial crisis and various other emerging
challenges.
</P>
<P>
The people in Hong Kong can create a bright future with the
support of the central government and the government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, according to
the president.
</P>
<P>
By pursuing an independent diplomatic policy of peace, he said,
China has consolidated cooperation with developing countries and
strengthed friendly relations with its neighbors. He added that
further progress has been made in developing diplomatic relations
with the United States, Russia, Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
He noted China also actively contributed to easing the
financial crisis in Asia by adopting a highly responsible attitude
and playing a constructive role in handling other key
international issues.
</P>
<P>
China is determined to work with the people of all countries in
promoting the lofty cause of world peace and development, said
the president.
</P>
<P>
China will further deepen reforms, expand opening and exert all
possible efforts to overcome difficulties and problems arising in
the course of advancement and promote the sustained, steady
development of the economy and society and the coordinated
development of material and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pledged that the Chinese Government will extend even
greater effort to help laid-off workers, farmers in
poverty-stricken areas and all other Chinese citizens facing
difficulty.

policy of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law of the
Macao Special Administrative Region throughout the preparation
period and will guarantee the smooth transition of power in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president reiterated that Taiwan is an inalienable
part of China, and stressed that the Chinese Government is
determined to settle the Taiwan issue in line with the policies of
"peaceful reunification, and one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that Taiwan authorities will comply with the
wishes of the people, squarely face reality and resume dialogue
and negotiations with the mainland in order to help realize direct
cross-Straits mail, shipping and trade services, and formally end
the hostility between the two sides under the one China
principle," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that the deepening multipolarization and economic
globalization, as well as the rapid development of science and
technology are offering new development opportunities for all
countries.
</P>
<P>
"However, the world is still far from tranquil," said
Jiang. "Hegemonism and power politics continue to exist, and no
fundamental changes have been made in the old, unjust and
unreasonable international political and economic order; conflicts
related to race, religion, territorial disputes and interference
in the internal affairs of other nations surface from time to
time; international crime, terrorism, drug smuggling,
environmental deterioration and many other international questions
remain unanswered."
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the Chinese government's deep concern about the
spread and increasing severity of the Asia financial crisis. He
called on countries throughout the world to strengthen cooperation
in overcoming the crisis and preventing a worldwide economic
recession.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that people in all nations will work
together to nurture a world in which all people can live and work
in peace and contentment, as well as a beautiful world where human
beings will be able to continuously realize colorful civilizations
and progress.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Adopts New Assistance Strategies for Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Under its new Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Nepal, the World Bank will, in the
next three years, bring the resources closer to the beneficiaries
and support collective donor action to foster stronger governance
to reduce waste and mismanagement, the bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In coordination with Nepal's new Local Self-Governance Act, the
CAS which was approved on December 15 emphasizes district-level
project implementation and greater beneficiary participation in
project design, construction and maintenance, the bank said in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
"The CAS states that the abundance of foreign assistance to
Nepal, while achieving some successes, has also shielded Nepal
from underlying structural problems and has often substituted for
the creation of national capacity to plan and implement
development programs," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"It therefore calls for greater donor coordination with
emphasis on institutional development. Such cooperation is also
needed to improve governance," it added.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that in parallel with these efforts, the CAS
stresses the need to strengthen both private sector project
implementation and the central government's crucial responsibility
for monitoring and evaluating the projects.
</P>
<P>
On the broader development outlook for the country, the central
message of the CAS is that faster and sustainable growth, more
equitably distributed throughout the country, is needed to make
substantial progress in reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
It also emphasizes the need for continued improvement in
national economic and fiscal management, especially strengthening
of the tax base, a better allocation and management of public
resources, reform of the financial sector and further
privatization.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the World Bank held extensive public
consultations on the CAS in various locations throughout Nepal
from January through September this year.

<HEADLINE> Two Nigerian Parties Decide to Present Joint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The All People's Party (APP)
and the Alliance for Democracy (AD) have resolved to present a
joint presidential candidate for next year's general elections in
a bid to check the victory run of the People's Democratic Party
(PDP).
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued Tuesday at the end of a joint committee
meeting of the two parties, APP and AD said that they had agreed
to pick the presidential candidate from the southern part of the
country, This Day newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that both parties are committed to the
principle of restructuring with a view to returning Nigeria to
true federation.
</P>
<P>
The two parties resolved to cooperate electorally for the
promotion and sustenance of civil democracy as opposed to
"militarized democracy", beginning with the governorship and
state house of assembly elections on January 9.
</P>
<P>
So, the communique said, APP and AD would most likely ask
their supporters to vote for whichever of the two parties is
stronger in any of the 36 states in the west African country
during the January 9 elections.
</P>
<P>
Efforts made in the early days of the formation of political
parties in the country to bring them under one umbrella failed as
the AFENIFERE and the People's Consultative Forum politicians who
are now AD members vowed not to have anything to do with those
people they dubbed "Abacha politicians" in the APP.
</P>
<P>
But, after the local government elections held early this
month, it is clear to APP and AD parties that if they want to check
the winning streak of the PDP, they must sink their differences
and work together, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Parliament Passes Fiscal 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian National
Assembly adopted Thursday the country's fiscal 1999 budget, with
no major changes in revenue and expenditure compared to last
year's budget.
</P>
<P>
The budget was adopted after a nearly two-day debate, with 98
votes in favor which reached the quorum.
</P>
<P>
The annual budget is about 420 million U.S. dollars, of which
almost half depends upon foreign aids and loan. At the same time,
half of its domestic revenue will come from import tax. The total
spending is just the same as the revenue, with no deficit.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure on military and security are still high
compared to previous years.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget, about 89 million dollars will be spent
on defense, which accounts about 40 percent of the total budget
and drops about 6 percent as compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
Keat Chhon, Minister of Finance and Economy, told the Assembly
Wednesday that "what we spent on defense and security is important
for the country. Although the war is finished we have to spend it
for buying peace and security."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the budget increased the spending on health by 47
percent, education by 13 percent and agriculture by 59 percent,
although those areas still make up only a small percentage of
overall spending.

JAKARTA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation in
December was 1.42 percent, bringing the 1998 inflation to 77.63
percent, the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation in 1997 was only 11.5 percent.

"The December inflation was particularly triggered by an
increase in prices of commodities in the past two weeks during the
fasting month of Ramadhan," BPS Chief Sugito said.
</P>
<P>
The prices of several commodities had increased along with the
people's rising demand during the Christmas and the fasting month
of Ramadhan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the prices of commodities was reflected by
consumer's price index which reached 198.54 compared to 195.86 in
November.
</P>
<P>
He said the December inflation was higher than the November
inflation which reached 0.08 percent, but was lower than the same
period last year when the figure was recorded at 2.04 percent.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the rising prices of rice, meat, chicken, fish
and eggs had contributed a lot to the December inflation.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Makes Encouraging Achievements in Tourism Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Nepali officials said here
Thursday that encouraging achievements have been made in the Visit
Nepal Year'98, the first of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a function called "See You Again - Grand Finale"
held at the end of the tourism year, Minister for Tourism and
Civil Aviation Bhim Bahadur Rawal said that throughout the year
various programs were organized across the country through the
broad-based coordination of the Nepalese people, the government
and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"This national campaign has clearly established strong
commitment on the part of the people to the cause of tourism
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Activities related to infrastructure development have been
carried out in the period, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Visit Nepal Year'98 campaign has increased awareness and
participation of the people in tourism and enhanced the image of
Nepal as a destination in the international market, besides
promoting domestic tourism," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He held that the campaign has also contributed to the
development of quality in the Nepalese tourism to some extent.
"Quality tourism will be our focus of activity in 1999 and
beyond," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that according to a World Tourism
Organization report, the year 1998 does not show encouraging
trends in the world tourism compared with the past years.
</P>
<P>
"Despite this odd, Nepal registered a positive growth in
tourist arrivals in 1998," he said. "This achievement is clearly
the contribution of Visit Nepal Year'98."
</P>
<P>
Nepal aims to attract 500,000 tourists this year, but by the
end of November, tourist arrivals by air stood at 360,875, up 11.8
percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a major foreign exchange earner for the Himalayan
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Dipendra Purush Dhakal, secretary at the Ministry of Tourism
and Civil Aviation, also told the function that the image of Nepal
has been reestablished among the international community.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal is again being selected as one of the prime destinations
by tourists," he said. "Had this been not the case, four
international airlines -- Gulf, Transavia, Austrian and Condor --
would not have started their flights from Nepal in the same year."
</P>
<P>
Queen Aishwarya and Crown Prince Dipendra graced the function
attended by some 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
An hour-long cultural and religious programs were presented on
the occasion by different castes of the Nepalese people.

<P>
SINGAPORE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Share prices ended the year
with little movement in the half-day session on the Singapore
Stock Market on the eve of the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
Activity almost came to a still ahead of the new year holiday
after some window-dressing gave the market some support during the
morning trading. No fresh incentive emerged to influence dealings
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) closed 1.97 points
lower at 1392.73 points.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover was 75.91 million units worth 99.31 million
Singapore dollars (about 60.21 million U.S. dollars). Decliners
led advancers by 130 to 82 with 208 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was a 0.81 million parcel of CSA which
transacted at 1.04 Singapore dollars per share. It was followed by

<P>
ASJ Hlds was the sole stock that showed gain on the chart,
inching up six cents to end at 0.585 Singapore dollars.

On the downside, Nat Kap was the biggest loser of the day
retreating nine cents to close at 0.345 Singapore dollars. CityDev

<HEADLINE> Doctors Satisfied With Condition of Four Surviving Sextuplets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Doctors say they are
satisfied with the conditions of the four surviving sextuplets
eight days after their birth in the northeast city of Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
The four boys and two girls were born at around 7:30 pm on the
evening of December 23 in this capital of China's Liaoning
Province. Two of them, a boy and a girl, died of lung hemorrhages
on December 27.
</P>
<P>
"The four survivors are in much better condition than we
expected," said Dr. Mao Jian from the New-Born Intensive Care
Department of the No 2 Hospital attached to the China Medical
University.
</P>
<P>
Mao said that the little girl who was born second suffered from
arterial duct patency and heart murmur on December 28, but that on
December 30 the arterial duct closed and the heart murmur
disappeared after two day's treatment.
</P>
<P>
Hospital reports show that the second baby now has better lung
and circulatory functions and is taking milk easily. The three
others have no apnea.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Mao said that the weight of the remaining babies has
increased by 15 to 40 grams respectively.
</P>
<P>
The babies were delivered by Caesarean section when their
mother, Yao Hong, a 33-year-old woman living in the suburbs of
Shenyang, experienced delivery problems on the afternoon of
December 23.
</P>
<P>
The mother was pregnant for only 28 weeks, and the heaviest
infant had a birth weight of only 1.17 kilograms, according to
Dr. Mao.
</P>
<P>
The sextuplets were naturally conceived rather than as a result
of artificial insemination, and medical experts say that the
chances of a woman giving to birth to six children is one in 400
billion.
</P>
<P>
Doctors attributed the births to hereditary factors. Li
Quanyou, the father, is one of twins and the mother has an aunt
who is also one of twins and has twins of her own. Li and Yao
already have a 12-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
The surviving four babies are still being strictly monitored.

<HEADLINE> End of the Housing Nightmare for China's College Teachers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to remodel living
accommodation for more than 180,000 teachers living in rundown
housing the Chinese government has set up a special fund of 2.15
billion yuan (260 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It has also set a deadline for the transformation work to be
completed by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that young college teachers and faculty members
working in education establishments nationwide, and under the
control of central government, are those facing the most
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In 67 Beijing universities and colleges there are 164
poorly-equipped buildings waiting to be remodeled with a total
floor space of 480,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Like most young college teachers in Beijing, Xu Tao, a
32-year-old researcher at Peking University, lives with his wife
and their five-year-old son in a tiny room the size of four
ping-pong tables. It is crammed with a large bed, a table, a
heavily-stocked bookshelf, a small desk, a refrigerator and three
chairs.
</P>
<P>
China's top leadership told the presidents of the country's
major universities recently that such crude housing should not be
permitted in the next century.
</P>
<P>
These rundown buildings on college campuses were first built in
the 1950s as students' dormitories but later became homes for
teachers and staff due to the increasing numbers of faculty
members. The rooms are bird cage-like and cooking has to be done
in corridors. There are also limited toilet facilities which have
to be shared.

<P>
"I became a researcher at Institute of Microelectronics in
Peking University this April and my project is quite
time-consuming," said Xu. "But I can find no quiet space to work
at night in my home. I want nothing more than two separate rooms
with our own kitchen and toilet," he added.
</P>
<P>
When Vice-Premier Li Lanqing announced his plans to solve the
issue no later than the end of the century, Xu and his wife were
overjoyed.
</P>
<P>
Xu revealed that one of his friends became so disillusioned
that he had made up his mind to go abroad and find a better
future. "He had asked the university to provide a room for his
parents but to no avail," explained Xu.
</P>
<P>
Although Peking University has built new housing for faculty
members, totalling more than 200,000 square meters, in the last 20
years the housing demands have also increased rapidly and are far
from being satisfactorily met.
</P>
<P>
A shortage of funds and a decreasing availability of land are
the university's daunting problems, according to Tang Xingsheng,
who is in charge of the university's general affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tang explained that after working out a thorough, comprehensive
plan to tackle the issues, the university has decided to build new
off-campus apartments for its young teachers, instead of
modernizing the old buildings, which is only a temporary remedy.
</P>
<P>
After some senior faculty members have moved to new apartments,
their previous rooms can also become a part of the housing stock
and the university can live up to its promise of meeting the hopes
of its young staff.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Peace-makers Dominate UK's Honors List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- British former Prime Minister
John Major becomes a Companion of Honor on the New Year Honors
list for his vital work for peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Leading a list of almost 1,000 members of the British
society, ranging from parliamentarians to shepherds, Major was
picked out by his successor Tony Blair for his groundwork that
led the province to its historic Good Friday agreement in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's official spokesman said Blair had wanted
to honor those who had "helped give peace a chance" in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, chair of the Northern
Ireland peace talks, was awarded an honorary Knighthood. But as a
foreign citizen, he is not allowed to hold a full honor.
</P>
<P>
His co-chairman in the talks General Alfred John Gardyne
Drummond de Chastelain, a Canadian and therefore member of the
Commonwealth, was also named a Companion of Honor.
</P>
<P>
A doctor, a policeman and a council official who played vital
roles in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing, the worst atrocity
in Northern Ireland's troubled history, were also named on the
list.
</P>
<P>
More than half of those named on the list are recognized
specifically for their voluntary service, the highest yet
recorded on any list.
</P>
<P>
They are joined by a pantheon of names from the fields of
politics, entertainment, sport and business.
</P>
<P>
Five life peers are created, including Onora Sylvia O'Neill,
principal of Cambridge University's Newnham College and Sir Naren
Patel, consultant obstetrician and lately president of Royal
College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria May Adopt 1979 Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A special committee set up to
co-ordinate debate on the 1995 constitution has recommended the
adopting of the 1979 constitution with some amendents, press
reports said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the special committee's final report to the Head of
State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar Wednesday, the committee's
chairman Justice Niki Tobi said from the finding of the
committee, "it is clear that Nigerians basically opt for the 1979
constitution with relevant amendents."
</P>
<P>
The 1995 constitution was drafted by the former military
government of late General Sani Abacha but it was never
promulgated.
</P>
<P>
The most important and controversial provision of the 1995
constitution is the rotation of the presidency among the six
geopolitical zones, which is designed to break the monopoly of
the power by the north in most of the time since Nigeria's
independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
To provide a constitutional base for the on-going transition
to civil rule program and the coming civilian government,
Abubakar who took the power in June following Abacha's sudden
death, inaugurated the Constitutional Debate Coordinating
Committee on November 11 to advise the government on the 1995
constitution before its promulgation.
</P>
<P>
The coordinating committee has received 405 memoranda on the
new constitution from Nigerians within and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Based on the memoranda, Tobi said, the committee has
"recommended to the Provisional Ruling Council the adoption of
the 1979 constitution with relevant amendement from the 1995
draft constitution."
</P>
<P>
The 1979 constitution was promulgated for the civilian
government of Alhaji Shehu Shagari which ruled from 1979 to 1983
and known as the Second Republic.
</P>
<P>
It provides for the presidential system of government, with a
vice-president and a multi-party system.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Inflation Over 80 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Russia reached
84.4 percent in 1998, compared with 11 percent in 1997, the
Russian State Statistics Committee said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The high inflation was attributed to the three financial
crises and two government reshuffles this year, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price in December rose faster than that in
November -- 11.6 percent against 5.7 percent. The average daily
price rise stood at 0.355 percent in December against 0.184
percent in November, said the committee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foodstuffs in 1998 became 96.9 percent more
expensive (compared with 9.1 percent in 1997) and the prices on
non-food items went up 99.5 percent compared with 8.1 percent in
1997. Tariffs and services went up 18.3 percent against 22.5
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, inflation was 109.6 percent in 1998, which means
that prices rose by 2.1 times, while in St.Petersburg prices went
up 78.0 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The inflation was 131.3 percent in 1995, 215.1 percent in
1994, 839.9 percent in 1993, 2,508.8 percent in 1992, and 160.4
percent in 1991, said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) ranks second after Oman among developing countries in the
speed of reducing mortality among children below five years of age.

According to the UN Development Program's Human Development
Report 1998, the UAE's mortality among children aged below five
fell from 150 per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 19 in 1995, a drop
of 87 percent.
</P>
<P>
Broader access to health services, safe water and sanitation
and mobilization of public action for immunization are the
reasons for the fall in the country's mortality amogn children.
</P>
<P>
The life expectancy of the UAE nationals is 74.4 years in 1995,
according to the UNDP report. Regionally, Bahrain has a lower life
expectancy of 72.2 years.

<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The normal technological trade
and exchanges are in the common interests of both China and the
United States, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark in response to a question on a recent
report issued by the U.S. congress Wednesday, in which they
claimed that China tried to grab the high-tech know-hows from
Sino-U.S. technical cooperative projects, including satellite
launching. The report called the bilateral cooperation a move
that "hurts the national interests of United States."
</P>
<P>
Zhu considered such rhetorics "groundless and irresponsible",
adding that China is deeply dissatisfied with such comments.
</P>
<P>
"With a view of the overall growth of the bilateral ties in
mind, China hoped the United States to remove barriers hindering
the economic and technical exchanges between the two countries,
not vice verse," he said.

<HEADLINE> No Imminent Iraq-U.S. Showdown: Saudi Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and the United
States are not heading for "an imminent fresh crisis," said a
Saudi Arabian official Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The current confrontations in the no-fly zones in the northern
and southern Iraq "is just due to a misunderstanding," said Prince
Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister, the
Kuwait News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had claimed that it had shot down two U.S. warplanes, but
Washington strongly denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan, also Minister of Defense and Aviation, advised
the Iraqi leadership to "understand the interest of their people."
</P>
<P>
He said that his country supports the call for lifting the
eight-year-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq, but "this is conditional to
agreeing and implementing the U.N. resolutions to serve their
country and its interest."
</P>
<P>
The Saudi defense chief said that the United States did not ask
for using Saudi territories " to launch the recent air strikes on
Iraq", adding this is not acceptable to Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. And the United States and Britain launched air
strikes against Iraq in mid-December for alleged Iraq's
non-cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.

<HEADLINE> New System to Speed Check Clearance in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Clearing House transactions
in Kenya are set for a major revolution with further
implementation of the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR)
automated clearing in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We have already put in place the necessary systems to ensure
electronic clearing of checks from the central clearing house
based in Nairobi," Thursday's Daily Nation newspaper quoted the
MICR project manager Michael Karanja Bedan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Karanja said that the first phase of the automated clearing
project, debit clearing, has been in place since May this year.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the MICR project, credit clearing, will be
piloted from January 1999 and further implementation will depend
on the success of the process, he said.
</P>
<P>
This phase will herald an almost "paperless" transaction
regime, reducing the traction time below the four days targeted
in the initial phase for all checks.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate aim should be to attain real-time settlements,"
said the manager.
</P>
<P>
Bank customers are expected to benefit from shorter check
clearance periods, especially in respect of the so-called
"up-country checks" that take as long as seven days to cash.
</P>
<P>
The MICR project is intended to speed up the process of contra
transactions between banks involving checks while creating
much-desired uniformity, according to Daily Nation.
</P>
<P>
The project involves the printing by all banks of an
electronic code line on all checks, so that they are recognizable
to special readers installed in banks reducing the time wasted in
physical checks.
</P>
<P>
The paper said central to the project is the centralization of
check clearance from the regional centers to Nairobi, the capital
of the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The MICR code line includes such details as check member,
bank, branch and the check digit, it added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM Warns of Water Shortage in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye has urged residents in capital Dar es
Salaam to use water sparingly as another water shortage is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was shocked to find that the water level at
Ruvu River, the main source of water of the city, is "alarmingly
low" when he inspected the Ruvu water works Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Minister of Water Mussa Nkhangaa, Sumaye
inspected the Ruvu water works at Mlandizi in the eastern Coast
Region, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye ordered the Ministry of Water to make sure that
wells dug in the capital city last year are operational as a
preventive measure.
</P>
<P>
He also directed water technicians and engineers to find
alternative water sources, saying that "this is not a time for
water engineers to sit in their offices."
</P>
<P>
Below average rains associated to the La Nina weather
phenomenon has led to a drought in most parts of the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has called on residents to use water
carefully when they wash cars and water flowers and trees.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a long spell of dry weather resulted in a low water
level of Ruvu River and shortage of supplies to Dar es Salaam.

<HEADLINE> Post-Flood Resettlement Gets International Aids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Ye Zhangrong and his family bid
farewell to 1998 as well as to their life of huddling in a tent
for months by moving into his new residence recently.
</P>
<P>
A victim of severe summer floods which destroyed millions of
houses, the 55-year-old farmer saw some 110 two-storey buildings
nearby are also in the final stage of construction.
</P>
<P>
Ye and 590 of his fellow villagers in Xinzhou County, central
China's Hubei Province, benefited from a three-million-yuan
donation from Lions Clubs International, the world's largest
service club organization.
</P>
<P>
The funds were used to build roads, water and power supply
networks and telecommunication facilities in the new village,
named "Lions Village". Every household was subsidized by local
government to cover one fourth of the costs for housing
construction, according to the village head Ye Fangxin.
</P>
<P>
"I feel much safer now," said Ye, whose former home inside the
levees of the Yangtze River had been inundated twice in flood
seasons of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
In areas along the Yangtze, China's longest river, a prolonged
problem is that some residents have settled inside the levees so
as to get more land to tilt and this was cited as one of the
causes for successive floodings.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has time and again pursuaded these
residents to move to safer locations, in an effort to make way for
possible flood water flows.
</P>
<P>
The design of Lions Village complies with the government's
decision, and should be a good example for rebuilding of housing
in other flood-hit areas, said He Xinghua, an official with the
Ministry of Construction in charge of urban and rural planning.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the design and planning work has been finished
for construction of 2,500 villages in Hubei and six other
provinces, the major flooded regions last summer.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of flood victims across China are expected to
move into their new residences before the Spring Festival, a
traditional year-end festival for family reunion, which falls on
February 16, next year.
</P>
<P>
"Helping the rest of the flood victims to spend their winter at
their own home will also be the most important job for the
government," He Xinghua said.

<HEADLINE> Famine Threatens as Drought Persists in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people living in
northern Kenya are facing severe food shortage as failure of the
short rains has caused a severe drought there, local leaders
warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Thursday quoted more than 40 county
and town councillors in Wajir District as saying that the drought
is taking its toll on livestock in the area inhabited mainly by
pastoralist communities.
</P>
<P>
The civic leaders said that if the situation facing our people
does not change soon, they and their livestock will die of hunger
and thirst.
</P>
<P>
The areas of Arbajanhan, Hadado, Giriftu, Dambas, Wajir-Bor
and Eldaas are said to be the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Minister of the Cooperative Development Ministry,
Mohamed Abdi Affey also expressed concern at the parliament
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the drought which, he said, could be precursor to the
La Nina weather phenomenon, milk yields have substantially
declined, creating an urgent need for food aid in the area.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, most bore-holes and other ground water reservoirs
have dried up, causing a critical water shortage there, Affey
noted.
</P>
<P>
He called for urgent action to rehabilitate the water supply
to avert conflict among the pastoralist communities scrambling
for the little water available.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Says 1999 Will Be Another Difficult Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong expected that 1999 will be another difficult year for
Singapore and he called upon the nation to stay united to overcome
challenges.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message released at noon on Thursday, Goh said
1998 has been a difficult year for Singapore and 1999 will be
another difficult year.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said his country's economic growth for the
fourth quarter of 1998 was again negative, contracting 1.9 percent
on adjusted quarter-on-quarter bases and bringing the economic
growth for 1998 as a whole down to 1.3 percent from the 7.8
percent of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry's forecast
that Singapore economy should grow by between minus one percent
and plus one percent in 1999, Goh said "the prospects are very
uncertain."
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister underlined that his country's security and
economic recovery will be affected by regional economic climate
and political events abroad, adding "these political problems may
have unhappy consequences-- social disorder, regional instability,
and uncontrolled flows of illegal immigrants."
</P>
<P>
Goh said Singapore can not avoid some further retrenchments
despite the economic package announced in November to reduce
business costs and strengthen competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He also drew attention to his expectation that the U.S. economy
may slow down next year and make it harder for Singapore to boost
its exports.
</P>
<P>
Noting Singaporeans have become used to high growth since the
1985 recession, the Prime Minister warned the whole nation "not to
take things for granted" and urged them "to be alert to what goes
on in the region and the major countries" and to respond nimbly to
changing conditions.

<HEADLINE> World's Auto Makers Deeper Rooted in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- With the first batch of
Buick cars coming off the production line of General Motors in
Shanghai recently, China at last has the capability to
manufacture the world's latest luxurious cars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in this showcase of China's economic growth, but on
the other side of the Huangpu River that runs through the city,
the construction of a car testing track and research and
development center for Volkswagen's Shanghai operation is
approaching completion.
</P>
<P>
The differences yet similarities between the two projects are
obvious.
</P>
<P>
The Buick project is GM's first in Shanghai but it plans to
raise the annual production capacity to 100,000 luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Company Ltd., Santana model
is now 14 years old. A mid-range model, it was marketed in the
mid 1980s in major industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The current production capacity of the Santana in Shanghai is
up to 300,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
The two joint projects share the same partner: Shanghai Automot
ive Industry (Group) Corp. (SAIC)
</P>
<P>
Many auto industry observers are speculating about the impact
they will have on each other, said SAIC President Chen Xianglin,
but both of them see their respective new endeavors as a
cornerstone for their commitment to China's auto industry. This
is evidence that China's automobile industry, with Shanghai as
its center, has become "an important arena for competition among
the world's auto giants."
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai VW has a long-term plan for its presence in China,"
Chen said,which is why it made a 1.6 billion yuan investment in
the technical center and the car testing track, which will become
China's first modern testing facility.
</P>
<P>
The founding of Shanghai VW in 1984 is considered the starting
point for China's modern auto industry. It is the most profitable
VW joint venture in the world and has so far produced 1.15
million cars, capturing half of China's domestic market share.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai VW is currently developing the third generation
Santana, whose two predecessors have made remarkable sales
achievements in China.
</P>
<P>
The first of the new models is expected to roll off the
production lines in a year, and mass production will begin in
2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Peter Loew, vice general manager of Shanghai VW,
the company's research and development center in Shanghai will
employ 600-800 engineers over the next few years. He expects the
center to be compared to VW's other two centers in Germany and
Brazil by then.

"GM has been eyeing the Chinese car market for many years,"
Chen said, "and now the world's No. 1 auto producer, though a
latecomer compared to VW, started its car making operations in
China with up to date models and technology.
</P>
<P>
Supported by 270 local auto part manufacturers, 40 percent of
the parts of the Shanghai joint venture Buick are made in China;
and the ratio is expected to rise to 80 percent in three years.
</P>
<P>
Within the joint venture agreement, apart from producing three
separate Buick models, Shanghai GM will have introduced all the
technologies needed for production, as well as related GM
technological innovations, within the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Shanghai has more than 30 joint ventures involved
in making cars and car parts with a combined foreign investment
of 2.07 billion U.S. dollars, from as the United States, Germany,
Britain, Japan and France.
</P>
<P>
But the Shanghai business is only part of the picture.
Different new models are being developed or sold, and new
production lines are being built, in other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts call 1998 the "model changing year" for
China's auto industry.
</P>
<P>
VW's joint venture in northeast China's Changchun city, the
First Automotive Works-Volkswagen, launched this year its new Jet
ta and Audi models.
</P>
<P>
And Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co., Ltd. in Wuhan, has begun
to market its third generation "Fukang" model in China.
</P>
<P>
The newly established Guangzhou Honda Automobile Co., Ltd., a
joint investment between Guangzhou Automobile Group and the Honda
Co., has already begun a trial production of the latest Accord
series sedan and start full time production next October.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that despite the leveling of growth in China's
car market due to the ongoing Asian Financial Crisis,it will
still have the most growth potential in the next decade. This,
together with China's expected eventual admission to the World
Trade Organization, are the incentives for the world's major auto
manufacturers to become even more active in China.

<HEADLINE> Central Departments Cut Business Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Following a decision of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
State Council, all of China's central departments have completed
the process of winding up their business connections, according to
the official body set up to monitor the process.
</P>
<P>
Departments of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council
will no longer be involved in the management of enterprises that
they formerly ran.
</P>
<P>
From tomorrow they are expected to end their business
associations under the supervision of the specially appointed
coordinating body.
</P>
<P>
A number of the enterprises will be transferred to national or
local management groups while loss-making firms will be suspended
or closed down.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime most of the businesses must maintain normal
operations and ensure the stability of their workforces.
</P>
<P>
The decision has been made to eliminate protectionism practiced
by certain departments, break monopolies in a number of
industries, enable central departments to perform their duties
fairly, promote the restructuring and development of
state-owned enterprises and turn enterprises into the principal
part of market competition.
</P>
<P>
The move was launched after the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party decided to prohibit the armed forces,
armed police and judicial departments from being involved in
business activities.
</P>
<P>
It is designed to strengthen Party building and building of
political power, combat corruption and separate the functions of
the government from those of enterprises.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Shipping Corporation on Brink of Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned Bangladesh
Shipping Corporation (BSC) has reached the point of brink of
collapse owing to huge financial liabilities and operational
setbacks.
</P>
<P>
The tottering condition of the firm is attributed to lack of
efficient management, failure to procure uptodate vessels and
purchasing vessels on unequal terms in many cases, taking loans on
high interest and finally misuse and mishandling of assets, The
New Nation daily Thursday quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The accumulated loss of the BSC has stood at nearly 2.16
billion taka (44.5 million U.S. dollars) while it owes 1.8 billion
taka (37.1 million dollars) to banks.
</P>
<P>
The BSC could not add a single vessel to its fleet during the
past 10 years, they said, adding the BSC rather sold out 13 ships
from its 38-ship fleet built up earlier.
</P>
<P>
The only mother tanker of the BSC fleet was sold in 1982 and no
replacement of the tanker has so far been made to make it worthy
to meet the present day needs.
</P>
<P>
The plight of BSC had started in early 1980s when a number of
private shipping companies started their journey by taking away a
number of skilled personnel from the BSC team.
</P>
<P>
From then on, the BSC started lagging behind in installation of
modern equipment in its ships, and it is now staying far behind
the international level in terms of technical facilities.
</P>
<P>
The BSC started its operation in 1972 as a local agent of
foreign cargo companies with a paid up capital of 450 million taka
(9.28 million dollars). Later it managed to procure vessels
largely with financial assistance from banks and other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The corporation made profit during the first 13 years of its
operation but now it has become a white elephant owing to huge
losses during the last 13 years.

<HEADLINE> Young Beijingers Focus on Science and Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey revealed that
young Beijingers are more interested in scientific and
technological development than in the basic science.
</P>
<P>
The younger generation is not only interested in the
development of communication technology and innovative daily
necessities, but also in biology, medical and military science and
space technology, according to the survey conducted by Beijing
Shaohai Market Research Company.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey indicated that younger people living in the
nation's political and cultural center are somewhat indifferent to
physics and agricultural science.
</P>
<P>
The survey of young people between 14-35 years of age was
designed to study scientific awareness. Some 29 percent of the
respondents were college graduates, 43 percent were in high school
and 28 percent were below the junior high level.
</P>
<P>
Youngsters with higher education levels exhibited greater
interest in science, with males exhibiting a greater
interest than females.
</P>
<P>
Young Beijingers are not only familiar with "cloning" and the
"information highway", and also exhibit greater competence in
terms of operating principles for mobile phones, cameras,
refrigerators and washing machines than in scientific and
technical terms.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players to Make Final Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- NBA players will make
their own "final" offer to the owners, hoping it will save the
season.
</P>
<P>
"I have called David Stern and requested an opportunity to
present it to the owners' labor committee as soon as they're
available, and certainly before the January 7 date that Stern has
set as the owners' deadline," union director Billy Hunter told
players Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Union president Patrick Ewing said the new proposal should be
ready before Friday. Ewing also revealed that the owners' "final"
offer would not be put to a vote by all players unless a majority
asked for it.
</P>
<P>
"If the majority of the players call up and say they want a
vote, then we're bound to vote," Ewing said. "But yesterday we
had a conference call and we put the question to them if they
want a vote. And as of today, no one has called to demand that we
put it to a vote."
</P>
<P>
Jim McIlaine, a member of the negotiating committee for the
union, said:"The committee's job is to do the will of the
majority of the players. If we get indications that they would
like some proposal voted on, we'd have to follow through on it.
But reading about it in the paper or hearing it from an agent
doesn't cut it for me. I need to hear it from the players."
</P>
<P>
Stern said in a letter to all players earlier, "While it is
your prerogative to reject our proposal, the consequences of that
decision will be so catastrophic to your members that simple
fairness suggests they be given a chance to be heard.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, we requested and strongly urge that you put the
NBA's final offer to a vote of the entire union membership."
</P>
<P>
Hunter said:"It should not be hard to get a deal that makes
both sides equally contented or discontented. As I have said in
recent weeks, we are not very far apart, and the owners' latest
offer bridges some of the gaps.
</P>
<P>
"It is now a matter of sitting down for a last bargaining
session where we each can reveal our respective bottom lines and
engage in whatever trading may be necessary to get a deal done."

<HEADLINE> India Weathers Global Crisis, But Reforms Slacken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Looking back on the year
1998, one could see that though India has weathered the global
economic crisis, it's economic reforms have slackened, 'The
Statesman' said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the calibrated pace of reforms adopted by India
since 1991, the country escaped a great deal of the convulsions
that shook East Asia and countries further afield. As its economy
was not fully integrated with the world, especially with the rupee
convertibility confined to the current account transactions, the
country escaped relatively unscathed," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"But that does not give much cause for optimism. The great
Indian economic reform had almost ground to a halt in the
pre-election year of 1995 when the initiator of the reform, then
the former Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, applied the
brakes...... There has not been change after the coalition
stitched together by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took office
nine months ago," it said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha in his 1998-99 Budget unveiled
on June 1 this year "made tall promises, but nobody believes that
the targets then outlined will be realized during this financial
year ending March 1999".
</P>
<P>
"For instance, Mr. Sinha had set a target of reducing fiscal
deficit to 5.6 percent of GDP by March 1999 and he had held on to
that goal with nothing more concrete than blind faith. Mr. Sinha
has now been forced to admit that the fiscal deficit will exceed
his magic figure and all he is prepared to venture is that it
would be less than seven percent," it further said.
</P>
<P>
"Industrial production in 1998-99 (April 1, 1998-March 31,
1999) has fallen much below the expectations of eight to 10
percent forecast by the government. The increase for the first
seven months of fiscal 1998-99 is estimated at 3.6 percent
compared to last year's 6.2 percent for the same period," it
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- People in the Tibet Autonomous
Region enjoy potted plants throughout frigid winter weather.
</P>
<P>
"Generations of our ancestors were serfs. We personally won the
right to own a home following the abolishment of serfdom, but
lacked the financial resources to do so at the time. Things are
quite different now however and our annual income ranges between
40,000 to 50,000 yuan (4,800-6,000 US dollars), said Lhasa
resident Zhoima Yangjim.
</P>
<P>
Zhoima's hope for a new home finally became true last
year. Some 30-odd potted plants, including Chinese flowering
crabapple, bamboo and plum, decorate three balconies and the
living room. A potted oleander sits in the center of the living
room, with Chinese wisteria plants sitting beside the sofa and on
the wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
"The beautiful plants help to purify the air and provide a good
atmosphere the year round," according to Zhoima.
</P>
<P>
Flowers were once the sole domain of aristocratic
families. However, the abolishment of the serfdom provided
ordinary Tibetans with the opportunity to build homes and flowers
have gained increasing popularity since the 1980s. Local residents
have indeed enjoyed a better life over the past 20 years of
reform and opening.
</P>
<P>
Temples in Tibet are also filled with the fragrance of
flowers. Resident monks water and prune the plants each day after
morning prayers.
</P>
<P>
"Colorful flowers have brought great happiness to us."

<P>
COLOMBO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's tea exports have
recorded a growth rate of 25 percent in rupee terms in the first
ten months of this year over the same period last year, a Tea
Board official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official said tea exports up to October amounting to Rs. 43
billion (63 million U.S. dollars) exceeded last year's total
exports of Rs. 42.5 billion. During the first ten months of last
year exports were only Rs 34.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
Tea production increased to 233 million kilograms during the
first ten months of this year against 224 million kilograms during
the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis faced by Sri Lanka's major buyer Russia has
affected local tea exports, said the official, adding that the Tea
Board is optimistic that when Russia's economy returns to normalcy
it will again emerge as Sri Lanka's largest buyer.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East market has also shown a reduction in tea buying
but is expected to improve after the Ramadan fast, he added.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Strengthens Animal Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- An additional 14 species of
wild animals in northeast China's Liaoning Province have been
placed under the national protection in recent years as a result
of the provincial government's extensive wildlife protection
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China was once home to over 1,000 species of wild
animals and was well-known for abundant ginseng, martens and
pilose antlers. However, excessive hunting for both food and
materials for traditional Chinese medicine led to a decrease in
the number of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has introduced a series of concrete
plant and animal protection measures since the 1980s. For example,
Liaoning has established a bird protection week and wild animal
protection month. The province has also conducted
extensive spring and autumn publicity campaigns on preventing
forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has also formulated a series of regulations and
established a comprehensive legal system covering wild animal
protection. Twelve hunting regulations have broadened the scope of
wildlife protection, and a total of 91 wild species have been
placed under provincial protection.
</P>
<P>
Seven national and 14 provincial nature reserves covering
145,000 ha have been established in Liaoning since the 1978
implementation of policies which prohibited hunting, and the
establishment of forest and wild animal nature reserves. The long
list of reserves includes Dalian Snake Island, as well as a
waterfowl reserve in Panjin and the Dongya Chinese Pine Forest
Reserve in Jinzhou.
</P>
<P>
Manchurian tigers, sable, black bears and hazel grouse have
reappeared since the establishment of nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
Local residents are conscientiously protecting wild
animals, with statistics showing that more than 280
animals have been rescued and returned to various reserves in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has also expanded cooperation and technological
exchanges with the World Wildlife Fund and the International Crane
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The Liaoning Department of Forestry noted plans to establish 20
more nature reserves by the year 2000, and will extend great
effort to ensure that wild animals enjoy a safe habitat.

<HEADLINE> Hungary to Have Anti-Y2K Plan Ready in January 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian government
will have a plan ready by mid next January to tackle the computer
millennium problem, earmarking 325 million forints (1.5 million
U.S. dollars) under the 1999 budget as the central control fund
for the plan, the Vilaggazdasag newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Computer systems in the sectors of energy, finance,
communication, national defense and health have been selected as
priorities for checking and debugging, the report quoted a
government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official, deputy state secretary in charge of information
management in the prime minister's office Roska Marietta, said
the national railway, post and telecommunications, as well as
some foreign funded banks had already started to fix the
millennium glitch more than a year ago, planning to complete the
work by mid next year.
</P>
<P>
The report said threats from the Y2K problem are relatively
slight in Hungary, where computers are not as widespread as in
West European countries.
</P>
<P>
However, other experts are less optimistic. Officials with
the Interior Ministry said billions of forints would be needed to
debug the computers of their ministry alone.
</P>
<P>
Some experts warned that the government's allotted fund is far
from enough, estimating that another eight billion forints (37.2
million dollars) would have to be drawn out from the 1999 budget
to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem results from a flaw in early computer
programming, which uses two digits to record years, like 98, 99.
Such computers can recognize only the last two digits of a year
and will fail on January 1, 2000, when they will assume it is
1900 and may start spewing out flawed data at the turn of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Governments of some countries began to prepare for the pote
ntial outbreak of the millennium problem as far back as 10 years
ago while global spending on fixing the problem is expected to
reach between 300 billion and 600 billion dollars.

signed an agreement with Sri Lanka for a project with investment
up to Rs. 800 million (11.76 million U.S. dollars) at the Mirigama
Export Processing Zone, about 70 kilometers northeast of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed Thursday with the Board of

Thailand and particularly in the South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The project, scheduled to be implemented in three stages, will
set up a high tech plant in a 15 acre land at the export zone.
</P>
<P>
Under the first stage 15,000 tons of aluminium rods will be
produced annually for the Electricity Board and private cable
manufacturers who import these for two million dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
In the second stage it will produce aluminium cables to meet
the domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
During the third stage investment will be increased from Rs.
425 million to Rs. 800 million, copper cables will be produced for
the telecommunications sector.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana on Wednesday reaffirmed that he would participate
in the opening ceremony of the peace talks with the leftist
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) starting on January
7.
</P>
<P>
But FARC founder and leader Manuel Marulanda Velez, 68, did
not confirm whether he would attend a scheduled meeting with
Pastrana in fear of his safety despite a government pledge that
the veteran rebel leader would be protected by 60 members of Pa
strana's presidential guards.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks will be held in the southern Caquete
department, an area which extends over more than 42,000
kilometers and has been demilitarized for three months.
</P>
<P>
Government representatives and multilateral organization
delegates, as well as personalities such as Guatemalan activist
and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Menchu, have been
invited to attend the opening ceremony.
</P>

Journalist Jose Vicente Rangel, a representative of Venezuelan
president-elect Hugo Chavez, will also attend the opening
ceremony.

<P>
In addition, the National Liberation Army (ELN), the second
largest guerrilla group after the FARC, will also attend the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The FARC's security measures will include a ban on selling and
consuming alcohol and restrictions on the number of cars and
planes.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Female Athlete Cashes in on Her Gold Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian female athlete
Supriati Sutono received 100 million rupiah (12,500 U.S. dollars)
in cash bonuses from the Indonesian Amateur Athletic Federation
(PASI) for her success in winning gold medal at the 13th Asian
Games.
</P>
<P>
Supriati confounded pundits' prediction when she won the
5,000 meters run in a time of 15:54.45 on the penultimate day of
the Games.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with the bonus," said Supriati after the
hand-out ceremony held in the presence of Chairman of the
Indonesian Sports Council (KONI) Wismoyo Arismunandar here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Supriati has now set her eyes on the Olympics
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"I will run until someone deserves to take my place in the
national team. And I will be happy to end my athletics career
when I have competed in the Olympics," she was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Supriati's gold ended a 36-year wait, ever since 1962 , when
Sarengat, now a KONI officer, stole the show with his 100 meters
victory in Jakarta. Supriati has also contributed to the
contingent's success in reaching the target of six golds set
prior to the event.
</P>
<P>
Supriati's coach Nicky Pattiasina shared the windfall with
his 50 million rupiah bonus. Three other athletics coaches, along
with medical team and athletics federation workers received a
smaller bonus.
</P>
<P>
Another 100 million rupiah of the cash went to the Secapa
track and field in Bandung, where Supriati undertook her daily
training. "We want to stress that Supriati's success also owes
much to team work from various parties," said Kunarto, a PASI
official.

<HEADLINE> Mia Audina Must Get Her Act Together, Says Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's best current
hope in badminton Mia Audina must be able to put aside all her
problems if she wants to qualify for the Olympics in Sydney, said
coach Liang Chiusia.
</P>
<P>
Liang Chiusia said a champion should not involve her personal
problems in training and competition.
</P>
<P>
"We all have problems but a champion must put aside her
personal problems during a competition. She must also concentrate
fully during training and not think about them", Liang was quoted
by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mia's performance has been dropping off lately. Her crucial
lapse was made in the women's team event in the just-concluded
13th Asian Games in Bangkok where she lost to South Korean Kim
Ji-hyun in the women's team semifinals.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Mia has been concerned lately about her
mother's health. Her mother is suffering kidney failure and must
undergo dialysis treatment twice a week.
</P>
<P>
Her poor relationship with her father Rivan Tjiptawan also
influenced her form. Rivan used to be Mia's idol during her youth.
</P>
<P>
Mia's close relationship with boyfriend Tylio Lobman, a Dutch
gospel singer, has been blamed for her declining form. But she
has refuted this and said that Tylio has been boosting her
fighting spirit.
</P>
<P>
"She must overcome her personal problems, otherwise they will
give her trouble and disturb her concentration," Liang said.
</P>
<P>
Liang said she was really shocked by Mia's failure in the
Asiad.
</P>
<P>
"She never told me that she was nervous and scared. If only
she had told me before playing, I could have helped her by giving
advice," she said.
</P>
<P>
Liang compared Mia to former world number one Susi Susanti,
now retired due to her pregnancy, who often confided with her
about her feelings before competing.
</P>
<P>
"Mia is only 19 years old but her problems are very complex.
Unfortunately, she rarely tells me about them and so I can't help
her," she added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Crime Rate in 1998 Increases by 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's crime rate in 1998
has increased by 10 percent compared to 1997, National Police
Chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a traditional year-end press conference here, he
said police across the country had so far recorded a total of
157,180 crimes in 1998, which is a 10 percent increase over the
142,711 cases in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Although the figures excluded looting, arson and other offenses
that occurred during the outbreaks of unrest nationwide, the 10
percent growth is described as the largest for years.
</P>
<P>
East Java, Jakarta, West Java, North Sumatera and Central Java
have been marked as the country's top five crime-prone provinces
this year.
</P>
<P>
"Crimes have been both more frequent and speedier than before",
Roesmanhadi said.
</P>
<P>
This year crimes nationwide occurred at a rate of one every
three minutes and 20 seconds, or 20 minutes faster than last
year's rating, he added.
</P>
<P>
The crime rate per 100,000 head of population increased from 72
to 78 this year.
</P>
<P>
Out of the entire volume of cases the police had only been able
to solve some 57 percent compared to last year's 60 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Roesmanhadi blamed the financial crisis, the spirit of reform,
the country's instability and the limited size of the
180,000-strong police force as the main factors that had sparked
the increasing number of crimes.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that these unfavorable conditions would still
appear in 1999, when the nation is to hold another general
election and an election to choose the country's fourth president.
</P>
<P>
The events have strong potential to trigger fresh unrest and
other types of crime, he added.
</P>
<P>
The severe monetary crisis hanging over the nation in 1999
might further worsen the overall situation, Roesmanhadi said.
</P>
<P>
He therefore encouraged people of all walks of life to give
helping hands to the police to head off possible fresh mass crime,
which could end up in anarchy.
</P>
<P>
In the annual police report, the kind of crimes which sharply
increased this year included armed robbery, vehicle theft and
theft with violence. These three types of crimes alone have shown
a 30 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
In narcotics-related matters, at the final count, Roesmanhadi
said that the police had handled 630 cases, close to last year's
figure of 622.
</P>
<P>
"In this year's cases, we've arrested 888 suspects, including
38 foreigners," he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Give Minimum 11 Years' Education for All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 31 (Xinhua) -- All students in Malaysia
will be given a minimum 11 years' public education instead of the
current nine years.
</P>
<P>
This is another history created in the education system in
Malaysia when a 100 percent of students can continue with their
education into the higher secondary schools, Education Minister
Najib Tun Razak told a press conference here Wednesday, according
to national press reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Najib announced that those who failed in all subjects in the
lower secondary examination (after nine years) will be offered
places in vocational secondary schools to continue their studies
with the start of next year's school session for a minimum of 11
years.
</P>
<P>
Najib said his ministry made the decision as it did not want
any student to drop out of the country's education system and if
a student drops out, it will not be for the good of the country
nor for the student himself.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the ministry would not stop any of the
academically weak students from rejecting the offer for a place in
the vocational secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that in the vocational schools, the students
can pick up technical certificates in various fields such as in
electrical services, radio and television servicing, welding and
motor maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Najib said the Education Ministry would redeploy teachers
trained in critical subjects -- English language, science and
mathematics -- to overcome the shortage of such teachers in
schools especially in the rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Experts Recommend Trash Composting Over Incineration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts recommend
composting as an effective method for sorting organic elements and
treating the increasing volume of waste in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trash in China's urban areas has increased by
between 8-10 percent annually in recent years, with some 200
cities deluged with mounting volumes of trash and garbage dumps
occupying over 500 million sq.m. nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Li Debao, a professor at the Zhejiang University Biological
Technology Institute, stresses that the current urban practice of
incinerating garbage for power generation or simply for disposal
should not be followed blindly.
</P>
<P>
He said the use of existing incineration technology requires
substantial investments, but offers low returns. For example,
incinerators with a daily handling capacity of a mere 500 tons
cost 150 million yuan, a substantial outlay when considering
future operating costs represent a totally different matter.
</P>
<P>
The lack of funding has forced a number of Chinese cities to
quit using incinerators, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Burning trash produces toxic gases and creates secondary
pollution, according to Lin Fucheng, an associate professor at
Zhejiang University. He emphasized that composting provides a
viable alternative for incineration.
</P>
<P>
"Composting is a comparatively advanced method used
internationally to treat garbage," according to Lin. He noted
composting turns organic elements in garbage into bio-fertilizers
which are free of toxic residues and readily decomposable.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- "I like to go to
bookstores with their own features when I want to buy books,
stores with their own styles that also offer good service,"
said Zhang Zhongshu, a bookstore browser.
</P>
<P>
More and more bookstores with their own characteristics have
been opening in Beijing over the past few years. One store
specializes in books by and for women, and Zhao Wenge, the owner,
says she now has four branches, all with the same theme.
</P>
<P>
Another store sells books mainly on the customs, traditions and
development of Beijing, and it invites local artists and writers
every week to give lectures on Beijing culture, attracting a wide
audience.
</P>
<P>
Some bookstore owners now offer customers not only good books
on many topics, but atmosphere as well, with fancy decorations and
cozy cafe. There are about 100 bookstores of this kind in Beijing now.
</P>
<P>
Guo Zhuqing, an official with the Beijing Municipal Bureau of
Culture, said that today large numbers of people like to read and
buy books, inspiring owners to compete with each other by offering
bookstores with special environments.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Wenge said there had to be some changes in the operation
of bookstores because of the ever-increasing competition among
them, and she has installed a reader's bar beside her downtown
bookstore branch to attract more customers.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Domestic and Foreign
investment projects that had been approved by the Indonesian
government in 1998 were declined, State Minister of Investment and
Chairman of the Investment Coordinating Agency Hamzah Haz said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The approved domestic investment projects in 1998 were
estimated at 59.4 trillion rupiah (7.4 billion U.S. dollars), a
decline compared to the 119.9 trillion rupiah in 1997, while the
number of projects also dropped by 57.1 percent to 308 compared to
718 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The domestic economic, political and security situation in the
country has a serious bearing on the prospective investors'
decision whether or not to make an investment in Indonesia," the
minister was quoted by Antara News Agency Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the approvals that had been issued to foreign
investment projects this year were estimated at 13.3 billion U.S.
dollars, a decline of 60.7 percent compared to the 33.8 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997, but the number of projects increased by 23.9
percent to 979 projects compared to the 790 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the approved foreign investment projects in
1998 is an indication that most of the foreign investors were very
well versed with the market, so that even in the current
protracted economic crisis they were able to plot feasible
investment opportunities, while their local counterparts still
have difficulties in making use of the existing opportunities,
Hamzah said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the domestic investment projects covered
transportation, office buildings and telecommunications, while
most of the foreign investment projects covered services.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the foreign investment projects belonged to
investors from the United Kingdom estimated at 4.8 billion U.S.
dollars with 49 projects, Singapore 1.3 billion U.S. dollars with
118 projects, and Japan worth 1.2 billion U.S. dollars with 73
projects, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The country with the biggest investment in Indonesia is Japan
with 1,066 projects worth 42.6 billion U.S. dollars, followed by
the United Kingdom with 282 projects estimated at 37.7 billion
U.S. dollars and Singapore with 820 projects estimated at 20.2
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of investment prospects in 1999, Hamzah said that
improved political stability as the result of the June 1999
general election as well as the general session of the People's
Consultative Assembly to form a new government in accordance with
the aspirations of the people, will encourage more investors to
build their projects in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Grows Colored Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, the nation's leading cotton production
base, has successfully developed new strains of cotton featuring
13 colors.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Junlu Group recently announced that it achieved a
1998 output of 171 tons of colored cotton on 2,000 mu (133.33 ha),
with per-mu production approaching the normal level of 85
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The new strains are free of chemical pigment which results from
dyeing. The worldwide production for colored cotton stands at
20,000 tons a year, or one percent of total output. However, the
proportion is expected to reach 30 percent within 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Projections for Xinjiang's 1998 ginned cotton output to hit
1.24 million tons, with the region accounting for some 30 percent
of total output nationally and six percent worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Junlu introduced three colored cotton strains from the
U.S. to experimental plots in Gansu and Sichuan provinces in 1994,
with the per mu output hovering at 30 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Chinese research institutes developed 11 color strain that Junlu
currently grows on the basis of imported varieties.
</P>
<P>
Over 100,000 of Junlu's colored cotton garments are available
in stores in many major cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and
Dalian.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang plans to grow colored cotton on 20,000 mu during 1999,
with output expected to reach 1,710 tons.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Gets Cleaner Water from Mainland Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Hong Kong will
soon have access to purer water from a water supply project in
neighboring Shenzhen, where a major treatment plant was put into
trial operation on December 21.
</P>
<P>
The system now in use, the Dongshen water supply project, was
built in 1964, and is used to provide fresh water to some 10
million people living in Hong Kong and the cities of Shenzhen and
Dongguan in Guangdong Province by drawing water from the Dongjiang
River, and sending it to the Yantian and Shenzhen reservoirs via
the natural course of the Shima River.
</P>
<P>
Due to economic development in the Pearl River Delta over the
past two decades and the drastic increase of industrial activity
and population, various polluting sources around the water supply
project are on rise, and the water in the Shima River has become
seriously polluted.
</P>
<P>
According to Ru Jianhui, engineer-in-chief of the Guangdong
Provincial Water Conservation Bureau, the new plant, built at the
entrance of Shenzhen reservoir at a cost of 350 million yuan, can
reduce the amounts of major pollutants such as ammonia and nitrogen
by 50 to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province has also adopted other measures to improve
the quality of water from the Dongshen water supply project,
including spending 350 million yuan to construct a pumping
station on the Dongjiang River.
</P>
<P>
This station, which was put into service in September, will
reduce the volume of pollutants around the previous water-drawing
spot by 60 to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has also approved another plan to
install a special pipeline for sending water directly from the
Dongjiang River to the Shenzhen reservoir. This plan, together
with a feasibility study report, has been submitted to the State
Development Planning Commission for approval.

<HEADLINE> Wenzhou: Window on China's Private Sector (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Over the past 20 years there
has been no other place in China quite like the city of Wenzhou
in eastern Zhejiang Province, a town often in dispute about
whether its local economy reflects capitalism or socialism.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Wenzhou has become a heaven of China's private economy.
</P>
<P>
More than one-tenth of Wenzhou's families were engaged in
private businesses ten years ago, and many of the so-called
collectively owned enterprises were actually private businesses.
</P>
<P>
Now, Wenzhou has some 40,000 private businesses, with an
output value accounting of more than 90 percent of the city's total
industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
A senior local official said that the private economy has
become a major force in the service sector, and also a leading
investor in science and technology, education, culture, public
health and sports.
</P>
<P>
He said the farmers in Wenzhou have a tradition of doing
business to make up for insufficient farmland, as per
capita farmland is less than 0.033 hectare, far below the national
average.
</P>
<P>
" In the past forty years, the state has invested little here
because Wenzhou, close to Taiwan Province, is regarded as a
frontline," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing to rely on but our own hands," said Xu
Shouguo, a millionaire farmer in the town of Yishan in Cangnan
county.
</P>
<P>
Driven by dire poverty, Xu set up a small printing house in
1975, but shortly thereafter he was severely punished for
reverting to capitalism.

<TEXT>
<P>
With China's reform and opening up, Xu resumed the operation of
his printing house in 1980, and it has now become a joint-stock
business specializing in producing garment brands.
</P>
<P>
Xu's move was silently approved by the local government, but
his enterprise was called "collectively owned."
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Wenzhou faced more pressures as news reports said that
the private economy was the base of bourgeois
liberalization. Fearing that policy might change, many Wenzhou
entrepreneurs either shut down their businesses, went abroad, or
renamed their enterprises as collectively owned ones.
</P>
<P>
The Wenzhou Boyi Valve factory, which had worn the
collectively-owned label for 12 years, stopped wearing it last
year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chenming, the factory owner, said that not until 1992,
when paramount Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping asked the nation to
stop arguing about what is socialism and what is capitalism, did
private business owners in Wenzhou put more funds into their
operations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said he will try to further raise the reputation of his
enterprise and compete in the international market.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that more and more household businesses
are evolving into joint-stock enterprises, and tend to rely more
on high technology in their development.
</P>
<P>
Private companies in Wenzhou are mostly engaged in such
industries as clothing, shoes, lamps, lighters, low-voltage
electrical appliances and valves.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Sets Modernization Timetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 31 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province plans to achieve at least a moderate level of development
by the year 2020, according to plans unveiled during the recent
Tenth Zhejiang Provincial Communist Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the province to meet 12 indexes for
modernization. The list includes a per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 US dollars; a 5-15
percent agricultural contribution to GDP; a non-farm population
accounting for 60-70 percent of the total work force; a 45-50
percent service sector contribution to the provincial GDP; and an
urbanization ratio of between 50-60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang, one of the most developed areas in China, has gained
recognition for successfully developing township-run enterprises,
as well as achievements in economic development.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's 1998 GDP skyrocketed to 505 billion yuan, up from
only 23.29 billion yuan in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Deputies attending the provincial congress pledged to redouble
effort to accelerate expansion of Ningbo Port, including an
economic and technological development zone, Daxie Island and a
bonded zone, as well as improving the modernization level of
industries and urban areas, closing gaps between rural and urban
areas, improving living standards and exploring the marine
economy.

<HEADLINE> Zeal in Vegetable Growing up in East China's Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- "I'm not worried about selling
the vegetables, we just fear that they may not grow well." said Qi
Baofang, a 28-year-old woman in the city of Shouguang in eastern
China's Shandong Province, who has rented an 800-square-meter
vegetable greenhouse to produce towel gourds.
</P>
<P>
Many local farmers have done the same thing. He Fengying
rented a 600-square-meter greenhouse to grow bottle gourds, which
will enable her to gain nearly 30,000 yuan (3,600
U.S.dollars). And Wang Delian uses his greenhouse to plant
potatoes introduced from Israel, with an annual yield of 40,000
kilograms and profits of 35,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang said she must work all day, from seven in the morning to
six in the evening, tending her vegetables in the greenhouse. But
she is quite satisfied, since it is quite profitable and she will
take gain back her investment after just one year of hard work.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 15th CPC this
year to prolong the land contracts for another 30 years has
greatly inspired farmers to invest more money in their land. Each
greenhouse costs 20,000 to 30,000 yuan on average, still the
number of the farmers who take up vegetable growing is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Ren Zhiwu, vice manager of the 36.6-hectare vegetable wholesale
market in the city, noted that the market place has brought great
convenience to the growers since its establishment in 1984, and
that investments in the facilities have now reached nearly 200
million yuan. The farmers will also be able to swap their crops at
the market to satisfy the various needs of different
locations.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmed will visit Iran Friday on a two-day tour for talks
on the Afghan issue, official sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad is scheduled to meet Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharazi and other senior Iranian officials on ways and means to
settle the long-running Afghan crisis, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will discuss the recent diplomatic activities in
the region to resolve the Afghan conflict. The visit will be part

coordinating efforts on the Afghan issue for a long time.
</P>

</P>
<P>
However, the talks had collapsed after five days due to their
intransigent attitude.

<HEADLINE> Clubs Queue up for Schmeichel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- English soccer Premier League
club Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel will start
talking next week to a host of European clubs hoping to sign him
at the end of the English season.
</P>
<P>
Schmeichel's form has been unusually patchy for United in
recent months, with some glaring mistakes sprinkled among the
more familiar inspirational saves.
</P>
<P>
But the Danish veteran has had no shortage of offers after
announcing his intention to quit Old Trafford in a bid to scale do
wn the number of matches he has to play each season.
</P>
<P>
His agent Ole Frederiksen said: "The interest for Peter has
been far larger even than we had dreamed it might be.
</P>
<P>
"Inquiries have come, in particular, from clubs in the
southern part of Europe - Italy, France, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are getting ready to look at the clubs which have
declared an interest, but that will not happen until early
January.
</P>
<P>
"Peter has been treated extremely fairly by United from the
point at which he made his decision to try a career change in a
new and warmer country.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore we will follow the rules and not start talking to
potential new clubs until we are allowed to, which is this
weekend," he told the Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
Brondby had emerged as favourites to sign Schmeichel, but the
35-year-old hinted that he would prefer not to return to his
native land just yet.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I have my 12-year-old son Kaspar to think about and
it would be good for him to learn another language before we
return home."
</P>
<P>
Schmeichel underlined his enduring skills with a commanding
performance in United's 0-0 draw against fellow title contenders
Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Foreman-Holmes Bout on its Last Legs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Despite reports to the
contrary, the heavyweight battle between grandfathers George
Foreman and Larry Holmes is not canceled. But a looming financial
deadline for $12.6 million puts it on a resuscitator.
</P>
<P>
Promoter Roger Levitt missed last week's deadline for
depositing letters of credit to preserve the planned January 23
fight at the Astrodome in Houston.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, a lawyer for Holmes, due $3.6 million, sent a letter
to Levitt exercising a clause that gives the promoter a five-day
window to deliver. Foreman, 49, is owned $9 million.
</P>
<P>
Levitt said he believed the letters of credit would be sent
by Thursday. Holmes, asked if he though the fight would happen,
replied:"I don't know, man. What do you think?"
</P>
<P>
Foreman already has received a non-refundable $1 million down
payment.
</P>
<P>
"If Levitt comes in late with the letters of credit, I will
still do the fight," Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
Levitt said an investor pulled out a couple of weeks ago
after the Mike Tyson-Frans Botha fight, scheduled for January 16,
was announced, which would hurt Foreman-Holmes pay-per-view
sales. He said he notified Foreman's lawyer Henry Holmes last
week.
</P>
<P>
"We told him we would be five dayslate," Levitt said. "We had
to replace that investor. I'm as much a victim because I've put
in a million dollars. There's no big deal about this. The fight
is full tream ahead."

<HEADLINE> Agents Lament NBA Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The NBA lockout has been
six months today, and the sides are still fighting without signs
of putting it to an end.
</P>
<P>
The players held a conference call with union leadership,
three agents held a call with the media.
</P>
<P>
"This whole negotiation has been disgraceful," agnet Keith
Glass said. "I don't care if they have a season or they don't,
but this is not a game. And this has been treated as a game by
the league. There's an awful lot of people -- and I'm not talking
about owners, players or agents -- who have been hurt by this."
</P>
<P>
Three agents who represent 33 locked-out NBA players said
that no more than seven of their clients would vote for the
league's "final" offer to avoid cancelation of the season on
January 7, if it were put to a vote by their union's full
membership, as Commissioner David Stern suggested Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jerome Stanley said his five clients would reject the
proposed deal, Glass said all but "two or three" of his 10
clients would do likewise and Steve Kauffman said all but "three
or four" of his 18 clients would vote against it.
</P>
<P>
If the league's "final" offer were put to a union-wide vote,
"I don't think it would get 80 to 85 percent rejection rate as
Billy Hunter said, but I think a majority of players would reject
it," said Kauffman.
</P>
<P>
Another agent, Mark Bartelstein, said that none of his 25
clients would vote in favor of the owners' proposal. All of his
clients are in the middle-to-low end of the salary spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Stern was still in Aspen, and deputy commissioner Russ Granik
was in Florida with his family. Union director Hunter conducted a
conference call with players from his office in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
The league says it has made its final offer, and no further
talks are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
New Jersey star Jayson Williams joined Toronto's Kevin Willis
in calling for a secret vote of players.
</P>
<P>
"Let's have a secret vote," Williams said. "This would
strenthen our union. Billy Hunter, the union, the press and the
league would all know where the players stand.
</P>
<P>
I have the best job in the world, and two pepole ruined it
for me -- David Stern and Billy Hunter. Who cares about the NBA
anymore? I don't. I'm just like Joe Public," said Williams.
</P>
<P>
"I'm ashamed to be an NBA player right now. We are really
looking like a bunch of dumb athletes and a dumb league if you
can't split $2 billion."
</P>
<P>
The three agnets, who spoke on a conference call arranged by
the union, said the players made huge concessions.
</P>
<P>
"No matter where the thing ends, the league is going to end
up with a good, a very good deal, almost a dream deal," Stanley
said. "If you took the same deal and offered it to baseball and
football owners, they'd hop all over it.
</P>
<P>
"At what point does it become enough? At one point do the own
ers stand up to their negotiator and say, 'We've already gotten
enough. Let's move forward.'"

<HEADLINE> Domi Joins Newcastle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- French defender Didier Domi
completed his move to Newscastle United at a transfer fee of 4
million pounds on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old left back, playing in Paris St Germain to St
James' Park for an initial 3.25m, with an extra 750,000 pounds
linked to the number of appearances he makes for the Magpies.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit, turning his attention to a
leaky defence after bolstering his attack with Duncan Ferguson,
was delighted with the signature of the French youth
international.
</P>
<P>
"He is a very good positional player," said Gullit, who had
trailed Domi for a month. "In England that is something we are
not used to, because in England people want to have players who
can tackle and run.
</P>
<P>
"But it's also important to have the right position, because
if you are in the right position you don't have to tackle.
</P>
<P>
"He's also a French youth international and that means he's
someone who has certain international experience, and that's what
we want."
</P>
<P>
Domi, who joins on a four-and-a-half-year contract, will go
straight into the squad for the Premiership clash with
title-chasing Chelsea on January 9.
</P>
<P>
He had been out of favour at PSG since the arrival of new
manager Artur Jorge, and he sees the move as an ideal opportunity
to prove his worth.
</P>
<P>
"The Premier League is very good and the truth will be shown
when I play," he said. "It's there that you will see my true
worth.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this season will go well because there are some very
good players here and Newcastle is a great side."
</P>
<P>
Gullit will be hoping Domi brings some rapid improvement to
his back line, after conceding seven goals in two games over the
Christmas period.

<HEADLINE> Leading Economic Index Rises in U.S. in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 30 (Xinhua) -- November leading economic
indicators in the U.S. point to a continuing growth through at
least early 1999, and the economy shows no evidence of cyclical
imbalance, a research group said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Conference Board said in its monthly report
that its composite index of the leading economic indicators rose
0.6 percent in November at 106.3 (1992=100), compared to a growth
of 0.1 percent in October and a drop of 0.1 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
The index foresees economic activity six to nine months in
advance. The newest figures represent the highest rise since it
moved up 0.8 percent in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The leading indicators show real strength as we end the year,"
said Michael Boldin, Director of Business Cycle Research at the
Conference Board, an influential private research group.
</P>
<P>
"While increases of this size will probably not continue, it is
unlikely that we will see any serious retrenchments in the next
few months," he said.

<HEADLINE> Moldova Lost 100,000 Ha of Forest in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 30 (Xinhua) -- In the last five years,
100,000 hectares of wood have been destroyed in the Republic of
Moldova, causing an alarming decrease of the wildlife, according a
recent declaration of the Ecological Movement of Moldova (EMM).
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Garaba, an EMM expert, warned that Moldova has
recorded the poorest biodiversity development in Europe. According
to him, the small territory occupied by woods and high level of
field utilization caused the disappearance of tens of animal
species.
</P>
<P>
Moldova is one of the least forest-covered country in Europe,
affirmed Dionisie Boaghie, a leader of the non-government
organization Progresul Silvic (forest progress).
</P>
<P>
According to him, Moldova has a forest reserve of 394,400
hectares of planted areas, including 325,400 hectares of forests.
40 percent of this surface does not correspond to environmental
requirements, Boaghie stressed.
</P>
<P>
Vasile Mahu, director of the state-run association MoldSilva,
said that little has been done in the recent years to enlarge the
forest reserves. If in 1981 there was planted a surface of 7,000
hectares, this year the figure hardly showed 1,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists insist on elaboration of a special program
for forest protection and regeneration, which would be financed by
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Valentin Bobeico, deputy minister of environment, told the
media that the ministry is working on a national strategy of
forest and biological diversity protection, which is to be
presented to the government next February.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets End 1998 With Weak Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- All the three main European
stock markets drifted lower to a quiet close in shortened trading
Wednesday, the final session.
</P>
<P>
In London, the stock market ended its session of the year with
a headlong dive into the red.
</P>
<P>
With trading extremely thin as traders awaited the launch of
the euro Friday, the market opened almost unchanged.
</P>
<P>
But dangerous volatility soon set in and within an hour the
FTSE-100 Index had begun a downward surge. At one point it had
lost 132.5 point. The index finally closed down 58.9 points at
5,882.6.
</P>
<P>
The market seemed unaffected by Tuesday's rally on Wall Street
which saw the Dow Jones close up 98.23 points.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt an initial rise of 1 percent was wiped out in
moribund trading, as the Xetra Dax index of leading shares closed
down 0.73 percent at 5,019.23.
</P>
<P>
Siemens AG, which set about major restructuring in 1998, was
among leading decliners, falling 5.25 marks to 107.50 although in
extremely low volume.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC 40 was equally downbeat, with most traders
concentrating on the impact of Thursday's conversion from francs
to euros.
</P>
<P>
One trader said, "There is some nostalgia about it being the
last day of trading in francs, but really, no one is interested in
doing any business."
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, most people are thinking about Monday and
beginning to wonder about how the prices will look in euros. Few
are really interested in what happens today," another trader said.

<HEADLINE> LIFFE Is Ready for The Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON December 30 (Xinhua) - The London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) announced Wednesday
that it is ready for the introduction of the euro on 4 January
1999.
</P>
<P>
In line with other European exchanges, LIFFE will be closed for
trading on Thursday 31st December and Friday 1st January. It will
re-open for trading, as normal, on Monday 4 January.
</P>
<P>
Hugh Freedberg, LIFFE's Chief Executive, said: "As an
international futures and options exchange, trading products
denominated in euro zone currencies, LIFFE has been preparing for
the euro for over two and a half years."
</P>
<P>
As far back as 1996 LIFFE changed the legal provisions of its
contracts to allow for settlement against the euro for it
euro-denominated short term interest rate contracts (STIRS).
Therefore, LIFFE will not need to make further changes to its
contracts over the coming historic weekend.
</P>
<P>
Freedberg said, the next important date for the Exchange and
its Members will be the weekend of 23rd/24th January when LIFFE
will be converting all the open interest in its Euromark and
Eurolira contracts into LIFFE'S Euro Libor contracts.
</P>
<P>
This will create the largest pool of euro money market
liquidity anywhere in the world, providing new opportunities for
trading within these markets.

<HEADLINE> Business Failures Show First Rise Since 1992 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The first annual increase in
business failures in Britain since 1992 was recorded, with a 6.2
percent rise in failed companies since last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures by business information company Dun &AMP; Bradstreet
released Wednesday show that nearly 200 more businesses are
failing each month than at the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 38,634 businesses went to the wall, compared with
36,368 in 1997 -- an increase of 2,266.
</P>
<P>
"The collapse of world markets, and the strong pound are the
main contributors," said Philip Mellor, analyst at Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet.
</P>
<P>
"You have had company start-ups failing as you would in good
times, but their problems have been compounded," he added.
</P>
<P>
A separate report shows the number of management buy-outs and
buy-ins going into receivership in 1998 hit its highest level
since 1995, with 62 companies affected, according to the Center
for Management Buy Out Research.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Launches VAT System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of the
Value Added Tax (VAT), a new tax system introduced by the
Government to enhance the country's revenue base, took off
Wednesday without much anxiety.
</P>
<P>
The VAT, which replaces the sales and service taxes is pegged
at 10 percent as compared with 15 percent charged under the old
system.
</P>
<P>
It was first introduced in 1995 at a rate of 17.5 percent but
was withdrawn three and a half months later following public
outcry and demonstrations on price distortions.
</P>
<P>
The re-introduction had been preceded by a public education
campaign and appropriate legal framework to support it as these
were some of the reasons for the withdrawal in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But critics have argued against the implementation of the new
tax regime, saying education on it was not elaborate enough.
</P>
<P>
Under the new VAT, the minimum turnover of businesses
qualified to charge VAT was also raised to 200 million Cedis (one
U.S. Dollar equals to some 2,350 Cedis) as against 25 million in
1995, perhaps to cut off petty traders and "corner shops", which
complicated the computation of the tax under the previous system.
</P>
<P>
Unlike before, most shoppers went round the virtually quiet
city shops without even noticing the switch over to the new tax.
</P>
<P>
"For me, it is the same old prices and if the change is not
going to be significant, then why worry," Yaw Tuga Yeboah, who
shopped from the Multi-Stores said.
</P>
<P>
Prices in most of the shops, which have boldly displayed their
VAT Certificate, indicating their authority to charge VAT on
their goods, have not changed from the pre-Christmas levels.
</P>
<P>
This may be the reason why consumers have not paid much
attention to the VAT and are not also worried about the new tax.
</P>
<P>
Some businesses, even though by the nature of their operations
could qualify to charge VAT, are still not registered.
</P>
<P>
The reason, they say, is that they are below the VAT
threshold.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the VAT law allows for voluntary registration, which
permits businesses below the 200 million-Cedi threshold to
register and operate VAT.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 7,000 traders have been issued with VAT
certificates throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin Agree to Disagree Over Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin Wednesday agreed to disagree
over U.S. air strikes against Iraq so that the two countries could
move the common agenda forward in 1999, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called Yeltsin from the Oval Office before leaving on a
New Year's vacation in South Carolina, White House spokesman David
Leavy said. They talked about 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Both presidents agreed that despite differences over Iraq, it
was important to continue to build the U.S.-Russian relationship
and to move the important common agenda that we have forward in
1999," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has strongly criticized U.S.-British bombings against
Iraq on Dec. 16-19, insisting there was no justification for using
force.
</P>
<P>
During their phone conversation, Yeltsin "stated his views, but
the president (Clinton) explained why force was necessary," Leavy
said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Clinton and Yeltsin had spoken since U.S.
and British air strikes against Iraq targets.
</P>
<P>
Leavy said Yeltsin did not specifically mention incidents
Monday and Wednesday in which U.S. warplanes and Iraqi air defense
batteries in northern and southern Iraq exchanged fires. But
Clinton referred to the incidents and stressed his determination
to enforce the no-fly zones, established right after the Gulf War
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed "concern about the continuing threat that
Saddam poses" in the Gulf region, Leavy said, and told Yeltsin
that "allied air crews will take the necessary precautions to
protect themselves and carry out their mission."
</P>
<P>
Leavy also said the conversation was mostly about items other
than Iraq, including the START II nuclear arms accord that awaits
Russian approval before taking effect; plans for meeting between
Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in
March and the meeting between Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
"Both stressed there is a solid foundation for the relationship
and agreed there is a need to tackle all the important issues for
1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reiterated U.S. support for economic reform in Russia.
He thanked Yeltsin for his New Year's message and extended New
Year greetings to the Russian people, Leavy said.

<HEADLINE> New Grass to Hold Roadside Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from the U.S.
Agricultural Research Service and Utah State University have
developed a new erosion-fighting grass to hold the roadside, said
the latest issue of Agricultural Research.
</P>
<P>
The new grass called RoadCrest which may tolerate cold,
drought and readily form rhizomes, will appear on western
roadsides and highways within a few years.
</P>
<P>
Tests in four states indicate it should thrive in temperate,
semiarid areas of Intermountain and western Great Plains states.
In these regions, it is best suited where summer temperatures are
mild and annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 20 inches.
Compared to many other crested wheat grasses, RoadCrest greens up
earlier in spring. It requires less seed to establish a good stand
and forms rhizomes more vigorously.
</P>
<P>
RoadCrest also is shorter-a trait that helps reduce the need
for mowing. The new grass is descended from plants grown from
seeds collected in Turkey.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The leader of Greece's main
opposition party New Democracy, Costas Karamanlis, Wednesday
criticized the decision by Nicosia and Athens regarding the
deployment of the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
After consultations with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
and Cyprus' National Council of political leaders, Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides Tuesday announced the cancellation of
plans to install the missiles in the divided island republic and
to negotiate their possible deployment in the southern Greek
island of Crete.
</P>
<P>
Simitis expressed his full support for Clerides' decision and
called it a responsible decision which would promote Cyprus'
defense and protection.
</P>
<P>
While describing the decision as "a grave defeat," Karamanlis
said in a statement that the consequences of incoherence, lack of
credibility and concessions were most serious for the whole of
Hellenism.
</P>
<P>
He said that all Greeks could not be called on to pay each time
for the serious mistakes of governments which proved themselves
less than able to meet the challenge.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government's handling of the missile issue
illustrated the need for a national strategy with the greatest
possible consensus and participation of all the country's
political forces, the party leader said.

said Minister of Finance and Economic Planning Donald Kaberuka
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Its economy is performing at 90 percent of its pre-war
capacity in just four years, Kaberuka was quoted by the
Independent Rwanda News Agency (RNA) as saying Wednesday in a
special story, which sent to Xinhua based in Nairobi here.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that when Rwanda emerged out of the 1994 civil
war, its economy was in total shambles, and its GDP had dropped
to about 50% of what it was before the war and the genocide.
</P>
<P>
Kaberuka said that this growth is not a surprise for any
economy beginning at Zero and it is quite normal to post such
growth rates, because the Rwandan government notably exercised
much fiscal and macro-economic discipline and closely followed
guidelines laid down by the donor community.
</P>
<P>
There are no longer any controls on foreign exchange rates,
and interests rates are freely determined in the country, said
Kaberuka.
</P>
<P>
Kaberuka said the government brought inflation -- which
constitutes a major obstacle to recovering economies -- almost
under control by basically living within the country's means and
desisting from measures like printing money.
</P>
<P>
The latest economic report of the country for 1998 covering
the period up to October, showed that the agriculture sector,
which represents 37 percent of the GDP and employs 91 percent of
the labor force, has now reached 86 percent of the normal
production.
</P>
<P>
The industry sector, which represents about 25 percent of the
GDP and occupies two percent of the labor force, has registered a
recovery estimated at 78 percent of its pre-war production.
</P>
<P>
Minister Kaberuka laid a special emphasis on the poverty
rocking the small central African state of Rwanda, where 70
percent of the population live below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government has just adopted a national development
strategy for the next two decades -- ending in the year 2020 --
which hinges on the modernization of agriculture, the development
of human resources, especially in science, technology and
management.
</P>
<P>
Other areas targeted by the new strategy include the
development of the country's infrastructure, the development of
transport infrastructure, notably the construction of railways to
link Rwanda with the Ocean outlet in a bid to lower high costs of
imports, and the promotion of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Although Rwanda has embarked on privatizing most of its
cumbersome enterprises and is progressively getting out of
commercial activities, the privatization drive has not been
welcomed by business people, and trade unions.
</P>
<P>
According to Kaberuka, Rwanda hopes to garner more revenues by
initiating an ambitious program of selling off a number of
government buildings and houses, and giving an impetus to the
privatization drive.
</P>
<P>
He deplored that Rwanda has been forsaken by donors because of
his involvement in the Congo (K) war.
</P>
<P>
It is unfair for donor agencies to punish a country doing its
best to implement and carry out its program, Kaberuka said

<HEADLINE> Ghanaians Flee Cote d'Ivoire for Fishing Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian Authorities have
evacuated home some 600 Ghanaians including 342 children fleeing
communal violence in Sassandra, an Ivorian fishing village, some
285 kilometers from the commercial capital, Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
Seven Ghanaians were killed and a great number wounded during
the violence which was sparked off by an alleged drowning of an
Ivorian at sea during a scuffle over fishing rights.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaians, mostly fishermen and their family members,
arrived at the Western border town of Elubo and were transported
in waiting buses to Komenda, Elmina, Moree and Mankessim, all in
the tourist region of central Ghana, a special story by Ghanaian
News Agency (GNA) faxed to Xinhua here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out when Ivorian fishermen returning from sea
alleged that a Ghanaian fishing group sank their boat during the
scuffle, resulting in drowning one of their colleagues, whose
body they are yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
There were some 3,000 Ghanaians living in Sassandra before the
violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ivorian government has pledged 500,000 CFA
francs (some 840 U.S. Dollars) to each of the bereaved families
of the seven Ghanaian fishermen killed in the violence.
</P>
<P>
It is also providing resources for the rebuilding of their
houses destroyed during the fighting.
