<HEADLINE> French Envoy Optimistic on Solving Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 5 (Xinhua) -- French president's special
envoy Bertrand Dufourcq said here Thursday that he was optimistic
about the prospect of solving the U.N.-Iraqi crisis over weapons
inspection through diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq, secretary-general of the French Foreign Ministry,
made the remark before he left here for Cairo, Egypt, Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that diplomatic efforts had resulted in
progress, and that these efforts should continue to solve the
crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources, Iraq has agreed to open nine
of its presidential sites to U.N. arms inspectors. But the news
has not been confirmed by the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic efforts are intensifying in Baghdad to avert a
possible American military action against Iraq. Among the
mediators are Russian president's special envoy Victor Posuvalyuk,
Secretary-General of the Arab League Esmat Abdel-Meguid, Turkish
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and Palestinian envoy Azzam al-Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
The French special envoy, who arrived here Tuesday evening,
met with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Wednesday and handed over
to Saddam a letter from French President Jacques Chirac which
contains proposals for defusing the current crisis through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Dufourcq also exchanged views with Meguid on the
current crisis between Iran and the U.N., which was triggered off
by Iraqi refusal to allow U.N. arms inspectors access to its
presidential palaces on ground of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The palaces are suspected of hiding banned weapons.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Lodges Protest Over Turkish Threats on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has lodged a protest to
the U.N. over recent Turkish threats to a military air base in
southern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The protest was made in a letter addressed Wednesday to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan by Cyprus' Permanent
Representative to the U.N. Sotos Zackheos, Cyprus News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The military air base, situated near the western coastal town
of Paphos, was constructed within the framework of a joint
defense pact with Greece in 1993. It will be used by Greek air
force planes.
</P>
<P>
The base has been completed and was handed over to the
National Guard by the contractors last month, but its formal
inauguration will take place after the presidential elections this
month.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has stated that the base was a
defensive project and would be used only when Cyprus suffers an
attack.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has said it would also protest the delivery of the air
base to the U.N. Secretary-General and the Security Council, and
threatened to take necessary counter measures. Turkish Cypriot
leader Ruaf Denktash has warned he would "break the wings" of
Greek aircraft that may be stationed at the base.
</P>
<P>
The letter of the Cypriot government to the U.N. said "as a
sovereign and independent state, the Republic of Cyprus does
nothing more but to exercise its inalienable right recognized by
the U.N. Charter and general international law, through the
enhancement of the defensive capabilities of National Guard."
</P>
<P>
After 24 years of occupation of northern Cyprus by Turkish
troops, Zackheos noted, the need for Cyprus "to take sufficient
measures to defend itself in the face of this continuing threat
becomes even more imperative."
</P>
<P>
The letter pointed out that Turkey maintains in the occupied
northern island "a force of 36,000 heavily armed troops which are
constantly upgraded and modernized."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot diplomat urged the U.N. chief "to remind the
Turkish government of its obligations and responsibilities under
the Charter of the U.N.."

<HEADLINE> Russia Able to Prevent Use of Force Against Iraq: Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said here Thursday that his country can prevent the United States
from taking military action against Iraq, Russian media reports
said.
</P>
<P>
"We must not allow a strike by force, an American strike. I
told (U.S. President Bill) Clinton about it: no, we shall not
allow that," Yeltsin told Russian and Italian journalists in the
Kremlin ahead of his Italian visit scheduled to start on February
11.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said his stance has gained support from the
international community including France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The president did not elaborate on how Russia would respond to
the possible U.S. military action.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the use of force against Iraq could fuel a new
world war.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to launch a military strike on
Iraq, which refused to grant U.N. weapons inspectors access to
some 60 sites on grounds of national sovereignty, to force it to
allow unrestricted access to all sites.
</P>
<P>
Washington even refused to pledge that it would not use force
during the winter Olympics held in Nagano, Japan from February 7
to 22.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin noted that the tension caused by the crisis over Iraq's
weapons inspection has eased but he could not say for sure that
the situation has returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
A news bulletin issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry on
Thursday said that the threat of force against Iraq still exists
because the United States remains reluctant to settle the crisis
by political or diplomatic means.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Renews Military Control in Troubled Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government Thursday
renewed a military control for another six months in the country's
troubled eastern area of Baalbek-Hermel, the official National New
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The move came a week after the bloody clash between maverick
Shiite Muslim cleric Sheikh Sobih Tufeili and the government army,
in which eight people were killed, including four army personnel.
</P>
<P>
The clash was prompted by the refusal of Tufeili and his armed
followers to leave a seminary belonged to the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah which had to call in the government army for military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Baalbek's military takeover was first imposed last November
when Tufeili launched an anti-government self-proclaimed "Hunger
Revolution," in an attempt to set up a mini state by prohibiting
government ministers and parliament members to enter the area.
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's regular cabinet session, Minister of
Information Bassem Al-Sabaa told reporters that the government had
decided to give the 3,000-strong troop another six-month mandate
to control the area in order to keep law and order.
</P>
<P>
He added the government decided to transfer the case of Tufeili
to the country's judicial council.
</P>
<P>
Tufeili has been at large since the clash and reportedly
hiding in the hills near his hometown of Brital in the area. The
government troops have surrounded the region in a hunt-down
operation.

<HEADLINE> Blair Gives Strong Support to Clinton on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- In a round of interviews
with U.S. televisions, British Prime Minister Tony Blair Thursday
showed his support to U.S. President Bill Clinton on the issue of
the Iraqi crisis over U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Blair told CNN that experience had told the world diplomacy
must be backed by military action before you can force Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to comply with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to recognize in the light of our experience with
Saddam Hussein that diplomacy simply won't work unless it's backed
up by the threat of force or indeed the use of force," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it should not be seen as "machismo" but a way to force
Saddam to live up to its promises.
</P>
<P>
"It's important, not out of machismo or a test of international
virility, but in the interest of long-term world peace that Saddam
Hussein is made to back down," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the ABC's "Good Morning American" program, Blair said U.N.
weapons inspectors found "a vast arsenal" of chemical and
biological weapons, which he said was a violation of U.N. weapons
inspections resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed the use of force was one way to compel
Saddam to end the manufacture of those banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we can, by military capability, force him to
do the things that he should be doing, properly in abidance with
the Security Council resolutions that have already been passed,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
But Blair told the NBC's "Today" program that decision had yet
to be made when to take military action against Iraq and any
newspaper reports about a specific date for the attack would only
be speculations. He was referring to a British newspaper report
which said Feb. 17 had been chosen for a military attack.
</P>
<P>
"There are no decisions on these things that can or should be
taken as a matter of public debate; newspaper reports like that
are highly speculative," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair arrived in Washington Wednesday night for a three-day
visit. He will hold talks with President Clinton, discussing a
wide range of issues including North Ireland, Iraq, the Middle
East, NATO expansion, European affairs and the Asian economic
turmoil.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Tries to Confirm Plane Detention in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has been
trying to confirm that Angola is holding two South Africans
reportedly on board a Ukrainian aircraft impounded this week,
foreign affairs spokesman Marco Boni said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
International news media earlier reported that Angola seized
an Antonov 26 and its crew, along with two South African
passengers after allowing it to land in Luanda Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The plane was reportedly chartered by a South African company,
SG Corporation. It allegedly made flights to the region
controlled by rebel forces -- the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Angolan civil aviation officials were quoted as saying the
Antonov was on a list of aircraft which violated Angolan
airspace.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian plane is the second to be detained in Angola in
the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
A DC-4 plane carrying mining equipment and other freight from
South Africa to Andulo, central headquarters of the UNITA, was
forced down by an Angolan Mig fighter on January 22. Eight South
Africans on board were being held in a military camp.
</P>
<P>
Angolan security officials said the privately owned plane
contravened a travel and air ban the United Nations imposed on
UNITA last year for violating a 1994 peace accord ending the
civil war in Angola.

Thursday by Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen for future
trends in interest rates.

KAMPALA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A registration by United
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) at a camp in
southwestern Uganda caused some arguments from the benefiters, a

The measure is aimed at prevention of repeated registration
and get the supplies more targeting, Thoolen explained in his
statement.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Families Eat Out Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadian families have been
eating out less, and spending more of their food dollars in the
grocery store, according to a Statistics Canada report.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that between 1992 and 1996, Canadian
family spending on restaurant meals fell 6.5 percent. Over the
same span, spending on groceries rose by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures are another sign of how Canadian families suffered
in the recession of the early 1990s and the idling economy of the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
"It's families tightening their belts," Gordon Betcherman, an
economist of Canadian Policy Research Networks, was quoted as
saying by reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Canadian families spent an average of 112.09 dollars
(77.4 US dollars) on groceries or in restaurants, up only 1.5
percent from that in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, restaurant meals prices were up 6.3 percent
and grocery store food prices up 5.8 percent, according to the

<HEADLINE> World Drug Sales Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate in sales of
drugs in 10 of the biggest pharmaceuticals markets in the world
slowed down in the year to November, according to the latest data
from specialist market researchers at IMS International.
</P>
<P>
The sales growth rate over the 12 months was 5 percent at 165.9
billion US dollars, compared with a 7 percent growth rate in the
year to October.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the slowdown is that in the world's biggest
market, the US, growth in the period fell from 14 percent to 10
percent at 66.05 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sales in the world's second largest market, Japan,
were down 1 percent at 42.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, sales in smaller markets rose. Drug sales in Italy and
Canada were up 5 and 11 percent at 8.6 billion dollars and 4.1
billion dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that by the medical area, heart drugs remained
the biggest sellers with sales up 5 percent at 33.7 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nervous system drugs remained the fastest growing sector, with
sales 12 percent higher at 23.4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU Leader Visits Angola for Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Joao de Deus Pinheiro, an
official in charge of the European Union's African, Caribbean and
Pacific affairs arrived at Luanda Thursday to try to strike deals
on EU's aid programs on Angola's reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Pinheiro, who is on his three-day visit, said on arriving at
the Luanda airport here that he has come at a time when the
Lusaka Peace Protocol is to be fully implemented in Angola and an
enduring peace is to befall the country.
</P>
<P>
The EU is to increase its aid to Angola by 90 percent in the
coming five years as compared with the past five years, he said,
adding that he is to sign a 100 million U.S. Dollars aid plan
during his visit this time.
</P>
<P>
He said that the framework of EU's relations with the African,
Caribbean and Pacific region, which is now waiting for European
Commission's approval, is to bring a brand-new concept of
treating countries in these regions as sovereign states rather
than the formerly donors and recipients.
</P>
<P>
The EU would like to help the African, Caribbean and Pacific
region countries in its economic integration with the world on
the basis of political talks between sovereign countries, the EU
official said.
</P>
<P>
To reach these goals, he said, the EU should make great
efforts in strengthening the production and trade systems, and
offer technical and financial help to countries in the region if
necessary, so as to link them closely with the EU.
</P>
<P>
He said he would like to have an extensive contact with
Angolan leaders, so as to better understand the political
situation in the country and the strategic choice of the leaders
of the former rebel movement the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The EU would naturally react to the new situation taking place
in Angola and to the strategic choice leaders in Angola are
taking, Pinheiro said.

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Register 2.5 Pct Drop in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The orders from the U.S.
factories and plants registered a drop in December mainly by a
record plunge in orders for aircraft, but retailers prospered, the
Commerce Department reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 63 percent aircraft drop was the worst since the department
began tracking the industry in 1958, the report said. The decline
caused an overall 2.5 percent dip in factory orders, to a
seasonally adjusted 336 billion U.S. dollars. It was the worst
monthly drop in more than five years.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile aircraft sector, orders rose a moderate
1.6 percent, with strength reported in demand for autos,
electrical equipment, industrial machinery, paper, chemicals and
food products.
</P>
<P>
Some economists believed the aircraft orders drop was one of
the first concrete signs that Asia's problems are hurting the U.S.
economy. Last week, Boeing Co. said it expected Asian customers
over the next three years to buy 60 fewer planes than anticipated
before the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Despite December's blow to aircraft manufacturers, factories
during all of 1997 reported a robust 5.3 percent orders increase,
compared with 4.6 percent in 1996 and 7.4 percent in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Civil Unrest to Affect Zimbabwe's Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's riotous civil
protests against economic difficulties have the potential to
damage the country's fledgling tourism sector, which registers
the fastest growth in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe National News Agency Ziana reported Thursday
that, coupled with the downward slide in the value of the
Zimbabwean Dollar against major international currencies, the
country is currently going through one of the worst economic
crisis since independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The unpredictable economic situation will likely cause more
civil unrest, Ziana report said.
</P>
<P>
The industry's performance in the past 10 years has been
commendable, generating 1.3 billion Zimbabwean Dollars (80
million U.S. Dollars) in 1995 and 2.3 billion (140 million U.S.
Dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the sector earned 3.4 billion Zimbabwean Dollars (200
million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Zimbabwean Council for Tourism (ZCT), Herbert
Nkala said the industry's ambitious projected revenue in 1998 may
not be realized due to likely more civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
Nkala warned that the growth phase of the sector, which is the
third largest foreign currency spinner, was on the decline.
</P>
<P>
He said, unlike other sectors like agriculture where effects
of drought take long to be felt or mining where minerals can be
stockpiled until the price is right, tourism is highly vulnerable
to unpredictable harsh socio-economic conditions.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Proposes African Telcoms Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Thursday
appealed to set up a dedicated fund to support public and private
telecommunication infrastructure investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop attended by African communications
ministers in Somerset, six km east of Cape Town, South African
Communications Minister Jay Naidoo said it was important, in
developing an African telecommunication strategy, to see how
private financing could be better used.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was held in preparation for the African Telecom
'98 Exhibition and conference to be held in Johannesburg in May.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo said an African plan of action for telecommunications
development should seek to initiate dialogue toward designing and
creating legal and regulatory frameworks.
</P>
<P>
It should also promote gradual introduction of competition in
providing advanced services, and improve the efficiency of public
telecommunication operations to prepare them for this
competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
A unified African position on telecommunications would ensure
that the continent achieved its vision of being an integral part
of the global information society, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Henry Chasia, deputy
secretary-general of the International Telecommunication Union,
said Africa was the largest and last great untapped market for
telecommunication infrastructure, products and services.
</P>
<P>
It was the place on earth that offered the greatest returns to
those entrepreneurs willing to take the risk and a longer-term
point of view, he said.

<HEADLINE> British Expert Calls for Education Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- British educationist Barnaby
Shaw today said education reforms are a necessity as countries'
economies and societies continued to change.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar at the on-going U.K.-Zimbabwe Cooperation
Week in Harare, Shaw, from UK's Department for Education and
Employment, said reforms were needed to raise performance in
schools.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a rise in demand for higher education, fast
change in the labor market and need for more technical skills,
and all these changes prompt the need for education reforms,"
Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
He urged governments to have national education commissions
which would look into the education system to give the best
possible recommendations for the benefit of it.
</P>
<P>
For education institutions, he said, they had to be clear on
what business needed, otherwise companies and organizations would
not be provided with the personnel they required.
</P>
<P>
"With the ever changing economic and social scenario," he
said, "gone are the times when there was demand for people who
are only academically sound, but with no practical experience."
</P>
<P>
He called for the need to respond to new demands for the
education system, and he commented the Zimbabwean government for
putting in place a commission on inquiry into education and
training.
</P>
<P>
The commission would look into various issues pertaining to
provision of education and training, organizational capacity and
management and financing the education system.

<HEADLINE> Soft Commodity Prices Fall 7 Pct in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The prices of soft commodity
fell by 7 percent last year and is forecast not to rise before
1999, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).
</P>
<P>
The EIU said in its latest analysis of the soft commodity
market that although the prices of beverages, such as coffee,
cocoa and tea, rose 29.9 percent last year, a 24.5 percent fall in
the price of grain helped drive the soft commodity price basket
down sharply by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that this year, cane sugar supplies would
fall due to the effects of El Nino, which in turn would force up
raw sugar prices by 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, a probable 12.1 percent decline in the prices of
beverages due to plentiful supplies of coffee, cocoa and tea would
offset sugar's gains and bring about a 1.1 percent fall in the
overall soft commodity price basket.
</P>
<P>
The EIU downgraded its forecast for global maize consumption as
a result of the fall-out from the east Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that commodity prices would rise by an average 3.7
percent in 1999.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela held talks with Botswana Foreign Minister Mompati
Merafhe in Cape Town Thursday, possibly on bilateral and regional
ties, South African Press Association SAPA reported.
</P>
<P>
Presidential aide Parks Mankahlana declined to go to details
of the talks, but indicated that Mandela had met Merafhe in his
capacity as chairman of the Southern African Development
Community, and that matters related to the welfare of the region
had been discussed, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela last week interrupted a two-day rest period to meet
Namibian President Sam Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana would not comment on whether the meeting was
related to renewed tension between Namibia and Botswana over the
disputed Situngu Island.
</P>
<P>
Merafhe's aide, Charles Ntwaagae, said the talks related to
"bilateral relations and matters of mutual interest."
</P>
<P>
Namibia and Botswana failed to reach an agreement late last
month on Botswana troops' withdrawal from Situngu Island in
Linyanti River.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed, however, to allow Namibian villagers to
continue cultivating crops on the island pending the resolution
of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Botswana troops had reportedly occupied the tiny island and
harassed Namibian farmers there.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The capital's criminal
investigation police in Rwanda have denied media reports that two
people have been arrested in connection with the killing of
Croatian priest Father Vjeco Curic in Kigali last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations' IRIN -- Integrated Regional Information
Network -- quoted BBC's Kinyarwanda Service as reporting
Wednesday that two people were arrested in connection with
Curic's murder.
</P>
<P>
"Three people traveling with Father Curic were responsible for
gunning him down as they drove up to Kigali from Kivumu in
Gitarama prefecture," IRIN had further reported.
</P>
<P>
It is further said that the three people believed to have shot
dead Father Curic were just students who got a ride from him.
</P>
<P>
"We have investigated their possible involvement, we found
nothing connecting them with the murder of the Croatian
Father," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The three students and the Father separated many hours
before he was shot dead in his vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Israel Vows Retaliation If Attacked by Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Thursday insisted
on its right of self-defense against a possible Iraqi missile
attack despite U.S. advice that it refrain from retaliation.
</P>
<P>
In response to U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen's call
for Israeli low profile, the Prime Minister's Office issued a
statement reiterating Israel will make its own decision.
</P>
<P>
"As we have always said, Israel reserves the right to
self-defense and will act based on its security interests," the
statement said. "This position has not changed."
</P>
<P>
As the U.S.-Iraq standoff over weapons inspection continued
escalating, there were widespread fears here that Iraq might
launch biological or chemical attack on Israel if the U.S. takes
military actions against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Worried citizens flooded gas masks distribution centers around
the country. For most Israelis, the memory is still vivid about
the Scud missile attack launched by Iraq during the 1991 Gulf
War. At that time, Israel was forced to refrain from retaliating
under U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
To prevent a public panic over the Iraqi crisis, Israeli
leaders in recent days repeatedly assured its citizens that the
chance of an Iraqi attack is very low this time. They also vowed
that if attacked, Israel would retaliate with close coordination
with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Ariel Sharon, national infrastructure minister and member of
the inner security Cabinet, said Thursday that Israel should not
be pressured on the matter of self-defense. He said that facing a
web of conventional and non-conventional threats, Israel must
carry out essential measures to defend its own citizens.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak also came out to
support the government position. After meeting with U.S.
Ambassador to Israel Edward Walker, Barak said Cohen's appeal to
Israel to stay idle toward Iraqi attack was "unhelpful."
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel has the right to reply to any attacker,
although he believed that such retaliation must be carried out in
a careful way and with close coordination with Washington.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, Israeli leaders held a flurry of high-level
consultations on the Iraqi crisis and possible answers to possible
Iraqi attack.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held
discussions on the Gulf situation with Sharon, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai, Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky as
well as Barak.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Netanyahu is scheduled to brief international
diplomats based in Israel on the Gulf situation and Israel's
position.

ATHENS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- All flights at Crete's Heraklion
airport had to be canceled Thursday as angry farmers used their
cars to block the roads to the airport.
</P>
<P>
Before blocking access to the airport, farmers from the Greek
prefectures of Heraklion, Rethymno and Lasithi gathered outside
the offices of the Federation of Agricultural Associations of
Heraklion prefecture, waving black flags to show their opposition
to the government policies of tight spending, according to the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After that gathering, farmers marched through the center of
Heraklion to the airport, causing serious traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, thousands of farmers have taken their tractors
onto the motorway linking Athens and northern Greece to pressure
the government to meet their demands including higher prices for
their products and an end to production quotas and penalties
imposed by the European Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today authorized extension of the mandate of
the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Implementation of the
Bangui Agreements (MISAB) until March 16, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution, the Security Council welcomed the efforts
made by the member states participating in the MISAB and by those
states providing support to the team, and their readiness to
maintain these efforts.
</P>
<P>
It welcomed the support provided by the United Nations
Development Program to the International Committee for the
follow-up of the Bangui Agreements and encourages it to continue
this support.
</P>
<P>
It called upon the parties in the Central African Republic to
complete the implementation without any delay of the provisions of
the Bangui Agreements.
</P>
<P>
The council welcomed the intention of the secretary-general to
appoint a special representative to the Central African Republic
and expressed its belief that the prompt appointment of such a
representative could assist the parties in the implementation of
the Bangui Agreements and provide support to other activities of
the United Nations in the country.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated its call to all states, international
organizations and financial institutions to assist in
post-conflict development in the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
The council requested the secretary-general to submit a report
for its consideration, no later than February 23, 1998, on the
situation in the Central African Republic with recommendations
regarding the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping
operation, including the structure, specific goals and financial
implications of such an operation.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed its intention to take a decision by March
16, 1998 on the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping
operation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The MISAB, established in February 1997 at the invitation of
the president of the Central African Republic and with the
authorization of the Security Council of the United Nations, aims
to help the country restore peace and stability. France provides
logistical and financial support for the team.
</P>
<P>
But the French government has announced withdrawal of its
support for the mission beginning in mid-April. UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has recommended establishment of a UN
peacekeeping force to succeed the MISAB when its mandate ends in
March 16, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Continue Supporting Lebanese Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian Majlis
(parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri Thursday said that his
country has and will continue to support Lebanese resistance
against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Nouri made the remarks during his talks with Lebanese House
Speaker Nabih Berri. Their talks touched on various issues,
including bilateral ties, the stalled Middle East peace process,
recent Lebanese Muslim unrest, the U.N.-Iraqi arms inspection
crisis and Turkey-Israeli military alliance.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of pursuing hardline policy which led to
the deadlock of the peace process, saying Israel does not want
real peace but work hard to gain more time and eventually
get more Arab land.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Turkish-Israeli military alliance cannot be
ignored, stressing the need to coordinate to face the threat.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent Lebanese crackdown on an unrest led by
the former Iranian-backed Hezbullah leader sheikh Sobhi Tufeili in
the impoverished eastern area of Baalbek-Hermel, the Iranian
parliament leader said he deplored the violence which killed eight
people, adding the issue is a Lebanese internal affair.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hopes that Lebanese government will deal with
it in accordance with state laws.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Berry stressed the importance of Nouri's
visit, the first of its kind, to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said the timing of the visit is very important in light of
the regional tension, stressing the need to close ranks to
confront Israel which has been attempting to weaken Lebanese
resistance.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer area in
south Lebanon since 1985 with the aim to protect its north
from cross-border guerillas attacks. The occupation prompted a
13-year-old resistance from Lebanese guerrillas which is
spearheaded by Hezbullah.
</P>
<P>
Nouri arrived here Thursday morning from Damascus. During his
two-day visit, he will also meet with Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and tour south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Warns Iraq of Grave Consequences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia warned Iraq
Thursday that it would face "grave consequences" if it continues
to bar the U.N. inspectors the access to suspected Presidential
Palaces, an official statement by the Saudi Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued following talks between visiting British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and his Saudi Counterpart Saud
Al-Faisal in Riyadh said "a failure to resolve this crisis through
diplomatic means will lead to grave consequences" and Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein is to blame for the consequences.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Britain urged Iraq to comply fully with the
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the two sides stressed the importance of
finding a diplomatic solution for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a joint news conference with Al-Faisal, Cook
said "we both agree that there will be grave consequences if
Saddam does not comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions,
and we both agreed that in that event it will be Saddam Hussein
alone who will be responsible for the consequences."
</P>
<P>
Cook arrived in Riyadh late Wednesday night on a regional
tour which would also cover Kuwait to discuss the recent
Iraq-UN standoff.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Russia Disallows Military Solution to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Thursday believed the peak of tension around Iraq is over and
stressed again that Russia would not allow a military solution of
the problem, according to the ITAR-TASS.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told reporters Thursday on the eve of going to Italy
for a visit, "We should not allow an armed strike, an American
strike, whatever the circumstances."
</P>
<P>
But he added, "One cannot be sure so far that everything is all
right, that another heightening of tension is out of the
question."
</P>
<P>
The president warned again that military strikes might trigger
another world war. He said, "The most important thing is that we
assumed a really firm stand: no to a military solution of the
problem. It is impossible; it will mean a world war."
</P>
<P>
Russia's position is backed by France and Italy while Britain
is still hesitant, according to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation Wednesday, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair promised to Yeltsin that he would no longer
send military hardware to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president Wednesday warned U.S. President Bill
Clinton by telephone that using force to resolve the Iraqi crisis
might provoke a world war.
</P>
<P>
The United States stated on the same day that it had no plan
and did not intend to use nuclear weapons against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> US Cautions Citizens Abroad Over Iraqi Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- All Americans abroad were
warned Thursday to beware of "random acts of violence" as tension
is increasing in the Gulf with the U.S. resolved to take possible
military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued by the U.S. State Department in a
statement before a possible military strike aimed to force Iraq to
abide by U.N. weapons inspections resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"While at this time we know of no specific threats to U.S.
citizens or interests overseas in relation to the present
situation in Iraq, we cannot discount the possibility of random
acts of anti-American violence," the State Department statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged U.S. citizens traveling or living abroad to
"exercise greater than usual caution" and said U.S. diplomatic
posts worldwide were taking "appropriate security precautions."
</P>
<P>
The "worldwide caution" was similar to one issued by the State
Department last Nov. 19 during a previous standoff with Iraq over
the weapons inspections.

<HEADLINE> Far Fewer People Join Nationwide Jobless Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Far fewer people than expected
took part in the long-planned nationwide protests in Germany
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police estimates by mid-afternoon showed less than 20,000
people joined the protests, compared to over 1 million earlier
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
The protests were called by trade unions, churches and the
opposition Greens Party against Germany's mass unemployment,
which had been at high levels since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The protests coincided with the Thursday release of official
unemployment figures for January, which showed that unemployment
in Germany surged by 301,600 to a record high of 4.823 million, or
12.6 percent from December's 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Labor Office blamed the January increase on
seasonal factors. It reported that on a seasonally-adjusted basis,
unemployment dropped by 72,000 to 4.46 million.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, the gap in joblessness continued to
widen between western and eastern Germany, with the rate being
10.5 percent in the west and 21.1 percent in the east.
</P>
<P>
About 11,000 people joined the demonstrations in eastern
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Among the most popular banners carried by protesters were
"(Chancellor Helmut) Kohl has to go!" and "We need work!"
</P>
<P>
The nationwide jobless protests were projected following the
example of France. But police said that, compared to the protests
in France, the demonstrators were not only fewer, but also
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Karlsruhe and Oldenburg, protestors only briefly
blocked the entrances to state-run employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the low turnout was due to a "feeling of shame"
among the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Social Democrats (SPD) in a heated debate
at parliament held Kohl's center-right government responsible
for the situation in Germany, deeming the widening gap between the
rich and the poor in the country as a major cause.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's party said Germany needed to improve the investment
environment in order to create more jobs.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Says Asia Rescue Must Shield Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) today expressed concern about the efforts
to rescue East Asia's sagging economies, saying it was not clear
that children would be protected from the effects of severe fiscal
austerity.
</P>
<P>
"Unless there are explicit safeguards for social programs,
efforts to ease the region's financial problems will cause great
suffering for children," said Carol Bellamy, UNICEF' executive
director.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy noted that the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund have stressed the importance of protecting the
social sector. But she said the austerity measures prescribed for
the East Asian economies might make it difficult, if not
impossible, to protect social programs.
</P>
<P>
"We know from bitter experience that the imposition of the
stringent austerity can trigger wrenching social disruption -- and
that in these situations, children are always most at risk," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The likelihood that millions will be thrown out of work makes
the prospects for children that much more dire, the executive
director said.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's concern, Bellamy said, is that the region be spread
the steep declines in human development that the same kind of
measures wreaked on the developing world beginning nearly two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said UNICEF does not question the need for economic
adjustment in developing countries facing serious financial and
trade problems. Nor, she said, does UNICEF believe that there are
any painless solutions to the East Asia crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We are all too familiar with the experience of the 1980s, when
dozens of countries in Africa and Latin America were obliged to
accept structure adjustment, but without a human face," Bellamy
said.
</P>
<P>
"The result was a `lost decade' of deepening poverty, rising
inequality, slow growth, and mass unemployment -- a slow-motion
social catastrophe whose effects are still being felt. That
history must not be allowed to repeat itself," she stressed.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Farmers Urged to Fully Tap Wild Gum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian farmers were
Thursday urged to fully tap wild gum resource in a bid to
increase gum export to world market.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the head of Gum
Production Trade Department of the country, Tiruwork Woldehana,
said the foreign currency earned from the sale of gum is very low
owing to lack of awareness on the part of the farmers.
</P>
<P>
She said peasants are using wild gum for fuel wood and other
purposes, thus the hard currency obtained in the sector has been
minimal.
</P>
<P>
The head said that the wild gum found along the Ethio-Sudan
borderline have an international market and that most of the item
is being sold to European, Middle-east and Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
However, she said although efforts have been exerted to deploy
the inhabitants of northern Tigray Regional State who are
experienced in collecting gum to places where gum is found, it
has been impossible to fully tap the resource due to shortage of
manpower engaged in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Wild gum could serve as an ingredient for medicines and a raw
material in pulp and gum factories.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Boost Film Industry: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government will
revamp its cultural policies to encourage more Canadian film
production and distribution, said Heritage Minister Sheila Copps.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the current policies are not working," the minister
was quoted as saying by Thursday's reports.
</P>
<P>
Canada is a huge market for films with a box-office total of
400 million dollars (280 million US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the box office receipts for Canadian films have remained
unchanged at 2 percent of the total market since 1984.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to change the distribution and marketing of
Canadian films, whose number rose to 61 in 1995 from 55 in 1992,
Copps said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said she hopes that a new policy will be in place
by this time next year.
</P>
<P>
Some of the steps that the government wants to pursue will
include distribution legislation, tougher foreign investment
rules, new subsidies for the film industry and quotas that could
be imposed on theaters and video rental stores.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Botswana government
expressed grave concern Thursday at the mounting tension on the
common border with Namibia.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry statement issued in Gaborone said Botswana
views the latest incident seriously, particularly because the two
countries agreed last month to help resolve any border-related
issues, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, one Namibian national, accompanied by troops,
confronted a patrol unit of the Botswana defense force along the
Linyanti River and demanded to cross into Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Botswana said the Namibian national told the patrol unit he
was a member of parliament and demanded to take pictures of the
troops on the Botswana side of the river.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry statement said the platoon commander of
Botswana defense force said he had not been informed about the
Namibian visit.
</P>
<P>
Ownership of few islands have become a bone of contention
between Botswana and Namibia during the past years. These are
Situngu, Luyondo and Kasikili islands situated in the Linyanti
and Chobe rivers on the Namibian side of the border.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are waiting for a decision from the
International Court of Justice, in the Netherlands, over their

LAGOS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government will
soon start a massive retrenchment of its civil servants by at
least 30 percent, with the recent issue of of a guideline for the

</P>
<P>
The government explained the guideline in a circular dated

According to the report, such offences include dishonesty,
drunkenness, false claims against the government, falsification
and suppression of records, or failure to keep records, among
others.
</P>
<P>
Those who were appointed irregularly, or belonging to secret
cults, or suffering from prolonged ill-health will also lose
their jobs, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Firms Asked to Report Year 2000 Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's public companies have
been asked to disclose Year 2000 computer risks to shareholders or
face sanctions ranging from a million-dollar fine to a cease-trade
order.
</P>
<P>
Securities regulators from across the country issued their 2000
requirements to public companies in a joint notice this week.
</P>
<P>
And they expect disclosures to appear in 1997 annual reports
this spring, according to Thursday's Financial Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"We and other financial regulators view the year 2000 problem
very seriously," said Jack Geller, acting chairman of the Ontario
Securities Commission.
</P>
<P>
"If the year 2000 risks could be putting you out of business,
or could be obligating you to make very substantial expenditures
to stay in business, then that may well be a material matter that
should be disclosed to your shareholders," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 risks arise from the practice of computers using
only two digits rather than four to indicate the year portion of
the date.
</P>
<P>
When January 1, 2000, arrives, the computer will change from
"99" to "00" and react as if it's 1900 rather than 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Israeli Defense Ministry said that Mordechai had a cordial
discussion with Kiyrikoghu on the past and future military
cooperations between the two sides, but gave no further details of
the discussion.
</P>
<P>
Kiyrikoghu arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit as guest
of the Ground Corps Command of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
Major General Amos Malka.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Kiyrikoghu was briefed by senior IDF officers
about the IDF operations and Israel's military industrial
productions.
</P>
<P>
He also visited the logistics and technology branch of the IDF
and examined the Merkava III tank that Israel has sought to sell
to the Turkish armed forces.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Turkey last November, Mordechai tried to
persuade Turkey to purchase the Merkava, Israel's main battle tank.
</P>
<P>
Israel is bidding in competition with four other countries for
a lucrative deal to supply Ankara with thousands of tanks, which
would be assembled in Turkey. If Israel wins the bid, it will be
the first time that a Merkava is sold to a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Turkish defense ties have been further strengthened by
Mordechai's November visit to Ankara, which also deeply enhanced
the strategic alliance between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As the first Israeli defense minister visiting Turkey,
Mordechai said during his stay in Ankara that Israel was willing to
share with Turkey advanced weapons technology to combat the
threats facing the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Apart from helping Turkey to upgrade its F-4 and F-5 jet
fighters, Israel is also offering to upgrade Turkey's aging M-60
battle tanks and sell Turkey anti-tank missiles, the
air-to-ground Popeye missiles and the Galil assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
In January, naval vessels from Israel, Turkey and the United
States held a one-day joint exercises in the Mediterranean
Sea.

<HEADLINE> Haphazard Issuance of Driving Licences in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Haphazard issuance of
driving licences is one of the major reasons for the high rate of
traffic accident in Tanzania, the country's Travellers' Service
Association has said.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary of the association, Cyprian Mhina, told
reporters Thursday in Dar es Salaam that the driving skills of a
number motorists are questionable, but they have acquired driving
licences unscrupulously.
</P>
<P>
"Our research has revealed that about 90 percent of motorists
in Tanzania are holders of class "C" driving licence, which is
difficult to obtain.
</P>
<P>
The official said he is also alarmed by the fact that many
teenagers also hold such kind of driving licence.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the government to look into the matter and take
stringent measures to check the abnormal phenomenon and revise
procedures to control the "unnecessary and avoidable accidents."
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has recorded high rate of traffic accidents. In the
worst accident this year, 25 people were killed when a bus
overturned in the Coast Region on January 14.
</P>
<P>
The dangerous situation must be redressed, he said, otherwise
the country will see more and more ghastly accidents.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Mahina lashed out at the corrupt officials
who took bribery during driving qualification tests, saying they
should also be held responsible for the traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Mhina said his association is registering the number of
drivers across the country, which will help relevant authorities
to manage motorists in the future.
</P>
<P>
The registration, which started last June, is progressing well
in urban areas but at a snail's pace in the countryside because
of El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, they have been able to register about 100,000
drivers. But drivers in Dar es Salaam, with an estimated number
of 450,000, have yet to respond positively -- not more than 8,000
drivers have got registered with the association.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Opposes Use of Force Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Thursday formally
announced that it opposes the use of military force against Iraq
over weapons inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by the Minister of Information Bassem
Al-Sabaa after a regular cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the session, President Elias Hrawi
suggested that the government should express Lebanon's opposition
to any military solution to the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi pointed out that Arab countries are intensifying
contacts and consultations, including the visit to Iraq by Arab
League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid, in a bid to avoid a
new disaster falling on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But some diplomatic efforts are also being made in the Middle
East aimed at lobbying Arab countries' support to stage a military
strike on Iraq, he added.
</P>
<P>
Why must international resolutions about Iraq be complied with
and while others concerning Syria and Lebanon can be overlooked,
he asked, referring to Israel's refusal to implement the
U.N. resolutions to withdraw its occupying troops from Syria's
Golan Heights and South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Even though Lebanon and Iraq have no diplomatic ties, Lebanon
will stand with most of the Arab countries opposing the use of
force against Iraq, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Lebanon and Iraq began to sour in 1990 due to
Lebanon's opposition to Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The ties were
severed in 1994 when two Iraqi diplomats were involved in the
assassination of an Iraqi opposition leader in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reiterates Denial of Sexual Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday reasserted his innocence over allegations of sexual
impropriety made against him, saying the charges are "false."
</P>
<P>
During a photo session in the Oval Office at the start of a
visit by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Clinton said the
charges that he had an improper relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky, are "false."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the investigation by independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, Clinton said, "There is an ongoing investigation... for
four years we have been cooperating."
</P>
<P>
Starr's probe has been focusing on whether Clinton had a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky and then tried to pressure her into
lying about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
"The charges aren't true," Clinton said in response to
questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, during an exchange with journalists in Little Rock,
Arkansas, Starr reportedly said he was making significant progress
but was still pressing to get "all the truth" from key witnesses.

<HEADLINE> Britain Warns of Attack on Iraq If Diplomacy Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 5 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook Thursday warned that Iraq would face military strike if
it continued to turn a deaf ear to diplomatic initiatives seeking
to end the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Cook made the remark at a press conference here at the end of
his shuttle visit to Kuwait aimed at coordinating its stand on the
current Iraqi crisis with its Gulf allies. His visit also took him
to Saudi Arabia earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we exploring every possible diplomatic effort,
that is why we also apply every possible pressure on Saddam" to
comply with the U.N. resolutions, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
He said his country could not leave Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein possessing chemical and biological weapons and further
delaying the work of the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors have closed down Saddam's nuclear and long-range
missile programs and "what is now very important is to achieve the
same progress on the chemical and biological weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot turn a blind eye to Saddam Hussein, for he
obstructs and delays the work of U.N. inspectors," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain was taking part with the U.S. in making clear
that "the military option is still there and Saddam Hussein is
making a big mistake if he calculated that we would not use that
option."
</P>
<P>
He said Saddam Hussein "must take the responsibility of the
consequences of a military action" if he does not give a chance to
a diplomatic solution to resolve Iraq's standoff with the U.N.
Special Commission in charge of scrapping Iraqi mass destruction
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who was on his first visit to Kuwait since he took
office, visited Saudi Arabia and Kuwait amidst escalating pressure
on Saddam Hussein to respect the U.N. resolutions by allowing the
U.N. arms inspectors to enter all sites suspected of containing
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in the Gulf state Thursday afternoon, Cook
held talks with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah on the
Iraqi crisis, the regional stability and the Kuwaiti security.
</P>
<P>
Cook said "Britain is interested in the peace and stability of
the Gulf region and wishes to work closely with governments in
the Gulf in resolving this crisis."
</P>
<P>
He will leave Kuwait for home Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by Kuwaiti Information Ministry after
the conference, Kuwait said it supports the determined position
of the United Kingdom and its keenness on pressuring Iraq into
abiding by the U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Blair Stand Firm against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday
showed their determinations to force Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to back down from his stand on his refusal to allow
weapons inspectors's access to his presidential areas.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders will hold talks, mainly on the possibility of
military action against Iraq, once they decide that all the
diplomacy has been exhausted to resolve the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In the end, it is up to Saddam Hussein. It is not up to the
rest of us... I haven't talked to a single soul who hopes there
will be some sort of violent encounter here -- not a soul,"
Clinton said at an arrival ceremony for Blair's three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Blair took a similarly hard line against Saddam at the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"We want a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but the
success or failure of diplomacy rests on Saddam. If he fails to
respond then he knows that the threat of force is there and it
is real," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before starting his talks with Blair, Clinton said any
military attack on Iraq would not take Saddam as a target, which
was in fact a response to Congress leaders who on Wednesday
urged to remove the Iraqi president by the use of force.
</P>
<P>
To remove Saddam from power "is not what the United Nations
has authorized us to do; that is not what our immediate interest
is about," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Our interest is in preventing Saddam Hussein from building
biological, chemical, nuclear weapons capability and the
missiles to deliver such weapons," he said.

<HEADLINE> Blair Asks U.S. to Help End IRA Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair today appealed to U.S. lawmakers to help stop violence by
the Irish Republican Army (IRA) if it fails to win its stated
demands at current peace talks in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Meeting some 20 senators and House representatives for
breakfast on the second-day visit to Washington, Blair said he
hoped to win over the powerful Irish-American lobby to his peace
strategy.
</P>
<P>
"We need your continuing help," said Blair in addressing the
lawmakers. If a settlement was achieved this would be "only the
beginning" and U.S. help would be vital in ensuring there were
real dividends from peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister, who had stated his nation's support
to the U.S. position for military action to force Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to comply with U.N. resolutions, also expressed
gratitude for the support of U.S. President Bill Clinton in his
peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Blair said: "We have succeeded in bringing Sinn Fein (political
wing of IRA) into the process, despite the obvious difficulties
this poses for us after long years of IRA terrorism, and clearly,
this was an important step."
</P>
<P>
He said, "I remain determined to keep the talks inclusive, and
to turn the men of violence once and for all onto the path of
democratic politics. This means that any return to violence cannot
and will not be countenanced."
</P>
<P>
"We must all make clear that violence can never be an answer in
Northern Ireland," Blair added.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister said his remarks applied to
everybody in Northern Ireland, but the Reuters news agency said
"it was clear he was particularly eager to ensure that the IRA
would find no more sympathy in Washington if it ended its current
cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
"This is one area where your help is essential," Blair told the
U.S. lawmakers. "You have excellent contacts, which I hope you
will use. I hope too these contacts will continue to be with both
sides."
</P>
<P>
The IRA's current cease-fire, which began last summer, allowed
Sinn Fein to join the Belfast talks when they began in September.
</P>
<P>
Blair's talks with U.S. leaders will also cover a number of
other issues, including Iraqi crisis, Mideast peace process, Nato
expansion, military deployment in Bosnia, Asian financial crisis
as well as relations between the European Union and the United
States.

<HEADLINE> White House Spokesman Criticizes Media Scandal Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- White House press secretary
said on Thursday that the rush by the news media to deliver
exclusive reports on the White House sex scandal has led to
erroneous stories.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry, referring to a Wall Street
Journal report which was posted on its Internet site on Wednesday
and later softened, said, "We went through one of the sorriest
episodes of journalism yesterday that I have ever witnessed."
</P>
<P>
"We had a daily newspaper reporting hour-by-hour, not giving
the White House any chance to assemble any facts and respond," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If that's where we're marching off to, we're in a world of
hurt," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper first reported that a White House steward told a
federal grand jury he saw Clinton and former intern Monica
Lewinsky alone together in a private study adjoining the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
After the lawyer for the steward, Bayani Nelvis, denied the
report the Journal revised the story on its Web site to say that
Nelvis described the incident to "Secret Service personnel" rather
than to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Paul Steiger, managing editor of the Journal, reportedly said
in a statement released by his New York office that his newspaper
went with its story "when we felt it was ready."
</P>
<P>
"We did not wait for a response from the White House because
the White House had made it clear repeatedly over the past two
weeks, in public and private, that they were not going to respond
to any questions or provide any information on any aspect of this
case," Steiger said.
</P>
<P>
"We stand by our account of what Mr. Nelvis told the Secret
Service," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has repeatedly denied allegations that he engaged in a
sexual relationship with Lewinsky and then asked her to lie about
it.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The electricity consumption in
Asia-Pacific area is projected to be 11 percent lower in 2020 than
expected due to the recent economic turmoil and electricity
tariffs imposed by the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Asia/Pacific Energy Outlook", a research paper said:
"As a result of both the currency crisis and economic slowdown,
many Southeast Asian countries have postponed power projects."
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, for example, 13 private power projects have been
postponed. In Malaysia, the 2400 MW Bakun hydroelectric project
has been shelved because of the increasing ringgit cost.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, as a result of the currency crisis, the PPAs of
the seven private power awards have been re-negotiated, according
to the paper by Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI.
</P>
<P>
DRI's forecast reflects the changing expectations concerning
capacity needs. Total installed capacity in Asia is forecast to
rise from 740 GW to 2002 GW by 2020 compared with 2265 GW forecast
last year.
</P>
<P>
Because of the Asian economic crisis, DRI expects capacity
additions to be 12 percent lower in 2020 than in last year's
forecast.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 9 in Colombo Bomb Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- At least nine people, including
a suicide bomber, have been killed in a bomb explosion in the
center of Colombo Friday afternoon, Military Spokesman Ink Dewage
said Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead were two women soldiers, three airmen, the woman
suicide bomber, her driver and the other two men aboard the van of
the bomber, Dewage said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
He said two other airmen and five civilians who were in the
vicinity of the explosion were injured and they were promptly
evacuated to the General Hospital in Colombo for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman confirmed that the incident took place when
security forces in the Downtown area stopped the van for routine
check at around 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place near an air force camp which is only a
few blocks away from Galadari Hotel and Hilton Hotel, which
sustained serious damage when a massive truck-bomb went off last
October.
</P>
<P>
Dewage said the woman suicide bomber was believed to be a
member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which has
been fighting  for more than a decade for a separate Tamil state
in the east and north of the country.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the incident, police sealed off the scene and began
investigations.
</P>
<P>
The blast took place only two days after the country celebrated
the 50th Independence Day on Wednesday, on which President
Chandrika Kumaratunga vowed to do everything to end terrorism and
war in her country.
</P>
<P>
The explosion is believed to be an act of the LTTE to mar the
Golden Jubilee Day celebrations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Prince Charles, who was here to attend the
celebrations, left the country only a few hours before the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
On January 25, members of the LTTE detonated a massive truck
bomb near the holiest Buddhist shrine of the Sri Lankan people,
the Tooth Relic Temple in Kandy, killing at least 17 people and
damaging the temple. The celebrations had been originally
scheduled to be held in the central mountain city, some 115
kilometers east of Colombo.

<HEADLINE> France Proposes Allowing Iraq to Import Oil Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- France has proposed that Iraq be
allowed to import oil equipment to increase and improve its oil
output, said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"France has presented a draft resolution and discussions are
under way (at the U.N. Security Council)," she said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal serves part of the drafted enlargement of the "Oil
for Food" program with Iraq, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has accepted an
earlier French proposal that Iraq be allowed to increase its oil
export from 2 billion dollars to 5.2 billion dollars for every six
months so that it can buy more daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq, which has been under a sanction for its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, is incapable of exporting so much oil now, said
some oil experts.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-U.N. "Oil for Food" agreement is the sole exception
to the U.N.-imposed embargo.

BAGHDAD, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Arab
League (AL) Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid left Baghdad Friday, ending a
visit aimed at mediating a peaceful solution to the crisis of arms
inspection between Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the AL said Abdel-Meguid told Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein during their meetings that the Arab states have
unanimously rejected U.S. threats to use force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief said that the Arab states are keen on seeking a
political settlement of the crisis, which will safeguard Iraq's
sovereignty, dignity and security.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge
of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction from searching
presidential palaces suspected of hiding the banned weapons,
triggering its stand-off with the Untied States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to take military actions to force Iraq
to grant free access to the UNSCOM if diplomacy fails to exact
Iraq's full compliance with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid expressed his readiness to participate in the
efforts to find a political solution to the stand-off through
coordinating with concerned Arab and international parties.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Abdel-Meguid also exchanged views with
France's presidential special envoy Bertrand Dufourcq on possible
solutions to the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
They both agreed on the necessity to attain a compromise
settlement to end the crisis through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Abdel-Meguid, who arrived in Baghdad Wednesday, is
the first ever by an Arab League chief since the end of the 1991
Gulf War which drove Iraq out of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> EU, Australia Sign Agreement to Boost Bilateral Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Australia and the European
Union have completed their negotiations on a mutual recognition
agreement on conformity assessment of products in a bid to boost
bilateral trade, said a statement issued by the EU on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, and Australian Minister for
Industry, Science and Tourism, John Moore, made the announcement
in Brussels on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is aimed at facilitating trade by allowing
conformity assessment -- testing and certification -- of products
traded between the two sides to be taken in the exporting country
rather than to be carried out at destination.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement will provide a significant boost to two-way
trade. It will also open up markets to manufacturers for whom
regulatory costs have previously made exporting uneconomic," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Brittan pointed out that this was an important step to enhance
bilateral trade relations.
</P>
<P>
It will deliver significant benefits to European industry,
affecting some 4.5 billion ECUs (some 4.8 billion U.S. dollars) of
bilateral trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moore said the fact that Australia has been able to conclude
such an agreement was a testimony to the high quality of the
Australian standards and conformance infrastructure and its
world-class reputation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement covers regulated sectors such as simple pressure
equipment, machinery, low-voltage electrical equipment and medical
devices, telecommunications terminal equipment and electromagnetic
compatibility.

<HEADLINE> Coal Use Blamed for Shanghai Air Quality Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Air quality in Shanghai, the
busiest commercial city in east China, deteriorated in 1997 as a
result of increased coal consumption.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released recently by the city environment
monitoring center, the average concentration of suspended
particles and dust in the air dropped compared with 1996, but the
density of sulphur dioxide was up 15.3 percent and nitrogen oxide
by 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Air quality experts said coal use was responsible for the
worsening air pollution. Last year Shanghai burned 40 million tons
of coal, or 60 percent more than 1990.
</P>
<P>
The report said water quality remained basically stable, but
that phosphorus pollutants were on the rise. The city gained some
improvement in noise control, with relevant indicators lower than
1996.
</P>
<P>
To improve air quality, Shanghai is readjusting its energy
structures by scaling down on coal use. Environmental officials
said the Donghai oil and gas fields will provide Shanghai with a
daily natural gas supply of 400,000 cubic meters by the end of
this year and the amount will increase to 1.2 million cubic meters
in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Prominent Skilled Workers Awarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A cook reputed as "the world's
best chef", a locomotive driver with no accident record in his
20-plus-year career, and eight other workers received here today
the country's top award for skilled workers--the China Grand Prize
for Professional Skills.
</P>
<P>
The ten award winners were also given a chance to meet Premier
Li Peng in Zhongnanhai, China's central government compound,
before vice premier Wu Bangguo bestowed each of them with a medal
made of 50 grams of pure gold. The medal was engraved with an
inscription from President Jiang Zemin: "National Model Skilled
Worker".
</P>
<P>
Apart from the ten, 101 other skilled workers selected from
China's over 100 million urban workers in various sectors were
also honored "National Model Skilled Workers" today.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly aware of the importance of technological
advancement and competent workers in economic development, the
Chinese government set up a national system in 1995 to discover
and honor the country's skilled workers doing an outstanding job.
</P>
<P>
The system requires the Ministry of Labor, along with 46
central government ministries and commission, and 31 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities, to search across the
country once a year for "National Model Skilled Workers", the top
ten of whom will become winners of the China Grand Prize for
Professional Skills.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the ministry has honored 308
national model skilled workers and granted the grand prize to 30
most prominent workers.
</P>
<P>
The 30 prize winners come from 21 provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities across the country, and are engaged in 25
different industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
"They all deserve the grand prize for their skills which
represent the highest level in their own sectors," commented Wang
Xizhan, an official with the department of professional skills
under the labor ministry.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Renliang, a cook from Shanghai, was reported to be honored
in April 1996 "the world's best chef" by a service-appraisal
society in the US, and later engaged as senior tutor by a noted
culinary school in France.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Junqing, a locomotive driver from central China's Henan
Province, has reportedly been operating his train safely for 26
years, traveling over 1.4 million kilometers without any liability
accident.
</P>
<P>
An official with the labor ministry noted that though China has
a huge labor resource, the general quality of the country's
workers lags far behind that of the developed nations.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years in particular, with the retirement of the
older generation of skilled workers, China has been in a severe
shortage of competent workers," he added.
</P>
<P>
Workers with senior technical titles only account for 3.5
percent of China's skilled workers, while the general level in
developed countries is 20 to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Before 2000, China will stick to the current system and try to
honor all prominent skilled workers in all sectors, to promote the
improvement of its labor quality," said Lin Yongsan, vice minister
of labor.

<HEADLINE> Police Bugging Law Approved in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Germany's upper house of
parliament, the Bundesrat, on Friday adopted a law allowing the
German police to bug criminal suspects in combating the rising
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The bill, worked out by the ruling party and the main
opposition Social Democrats (SPD) earlier last month, was passed
by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, on January 16.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, judges can approve the police to install
listening devices in the homes of the suspects of serious crimes
and the people who might commit serious crimes such as terrorism
against the public.
</P>
<P>
But the police will be barred from bugging the conversations of
criminal suspects with religious figures, their lawyers and
members of parliament. The use of the information bugged from
doctors and lawyers will also be limited.
</P>
<P>
As part of a deal for supporting the law, the government had
agreed with SPD to negotiate a complete ban on bugging journalists
and doctors.
</P>
<P>
The issue of police bugging had been debated in Germany for
years and such a need became more acute only in the 1990s as a
result of increased organized and violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
The latest available data show that violent crimes in Germany
increased 5.5 percent in 1996. The number of criminal cases
involving the use of firearms rose to 13,479 in 1996 from 12,855
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther told the Bundesrat Friday
that 600 to 700 organized criminal groups with up to 8,000 members
are active in the country.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Neighbors Not to Allow Military Strike: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of Iran's
Constitutional Guardian Council Ayatollah Ali Jannati warned here
Friday that Iraq's neighbors would not allow any military strike
on Baghdad, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayers congregations, Jannati
criticized the behavior of the U.S. government toward Baghdad
and the U.S. handling of the issue of the U.N. arms inspections
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The people of the world are denied peaceful life because the
U.S. Administration is mischievous and too conceited," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jannati also urged the Iraqi government to do better to comply
with U.N. Security Council resolutions "so that the rogue
super-powers would not be able to exploit the situation."
</P>
<P>
Following the escalation of the tension between Iraq and the
U.S. over the U.N. arms inspection in Iraq, the Iranian
government expressed great concern over the situation, calling on
the international community and regional countries to use their
influences to avoid any possible military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Tehran said that any military operations against Iraq would
only create new tension in the region and worsen the situation,
stressing that diplomatic efforts should continue to find a
political resolution to the stand-off between Iraq and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi strongly condemned the threatening statements by some
countries to use strategic nuclear weapons against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said "such statements are against the whole region and none
of the regional countries will remain indifference to such
ill-considered statements."

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Opposes Tokyo's Plan for U.S. Military Heliport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Okinawa Prefecture
Governor Masahide Ota on Friday rejected the central government's
proposal to build an offshore heliport for U.S. military forces.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Haha, capital of Okinawa, Ota stressed
that the residents of Nago, the proposed site of the heliport,
voted overwhelmingly against the project in a non-binding
referendum held last December.
</P>
<P>
The governor even expressed his opposition to U.S. military
presence in Japan, adding that if the heliport plan was permitted,
it meant to allow the United States to establish its military
bases on Japan's territory.
</P>
<P>
The issue of U.S. stationing in Okinawa hit the central
government after anger erupted among the prefecture's residents in
1995 over the rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl by three
U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a floating heliport was proposed, however, in
exchange for returning to Japanese jurisdiction the land that now
houses the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Ginowan.
</P>
<P>
With Ota's opposition to the heliport project made clear,
Japanese Prime Minister Ryuaro Hashimoto expressed his regret on
the same day that the return of the air base will be frozen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka
threatened to cancell a development scheme for the island
prefecture in retaliation for Ota's tough stance on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Two Okinawa-related panels of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) have decided not to carry out the planned revision of
the Okinawa promotion and development law, which is aimed at
creating a special free trade zone and easing taxes on businesses.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa accounts for less than one percent of Japan's total
land area, but contains about 75 percent of the land used by
U.S. military facilities in Japan.

<P>
TAIYUAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Two suspects have been arrested
and 33 others detained for their involvement in the poisonous
alcohol case in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
According to local police, an illegal wine-maker in Wenshui
County produced the fatal drinks by mixing 2,400 kilograms of
methanol with 24,000 kilograms of alcohol and sold the mixture.
</P>
<P>
The buyer then mixed the dangerous drinks with other additives
and wholesaled it to private shops in Shuozhou and Datong cities.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 222 people were hospitalized from drinking the
mixture; 27 people have died, while 171 have been discharged from
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the State Bureau for Technical
Supervision has ordered its local branches to take emergency
measures to prevent the spread of the fatal drinks.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities in some northern and northeastern provinces
have begun to check on any suspicious alcoholic drinks from
Shanxi. People have been advised not to drink bulk or bottled
alcohol with the label of "Zhongxing Brewery, Xinghua Village,

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Labor Leaders Accept Layoffs for More Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korean labor leaders agreed
Friday to legalize layoffs in return for more labor freedom after
three weeks of tough talks with employers.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached at a tripartite meeting of labor,
management and political figures, companies will be allowed to lay
off workers only when they face "emergency situations" such as
financial trouble, mergers or acquisition.
</P>
<P>
However, employers have to give a 60-day notice before they
dismiss workers, and they are also required to re-hire the
dismissed workers if their business improves.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions will be given the right to participate in
political activities in the first half of this year. Teachers will
be allowed to form unions from July 1999, while public officials
will be permitted to set up a "consultative body" as from early
next year.
</P>
<P>
The employment stabilization fund, which will be established
with the contributions from conglomerates, government and workers,
will be expanded by 5 trillion won (about 3.4 billion
U.S. dollars), 600 million won (about 2.7 million dollars) up from
the government's original proposal.
</P>
<P>
The agreement paves the way for the National Assembly
(parliament) to legalize a layoff bill, one of the key conditions
imposed by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for its 57
billion-dollar bailout package for South Korea, at its ongoing
special session.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that some 1 million people will lose their
jobs when the layoff bill is passed this month.
</P>
<P>
Han Kwang-ok, a senior aide to President-elect Kim Dae-jung,
chaired the three-way panel on layoffs. He said the agreement will
help bring the nation out of the economic crisis triggered by the
failure of some conglomerates and bad loans of financial
institutions late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean cabinet endorsed the proposed bill and other
labor reform measures later in the day and submitted them to the
assembly for consideration.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Christian Leader on Three-Self Patriotic Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Deng Fucun, vice chairman
and secretary-general of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement
Committee of the Protestant Churches of China, said Friday that
the aim of the movement is to make all Chinese Christians
patriotic citizens.
</P>
<P>
He said the three-self principles -- self-administration,
self-support and self-propagation -- have led to the increase of
the number of Chinese Christians from 700,000 in 1949 when the
People's Republic of China was founded to the current more than 10
million.
</P>
<P>
Deng made the remarks here at a seminar held at the Center for
Strategic International Studies.
</P>
<P>
Invited to talk about the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, Deng
said, it was unfortunate that Protestantism's introduction to
China last century coincided with the colonization process of the
nation by the Western powers; some missionaries played a
dishonorable role in it.
</P>
<P>
As a result, from the very beginning, Protestantism was deemed
an "alien religion" and not accepted by the Chinese public. During
the long period afterwards, a saying remained popular: "More
Christians, fewer Chinese" to mean that when a Chinese was
converted to Christianity, he would become an "alien" who bullied
his fellow Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In the 140-plus years prior to the founding of the People's
Republic of China in 1949, tens of thousands of missionaries were
sent to China by almost all Western nations at great
cost. However, only 700,000 Chinese became Christians because the
faith smacked of alienness and churches were run not by the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The founding of the People's Republic of China put an end to
the colonial rule by Western countries. Christianity in China
faced a practical choice: either remain an "alien religion"
rejected by the Chinese, or shed off its image by letting the
Chinese Christians organize independently churches acceptable to
the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Deng stressed that if a Chinese Christian wants to disseminate
the gospel, he should first be a good citizen of China. The
three-self principles are aimed at making Chinese Christians good
citizens. That is the main reason for the launch of the movement
by the church.
</P>
<P>
Deng said the the three-self patriotic movement has paid off in
the past 40 years, with Christianity no longer considered an
"alien religion" and the number of Chinese Christians increase by
more than 12 times.

<HEADLINE> No Survivors Found at Philippine Crash Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Hopes for survivors are dimming
as rescuers on Friday picked up more mangled and decapitated
bodies at the crash site of a DC-9 plane on a southern Philippine
ridge.
</P>
<P>
Earlier television reports said about 46 dismembered bodies had
been retrieved by rescuers as of noon Friday at the crash site on
Mt. Sumagaya on the southern island of Mindanao. But so far, there
has been no official report on the number of recovered bodies.
</P>
<P>
Jesus Dureza, a leader of the rescue operation, told reporters
late in the afternoon that a total of seven cadavers of body parts
had been transported from the mountain to Cagayan de Oro City for
forensic examination.
</P>
<P>
He said it is very difficult to count the number of bodies and
identify them since most bodies are mangled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the airlift of the body bags from the crash
site to Cagayan de Oro has been hampered as helicopters can not
land at the area due to gusty winds, thick clouds and fog.
</P>
<P>
There is still no word from rescuers combing the crash site on
any survivors of the 104 people aboard the ill-fated Cebu Pacific
Flight 387, which crashed Monday into Mt. Sumagaya on its way to
Cagayan de Oro from Manila.
</P>
<P>
Rescue officials said earlier that it was a "remote
possibility" that any one could survive the air disaster, the
worst ever in Philippine history.
</P>
<P>
Government doctors who were sent to villages near the crash
site echoed the sentiment, saying that if there were any
survivors, they would have already died.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams reached the impact point of the plane Friday
afternoon and found the wings, tail and two engines of the doomed
jetliner. But the "black box," the flight data recorder that will
pinpoint the cause of the accident, has not been recovered.
</P>
<P>
Rescue officials said it would take at least two months to
clear the crash site, an area of one square kilometer, and another
six months to undergo the painful procedure of identifying the
remains of crash victims.

<HEADLINE> Island Province Attracting Foreign, Domestic Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- China's largest special economic
zone of Hainan is reporting good results in using foreign and
domestic investment to develop its local economy.
</P>
<P>
The island province has used 7.5 billion U.S. dollars of
overseas investment during the past decade since it was
established as a province, as well as 50 billion yuan of domestic
capital, accounting for 70 percent of its total investment in
fixed assets, involving more than 10,000 joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Hainan utilized 710 million U.S. dollars of overseas
investment in real terms, with foreign-backed businesses providing
100 million U.S. dollars worth of exports, up 30
percent. Meanwhile, domestic investment amounted to 3 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province approved 220 foreign-backed enterprises last year,
with 49 percent of them in primary industry and 42 percent in
secondary industry, considered a more rational proportion for the
province's industrial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Some large groups began to show interest in the province, said
a government official, adding that Hainan plans to invite
investments of 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, 750 million of
which will be direct foreign investment.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Republican Congressional leaders demanded that the Clinton
Administration provide more clearly defined objectives for managing
and concluding the confrontation with Iraq. The Pentagon sent
reinforcements to the Persian Gulf. The chief weapons inspector
for the U.N., Richard Butler, told the Security Council that the
proposal floated by Iraq were not good enough.
</P>
<P>
-- The independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, said he would not
consider granting immunity to Ms. Lewinsky unless she submitted to
face-to-face questioning with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- A gunman waiting in ambush in the lobby of Washington

local boxer Reuben Bell, and wounding five others.
</P>
<P>

<P>

House from spending any money from the proposed 368.5 billion
dollar tobacco settlement on new programs, as Clinton's fiscal

specifics on Clinton's support for limiting tobacco firms'
liability.
</P>
<P>
-- Federal Reserve officials, with substantial internal
disagreement, abandoned their tilt toward higher interest rates in
December and signaled instead that they might cut interest rates
if the turmoil in Asia was to intensify.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Enacts Law on Foreign Troop Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia on Friday published
its first law which will govern the stationing in and passing
through its territory of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law adopted by the Great Hural (parliament) on
January 8, Mongolia may invite foreign troops to station in its
territory if the country is under foreign armed aggression or is
in a de facto state of such aggression.
</P>
<P>
Foreign troops may also be deployed in Mongolia if the United
Nations Security Council has passed a resolution authorizing the
use of the U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia will allow foreign troops to pass through its
territory or airspace if it believes that foreign governments'
request for such a permission does not infringe its security
interests.
</P>
<P>
However, Mongolia will not allow the troops of any of the
warring parties to station in or pass through its territory if the
warring parties have not constituted a threat to the national
independence and sovereignty of the country.
</P>
<P>
Although the troops of the former Soviet Union had been
stationed in Mongolia for a long time, there has been no law to
govern such deployment.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian officials explained that the adoption of the new law
does not mean that the country will soon invite foreign troops in
or allow itself to become a military base of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is just one of the basic laws of the country," they said.

<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad met with Philippine President Fidel Ramos Friday
night to discuss ways to ease the current financial crisis
affecting the region.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two leaders exchanged views on a
Manila-proposed intra-Southeast Asian trade mechanism under which
local currencies will be used in regional trading to reduce
dependence on the U.S. dollar, the official Philippine TV
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who arrived here in the afternoon for an overnight
visit, also reviewed the results of the ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) leaders' informal summit last December.
</P>
<P>
No official statement was made on their talks which were not
open to reporters. Mahathir will leave Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand have been reported to be
nearing agreement on the Manila-proposed trading mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon said
earlier that discussions on the proposed system have been under
way among ASEAN countries both by their governments and private
business sectors.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Private Sector Debts Reach US$73 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's private sector had
borrowed a total of 73.962 billion U.S. dollars from abroad by the
end of December 1997, a official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Radius Prawiro, head of the Steering Committee on Indonesia's
Private Sector Debts, said the country's total foreign debts have
reached 137.424 billion dollars, including 63.426 billion dollars
owed by the government.
</P>
<P>
The private sector's foreign debts are broken down into bank
loans (62.057 billion dollars) and commercial papers (11.905
billion dollars), Radius said after a meeting of the Economic and
Monetary Resilience Council led by President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"People should know that Indonesia's private sector debts have
broadly reached 73 billion U.S. dollars, which is not as big as we
previously thought," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the size of mature private sector loans, Radius
said, "I can't say it, it is confidential."
</P>
<P>
Radius recently went to Japan to meet with Indonesia's Japanese
creditors.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, two groups were formed to handle the debt
problem -- a steering committee consisting of Japanese creditors
and a contact committee comprising Indonesian debtors.
</P>
<P>
"Japan has agreed to assign Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi and Sanwa
Bank (to be included in the steering committee of creditors),"
Radius said, adding that the government has been approaching banks
in Europe about joining the steering committee of creditors.
</P>
<P>
Economists here hold that private sector debts were a main
cause of the depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah against the
U.S. dollar. The rupiah has dropped from 2,400 per dollar early
July last year to the present 10,000 a dollar.
</P>
<P>
Radius said his committee has also discussed the debt problem
with the World Bank affiliate, International Finance Corp., which
has provided loans to 42 companies in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Australia to Strengthen Commercial Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Australian Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer expressed the hope here on Friday that
his visit to Pakistan would enhance the bilateral relationship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have a pretty big trade relationship. Australian
businessmen have invested around 250 million dollars in Pakistan
and the potential for Australian investment in Pakistan is very
good," Downer told reporters upon his arrival at the Islamabad
airport Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Pakistan, Downer is scheduled to meet with
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and
other high officials.
</P>
<P>
Referring to an investment promotion and protection agreement
Pakistan and Australia will sign during his visit, Downer said, "I
think that would encourage Australian businessmen to invest in
this country."
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Siddique Kanju, who
greeted Downer at the airport, described Australia as a very
important country, saying the two countries enjoy excellent
relations in economic and political fields.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that the visit of the Australian foreign minister,
who brings in a lot of experience, will contribute significantly
to strengthening the economic and political relations between our
two countries," Kanju said.

<HEADLINE> Visitor Arrivals in HK Expected to Rise in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The total number of visitor
arrivals in Hong Kong in 1998 is expected to rise, in contrast to
the overall fall last year, a leading official of the Hong Kong
Tourist Association (HKTA) says.
</P>
<P>
Amy Chan, executive director of the HKTA, forecast an overall
increase of about two percent in the arrivals this year to reach
10.6 million, when commenting on the year-end results of the local
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The total number of visitor arrivals and tourism receipts for
1997 showed a drop of 11.1 percent and 14.7 percent respectively,
compared to the record year of 1996, according to HKTA figures.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals for the whole of 1997 were 10.4 million, which, while
down on the bumper year of 1996, were still higher than the 10.2
million for 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Americas were the only major market region to register an
increase in total arrivals, up by 7.3 percent to over one million.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Asian region, comprising Japan and South Korea,
showed the heaviest fall in 1997, with arrivals down by 37.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The tourism receipts dropped in line with the arrivals. Total
receipts stood at 72.1 billion HK dollars (9.24 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Other reasons for the decline include the currency depreciation
in Asia and a shortened length of stay by visitors (down three
percent to an average of 3.59 nights). There was also a moderate
drop in per capita spending of 4.6 percent to an average of 6,722
HK dollars (862 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
China's mainland was the largest contributor to visitors
spending receipts, accounting for 22.3 percent of the total,
followed by Taiwan, North Asia, South And Southeast Asia, Europe,
Africa and the Middle East, the Americas, Australia and New
Zealand and the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
China's mainland registered an increase of 3.1 percent in per
capita spending.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA's new marketing campaign is designed to ensure Hong
Kong will be uppermost in travelers' minds so that it can be well
positioned for the business rebound, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA expects that most markets, excepts for North Asia due
to the expectedly continued economic turmoil to depress outbound
travel, will begin to show an increase in arrivals by the end of
this year. It is looking to the Americas, China's mainland and
Taiwan to perform even better.

<HEADLINE> Kim Dae-jung Firm in Restructuring Conglomerates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President-elect Kim
Dae-jung reaffirmed Friday his determination to restructure the
country's conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
"The new administration will not let the conglomerate
restructuring program fizzle out. The five-point accord reached
between me and business leaders last month should be implemented
without fail," Kim told the bosses of the nation's 30 largest
conglomerates at a luncheon.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who will be sworn in as president late this month, urged
the bosses to change their business practices to enhance
international competitiveness of South Korean businesses. He
promised that his government will give full legislative and
financial support to them.
</P>
<P>
Kim's renewed call for corporate restructuring came hours after
union leaders agreed to give employers the power to lay off
workers, ending a three-week long tough negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Kim said he will also protect the rights and interests of the
workers as much as he could.
</P>
<P>
The business leaders pledged to implement restructuring
measures they agreed early last month.
</P>
<P>
"We will change our business practices by holding general
meetings of shareholders soon and try to honor the agreement,''
said a statement issued by the business leaders after the luncheon.
</P>
<P>
Last month, most of conglomerate heads agreed to introduce
consolidated financial accounting and abolish the practice of
inter-subsidiary debt guarantees.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy in the world, has
been in serious financial crisis caused by the collapse of some
conglomerates and bad loans of financial institutions late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached with the International Monetary Fund
last December for a bailout loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars, South
Korea has to restructure its ailing economy and completely open
its financial market.

and General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China, has express deep concern for those who fell ill
and died from drinking unlawfully made alcohol in north China's
Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
During the Spring Festival, more than 20 people died and
hundreds were hospitalized in Shuozhou after drinking the
poisonous alcoholic beverages that were illegally produced in
Wenshui County of Shanxi.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Criticizes U.S. Report on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Friday criticized the United States for its recent report on human
rights in a number of developing countries like Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"It is inconceivable that the United States feels privileged to
continue to systematically target a number of developing countries
like Indonesia as the violator of the human rights of their own
people," the Foreign Ministry said in a press release issued here
concerning a report by the U.S. State Department on human rights.
</P>
<P>
It charged that the United States does not only arrogate to
itself the right to patronize and pass judgment on another group
of countries which enjoy full right to an equal status, but it
also resorts to a false prism which is solely based on its own
experience when it seeks to judge situations completely different
from those affecting its own society.
</P>
<P>
The ministry described the report as reflecting an imbalanced
and biased view on the human rights situation in Indonesia,
containing misperceptions regarding the policies of the Indonesian
government and its conducts and being replete with inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the protection, promotion and safeguarding of
human rights in Indonesia is and has always been a constitutional
imperative. "The very purpose of our national development is to
uplift the human dignity and integrity of all Indonesian
citizens."
</P>
<P>
The government of Indonesia, it said, also considers stability
to be critical to the continued political, social and economic
development of the country. The government will do everything
required to protect the freedom of all Indonesians and ensure that
there is an environment that enables all citizens to exercise
those rights.
</P>
<P>
Publication of imbalanced and self-righteous reports containing
inaccuracies, baseless accusations and heresies such as the State
Department's report will only hamper efforts to promote and
protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, it said.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Government Decides to Begin Total Nuclear Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish government
formally decided Thursday to close the first of its 12 nuclear
power reactors, Barsebaeck 1 in southern Sweden by July 1.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in accordance with the result of a 1980
referendum, in which Swedes voted in favor of a total nuclear
phase-out by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The decision triggered protests from opposition political
parties as well as Swedish electricity company Sydcraft, the
private owner of Barsebaeck 1 and Germany's Preussen Electra, the
main owner of Sydcraft.
</P>
<P>
"It will probably cost the state treasury at least 10 billion
Swedish kronor (1.25 billion U.S. dollars) at a time when health
care and the schools are crying out for more money," Liberal
Party criticized the decision by the Social Democratic government
in a comment.
</P>
<P>
Sydcraft holds that the government should start the nuclear ban
program with the state-owned power company Vattenfall.
</P>
<P>
The electricity supplied by all of Sweden's nuclear reactors
currently account for more than half of the country's power.

<HEADLINE> China Specialists Refute U.S. Human Rights Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu Muzhi, president of the China Society for Human Rights
Studies, said that although the report admitted that China has
made some progress in human rights, some of its content ignores
facts and justice.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the country's greatest achievement in human rights has
been China's success in providing adequate food and clothing for
its 1.2 billion people and in helping more than 50 million people
rise above the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the U.S. report denies the achievement as
progress in China's human rights, instead attributing that to a
condition for maintaining power by the Chinese Communist Party
(CPC). The report also states that 350 million Chinese people are
living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the report only appears to take a fair stand in
its attacks on China.
</P>
<P>
For example, the report depicts China's jails as terrible
hells, he said. But the report also notes that when a delegation
of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention visited
jails in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Xi'an, members of the
delegation were allowed to talk with prisoners without the
presence of a Chinese official, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Some charges in the report that are applied to China also could
be applied to the United States, Zhu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Nairobi Fly, a poisonous
insect, has invaded Kampala, a Chinese doctor confirmed here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
John Ekudu, the dean of Makerere University, reported to the
vector control division of the university and took samples of the
insect to the division. The division called the insect as
Nairobi Eye beetles.
</P>
<P>
The insect is described as a tiny red beetle with short
hard-wings. It spends most of the day time on the walls and
ceilings and is attracted at night to light.
</P>
<P>
The insect never bites nor stings but releases a poisonous
substance on human body that causes painful ugly swelling or tiny
blisters and sores on the skin. The victims' eyes may also swell
and discharge yellowish liquid.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jianhua, a doctor in Shanxi Hospital in the city, told
Xinhua that they treated quite several such cases since
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Liu and other local medical staff said they have no ready cure
to the poison and they treated the patients with antibiotics and
drugs reducing the swellings.
</P>
<P>
There were no serious cases threatening the life of the
patients, and the victims generally recover within two weeks, Liu
added.

China is actively discussing ways to ease the crisis with all
relevant countries. Chinese vice-foreign ministers Li Zhaoxing and
Zhang Deguang, and Assistant Foreign Minister Ji Peiding, met
respectively with Russian Vice-Foreign Minister Grigori Karasin,
British Ambassador to China Anthony Charles Galsworthy and Saudi
Arabian Ambassador to China Al Madani.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side stressed that the current situation is rapidly
deteriorating and the crisis can only be solved through dialog and
cooperation, with a solution requiring all parties to exercise
wisdom and flexibility. The use of force or threat to use force
will only intensify contradictions rather than help to solve the
problems.
</P>
<P>
China maintains that Iraq should earnestly and comprehensively
implement all relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and should
fully cooperate with the UN by fulfiling its obligation to destroy
all weapons of mass destruction. Based on Iraq's implementation of
resolutions, the Security Council should gradually relax and
remove sanctions. China sincerly hopes that the United Nations
Special Commission will continue to engage in discussions and
dialog with Iraq in order to find a proper settlement which will
lead to the implementation of its work in line with Security
Council authorization. Related efforts should fully respect Iraq's
sovereignty and dignity and its concerns about security.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to France Cai Fangbo told French leaders
that China is deeply concerned about the escalating situation
resulting from disputes over weapons inspections. And since early
this year, China has sent three experts to participate in the work
of inspection and will also send experts to attend the weapons
inspection appraisal meeting to be held in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At present, the crisis in weapons insections is still in
escalation, and China will continue to play an active role in
seeking a peaceful settlement to the crisis, the article said.

LUANDA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Central African Economic
Community (CEEAC) is to resume operation after four years of
silence and becomes a tool in preserving regional stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
Franca Van-Dunem, the Angolan Prime Minister said here Friday
before his trip to Libreville, capital of Gabon, for the CEEAC
summit that the summit would see the regional organization
working. Van-Dunem attends the summit on behalf of Angolan
President Dos Santos,.
</P>
<P>
On the one-day meeting, Van-Dunem said a plan to revitalize
CEEAC will be mapped out so to make the regional organization
serve its original function.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the summit will also work out a budget for the
organization so that it could start working within this year.
</P>
<P>
The idea to re-start the organization was brought forward by
Angolan President Dos Santos on the four-sided meeting between
Gabon, Congo (K), Congo (B) and Angola in October last year.
</P>
<P>
CEEAC was established in October 1983 in Libreville. It was
made up by 11 countries such as Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Congo
(B), Gabon, Cameroun, Rwanda, Sao Tome &AMP; Principe, Congo (K),
Chad, the Central African Republic and Angola.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Stresses Sanitation Conditions For Hong Kong-Bound Chickens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese inland resumed
shipping live chickens to Hong Kong late today, with a government
official calling for more attention to the sanitation condition of
the livestocks.
</P>
<P>
"In shipping live domestic fowls and animals to Hong Kong,
overriding importance must be attached to safety and sanitation
conditions," Yu Dahai, China's leading official in charge of
quarantine of animals and plants, told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
The quarantine departments must take responsibility for the
health of the Hong Kong residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Yu added that both the quarantine instruments and
methods of the Chinese inland have reached advanced world levels.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong suspended importing live chickens from the Chinese
inland in late December last year.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that the quantity of live chickens to be shipped to
Hong Kong, which averaged 100,000 each day before the outbreak of
a bird flu, will be dependent on the quarantine quality and the
responses of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"We will not blindly raise the amount just in order to make
more foreign exchange, let alone slacken the requirements of
quarantine as time passes by," he said.
</P>
<P>
It may take a fairly long period of time for the Chinese inland
to restore its daily export of 100,000 live chickens to Hong Kong,
Yu said.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Sales Increase in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Industrial sales for the first
10 months of 1997 in the Philippines reached 352.7 billion pesos
(8.8 billion U.S. dollars), up by 12 percent from the previous
year's 315.8 billion pesos (7.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
A survey released on Friday by the Department of Trade and
Industry Management Information Service showed that 12 sectors
experienced positive sales with value growth rates varying from 1
to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
Garments posted the highest sales at 70.2 billion pesos (1.8
billion dollars) from 61.7 billion pesos (1.5 billion dollars)
with the peso depreciation primarily assuring the growth.
</P>
<P>
Electronics ranked second with 59.8 billion pesos (1.5 billion
dollars) though sales and value of the sector recorded a hefty
48-percent growth during the 10-month period.
</P>
<P>
This was due to the increase in global demand for integrated
circuits used in cellular phones and pagers, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Food processing went up by 1 percent to 52.9 billion pesos (1.3
billion dollars) and consumer non-durables by 17 percent to 34.1
billion pesos (852.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The biggest loser in terms of value was sugar, with sales
plummeting by 67 percent from 1.7 billion pesos (42.5 million
dollars) to 542 million pesos (13.6 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed this to the peso's fall which had
resulted in the lack of raw materials and the influx of imported
sugar onto the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The next big loser was packaging materials, which saw a
20-percent drop from 4.1 billion pesos (10.3 million dollars) to
3.3 billion pesos (8.3 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Specialists Refute U.S. Human Rights Report (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tan Songqiu, executive councillor of the China Society for
Human Rights Studies, said the report has fabricated many cases to
attack China, most of which are distorted.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the report states that Catholic Church
Bishop Joseph Fan Zhongliang was arrested in his house in
Shanghai. Fan has stayed with his niece in Shanghai and has never
been arrested, Tan said.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Liu Fanwen was cited as a "dissident" and
"democratic activist." Liu's sentence to education through labor
was regarded as a proof of China's interference in human rights.
</P>
<P>
Tan said that Liu is not a democratic activist, but a hooligan
who harasses women. In 1982, Liu sexually harassed women on a bus
and was reprimanded by the Public Security Bureau of the Dongcheng
District in Beijing. In 1985, he also harassed women cleaners at
the toilets of Heizima and Nanluogu lanes in Beijing. In June of
1986, Liu gave himself up to the police and was exempted from
penalty, but in June of 1994 he was given a two-year
labor-education sentence for insulting women at Andingmen in
Beijing. On Feb. 25, 1997, Liu was sentenced to another two-year
term for his conduct with women.
</P>
<P>
Tan said that it is a pity that such a hooligan should be cited
in the report as one of the "radicals" to be protected by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hongyi, professor of Beijing Normal University, said that
as far as the human rights issue is concerned, the United States
has always adopted a double standard.
</P>
<P>
He said that the report accuses China of interfering in human
rights because "it does not tolerate religious manifestations that
advocate Tibetan independence or any expression of divisiveness."
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the report aims to support the Dalai Lama clique
which advocates independence.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, in the United States the U.S. Constitution aims
to set up an unbreakable federation of states which cannot be
separated from the union, and that any action to split the country
will be subject to stern legal penalties.

<HEADLINE> China Specialists Refute U.S. Human Rights Report (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dong Yunhu, a professor with the Party School of the CPC
Central Committee, said at the seminar that there are severe human
rights problems in the United States. Violent crimes are so
serious that 65 persons die each day of violence and that more
than 6,000 people are seriously maimed as a result of
violence. The mortality rate from violence in the United States is
10 times that in China.
</P>
<P>
During the past 10 years, the U.S. prison population increased
by a yearly average of 8.1 percent. In 1997 the number of
prisoners exceeded 1.7 million, or seven per 1,000 of the
U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
"Racial discrimination is well-rooted in the United States,"
Dong said. Blacks, who make up only 12 percent of the
U.S. population, account for more than half of all prisoners and
40 percent of those given the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Facing similar charges, blacks are 10 times more likely to be
sentenced to death than whites. The poverty rate of black families
is 15 percent higher than whites, and the life expectancy of black
men is 7.5 years less than white males and 5.2 years less for
black women, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States, with such a bad human rights record,
mentions nothing about its own human rights problems, but distorts
the facts and attacks the human rights situation in other
countries," he said. "That is a typical double standard," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing University professor Tian Dan, the United
States has ulterior motives for targeting China for criticism. For
example, the report claims there is no freedom of speech in China
and that its people are prohibited from criticizing the
government. But, in fact, Tian said, China's newspapers,
periodicals and television often give critical reports and
comments on the defects of the work of government departments. The
opinions of the masses are fully expressed and not limited by the
government, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
What some Americans seem to want, Tian said, is the kind of
free speech which advocates the overthrow of the legitimate
government and the socialist system of China.

Tian Jin, executive council member of the United Nations
Association of China, said there is a diehard political force in
the United States which does not want China to remain a socialist
country and does not want to acknowledge China's stability,
development and progress.
</P>
<P>
"On the excuse of human rights, they give support to a very
small group of so-called dissidents in China who endanger national
security and go in for divisive activities, attempting to change
the nature of China's society and its path of development," the
professor said. "That will surely arouse the disgust and
opposition of the Chinese people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Hangsheng, a professor with the People's University of
China, said at the seminar that the United States advertises
itself as the embodiment of the universality of human rights and
gives itself the airs of an international human rights judge. In
that role, the United States treats other countries as the accused
and reprimands others which do not conform with, or consent to,
its human rights view and human rights model.
</P>
<P>
"This overbearing action shows its self-centeredness with
regard to human rights issues," Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Huang Nansen, a professor with Beijing University, said that
the United States accounts for less than 5 percent of the world's
total population, but consumes 30 percent of the world's
petroleum, natural gas and coal.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with such a standard, the 1.2 billion Chinese
would consume 120 percent of the world's total energy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The swelling of personal freedom in the United States has
resulted in an infringement on the freedom of others and even
personal safety. For example, he said, the freedom of
homosexuality leads to the spread of AIDS and other sexual
diseases, and the freedom of private gun ownership leads to
frequent violent and terrorist incidents in U.S. society.
</P>
<P>
"If such freedoms in the United States are introduced as
universal human rights around the world, the world will be plunged
into a mess," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yizong, a professor with the Foreign Affairs College, said
that since Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to the United
States last year, Sino-U.S. relations have improved. The two
countries have decided to establish a strategic partnership toward
the 21st century and resolve differences with regard to human
rights on the basis of equality and mutual respect, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"However, only several months after the visit, the U.S. State
Department overtly ran against the above-mentioned guidelines and
released its human rights report, attacking China's human rights
and creating confrontation purposely," Li said. "Obviously, it is
a move to poison the relations of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Other participants at the seminar said that the United States
issues yearly human rights reports which provoke confrontations,
violate basic international norms and the current progressive tide
of the world, and meet resistance and opposition in more countries.
</P>
<P>
The participants said that if the United States really pays
attention to human rights, it should first improve its own
situation and halt its overbearing interference in the internal
affairs of other countries.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls to Fight Against Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
Friday called on people of South Africa, especially the whites,
to offer voluntary community service to help end the crime
scourge and meet other socio-economic challenges.
</P>
<P>
In his address at the opening of parliament, Mandela said his
government could do more if every South African consciously asked
themselves everyday whether they might have assisted in the
commission of a crime.
</P>
<P>
Referring to crime, Mandela said most serious crime had
decreased since his government came into power in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, there had been a marked decline in serious crimes
such as murder, robbery, taxi violence and car-hijacking, which,
Mandela said, were the result of better co-ordination among the
security services.
</P>
<P>
Mandela disagreed on the saying that crime situation had been
worsening, noting that there was a tendency to exaggerate and
distort the real crime situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, however, said particular attention would this year be
paid to woman and child abuse -- crimes which were on the
increase.
</P>
<P>
Renewing his new patriotism call, Mandela urged South Africans
to build the nation into "a community of citizens who appreciate
their civil duty".
</P>
<P>
He defended his government's performance since coming into
power, stressing that it had met, and in some instance even
surpassed last year's targets.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said his government remained committed to meeting its
budget deficit target. The government would strive creatively to
meet its obligations within the context of a reduction in the
public debt, he said, adding: "we must eliminate overspending."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela also pledged to continue the
government's efforts to improve the majority of people's living
and working condition. He said affirmative action was the only
way of moving away from racial discrimination to true equality.
</P>
<P>
He said although the government might not meet its election
promise of one million houses in five years, it would do its best
to meet the target. He said, "whatever the difficulties... we are
on course to ensure that in the end there shall be housing and
security for all."
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, 1,000 houses are being
started or completed very two-and-a-half days, and as a result of
government programs 1.2 million more South Africans had a
permanent roof over their heads.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Mandela government's targets for 1998
included ensuring that 90 percent of mothers and children had
access to free medical care, that a further 580,000 telephones
would be installed, and a further one million citizens supplied
with clean and accessible water.
</P>
<P>
As a measure to improve good governance, his office would also
begin drafting legislation on ethics in government. This would
include a statutory code of conduct for members of the executive
at national and provincial level, the report said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Incoming PM Rules out Official Ties With Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's incoming prime
minister said here Friday that his country will never develop
official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong-pil, the honorary president of the United Liberal
Democrats, will become the prime minister of a coalition
government late this month under an agreement reached between his
party and the National Congress for New Politics led by
President-elect Kin Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Chinese correspondents ahead of
his visit to China Sunday, Kim Jong-pil said that South Korea will
strictly keep its promise on the Taiwan issue as specified in the
joint communique signed by South Korea and China on August 24,
1992 for establishing full diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the issue of Taiwan is an internal affair of China
and that South Korea's contacts with Taiwan will continue to be
restricted to non-governmental level.
</P>
<P>
Kim, a veteran South Korean statesman, will pay a four-day
visit to China at the invitation of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has a very good impression of China although he
has never visited the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that his forthcoming visit is aimed at exchanging views
with Chinese leaders on various issues and enhancing mutual
understanding, friendship and cooperation between the two
countries.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- India has lost about 5,500
square kilometers of forest cover in the last three years, said
the latest "State of the Forest Report -- 1997" released here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Though open forests increased by 12,001 square kilometers and

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets Russian Deputy Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reiterated today that China fully
supports a diplomatic solution to crisis in Iraq, and is opposed
to the use of military force.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks during an afternoon meeting with Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Grigori Karasin.
</P>
<P>
He said the pressing task at the moment is that all parties
concerned should persist in diplomatic efforts in order to solve
the crisis in a manner acceptable to all sides.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed appreciation for Russia's active efforts to find
a peaceful solution to the crisis. He reiterated that China maintains
all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions on the
Iraq issue should be earnestly implemented in a comprehensive
manner. He stressed that Iraq should cooperate fully with the UN
Special Commission (UNSCOM) and seriously implement its
obligations.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council should take steps to remove sanctions in
accordance with the development of how Iraq implements related
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM is operating with the support of the international
community and has made effective progress, said Qian, adding that
the commission should make timely objective assessments of certain
cases requiring no further investigation. UNSCOM should accelerate
efforts to avoid unnecessarily prolonging the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed to the positiveness of Sino-Russian relations over
the past year, and noted that the two nations witnessed smooth
progress in the development of political ties. He said the two
nations signed several joint statements, completed demarcation of
the eastern section of Sino-Russian border, and enjoyed good
cooperation in the realm of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China and Russia have broad prospects for mutually
beneficial cooperation and vast potential for trade. He added that
the two sides should engage in mutually beneficial development.
</P>
<P>
Karasin briefed Qian on Russia's diplomatic efforts to find a
workable solution to the crisis in Iraq. He said Russia and China
share many common views on the issue and expressed hope for
continued close contact.
</P>
<P>
Karasin arrived in China on Tuesday to join in consultations
between deputy foreign ministers from the two countries. The
Russian leader, who is visiting at the invitation of the Chinese
Foreign Ministry, also held talks with his Chinese counterpart,

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Ratifies New Oil Deregulation Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate Friday
ratified a bicameral conference committee report on the new Oil
Deregulation Bill, setting a uniform tariff of 3 percent for
imported crude and refined oil products.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which seeks to replace the old oil deregulation
law, also sets a 2.9 billion peso (72.5 million U.S. dollars)
buffer fund to subsidize oil companies during a five-month
transition period for full deregulation.
</P>
<P>
The old oil deregulation law, which took effect in February
1997, was nullified by the Supreme Court last November on the
grounds that it violated the country's constitution and the rule
of free trade.
</P>
<P>
The law provided for a 7-percent tariff for refined petroleum
products and a 3-percent tariff for crude oil to encourage firms
to invest in the domestic refining industry.
</P>
<P>
But the court ruled that free trade would be hindered if oil
firms were forced to choose between investing huge amounts in
refineries and paying higher tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Under the new bill, the full deregulation of the downstream oil
industry involving such socially-sensitive products as liquefied
petroleum gas, kerosene and gasoline shall come no less than five
months after the measure is signed into law.
</P>
<P>
But in other products, the bill empowers the president to
accelerate full deregulation upon the recommendation of the
Department of Energy and the Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, full deregulation may only be accelerated when
the prices of crude oil and petroleum products in the world market
are declining and the value of the peso in relation to the U.S.
dollar is stable.

<HEADLINE> China Cuts Armed Forces by 7 million in 49 years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- China has reduced its armed
forces by seven million since the founding of new China in 1949,
according to a senior officer of the People's Liberation Army
(PLA).
</P>
<P>
He said that China's latest disarmament was initiated following
a 1997 September announcement by Jiang Zemin, chairman of the
Central Military Commission, that the PLA would further reduce its
forces by 500,000 personnel over the next three years, marking the
ninth cut of the country's armed forces in 49 years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the announcement during 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China held last September 12-18.
</P>
<P>
A number of field troops from the PLA Group Army have been
transfered to armed police units during the current ongoing ninth
round of military disarmament.
</P>
<P>
China's first armed forces cut was launched at the end of 1950
with a 17.1 percent reduction in a force of 5.5 million personnel.
</P>
<P>
The number of PLA personnel jumped to a record 6.1 million in
1951 during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.
</P>
<P>
China's second round of disarmament was carried out in January
1952 when the total number of PLA personnel fell to around 3
million. Staff levels at the PLA headquarters and departments at
various other levels were reduced by at least one third, with
local units integrated into public security departments, and a
large number of staffers entering military universities.
</P>
<P>
The third round of disarmament in 1953 was followed by the
fourth round in 1957. The former round involved a 23.3 percent cut
of the total troops, with the latter round resulting in a 33
percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
The fifth round was characterized by significant reductions in
the infantry, engineering and railway corps.
</P>
<P>
The sixth, seventh and eighth cuts were in 1978, 1980 and 1985
with the eighth cut being one million, a record reduction in the
history of the PLA.

<HEADLINE> Hutu Militiamen Kill 34 in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Hutu militia massacred 34
people Wednesday night in Rwanda's Jenda settlement, which is
located on the border between Ruhengeri and Gisenyi Prefectures,
officials in Ruhengeri said.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda News Agency (RNA) quoted Boniface Rucagu, prefect
of Ruhengeri as saying that a large group of militiamen armed
with guns, machetes, axes and clubs killed 30 on the spot, and
critically wounded 13 others. One deaf person was abducted, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In a special dispatch to Xinhua, the RNA said during the
attack which occurred at around 8:00 p.m. local time, some of the
militiamen blocked the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road, while others were
busy indiscriminately killing residents.
</P>
<P>
The victims are said to have been hacked to death by the
marauding Hutu extremists. "No single bullet was used," Rucagu
quoted survivors of the attack as saying.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the 30 residents who died on the spot, three
of the wounded died later, and the deaf man was later found
dead," Rucagu added.
</P>
<P>
It is said that after the massacre, the killers withdrew back
to nearby forests.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by
Hutu government forces and militiamen in 1994 after a plane of
the then Rwandan president was downed over Kigali, killing him
and several ministers. This incident triggered off the Rwanda
genocide, and resulted in the assuming power of the present
regime in Kigali.

<HEADLINE> China Actively Seeks Peaceful Settlement of Iraqi Crisis (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- An article signed by Guo Yali
and released today calls for active efforts to seek a peaceful
settlement to the ongoing crisis in Iraqi and states that China
will continue to play an influential role in reaching the goal.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that China, a permanent member of the United
Nations Security Council, has from the very beginning called on
the parties concerned to seek peaceful settlement to the dispute
over weapons inspection by engaging in dialogue and cooperation
and will continue supporting diplomatic efforts by all countries
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In recent meetings with visiting British and French foreign
ministers, Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
underlined that China is deeply concerned about the accelerating
deterioration of the crisis, and expressed the hope that
settlement of the issue will be accomplished through diplomatic
channels. China is opposed to both threats to use force and the
actual use of force. In a telephone conversation with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright and in messages to Iraqi
Vice-Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, Qian called for all concerned
parties to adopt a flexible attitude and practice restraint in
order to avoid further escalation of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin Huasen, China's representative to the UN,
pointed to UN Security Council deliberations of the Iraqi issue
and noted that China has consistently maintained that Iraq should
comprehensively implement the relevant resolutions adopted by the
council and fully cooperate with the UN Special Commission
(UNSCOM). However, he added, Iraq is a sovereign nation and the
international community should pay due attention to that country's
concerns about its dignity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The article went on to say that the Iraq crisis is quite
obviously intensifying, with the U.S. deploying a huge military
force to the Gulf and Iraq escalating preparations for a possible
war.
</P>
<P>
China places high value on the forthcoming technical appraisal
of weapons inspections in Iraq and sincerely hopes that all
parties concerned will adopt an earnest attitude to avoid
irresponsible assertions and judgments so as to enable all the
participating experts to make an objective judgment concerning
Iraq's implementation of relevant UN Security resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Inland Resuming Chicken Supply to Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of 38,000
live chicken will be shipped to Hong Kong from Shenzhen this
evening after going through rigid quarantine procedures.
</P>
<P>
The chickens are expected to be transported to various
wholesale markets of Hong Kong and be sold at local retail booths
tomorrow afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Technicians of Guangdong Provincial Department of Animal and
Plant Quarantine (GPDAPQ) were sent to 25 export-oriented chicken
farms in Guangzhou, dongguan, Zhuhai and Shenzhen cities yesterday
to collect chicken blood samples.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 blood samples were collected randomly from every
3,000 live chickens, doubling the amount required by the
Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) of Hong Kong, said
Huang Weiming, deputy director of GPDAPQ.
</P>
<P>
The whole process was under the guidance and supervision of Yu
Dahai, director of the Chinese Administration of Animal and Plant
Quarantine under the Ministry of Agriculture and officials from
relevant departments in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Hong Kong AFD will send quarantine officials
to re-examine the result by random before the chicken are shipped
into Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, quarantine departments in Guangdong collected 11,000
blood samples from 200 poultry farms for test of H5N1
virus. Negative reaction was shown in all blood samples, Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong will take new measures to examine H5N1 virus and
enhance quarantine management, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Export of chicken from China's inland to Hong Kong was
temporarily suspended as a precautionary measure since December 23
because of the outbreak of bird flue in Hong Kong late last year.

KAMPALA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A research has found that many
Ugandans prefer contract marriage.
</P>
<P>
Enid Nambuya, a member of Uganda Association of Women Lawyers,
said at a domestic violence workshop Wednesday that a survey in
eastern districts of Kampala, Iganga and Soroti and western
district of Masindi indicated that spouses were easier to deal
with their problems under contract marriage.
</P>
<P>
The interviewees of the survey include women and men in
intimate relationship, victims of domestic violence, law
enforcement officers and health workers.
</P>
<P>
They want more strict law dealing with physical abuses,
Nambuya said.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said there are few cases of contract marriages
and divorces among local spouses for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Domestic violence is still widespread in the country,
especially in rural areas, they noted.

in Nakuru District, the Daily Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the angry students staged
demonstrations in the university compound before they barricated

<HEADLINE> 3 Million Ethiopian Farmers Benefit from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- About 3 million Ethiopian
farmers have benifited from the implementation of extension
packages which also focused on development of cash crops, said
Ethiopian Minister of Agriculture Seifu Ketema.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the House of People's Representatives
Thursday, the minister said 989,000 farmers have been direct
beneficiaries of the extension programs in 1997 which shows a
rise by 53 percent from the set target for the year.
</P>
<P>
The number of farmers incorporated in leguminous and stalk
crops as well as fodder development packages has reached 375,000,
he said.
</P>
<P>
New packages on animal husbandry have also been prepared and
implemented in the stated period, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Ketema, the commitment the peasants have
displayed in applying the new technologies even in the face of
climate change is a testimony to their determination to carry on
with the programs.
</P>
<P>
The boost in agricultural production witnessed over the past
two years indicates that the country has the capability to be
self-sufficient in food, he added.
</P>
<P>
To attain self-sufficiency in food set by the five-year
development plan (1995-2000), the Ethiopian government organized
farmers in extension programs to teach peasants new farming
technologies and provide them with fertilizers and seeds.

BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Chen Jinhua, minister in charge
of the State Planning Commission, today called for greater efforts
to improve the government's ability and methods for implementing

<HEADLINE> 1998 Is Year of Science, Technology for S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki said South African has attached great
importance to the development of science and technology in the
country, saying 1998 is the year of science and technology for
all South Africans.
</P>
<P>
Launching the Year of Science and Technology program, Mbeki
cited a 1996 world report on competitiveness, which showed South
Africa as being at the bottom of a 40-country list in the area of
human resources development for science, engineering and
technology.
</P>
<P>
"During this Year of Science and Technology..., the key
message must be that science, engineering and technology are
important for the survival of our country in an increasingly
competitive world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic expansion on one side, and advances in science,
engineering and technology on the other, can hardly be seen
apart," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The attainment of a better life for all was dependent on South
Africans' achieving a competitive, growing and sustainable
economy, in which everyone participated, he noted.
</P>
<P>
For the first time the government was putting in place a
program to bring all South Africans into science, engineering and
technology, said Mbeki, who is patron of the program.
</P>
<P>
Lionel Mtshali, Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology, said the main reason for declaring 1998 the year of
science and technology was the results of two international
studies that rated South Africa "very poorly" in science,
engineering and technology and innovation.
</P>
<P>
Mtshali said his department, together with the science,
engineering and technology community, were working together "to
ensure that in 1998 South Africa would be in for a fascinating
and captivating experience of science, engineering and
technology".

<HEADLINE> Chinese Specialists Refute US Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese human rights
specialists and scholars pointed out here today that the China
Part of "1997 Human Rights Report" issued by the US State
Department on January 30 has once again interfered with China's
internal affairs under the pretext of human rights.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on the US Human Right Report, they pointed out
that by distortion and fabrication and citing the so-called
"facts", the report made unwarranted charges with China's human
rights situation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Muzhi, president of China Society for Human Rights Studies,
said that although the report admitted that China has made some
progress in human rights, it continues to ignore the facts and
justice here in China.
</P>
<P>
The greatest achievement China has made in the field of human
rights is its success in providing adequate food and clothing for
its 1.2 billion people and in its efforts to help more than 50
million people to get out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Other participants noted at the seminar that the United States
issues a human rights report every year, violating basic
international norms and the current tide of progress in the world,
thus meeting the resistance and opposition from more and more
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The United States should halt its overbearing move of
interfering the internal affairs of other countries by using
the human rights issue," participants stressed.
</P>
<P>
More details are to follow.

<HEADLINE> Low Copper Production Bars Zambia's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The low copper production and
subsequent decline in its prices are the main reasons why
Zambia's economy only grew 3.5 percent instead of the targeted
5.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Friday quoted a quarterly Economic Review
report released by the Barclays Bank (Zambia) as saying
that the lower economic growth rate resulted from the slump in
Zambia's copper production, the country's biggest foreign
exchange earner, and its prices respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that following the ongoing
privatisation of the copper mines, the economy will improve even
though the fruits should be expected after one to two years.
</P>
<P>
"As the rehabilitation of the mines will take some time, it is
unlikely that the impact of privatisation on exports will be felt
before the fourth quarter of 1998, and then only in relatively
small way," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the process of the rehabilitation in the
privatised mines should be a source of employment because the
owners would demand local skills in engineering and construction
sectors.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Appeal for Lifting of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Five African presidents Thursday
addressed an urgent appeal for the lifting of the international
embargo imposed against Libya since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by presidents from Sudan, Chad, Nigeria,
Mali and Libya at the end of their summit held in Libyan capital
of Tripoli. Tunisia, Egypt and Burkina Faso also sent delegates
to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit communique carried by the Libyan news agency called
for the immediate lifting of the sanctions against Libya in
conformity with the related resolutions of the Organization of
African Unity, the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic
Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed after Libya refused to hand over two
suspects allegedly responsible for the bombing of a Pan Am jet
over Scotland in 1998, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also signed a treaty for the establishment of a
group for consultations and action among the coastal, desert
African countries which confront similar internal and external
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
These countries will cooperate with each other in tapping the
rich human and natural resources in the coastal and desert areas
for the good of their development.
</P>
<P>
The newly founded framework will have a council of heads of
state, an executive council, a secretariat, a development bank and
an economic, social and cultural council. The secretariat will be
temporarily based in Tripoli. And the summit chose Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi as chairman of the current session of the council
of heads of state.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- South African zoologists have
artificially inseminated three cheetahs in hope to save the extremely
endangered animal, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
If the cheetahs carry their cubs full term, it will be the first
successful artificial insemination of cheetahs in Africa, National
Zoological Gardens chief veterianarian Ian Espie was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Espie said five cheetahs, including four king cheetahs, were
selected for insemination, but only three were found to be ovulating
when they were examined on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The females had been injected twice with hormones to synchronize
and induce ovulation. A second injection was given to them on Tuesday.
Semen was extracted from male cheetah and injected into the ovulation
females.
</P>
<P>
If Thursday's procedure is successful, the three females will
give birth after the average gestation period of 93 days. Cheetah
usually give birth to two or four cubs at a time.
</P>
<P>
According to Espie, United States zoos had a 50 percent success
rate in cheetah insemination.

<HEADLINE> 10 Million Nigerians Suffer from River Blindness: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- About 10 million Nigerians have
been infected with the river blindness disease, otherwise known
as onchocerciasis, and 150,000 of them are currently irreversibly
blind.
</P>
<P>
The startling revelation was made on Thursday by Emmanuel
Gemade, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) project officer
for health in Nigeria, to herald the forthcoming National
Onchocerciasis Week taking place between February 8 and 13 in the
capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that over 30 million Nigerians are at risk of
contracting the disease, since it has spread to over 30 states of
the federation, thus making the country the worst victim of river
blindness globally.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has a population of about 100 million.
</P>
<P>
According to Gemade, a United States-based company has
promised to supply free of charge the potent drug for fighting
the ailment (mectizan) until the scourge is totally eradicated
from the continent.
</P>
<P>
The African Program for Onchocerciasis Control, the United
Nations agency responsible for the fight against the disease in
African countries, has mapped out strategies to address the
issue, Gemade said.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures involves the use of members of the
communities involved as distributors of the drug.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, 12 million Nigerians had received the
drug, compared to the less than one million people that benefited
from the drug distribution program at its beginning of 1991.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Hopes for Peaceful Solution to Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu expressed the hope Friday for a peaceful
solution to the current Iraqi crisis, but adding Israel reserves
the right of self-defense if attacked.
</P>
<P>
In an official briefing on the Persian Gulf situation held
here to foreign diplomats based in Israel, Netanyahu said Israel
is "hopeful that there will be a peaceful solution to the present
crisis."
</P>
<P>
He voiced Israel's full support to the United States and the
international community in demanding Iraq to allow unfettered
search by U.N. inspectors of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israel is exercising a policy of restraint and
responsibility over the Iraqi crisis so to avoid getting involved
in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel's assessment is that "the risk of Iraq
attacking Israel is low, even very low," but stressing Israel's
right of self-defense against any such attack. "We reserve the
right of self-defense, which is a natural right of any state, or
nation, under potential real attacks," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past days, Israeli leaders have been trying to
allay fears among its citizens about a possible Iraqi biological
and chemical attack. The U.S., who is wielding the option of
a military strike against Iraq, has reportedly urged Israel to
refrain from retaliating if attacked by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991 Gulf War, Israel was forced by Washington to
refrain from striking back when Iraq launched dozens of Scud
missiles against it. But most Israeli politicians maintained this
time that if attacked again, Israel would not stay idle and would
retaliate according to its own security interests.
</P>
<P>
Besides the danger of Iraq, Netanyahu tried to draw
international attention to the same efforts that Iran is making
to acquire ballistic missiles and non-conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to pay equal attention to
the Iranian efforts, which he called as another major source of
instability in Middle East. He warned that if Iran continues to
develop its weapons programs unimpeded, it would pose threats not
only to the region, but to the world as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Somali Warlord Pledges Quick Withdrawal From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 6 (Xinhua)--Somali warlord Hussein Mohamed
Aideed has agreed to withdraw his militiamen out of the southern
town of Baidoa, ahead of a peace conference due to open on
February 15, said a report reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We shall respect all genuine agreements regarding the
pacification of the twon," said Aideed's spokesman Abikar Qali.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal will comply with an undertaking Mr. Aideed gave
at a peace conference ended in Cairo on December 22. The
conference ended with an agreeement by 26 factional leaders to
meet in Baidoa to establish a federal state and an interim
government.
</P>
<P>
Baidoa was captured by Mr. Aideed's father, the late General
Mohamed Farah Aideed, in September 1995 from the Rahanwein Clan.
</P>
<P>
"Our troops will be deployed outside Baidoa according to the
Cairo agreement," Qali said.
</P>
<P>
But the Rahanwein Resitance Army (RRA) spokesman Mohamed Aden
Qalinle said he did not believe Aideed's troops withdrawal would
take place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Somalia's main warlords Mr. Aideed, Mr. Mahdi and
Osman Hassan Ali Atto, had agreed on January 31 to take away the
barricades and checkpoints that have divided the capital
Mogadishu into three zones in the past seven years, and reopen
both port and airport in the capital.

business premises in urban centers between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m.

district after 9 p.m. would be arrested and anyone calling on
people to arm themselves should be arrested and punished.

ordered bakers and cooking oil manufacturers to stop any further
increase of bread and cooking oil prices.
</P>
<P>
"The government will hold the prices at present levels and
hold further meetings with the manufacturers to see if they can
even be brought down," said Nathan Shamuyarira, Minister of
Industry and Commerce on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the government and millers have
agreed to hold the price of maize meal at present levels for
three months, while bakers agreed to suspend a 25 percent
increase in bread prices and oil producers have been asked to
forgo a 20.5 percent proposed increase.
</P>
<P>
"Generally what the government is trying to do is to hold the
prices for all basic commodities as what they are for some time
while we try to find a solution to the problem of sharp price
increases," he said.
</P>
<P>
A task force was set up by the government to review price
increases following last month's alarming price increases of
essential goods which triggered violent food riots.
</P>
<P>
From January 19 to 21, thousands of residents in the capital
Harare and other towns staged the demonstrations in protest
against the steep prices increases. Some of them looted shops,
stoned cars and destroyed properties, causing million of Dollars
losses.
</P>
<P>
The minister assured the nation that the government had enough
maize in stock to see the country through the next four months at
the current consumption rate of 50,000 tons a month.

<HEADLINE> S. African Opposition Leaders Discuss Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and National
Party (NP) leader, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, met officially for
the first time Thursday to discuss the political situation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Issues of mutual interest were discussed in their capacity as
leaders of opposition parties," The Star newspaper quoted a joint
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting took place in a constructive and friendly
spirit," said IFP national chairman Ben Ngubane and NP executive
director Renier Schoeman.
</P>
<P>
They said a follow-up meeting would take place later. However,
they did not say whether the 1999 general elections were discussed.
</P>
<P>
Van Schalkwyk said Monday that his party would take some
initiatives this year on opposition realignment and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing NP is the biggest opposition party in the
country and the IFP is the largest black-based opposition.
</P>
<P>
Nelson Mandela, former president of ruling African National
Congress (ANC), had called for a merger between his party and the
IFP on the eve of ANC's 50th national conference in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
Both sides later denied media reports that the process of
merging had begun.
</P>
<P>
The ANC and the right-leaning IFP were bitter rivals in the
1980s and early 1990s as their political objectives differed in
thier struggle against apartheid.

<HEADLINE> Weakening Asian Currencies Attractive to U.S. Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Amid the current Asian
financial crisis, travel agencies in the United States received a
lot more phone calls than usual, asking information about travels
to the region.
</P>
<P>
One of them, based in San Diego, said that since it slashed its
tour prices to Asia late last month, incoming phone calls have
more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
"People from all over North America have decided that now is a
good time to visit Asia," a marketing executive of the Japan
Orient Tours said.
</P>
<P>
At Japan Orient Tours, tickest from Los Angeles to Hong Kong,
including round air fare and a five-night hotel stay, were slashed
from 1,298 U.S. dollars to 798 dollars.
</P>
<P>
At Balboa Travel, the price of a round-trip package with three
night-stay in Tokyo also dropped by a third, from 1,498 dollars to
988 dollars. Fares to Bangkok, Hong Kong and Indonesia dropped 300
U.S. dollars to 500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to tourism analysts, the drop-off price is also
caused by the sharp decline in business travels. Fewer executives
from Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea take business trips.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are fewer travelers to the United States, from
Asia, especially from Japan and South Korea. Local tourism
analysts predict that Japan's economic problems will cut further
into Japanese tourists' spending patterns.
</P>
<P>
According Joe McInerney, CEO of the Pacific Asia Travel
Association (PATA), South Pacific members are also feeling the
impact of the economic situation in Asia. McInerney has just
returned from a recent visit to Australis, New Zealand and Fiji,
</P>
<P>
Roundtable meetings with industry leaders and PATA members are
being scheduled for a number of Northeast Asian locations in
Mid-February, PATA said. McInerney will conduct sessions in Tokyo,
Osaka, Seoul, Beijing and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> California's Two Top Banks to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Two of California's largest
banks - Los Angeles' Glendale Federal Bank and San Francisco's
California Federal Bank - will merge into the third largest
savings and loans in the United States, reports from both banks
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the merger is to grab a leading share of deposits
in key markest such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and
Orange County where both banks competed each other in the past,
said Gerald J. Ford, chairman and chief executive of California
Federal Bank.
</P>
<P>
Some branches will close in neighborhoods where both banks have
offices, he said, adding that it would cut costs by 131 million
U.S. dollars following the merger.
</P>
<P>
Glendale Federal Bank is the sixth-largest thrift in California
with 16 billion U.S. dollars in assets, 181 banking offices and 26
loan offices in the state.
</P>
<P>
California Federal Bank is the fourth-largest thrift with more
than 30 billion U.S. dollars in assets, 225 branches, including
194 in California, 24 in Florida and seven in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
The merged institution will be called California Federal Bank
and based in San Francisco. It will have more than 400 branches
with 51 billion U.S. dollars in assets, 6.4 percent of the
California's deposits.
</P>
<P>
The boards of directors of both banks have approved the
transaction, but it still needs regulatory and shareholder
approval.
</P>
<P>
The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Supercomputers in India Not to Be Affected by US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- India's noted supercomputer
expert V. Rajaraman said Friday that the United States' move to
promulgate a new regulation to permanently peek into all end-users
of U.S.-made supercomputers in India will not have any tangible
effect on the country as it has developed its own supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the 1980s when the supercomputer was denied to the
Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, a new emerged industrial
city 2019 km south of New Delhi, the move would not produce any
tangible effect this time, said Rajaraman, founder chairman of the
Supercomputer Education and Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The regulation is irrelevant as far as India is concerned, said
Rajaraman, when asked about the possible impact of the move on the
country's ongoing defense, space and nuclear programs.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Tells West Not to Meddle in Other's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria stressed on Thursday the
need for western countries to eschew what it termed "meddlesomeness"
in its national business.
</P>
<P>
Mutual respect for the sovereign rights of countries could
heal the wounds of distrust and muscle-flexing which currently
pervades the circle of international diplomacy, said Alhaji
Buhari Bala, Nigerian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The minister's remarks, according to the Guardian newspaper
today, is apparently a response to the censure on alleged human
rights abuses in Nigeria by the United States.
</P>
<P>
In a report titled "Nigeria Country Report On Human Rights
Practices For 1997", the U.S. described the scorecard of the
Nigerian government in this respect as "dismal" last year.
</P>
<P>
It claimed that despite the announcement of a timetable for
transition from military to multi-party rule, "there was little
meaningful progress toward democracy".
</P>
<P>
It also found fault with Nigeria's local government elections
last March although the polls "were largely peaceful" and called
for release of political detainees.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister, at a meeting with Tunisian ambassador
to Nigeria, said the on-going transition to civil rule program
could not be doubted any longer while the country's doors "will
remain open on constructive dialogue, economic and cultural
issues".
</P>
<P>
According to the timetable, an elected government will take
over power from the military on October 1 this year. Preparations
for the elections of the National Assembly, state governors and
president are underway.
</P>
<P>
The National Electoral Commission of Nigeria on Thursday
released details of delineated federal constituencies and
senatorial districts across the 36 states and the federal capital
territory for the April 25 national assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
Elections of governors and president will be held in August.

<P>
PARIS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While the United States sent Thursday 2,200 more marines to
the Gulf to reinforce the American armada there, it is always time
for talks in Baghdad to solve the Iraqi crisis. Even the U.S.
president has admitted that Iraq has made an opening, although he
judged it not enough. He also admitted that a policy to attack
Iraq is not easy to make and a military action is not inevitable.
</P>
<P>
-- Seven years after the Gulf War, the rigor of the embargo and
the threats by the United States to strike Iraq are more and more
detested by Egypt. Although the Egyptian government does not support
Saddam Hussein, the suffering of the Iraqis and the U.S. policy
toward the Mideast, judged in favor of Israel, are eroding the stock
of credit of the Untied States.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- As the unemployment rate has just attained 12.6 percent in
Germany, the organizations of the unemployed demonstrated massively
in more than 250 German cities Thursday and have vowed to protest
all the months until the elections are held. Imitating their French
peers, the protesters occupied some government employment offices,
where they spent the night.
</P>
<P>
-- General Jacques Guillermaz, a French military attache in the
French embassy in China from 1937 to 1951 who later became a
well-known Sinologist, died at the age of 87 in Paris this week.

YANGON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities Friday
rejected the U.S. State Department report on human rights, saying
that "the situation report on Myanmar is no doubt written in the
standard and stereotypical fashion of judging others negatively so
that the judge can be imaged to look like an innocent or a saint."
</P>
<P>
An official Information Sheet said that "the policy imposed on
Myanmar by the United States today is regarded as a precursor and
a catalyst to transform the process of a peaceful evolution into a
revolution by imposing sanctions, embargoes and pressures of all
sorts on our nation."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously various pretexts such as human rights and democracy
have been hypocritically used as weapons while fabricated,
exaggerated and false news have also been constantly disseminated
to tarnish the image of the target countries," the Information
Sheet added.
</P>
<P>
In a report released last Friday, the U.S. State Department
slammed Myanmar's record of human rights.

<HEADLINE> Study: Caspian Oil Pipeline to Cost 2.5 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- An international pipeline to
transfer Caspian oil to the European markets will cost 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars, according to a feasibility study.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Baku, Azerbaijan and ending in the southern
Turkish port of Ceyhan, the pipeline will have 468 kilometers in
Azerbaijan, 225 kilometers in Georgia and 1,037 kilometers in
Turkey, according to the study report available Friday.
</P>
<P>
If completed, the pipeline is expected to have a capacity of 45
million tonnes per year and the figure could be raised in the
future, said study report, which was prepared by a german expert
team and financed by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Engery and Natural Resources Minister Cumhur Ersumer
told reporters here Thursday that choosing this land route could
reduce the pressure on the Turkish Straits whose waters have been
suffering increasing pollution of oil tankers sailing through it.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Turkey also will take advantage of
the pipeline by collecting transportation fees and buying crude
oil at a lower price when it is put into operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ersumer stated that Russian oil could also be
carried by this pipeline, saying Turkey welcomes Russian companies
to join in the project.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been playing an active role in exploiting the
abundant Caspian area in order to meet its rapidly increasing
energy demands.
</P>
<P>
As an oil-starving country, Turkey has to import oil and
natural gas from its neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> indaga israel reportes sobre prohibiciones comerciales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
jerusalem, 6 de febrero (xinhua) -- autoridades israelies
procuran verificar reportes segun los cuales egipto ha prohibido
la importacion de productos israelies, entre ellos algunos tipos
de medicinas y cosmeticos, revelo hoy la prensa local.
</P>
<P>
el asesor legal del ministerio israeli del exterior, alan
baker, ha recomendado una reunion de la comision conjunta de
comercio israel-egipto para examinar esas versiones, segun el
diario en lengua inglesa the jerusalem post.
</P>
<P>
los reportes sobre las prohibiciones a productos israelies
aparecieron publicados el mes pasado en el diario al ahram, el
cual cito a la viceministra egipcia de salud jamila moussa, quien
indico que se habian dado instrucciones en ese sentido a los
puestos aduanales.
</P>
<P>
a juicio de baker, si esos reportes son veridicos entonces
egipto estaria violando el tratado de paz de 1979 y el acuerdo
comercial de 1980, vigentes entre ambos paises.
</P>
<P>
por su parte, el embajador egipcio en tel aviv, mohammed
bassiouny, confirmo la version del diario al ahram, pero indico
que las medidas tomadas por su pais son similares a las impuestas
con anterioridad por israel contra productos egipcios como
textiles y conductores de agua.
</P>
<P>
segun el acuerdo comercial israel-egipto, cualquiera de las dos
partes debe informar a la otra de todo cambio o variacion en su
intercambio.
</P>
<P>
funcionarios de la cancilleria israeli indicaron que aun cuando
este es un asunto serio, se mantendra un bajo perfil en el
tratamiento de este problema a fin de no ocasionar ningun dano a
las ya tensas relaciones bilaterales a causa del estancamiento en
el proceso de paz en el medio oriente. fin

<HEADLINE> El Nino Meeting Calls for Establishing Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Asian regional conference
on El Nino ended here Friday after issuing a statement stressing
the importance of setting up an information system.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Asian regional meeting on El Nino
related crises calls upon national governments, regional and
international organizations to:
</P>
<P>
-- Establish a regional forum of climate experts (national,
regional, international) to engage in ongoing dialogues to provide
guidance to the countries of the region; and
</P>
<P>
-- Establish a regional strategic planning committee
representative of key stakeholder groups in the region.
</P>
<P>
The statement said all countries concerned should commit to
providing the political and financial support necessary to
establish such a system.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, co-organized by the Asian Disaster
Preparedness Center and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, brought together more than 100 weather experts to
discuss weather anomalies thought to be caused by El Nino.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is the name given to the occasional warming of surface
waters in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific ocean. It
causes disruption of the ocean-atmosphere system in the tropical
Pacific, with important consequences for the weather around the
globe such as increased rainfall, flooding, drought, bush fires
and hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
"Effects of climate variations can be significantly mitigated
and the positive aspects can be capitalized upon," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It said there is urgent need to interface between climate
information and user community to address the short term and long
term problems of vulnerability to climate variations.
</P>
<P>
The statement identified the following key action areas towards
building regional capacities:
</P>
<P>
-- Developing a regional capability to produce climate
information guidance;
</P>
<P>
-- Disseminating information on potential impacts on key
sectors such as agriculture and food security, environment and
natural resources, population and public health and industry and
economics;
</P>
<P>
-- Coordinating various regional initiatives;
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting and strengthening the use of existing technical
capacities in the region;
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening capacities of governments and institutions to
respond; and
</P>
<P>
-- Sharing best practices.
</P>
<P>
The participants formally acknowledged the value of long term
forecasts in alleviating social and economic costs related to
climate variations.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Becoming Major Chinese Industrial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Industrial output of Hainan,
China's island province, was 17.9 billion yuan (2.2 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1997, a 13 percent increase from the previous
year, according to local statistics.
</P>
<P>
Industrial product sales were 95 percent of the total, up two
percentage points from 1996, and exports grew 30 percent to 150
million U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Annual growth of investment in industrial fixed assets has been
20 percent since the province was founded 10 years ago, and the
petrochemical, automobile, beverage and food, textile, medicine
and building material industries are playing an important role in
local economic development.
</P>
<P>
The petrochemical industry has become a pillar of economic
development. Work will begin soon on a gas fertilizer project
costing 15.6 billion yuan, and the province is expected to be the
country's largest carbamide production base. The Shilu Iron Mine
Plant, Chahe Cement Plant, Daguangba Power Station, and Yinggehai
Saltern are now operating.
</P>
<P>
Hainan now has more than 50 medicine producers. There were only
five in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The 31-square-kilometer Yangpu Economic Development Zone has
become a large investment project base and the country's largest
export-oriented bonded zone.
</P>
<P>
To increase competitiveness and economic returns, 100
state-owned industrial enterprises, accounting for 40 percent of
the province's total, have been reorganized through various forms
including merger, acquisition, shareholding, or bankruptcy, and
the province has introduced more modern equipment, technology, and
production lines from abroad.

<HEADLINE> Pearl Orchids Bring More Income to Chinese Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Huang Chuanxian, a formerly
poor Qianjiang County resident in the southwest China municipality
of Chongqing, earned 30,000 yuan (3,600 US dollars) in 1997, a
dramatic rise on his former annual income of only 2,000 yuan (241
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Growing pearl orchids enabled my family to escape poverty,"
said Huang with a broad smile.
</P>
<P>
Pearl orchids, a wild flower species found in the country's
southwestern mountainous areas, have also brought prosperity to
poverty-stricken people in the Tujia Minority Autonomous County in
the Chongqing area.
</P>
<P>
Pearl orchids, a type of herbal plant, make an excellent
"gourmet powder" for flower tea. However, harsh weather conditions
inhibit the growth of the delicate species.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, the Qianjiang County tea processing plant has
cooperated with the Southwest Agriculture University to expand
plantation areas for the plant. The cooperative effort led to the
establishment of pearl orchid processing venture.
</P>
<P>
The current annual output of flower tea containing pearl orchid
ingredients stands at one million tons, with related products
earning profits of 3.5 million yuan (422,000 US dollars). The
products are exported to Japan and India, and are sold in a number
of cities and eight provinces, including Anhui, Fujian and Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Tea experts predict that pearl orchid flower tea will become an
important component in China's flower tea family.
</P>
<P>
Pearl orchids are currently grown on 667,000 hectares in
Qianjiang County. Growing the flowers has enabled some 600
families in seven towns become better off, with total income for
the group approaching five million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Projections for the year 2000 call for the company to produce
2,000 tons of tea. Some 10,000 farmers families from 40-odd towns
will be growing pearl orchids, and earnings from related
activities will soar to 40 million yuan (4.8 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Pak Asks UN to Be Impartial Mediator on Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmed has said it was important for the U.N. to quickly
establish its credentials to the Afghan parties as an impartial
mediator, the official APP reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad made the remarks when he met with a delegation from
the European Union Wednesday, according to the Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the EU delegation's visit was to convey the
"common European Union position" on Afghanistan, APP said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani foreign secretary made a detailed briefing to the
EU delegation on the current situation in Afghanistan, it said.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad also explained Pakistan's role in bringing permanent
peace in the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan wants the U.N. to play a central role for an eventual
settlement in Afghanistan, he said, adding that Pakistan is making
hectic efforts to promote the Afghan peace process in support of
the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Pakistan is seeking support from the countries,
which have influence in Afghanistan including the six countries
with common borders with Afghanistan (Pakistan, Iran,
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and China) plus the United
States and Russia, he said.

<HEADLINE> Diplomat: Iraq Poses No Threat to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq cherishes its friendship
with Turkey and will never be a threat to this neighboring
country, a senior Iraqi diplomat in Ankara said.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with local newspaper Daily News and
published Friday, Iraqi Charge d'Affaires Saad Al Samarral denied
the claims that Iraq targets its weapons of mass destruction on
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Iraq and Turkey are brothers and sisters.
So why should Iraq threaten the Turkish people?" Samarrai said.
</P>
<P>
He added "We enjoy special and historical ties. Our aim is to
further enhance our relations."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi diplomat pointed out that those allegations that
Iraq's weapons are targeted against Turkey is simply trying to
sow the seeds of discord between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Denying that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, Samarral
said that the futile action of the numerous U.N. arms inspection
teams was a convincing proof that Iraq does not possess such
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's only concern is how its people will be fed and
provided with medicine. It does not have the intention of
launching another war in the region which could not bear another
confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is ridiculous to describe those people
threatened by powerful Western countries as a nation which poses
a threat to the region.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain are amassing their military
force in the Gulf region for a possible strike against Iraq
in order to enforce an unrestricted arms inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At present, France, Russia, Turkey are making diplomatic
efforts to persuade the Iraqi leadership to comply with the
relevant U.N. Security Council resolution in return for a
peaceful solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has said it favors a diplomatic settlement of the
stand-off between Iraq and the United States, saying that a new
war will harm the region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a close ally of the United States, has said that
Washington has not made a request of using the Incirlik air base
in southern Turkey for a military operation against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. warplanes stationed in the air base have
obviously increased taking-off and landing flights during the
past days.

<HEADLINE> Manila Less Burdened by Overbuilt Property Sector: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Throughout Asia, the Philippines
is less burdened by an overbuilt property sector, substantial
excess capacity and mountains of external debts.
</P>
<P>
This was the outcome of a study conducted by Merill Lynch, a
U.S.-based investment management and research company, included in
its Asia Pacific 1998 outlook, the Philippine News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The study, however, noted that high interest rates have to be
tapped to provide an effective remedy to at least reduce
consumption to more sustainable levels and to fund a looming
fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
The peso depreciation and spiked interest rates were also seen
as factors that have contributed to the drop in the growth of
corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in the fall of profits by some listed firms to 10
percent in the third quarter of last year, it said, adding that
this brought the nine-month profit tally to a growth rate of only
9 percent.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the drawbacks of the currency crisis, the property
sector is seen to recover quickly, but the improved performance
will not go beyond five percent this year, it predicted.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the worst still lies ahead for the banks due
to the lag in bad loan recognition," Merill Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
It further noted that the downward pressure on net asset values
for property companies will not be fully realized until later in
1998 or until the banks have fully disposed of the properties held
as collaterals for the bad loans.
</P>
<P>
Merill Lynch said that the lag in non-performing loan
recognition suggests that the bad news for banks might not occur
until later this year.
</P>
<P>
But as high interest rates dominate the property market, unit
sales are likely to weaken as net asset values will not come from
distressed property companies but from banks which wanted to
unload properties used as collaterals, it said.

<HEADLINE> Legal System Guarantees Better Conditions for Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Major improvements in China's
education system, including codes and regulations, guarantee
better pay and living conditions for Chinese teachers.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Teachers went into effect on January 1, 1994. More
than half of the country's provinces, municipalities directly
under the Central Government and autonomous regions have since
issued local laws designed to improve overall conditions for
teachers.
</P>
<P>
Laws and regulations adopted by Beijing, Tianjin and Fujian
Province, as well as a number of other municipalities and
provinces, clearly stipulate that wages for teachers must be
higher than those for civil servants.
</P>
<P>
A number of provinces have also introduced regulations
providing teachers with higher than average per-capita housing
space at preferential prices.
</P>
<P>
Six laws, 16 administrative codes and more than 200 regulations
regarding education and teachers have been issued nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In addition, various provinces plan to introduce additional
local codes and regulations during 1998 to provide greater
guarantees covering salaries and living conditions for teachers.
</P>
<P>
China's long tradition of exhibiting great respect for teachers
was virtually destroyed during the 10-year tumultuous "Cultural
Revolution" (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
However, the growing attention the entire nation has paid to
education and the plight of teachers since the introduction of the
reform and opening polices in the late 1970s can be largely
attributed to persistent calls issued by late Senior Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Tailors Enjoy Brisk Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and domestic tailors
alike are edging into the popular ready-to-wear clothing market in
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
"A tailor-made pair of slacks and long skirt cost around 100
yuan, compared to several hundred yuan for expensive high quality
Western-style clothing. Tailor-made clothing not only equals items
offered in large department stores, but more importantly offers
fine workmanship," according to a young female accountant.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign-funded shops have joined the competition,
with most offering high quality clothing fashioned according to
individual specifications.
</P>
<P>
Many consumers visit foreign shops for wedding gowns or
evening dresses. Young people, on the other hand, are willing to
pay as much as 3,000 yuan for Western-style clothing such as
suits. Clothing ensembles are popular items with people in higher
income brackets, according to a clerk in a foreign-funded shop.
</P>
<P>
Most small domestic tailors are equipped with a sewing machine,
tape measure and iron. Nonetheless, profitable small shops are
able to compete due to their large clientele of urbanites.
</P>
<P>
Domestic shops also offer traditional clothing styles,
including cheongsam, or tight-fitting dresses with slit skirts and
high necks, as well as Chinese-style jackets with buttons, and
tunic suits.

<HEADLINE> Cleaner Drinking Water Coming Out of China's Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Lanzhou, the
capital of China's Gansu Province, now have cleaner water to drink
from the Yellow River, one of China's biggest rivers, thanks to a
water purification technique developed by Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
The part of the river that flows through the city has become
seriously polluted because of the industrial and human waste
discharged into it. The situation had gotten so bad that the
city's drinking water supply was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
To remedy this, the Lanzhou branch of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences developed the water purification equipment specifically
designed to handle the river water's high density of oil-based
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
The equipment can be produced at a low cost and is efficient
and effective at bringing the polluted water up to state-set
standards.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators of the Philippine
government and a major Muslim rebel group will sign an agreement
Friday on the repositioning of both forces and some other things,
a top rebel leader said.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, vice chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), said that negotiators from both sides will sign the
accord at the end of their two-day initial peace talks late Friday
in Marawi City, capital of Lanao de Sur province.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said that the accord is in line with the provisions
contained in the general agreement for cessation of hostilities in
Mindanao signed in July 1997 by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, all government troops will pull back five
kilometers away from the defense line of MILF's Camp Abubakar in
Buldon town, Maguindanao province. The camp is MILF's largest
stronghold in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The accord also provides for the reactivating of a
government-MILF coordinating committee to monitor any future
ceasefire violations.
</P>
<P>
A joint military-MILF quick response team will be established
to respond on any future conflict between the MILF guerrillas and
the military.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to meet again on February 24-25 in Marawi
city to tackle the agenda of the formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF began their exploratory peace talks
in January 1997, but the talks have been on and off due to
sporadic conflicts between the two forces.
</P>
<P>
Boasting a membership of about 12,000, the MILF is presently
the strongest anti-government force in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Low Copper Production Bars Zambia's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The low copper production and
subsequent decline in its prices are the main reasons why
Zambia's economy only grew 3.5 percent instead of the targeted
5.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Friday quoted a quarterly Economic Review
report released by the Barclays Bank (Zambia) as saying
that the lower economic growth rate resulted from the slump in
Zambia's copper production, the country's biggest foreign
exchange earner, and its prices respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that following the ongoing
privatisation of the copper mines, the economy will improve even
though the fruits should be expected after one to two years.
</P>
<P>
"As the rehabilitation of the mines will take some time, it is
unlikely that the impact of privatisation on exports will be felt
before the fourth quarter of 1998, and then only in relatively
small way," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the process of the rehabilitation in the
privatised mines should be a source of employment because the
owners would demand local skills in engineering and construction
sectors.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Registers No-confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition party
registered Friday a no-confidence motion against the present
government in the Parliament Secretariat two days after King
Birendra decided to call a special session of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Those signed on the censure motion are 89 MPs from the
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and
one from the breakaway faction of the ruling National Democratic
Party (RPP) led by Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, the
Parliament Secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra had appointed February 11 for the special
parliament session. But under Nepal's laws, voting on the censure
motion in the Lower House can take place 10 days after the motion
is registered.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that at the February 11 session, the speaker
will set a fresh date for discussions of the motion.
</P>
<P>
A simple majority of 103 votes is needed to pass the censure
motion in the 205-seat Lower House.
</P>
<P>
"We have enough votes to bring down the government," press
reports Friday quoted Man Mohan Adhikari, president of the
CPN-UML, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He did not give details, but said that former prime minister
Lokendra Bahadur Chand, leader of the breakaway faction of RPP,
had assured his party that he has enough votes to pass the
no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
The political crisis in the country erupted on January 8 when
Prime Minister Thapa, who came to power last October, recommended
the King to dissolve parliament and hold mid-term elections to
forestall a move by 96 MPs from the CPN-UML and his own party to
plan a censure motion against his coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, these MPs submitted a petition to King
Birendra demanding a special session of parliament to discuss
their no-confidence motion against the government.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, King Birendra took the Supreme Court's advice
and accepted the submission by the legislators.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Review Education Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to review its
national policy on education promulgated in 1981 and make the
French language compulsory in all secondary schools in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Far reaching decisions are expected to be discussed at the
National Council on Education meeting later this month, the
Guardian reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian head of state General Sani Abacha has been personally
advocating French as the second official language of the country,
which is surrounded by French-speaking countries and suffering
setbacks in its relations with English-speaking western
countries.
</P>
<P>
The program is also expected to boost economic and trade
relations with French-speaking countries in the west African
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
As the first step to popularize French, Nigeria set up a
French language center in Lagos later last year and the
government is planning another in Nassarawa State in the central
part of the country near the national capital of Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a source close to the presidency
as disclosing that a decree on the adoption of French as an
officially recognized language in Nigeria is now before the head
of state.
</P>
<P>
A task force on the development of French headed by an eminent
linguist is underway to ensure effective implementation of the
policy on the language.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 15,000 teachers would be required
for the program in secondary schools, with each school having two
teachers.
</P>
<P>
France has expressed its willingness to assist in the program,
suggesting that Nigeria facilitate French teaching by massive
recruitment of qualified teachers from neighboring
French-speaking countries.

<HEADLINE> Israel Probing Report on Egypt Trade Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel is probing the report
that Egypt has banned the import of a variety of Israeli goods,
local English daily The Jerusalem Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Foreign Ministry's legal adviser Alan
Baker has recommended a meeting of the joint Israeli-Egyptian
trade committee to examine a report on the Egyptian daily Al
Ahram that Egypt is banning import of Israeli medicines,
cosmetics and other items.
</P>
<P>
A report published on Al Ahram late last month quoted Egypt's
Deputy Health Minister Jamila Moussa as saying that stringent
instructions have been given to customs stations to ban the entry
of Israeli medicines, cosmetics and some other goods.
</P>
<P>
Baker said that if the report is true, Egypt would be in
violation of both the 1979 peace treaty and the 1980 trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry is analyzing a document from Baker
listing three agreements which may have been breached. According
to the agreements, the countries should allow free movement of
goods, vehicles and nationals, and both sides should inform the
other of any change in trade relationship.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny confirmed the
report on the Al Ahram, but he noted that the Egyptian measures
are similar to those already imposed by Israel banning the import
of Egyptian textiles or water pipes. He stressed that Egyptian
government's strategy is not to place obstacles or prevent trade
with Israel, but rather let the market to regulate it.
</P>
<P>
One Israeli Foreign Ministry official was quoted by the
Jerusalem Post as saying that while this issue is serious, Israel
will keep a low-key profile in dealing with the matter because
Israel does not want to hurt the already strained bilateral ties
caused by the deadlock in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between Israel and Egypt totaled 85 million
U.S. dollars last year, compared to 60 million dollars in
1996. Israeli pharmaceutical export to Egypt last year rose
slightly from 11,100 dollars in 1996 to 11,500 dollars, and
Egypt's textiles export to Israel increased from 1.7 million
dollars to 3.1 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> WB to Grant One Billion Dollars to Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has agreed to
provide one billion U.S. dollars in loans this year to help the
Philippines deal with the effects of the current financial crisis,
WB President James Wolfensohn said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn, who is on a five-nation tour in Asia, said that the
loans would be on top of the 350 million dollars the World Bank
programmed for the country annually.
</P>
<P>
"I indicated to them that in addition to the 350 million
dollars that we typically advance each year, we are looking at a
special program of one billion dollars to cover structural
reforms, social sector and infrastructure that may be provided
urgently as you need it," he said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wolfensohn praised the Philippines for weathering
the financial crisis better than its neighbors hit by the
financial turmoil, although he said that there was still a need to
tighten supervision of the banking system.
</P>
<P>
"What is very clear is that the Philippine situation is largely
different from South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While there are also some disturbances, while quite obviously
the foreign exchange market has weakened, the stock market has
weakened, I think you all know that you (the Philippines) have
weakened less than the region with the exception of Singapore," he
said.
</P>
<P>
During his 24-hour visit to the Philippines, Wolfensohn met
with President Fidel Ramos, economic managers, business executives
and trade union leaders.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn commended Ramos for doing a remarkable job by
putting in social, economic and political reforms, thereby making
the Philippines the "least affected country" in the currency
storm.
</P>
<P>
Ramos briefed Wolfensohn on the economic situation in the
country and the remaining measures the government is taking,
including strict implementation of sound fiscal management and
discipline, to contain the effects of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn is leaving for South Korea Friday. He has also
visited Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.

MOSCOW -- A Russian official has denounced allegations made in
a U.S. State Department report on human rights. Gennady Tarasov,
director of the foreign ministry's press bureau, said Thursday
that the U.S. report failed to take into consideration Russia's
democratic progress.
</P>
<P>
The report, Tarasov said, which is similar to previous ones, is
full of flaws. He said the report evaluates the Russian human
rights situation according to American laws and practices.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said the report not only shows disrespect for the
status of Russian laws, but also neglects the human rights
practices of other nations. (Russia-US-Human Rights)

WASHINGTON -- The United States will provide 200,000 tons of
food for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in
response to a United Nations appeal for humanitarian aid, the
State Department said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a briefing that
a U.S. team visited the DPRK last year and confirmed outside
assessments that the 1997 harvest "fell well short" of meeting the
nation's food needs and substantial food aid would be needed to
avert serious food shortages this year. (US-DPRK-Food Aid)

<HEADLINE> Chinese Support Opening-Up  Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A recent opinion poll revealed
that Chinese citizens are fully satisfied with the remarkable
successes achieved since the country adopted reform and opening-up
policies nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The poll was taken by the Beijing Horizon Market Survey &AMP;
Analysis Company.
</P>
<P>
The survey of over 5,000 permanent residents in ten large
cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and
Shenyang, indicated that 34.6 percent of respondents felt that
China has reached an appropriate opening-up level, with 24.9
percent indicating that the country should open wider to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one percent noted the imbalance in opening-up levels for
different regions throughout the nation, and 11 percent indicated
that the pace of opening-up should be slowed somewhat.
</P>
<P>
When compared to a similar survey in 1995, the number of
respondents satisfied with the current status of the opening-up
effort jumped by 14 percent, with the number citing regional
imbalances falling by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey suggests that the fall in the latter figure resulted
from China's increased emphasis on reform and opening-up in inland
and western areas, and improving management policies governing
foreign capital.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Former World No. 1 Andre
Agassi is backing to his form and may be leading the United States
against Russia when the two battle in a first-round Davis Cup
matchup.
</P>
<P>
"He certainly is strongly considering playing," Davis Cup
captain Tom Gullikson said. "He didn't commit 100 percent to it,
but obviously he has got some great feelings about Atlanta."
</P>
<P>
The three-day Davis Cup competition will be held April 3-5 at
Stone Mountain, Georgia, in the site where Agassi won the gold
medal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Agassi had a disastrous 1997, falling to 141st in the world,
but is currently in the midst of a strong comeback that has seen
him raise his ranking to 71. In four tournaments since he began
his comeback, he has reached three finals, winning one.

<HEADLINE> Waste Water Treatment Plant in Operation in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Zhengzhou
Waste Water Treatment Plant, the biggest in the Huaihe River
valleys, has begun in Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan
Province, the People's Daily has reported.
</P>
<P>
The 761 million yuan (92 million US dollars) project, which is
being built with loans from Japan and the State Development Bank,
will be able to treat 400,000 tons of waste water a day when its
first phase is completed.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River runs through Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong
provinces, the country's major grain and energy producers.
Located on the upper reaches of the river, Zhengzhou
discharges nearly a million tons of waste water into the river
each day.
</P>
<P>
The water quality of the river, one of China's longest,
is showing signs of improving thanks to a massive pollution
control campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
On January 1 this year, the anti-pollution battle entered its
second phase.
</P>
<P>
The country has planned to build 47 urban waste water treatment
plants in the valleys by the year 2000. The plants are expected to
cut the release of pollutants by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that China will spend nearly 20 billion yuan
on pollution control projects in the Huaihe River valleys during
the 1998-2000 period.

LOS ANGELES, February 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 60,000 soaked
books from a library at Stanford University have been moved to a
local cold storage company to be freeze-dried.
</P>
<P>
Two days' drenching rains caused by El Nino earlier this week
hit California hard, flooding the whole campus and the library's
basement where 120,000 books were shelved.
</P>
<P>
The whole drying process will take three months and the vast
majority of the volumes could be restored and returned to library
shelves, according to engineers.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, another Stanford library was flooded and
44,000 books were damaged. Most of the books later got preserved
with the help of Lockheed Missile and Space Co. which offered a
vacuum chamber for use in the drying process.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Scores Technological Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning, a traditional heavy
industrial base in northeast China, invested 24 billion yuan in
technological transformations during 1997, up 20 percent on the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of investment went to 250 key projects at 26
provincial technical centers and 100 experimental high-tech
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,300 local industrial firms had used foreign funding to
upgrade their technology by the end of last November.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government plans to allocate 24.5 billion yuan
to upgrade the technology of the ten key projects in six pillar
industrial sectors during 1998, including the computer and
software, new materials, modern telecommunications,
bio-pharmaceutical sector, electric machinery, and fine chemical
industry, and their 1998 output value is expected to reach 50
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The sector will attract 1.5 billion yuan from abroad to
facilitate the technological cooperation between medium- to
large-sized local state-owned firms and the world's top 500
companies.
</P>
<P>
A mere 10 percent of equipment in Liaoning's state-owned
enterprises was installed during the 1980s, with obsolete
equipment dating to the 1950s, accounting for 30 percent of the
remainder.

SHANGHAI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Consulting agencies always
willing to listen to Shanghai's senior citizens have helped the
city's elderly people escape feelings of loneliness, sociologists
here said.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,200 consulting agencies in Shanghai, China's largest
commercial and economic center, provide comfort to senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Many of the agencies are staffed by highly educated elderly
people who discuss problems with those in need, offer advice and
help solve problems.
</P>
<P>
Other agencies seek to enrich the knowledge of senior citizens
in areas such as medicine, psychology, sociology and law, and some
offer household services.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that some 2.3 million elderly citizens at or
above the age of 60 account for 18.2 percent of the city's total
population.

"Shanghai currently faces pressing challenges related to its
aging population," sociologists said.

<HEADLINE> Official Calls for Early Political Talks Across Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- An official in charge of
relations across the Taiwan Straits has said that high-level political
talks between the mainland and Taiwan are so crucial that they
cannot be sidestepped.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, vice-chairman of the mainland-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), was quoted in a
recent interview with Beijing's monthly "Cross-Straits Relations"
as saying the political talks are unavoidable for cross-strait
relations this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Jiang Zemin and Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
have repeatedly called for talks to end the hostilities, under the
one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
There has been no explicit response from Taiwan authorities so
far, he said, but the significance of these talks is recognized by
a growing number of Taiwanese, and it is high time that the two
sides held procedural talks.
</P>
<P>
If ARATS and SEF (the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation)
can meet, he said, they could make proper arrangements to talk
about the agenda, the capacity of representatives, and in what way
the talks should be held. But, these negotiations depend on the
sincerity of the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed the hope that contacts between ARATS and SEF can
be increased this year and that there can be visits of senior
officials. He said that ARATS will continue to promote exchanges
and visits, including those of mayors and county heads.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- An environmental
protection project in central China's Henan Province has been put
into operation recently.
</P>
<P>
The Zhengzhou Golden Dragon Cement Co Ltd, the largest so far
in Henan, was built at a cost of 299 million yuan (37 million US
dollars). It produces 660,000 tons of cement a year, by consuming
200,000 tons of coal dust as raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The thermal power plants in Henan, with a combined generating
capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts, discharge a large
amount of coal dust every year, seriously polluting the
environment.

<HEADLINE> More Telephone Lines Installed in Yangon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- More telephone lines are being
installed in Yangon, capital of Myanmar, and new communications
systems are also being introduced, according to Myanmar posts and
telecommunications sources.
</P>
<P>
There were 88,000 telephones in Yangon out of a total of
195,494 in the whole country at the end of August 1997, operating
with 21 exchange stations. There were only 73,545 in the country
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,000 more telephone lines for three townships in
the capital are due to be added by March, the end of the present
fiscal year (1997-98).
</P>
<P>
As the expansion of telephone use in Yangon exceeded the
numbering capacity, the numbering in the city was changed to 6
from 5 digits in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Following extensive use of cellular phones in Yangon, which now
has 2,000 lines, Myanmar began introducing the United-States-made
CDMA radio-telephone system in the capital last October, setting
up initially 3,000 lines at two stations. Each station has a
16-kilometer communication radius covering 22 townships.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of a digital micro-wave system in the
country in 1995, the capital has been able to link nine other
cities through the system, ensuring smooth and direct trunk
calls.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the capital is able to connect 14 remote border towns
through local satellite stations set up in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Myanmar has a total of 80
auto-exchange stations and 416 manual exchange stations in the
whole country, operating nearly 200,000 telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign companies from Australia, Israel, Germany,
Japan, Singapore and the United States have in recent years been
involved in the installation of new telephone communications
systems in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar introduced its first computer communications system
last November in its latest move to improve the country's
telecommunication links at home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 46 From Philippine Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-five mangled bodies were
retrieved Friday morning in the crash site of a DC-9 plane on a
southern Philippine ridge, bringing the death toll to 46, rescuers
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting more bodies since a bigger portion of the
aircraft's fuselage crashed in our area," Gerald Navarro, a leader
of a local mountaineering club, reported Friday morning from Mt.
Lumot in Claveria Town, Misamis Oriental Province.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers from the club Thursday morning reached Mt. Lumot, a
nearby ridge of Mt. Sumagaya where the Cebu Pacific Airways' DC-9
plane crashed and exploded Monday.
</P>
<P>
"A bigger portion of the aircraft remains intact but it is
covered by soil due to landslide when the aircraft hit the
ground," Navarro added.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine plane carrying 104 people was on its way to
Cagayan de Oro City from Manila Monday morning when it crashed 15
minutes before it was supposed to land. All aboard were feared
dead.
</P>
<P>
"We have now accounted for 40 bodies, including the 11 bodies
accounted Thursday afternoon, and the number may rise if the
aircraft is cleared of soil," Navarro said.
</P>
<P>
According to Navarro, the bodies strewn over Mt. Lumot were
badly mutilated, some of them naked, but could be identified by
experts.
</P>
<P>
Six other bodies were separately accounted for by ground rescue
groups in Mt. Sumagaya headed by Col. Jacinto Ligot Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
The bodies will be transported to Cagayan de Oro City for
forensic examination.
</P>
<P>
The weather condition in the vicinity of the crash site was
favorable but air rescuers still failed to drop supplies to
Navarro's men due to the dense forest.
</P>
<P>
Navarro said helicopters could not land until a landing pad was
made in the area. "But, we need chainsaws to clear the forest
since trees in the crash site are big."
</P>
<P>
He said their group needed deodorizer powder, gloves, shovel
and cadaver bags.

COLOMBO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's tea output in 1997
reached an all-time high of 276.9 million kilograms, a seven
percent increase over the previous high of 258.4 million kilograms
in 1996, The Island newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, while the high and medium grown tea production showed
significant increases last year, production of low grown tea
dropped, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
High grown tea production in 1997 was 83.8 million kilograms,
compared with 72.2 million kilograms the previous year. Medium
grown tea production went up from 48 million kilograms in 1996 to
57 million kilograms last year.
</P>
<P>
Local tea experts have said this year's tea production might
encounter some difficulties due to a lasting draught which hit
this island nation early January.
</P>
<P>
Tea output this year could also be affected by the El Nino
phenomenon, they said.
</P>
<P>
Tea is a traditional export item of Sri Lanka.

NEW DELHI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Following up his January 30
letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton and the heads of the other
four permanent members of the United Nations Security Council on
the escalating Iraqi crisis, Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral Thursday wrote a letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan for the same purpose, official sources said here Friday.
</P>

In his letter, Gujral reiterated India's support for the U.N.
resolutions relating to Iraq while stating that the use of
military force against Iraq would only serve to complicate the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Any military conflict would aggravate the enormous suffering
that the Iraqis had undergone under the sanctions regime, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Gujral expressed his concern particularly for the plight of
women and children who were the most adversely affected section of
the people and were the main victims of malnutrition and shortage
of medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the U.N. secretary general's plea to accord
primacy to the process of diplomatic negotiations and his offer of
mediation and reiterated India's readiness to contribute to the
process of bringing about a peaceful solution through diplomatic
parleys.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Labor Minister John
Seneviratne has called for the plantation management companies and
trade unions to hold another round of talks Friday in a bid to end
a nation-wide strike which began on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ceylon Planters Association Chairman Mahendra Amarasuriya said
representatives of the association would attend the meeting
convened by the minister to settle the dispute over a wage hike.
</P>
<P>
About 600,000 workers in tea and rubber estates began the
strike Thursday after talks with their employers broke down.
</P>
<P>
The unions demanded a wage hike from the present daily salary
of 83 Rupees (1.34 U.S. dollars) to 105 Rupees (1.69 dollars)
while their companies only agreed to pay 93 Rupees (1.5 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Seneviratne had intervened on Tuesday, urging the companies to
offer 100 Rupees (1.61 dollars) as a compromise.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts have warned that a minimum seven Rupees
increase on the basic wage would cost the industry at least 1
billion Rupees (16.1 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The last strike by estate workers was in April 1996. It lasted
one week and cost an estimated 500 million Rupees (8.1 million
dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 6 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch trod a political tightrope
on Friday when he said at a press conference that he supported both
U.S. president Clinton and U.N. resolution against military action
during the games.
</P>
<P>
"Our hope -- and I repeat I can only say hope -- is that the
Olympic Truce will be observed."
</P>
<P>
The Olympic chief believed that president Clinton could find a
proper way to solve the problem. "I'm sure he'll find diplomatic
efforts to convince Iraq to respect the U.N.," he said, adding his
voice to the mounting IOC and U.N. effort to have some impact on
American policy in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Washington said the United States has warned that it
may take military action against Iraq unless it allows U.N. inspectors
unrestricted access in carrying out the weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Samaranch also emphasized in the press conference he was
not opposed to the American stance.
</P>
<P>
"I am not against the position of the President Clinton. Clinton
said many times he prefers a diplomatic solution. This is our
position, too," he added.
</P>
<P>
When being asked whether he would travel to the United States or
Iraq as he did to Sarajevo at the Lillehammer Olympic Winter Games
four years ago, the president said:"the power of the Olympic Truce is
limit. We have done what we could possibly do."

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Proposes Regional Trade Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad has proposed a regional trade plan for using
local currencies instead of the U.S. dollar to make purchases in
efforts to ease the currency turbulence hitting Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir made the proposal during his talks with Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would encourage buyers from a member country of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to use their
own currency to make purchases, and the central banks in the
region would help clear the transactions within three months.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers Friday quoted some Thai officials as saying
that Mahathir's proposal would be feasible among Malaysia, the
Philippines and Thailand because their economies are of compatible
sizes.
</P>
<P>
Trading in local currencies would save ASEAN economies the fees
of buying U.S. dollars, the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir arrived here on Thursday and leaves on Friday to
continue his regional tour which will also take him to the
Philippines and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Violation of Flight Rules Caused Cable Car Crash: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The contact between the United
States Marines Prowler aircraft and the Mt. Cermis ski-lift cable
occurred because the plane flew under the cable line, a flight
plan which had not been authorized, Italian Defense Minister
Beniamino Andreatta said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint meeting of the House and Senate Defense Committees,
Andreatta said there would not have been any danger if the
aircraft kept to the rules.
</P>
<P>
He said the accident was "incomprehensible."
</P>
<P>
As to those who called for a halt to allied bases on Italian
territory, Andreatta warned against any move, based on the
emotions of the moment, which would weaken the ties that bind
Italy to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). This
would mean not only distancing Italy from the alliance but also
from European security, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi has sent
messages of condolence to the heads of government of the five
countries which lost citizens in the cable car crash, expressing
his sympathy for those who were killed in the cable car accident
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The messages were sent to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, Polish Prime Minister
Jerzy Buzee, Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima and Holland's Prime
Minister Wim Kok.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 people aboard on the cable car, including
Germans, Belgians, Poles, Austrians and Dutch were killed in the
cable car accident when the U.S. aircraft severed the cable line.

<HEADLINE> Soft-Money Gifts to Parties Last Year Total 67 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Democratic and Republican
national party organizations in the United States together raised
67 million dollars in unregulated "soft money" last year from
corporations, unions and rich patrons, an advocacy group said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure is a record for soft money raised in an off-election
year and more than double the amount raised in 1993, the last
post-presidential-election year, said Common Cause, which wants
such contributions outlawed.
</P>
<P>
Soft money donations are supposed to be used only for
party-building activities like voter registration, but Federal
Election Commission lawyers said last week the parties are finding
ways to circumvent campaign finance laws and use the money to help
federal candidates.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 election, the two parties raised 262 million
dollars in soft money, most of it from special interests.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is scheduled to vote next month on a bipartisan bill
that would eliminate such contributions.
</P>
<P>
Soft money is one of the fastest-growing and most controversial
types of fund-raising employed by the political parties. Critics
view the donations as a way for special interests to influence
politics; supporters see them as free speech.
</P>
<P>
"Banning soft money is a critically important first step to
address the worst abuses in the political system today... and to
help clean up the presidential system for the year 2000," said Ann
McBride, president of Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
The groups said in its analysis of FEC records that Republicans
raised 40 million dollars and Democrats took in 27 million dollars
in soft money last year.

<HEADLINE> 19 Killed in Storms in Eastern U.S. Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The storm dumped more than 18 centimeters of rain on Virginia
Beach, Virginia, and swept the South Jersey shoreline on Thursday
with tides 3.3 meters above normal.
</P>
<P>
A storm landed from the south coast and stomped its way north,
flooding streets, stranding travelers, forcing people to evacuate
their homes and leaving tens of thousands of people without
electricity across West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
It brought tornadoes to southern Florida on Monday before
churning to the north, hammering the coast from Georgia to New
Jersey with heavy rain and winds as high as 120 kph.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 customers along Tennessee's Cumberland Plateau
were without power Thursday. Thousands more lacked electricity in
Virginia, New Jersey, West Virginia, Delaware and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The storm also has brought snow that blanketed an area from
Ohio to North Carolina. In areas in Kentucky and Ohio, snowfalls
reached more than a 30 centimeters and in the hills of western
Maryland, 50 centimeters of snow were recorded.
</P>
<P>
19 deaths have been attributed to the East Coast storm. Five
were killed in accidents on snowy roads in Kentucky, and two in
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
Two men died when the roof caved in under 11 inches of snow at
a recycling plant in Princeton, West Virginia, and a pregnant
woman drowned when her car plunged into a swollen creek in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
A 20-car freight train heading to Roanoke, Virginia, derailed
Thursday morning after floodwaters from the Maury River swept away
an 25-meter section of track.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 house fires were reported in southeastern Virginia
caused by flood waters that spread into homes and soaked oil
heaters, sparking the blazes.
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters up to 1.3 meters deep along New Jersey's coast
forced authorities to close nearly all the access routes to
Atlantic City, Ocean City, Wildwood and other beach towns early
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the west, severe storm lashed California in the last few
days, leading to street flood in several counties. Governor Pete
Wilson has declared emergencies in 10 counties.

<HEADLINE> Water Storage Facilities Help Chinese Province Battle Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Water storage facilities
enabled farmers in central Gansu Province, which was hit by severe
drought in 1997, to enjoy sufficient grain and potable
water during this year's Spring Festival holidays.
</P>
<P>
"The five cisterns near my house will provide enough water for
us until May," said Yang Gong, a farmer in Lujiagou Township
in Dingxi County.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the water storage facilities in Lujiagou, an area
which recorded a mere 80 millimeters of rain in 1997, residents
had no longer to buy water from cities during the Spring
Festival holdays.
</P>
<P>
Yang's five cisterns are full due to ample rainfall in
August. Three cisterns are used to irrigate fruit trees and maize
and the two others provide ample water for the family and its
livestock.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 percent of the families in his village relied on water
storage facilities to raise their livestock. The facilities
enabled them to earn a steady income despite the drought.
</P>
<P>
Gansu, a drought-prone area in northwest China, has encouraged
the construction of water storage facilities as part of the
government poverty relief program.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Gansu farmers constructed over 440,000
water storage facilities in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 40 bodies had been
accounted for by rescuers as of early Friday morning at the crash
site of a DC-9 plane on a southern Philippine mountain, according
to local television reports.
</P>
<P>
Jesus Dureza, a rescue operation leader, told the SNN
television that more body parts believed to be from 29 victims had
been recovered by rescue teams early in the morning, bringing to
40 the number of bodies found.
</P>
<P>
He said the bodies will be moved by foot to the foot of Mt.
Sumagaya and be airlifted to nearby Cagayan de Oro City for
examination and identification.
</P>
<P>
Dureza said more body bags will be delivered to the crash site
as rescuers reported a shortage of bags because of too many
mangled bodies.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of casualties is still unknown as rescuers
continued to scour a one-kilometer-square slope where the Cebu
Pacific DC-9 jetliner crashed Monday and its wreckage and the
victims' bodies were strewn, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Hampered by rains, thick vegetation and snakes, by Friday
morning, rescuers had not yet reached the impact point of the
plane where part of its wreckage, including one of the two
engines, was first sighted by air rescuers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rescue officials said earlier there was little hope for any of
the 104 people aboard the ill-starred passenger plane to survive
five days after the crash, the worst ever in the Philippines'
aviation history.
</P>
<P>
The 99 passengers on board the plane included one Japanese, an
Austrian, a Swiss, at least two Americans, an Australian and at
least one Canadian.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine aircraft slammed into Mt. Sumagaya Monday
morning while approaching the nearby airport of Cagayan de Oro
City, some 800 km south of its departure place Manila.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A Russian official has denounced
allegations made in a U.S. State Department report on human rights.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Tarasov, director of the foreign ministry's press
bureau, said in a conference Thursday that the U.S. report failed
to take into consideration Russia's democratic progress.
</P>
<P>
The report, Tarasov said, which is similar to previous ones, is
full of flaws. He said the report evaluates the Russian human
rights situation according to American laws and practices.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said the report not only shows disrespect for the
status of Russian laws, but also neglects the human rights
practices of other nations.
</P>
<P>
Russia, of course, takes into consideration the American
experience. Russia however does not think the American attitude
toward human rights is the only correct one.
</P>
<P>
In response to the criticism of Russia's religious belief law,
he said the law does not exclude non-traditional religions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The restrictive provisions in the law are directed only toward
extreme doomsday religions, which threaten or violate human life,
family values and the morality of children, said Tarasov.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- China Pacific Insurance
Co. Ltd. collected insurance premiums totalling 13.17 billion yuan
in 1997, a year-on-year rise of 50.3 percent, according to a
report General Manager Li Xueqian presented at Thursday's annual

billion yuan, up 2.78 percent, and life insurance of 7.55
billion yuan, up 129.59 percent.
</P>
<P>
Li attributed growing premiums to risk prevention for property
insurance and the improved structure for life insurance.

The company has enhanced its reputation by providing insurance
for a number of large projects, including the massive Three Gorges
Project, Xiaolangdi Dam and the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant.

BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- In 1997, the combined
industrial output of development zones in Beijing was 25.1 billion
yuan, accounting for 14.6 percent of the city's total industrial
output, more than 6 times the figure of five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has 31 high-tech and economic development zones,
covering 256.6 sq.km. of ground. By the end of 1997, these zones
had 8,100 businesses, their investment totaling 58 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Rapid development of these zones is attributed to the quality
and efficiency of these enterprises, 80 percent of which are in
high-tech fields like electronic information, biological
engineering, new energy resources, and new materials.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 percent of Beijing's added industrial output value for
1997 resulted from new technologies.
</P>
<P>
The good investment environment was yet another factor in their
rapid development. The world's top 500 enterprises have put a
total of 2.2 billion US dollars into these development
zones.

SANTIAGO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei
returned to Santiago Thursday after ending his successful one-week
European tour.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Frei participated in the annual meeting of
the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He also visited
Spain.

which could assist in the integration of the continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Spain, the governments of the two countries agreed to
accelerate negotiations to provide a free trade agreement between
Chile and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress to Pass New Oil Deregulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' bicameral
Congress will ratify Friday a compromise version of the new oil
deregulation bill which is vital for the country's exit from the
supervision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
A bicameral committee, composed of representatives from both
the Lower House and the Senate, reached agreement Thursday night
on the proposed oil deregulation bill after more than one month of
bargaining.
</P>
<P>
The old oil deregulation law, which took effect in February
1997, was nullified by the Supreme Court last November on the
grounds that it violated the constitution and the rule of free
trade.
</P>
<P>
The law provided for a 7 percent tariff for refined petroleum
products, and a 3 percent tariff for crude oil, to encourage firms
to invest in the domestic refinery industry.
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court ruled that free trade would be hindered
if oil firms were forced to choose between investing huge amounts
in refineries and paying higher tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The abolishment of the old oil deregulation law prevented the
country from getting free from decades of economic supervision by
the IMF before the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise oil bill, a uniform 3 percent tariff will
be imposed on both finished oil products and crude oil. The
proposal for a uniform tariff for all oil products was actually
approved by President Fidel Ramos late last year.
</P>
<P>
The bill also provides a 2.9 billion pesos (71 million U.S.
dollars) buffer fund to subsidize oil companies during a
five-month transition period prior to the full deregulation of the
country's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
During the period, oil companies are barred from jacking up
prices of "socially sensitive" products like kerosene and diesel.
But the transition period is "flexible" and Ramos is empowered to
reduce its length for those oil products that are not socially
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
Because of the delayed passage of the new oil deregulation
bill, many new entrants in the local oil industry are considering
closing their operations and put on hold their new investments in
the country.

NANJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
has begun to reduce the number of spindles, as a reform measure to
reshape its textile industry.
</P>
<P>
Provincial government sources said that Jiangsu will take two
years to meet the State-set quota of reducing the spindle number
by 1.01 million. This means that 60,869 textile workers will be
laid off.
</P>
<P>
This year is crucial for the industrial reforms, according to
Governor Zheng Silin.
</P>
<P>
He said that 840,700 spindles will be cut this year and 176,000
in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Share Flotation to Help Chinese Tourist City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Guilin, one of the most popular
and oldest tourist spots in China, plans to issue shares in
China's interior area and in Hongkong to try to save its
money-starved travel industry.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jiacheng, director of the Guilin Tourism Bureau, told
Xinhua that Guilin Tourism Co. Ltd. (GTC) hopes to raise over 1.7
billion yuan (204.8 million US dollars) in this way. It has 700
million yuan in assets and counts major local hotels, scenic
spots, and other tourism enterprises as its main shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to help raise funds for an international
convention and exhibition center, a sports center, a holiday
resort, and for the renovation of old hotels and to open new
tourist routes, all of which are badly needed or even crucial to
maintaining its charm, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Guilin is in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It's known
for its Lijiang River and the surrounding mountains. In 1996, it
had 408,800 overseas tourists who brought in 118.4 million US
dollars, and 10 million domestic tourists. But, its tourism, which
grew by leaps and bounds, has suffered from a shortage of funds in
recent years. This has aroused concern in the central government,
according to Gao Shunli, an official with the China National
Tourism Administration's Department of Policy and Law.
</P>
<P>
"Guilin's importance can never be overestimated because it is
one of the five major attractions with Beijing, Xi'an, Shanghai,
and Guangzhou and its ranking in the country's tourism industry is
quite impressive, when one considers that it is not a provincial
capital," Gao said
</P>
<P>
"We've got everything ready for the listing and are only
waiting for central government approval," Huang explained.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is supporting the listing, and
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji personally wrote instructions on documents
related to the matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
When tourism in Guilin develops, it is expected to bring more
tourists to other parts of south China, he said.

<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Rescue operations in the
Philippine air crash entered the fifth day Friday after 11 bodies
and many body parts had been found at the crash site of a DC-9
plane on a southern jungle-covered mountain as of Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Local television reports quoted rescue officials as saying
there is little hope for any of the 104 people aboard the
ill-fated passenger plane to survive five days after the crash,
the worst ever in the Philippine history.
</P>
<P>
Jesus Dureza, a rescue operation leader, told reporters that
rescuers had retrieved six bags of scattered body parts and 11
bodies in the surrounding vicinity of Mt. Sumagaya in Claveria
Town, Misamis Oriental Province as of 6 p.m. local time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plane's 99 passengers included one Japanese, an Austrian, a
Swiss, at least two Americans, an Australian and at least one
Canadian.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine aircraft, owned by Cebu Pacific Airways,
slammed into Mt. Sumagaya Monday morning while trying to land at
the nearby airport of Cagayan de Oro City, some 800 km south of
its departure place Manila.
</P>
<P>
Bitterly cold rain and low visibility grounded helicopters for
much of the day and slowed rescue operations as rescuers crawled
along the steep slopes to recover the bodies and the wreckage of
the plane.
</P>
<P>
Dureza said rescuers had tried to move the bodies by air from
the crash site to Manibay, a military base in Claveria town on the
foot of Mt. Sumagaya, but failed due to bad weather in the area.
</P>
<P>
Dureza said the bodies could be transported by foot Friday
morning to Manibay where a group of forensic experts headed by the
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) will conduct examination to
identify the bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health is sending more mental health experts
to Calveria and Cagayan de Oro to provide disaster debriefing to
the hundreds of anguished relatives of the victims.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A comprehensive social
security system is taking shape in China's largest city of
Shanghai to provide relief for all the needy.
</P>
<P>
The system, named "Warmth Project", has in the last two years
issued more than 300 million yuan in relief to 500,000 needy
residents in the city to ensure minimum living standards.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 the municipality took the country's lead in
setting a bottom line to ensure minimum living standards for its
urban people. Following that, the bottom income line for laid-off
workers was also set to help financially-troubled state-owned
firms.
</P>
<P>
A computerized network has linked the needy together.
</P>
<P>
The Trade Union of Shanghai, which focuses its efforts on
helping the needy workers, has established files for 100,000 poor
workers and issues 40 million yuan in relief for them every year.
</P>
<P>
The project also takes measures to help those residents who are
financially stranded and seriously ill. Governments, communities,
hospitals and individuals are asked to join hands to shoulder the
burden.

WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
provide 200,000 tons of food for the Democratic People's Republic

humanitarian aid, the State Department said on Thursday.

State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a briefing that

assessments that the 1997 harvest "fell well short" of meeting the
nation's food needs and substantial food aid would be needed to
avert serious food shortages this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. assistance will be targeted at children in
nurseries; schools and orphanages; pregnant and nursing women;
handicapped people and hospital patients.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Asia Crisis Dampens Canadian Growth This Year, Thiessen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis will
"have a dampening effect" on Canada's economic growth this year,
Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yet, "there are also other, more positive developments that
could well work to mitigate this effect," Thiessen said in a
speech to Saint John Board of Trade, New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Asian financial turbulence "has become a more
widespread problem than anyone would have thought likely some
months back."
</P>
<P>
The crisis direct effects on the Canadian economy will be
"relatively modest", since Canada's trade with Asia makes up less
than 10 percent of its total exports.
</P>
<P>
However, "the implications of the Asian crisis for global
economic growth and for primary commodity prices on world markets
will probably have a more important impact on Canada than the
reduction of our exports to Asia."
</P>
<P>
"The fallout from Asia will no doubt have a dampening effect on
Canadian output growth for the current year," the governor noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear, however, that economic growth in 1998 will not be
as robust as appeared likely last fall," Thiessen said.
</P>
<P>
"And some Canadian regions and industries, particularly those
with heavier reliance on primary commodities and exports to Asia,
will no doubt feel the impact more than others."
</P>
<P>
The governor also stressed that Canadian economic outlook
"remains positive".
</P>
<P>
With its low inflation and improved fiscal position, "the
Canadian economy is now in better shape to withstand the impact of
the Asian crisis and to continue to make headway in improving the
well-being of Canadians," he concluded.

session before ending 10.6 points up at 5,606.4 as late
profit-taking took the market off the fresh record high.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that unchanged UK, US and German interest rates,
hopes of further big mergers and solid overnight performances in
Asian markets had propelled the London market to a new high.
</P>
<P>
But Wall Street's inability to hold early opening gains
contributed to London's late retreat.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt closed a quiet floor trade session
61.51 points higher at 4,548.46, with sentiment buoyed by gains on
Asian markets and positive technical factors.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index ended 23.34 points up at 3,189.60, a fresh
record close although well down from a historic intra-day high as
profit-taking wiped some of its earlier gains.
</P>
<P>
The softer dollar and weaker Wall Street also curbed the
market's advance.

by the book" and making significant progress.

our job. It is not to engage in politics."

WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton has
decided to send about 2,200 U.S. Marines on board warship from the
Mediterranean to the Gulf to join the already might military force
in the region as time ticks close to a possible military showdown

General Anthony Zinni, chief of the U.S. Central Command and the
commander of all American forces in the Middle East.
