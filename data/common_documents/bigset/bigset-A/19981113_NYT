 UNDATED: Saints, 14-7.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Ravens (3-6) at Chargers (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: You know a team is in a desperate state when it
benches the franchise quarterback, Ryan Leaf, for a backup that
last year was 0-7, Craig Whelihan. The saving grace for San Diego
has been the defense. The Chargers have given up just 254 yards a
game, especially impressive since the team hasn't led the NFL in
defense since 1965. It seems like its been that long since the
Ravens got a win.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers, 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks (5-4) at Raiders (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Quietly, one of the best quarterbacks in the league
has been Donald Hallas. Donald Hallas? He replaced Jeff George
three weeks ago and his play, combined with a defense that has
allowed just two touchdowns in the last 10 quarters, means that
Oakland Coach Jon Gruden is in the running for coach of the year.
Seattle has a solid defense of its own and lead the NFL in sacks
with 37. Quarterback Warren Moon has traditionally done well
against the Raiders _ he is 3-1 in his past four starts against
Oakland _ but this Raiders defense is too good right now. Moon gets
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 17-15
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys (6-3) at Cardinals (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Cardinals are over .500 for the first time since
the football was invented. They are talking about how they have a
chance to win the division. Next year, they will be good. This
year, the NFC East belongs to Dallas. The Cowboys are 5-0 in the
division, including 3-0 on the road. Their offensive line is
playing out of this world, allowing just 10 sacks, a league low. In
its last five games against Arizona, the Cowboys have given up just
five sacks. Arizona has done a great job of trying to shake its
recent sorry past and there is no doubt they will be a contender
next year. Just not now.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys, 24-17
</P>
<P>
   Packers (6-3) at Giants (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Packers are an angry team. They aren't used to
getting beat up on Monday Night Football like they were against
Pittsburgh. So they will come into the Giants game with a giant
chip on their shoulder. There is no way the Giants offensive line
can contain the Packers' front four. Defensive end Reggie White has
12 sacks in what has been a tremendous year. Plus, he's never
sacked Giants quarterback Danny Kanell and White would love to add
another trophy to the mantle. Something else to keep in mind: The
Packers are 22-7 against non-division teams since 1995 including
4-1 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 41-17.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers (4-5) at Jaguars (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Tampa Bay plays well against the AFC, winning 5 of the
past 7. But this isn't just any AFC team. The Jaguars are one of
the top five teams in the game and they've won 18 of the past 20
games at home. Their offense has been incredible, outscoring teams
66-13 in the first half of the past two games. Tampa Bay simply
does not have the offensive firepower to stay with Jacksonville.
The Buccaneers' only hope is fullback Mike Alstott. The team is 7-0
when he has at least 100 all-purpose yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville, 31-21.
</P>
<P>
   Bears (3-6) at Lions (2-7)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Earlier this season, the Bears held running back Barry
Sanders to just 28 yards rushing on 14 carries. Sanders will likely
improve on those numbers, but not by much. The Lions have evolved
into a bad team, a very bad team, and it wasn't lost on some
players when after Detroit's loss to Philadelphia last week, Coach
Bobby Ross was blaming the players. The cracks are becoming the
Grand Canyon. Detroit needs to get Pro Bowl wide receiver Herman
Moore back into the offense to have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Bears, 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Broncos (9-0) at Chiefs (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Broncos have a chance to become just the 16th team
in NFL history to start 10-0, but they have to get by the Chiefs.
It seems no matter how well the other team is playing, these
hard-hitting and intense games are always close. The last 4 at
Arrowhead Stadium have been decided by 3 points or less. Chiefs
quarterback Rich Gannon gets the start and if it isn't obvious by
now it should be _ he's better than Elvis Grbac. His scrambling
ability will give the Broncos fits and while Coach Mike Shanahan is
the best coach in the game right now, he's still not God. Not yet.
Even Shanahan loses a few and this is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs, 34-31.

MALONE DENIES MONDESI DEAL IS CLOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Driving across Florida on Thursday afternoon,
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone had a lot to consider.
</P>
<P>
   There were the discussions he had with Cincinnati at the GM
meetings in Naples that would send Gold Glove right fielder Raul
Mondesi to the Reds in exchange for shortstop Barry Larkin and
outfielder Reggie Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, according to sources, think the deal is close. Malone
disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin ($5.7 million) and Sanders ($3.3 million) are entering
the final seasons of multiyear contracts. The Dodgers would have to
pay more the first season since Mondesi will make $8.5 million in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   But it will help the club in future years afford free-agent
right-hander Kevin Brown, who is seeking a six-year, $72 million
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was discussed, but there is nothing to it, nothing on the
table,'' Malone said of the Mondesi deal. ``There are a lot of
hypotheticals in meetings like that. I've had discussion with 29
teams involving hundreds of players. You look for a fit, but it
doesn't mean there is a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone also had a chance to ponder the dinner he had in Tampa on
Wednesday with All-Star outfielder Gary Sheffield, just hours after
Sheffield's teammate and good friend Bobby Bonilla was traded to
the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, it was Sheffield's name that came up in trade
talks, one of a dozen proposed deals that have been floating in the
gray area between rotisserie league and blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was driving to the Dodgers' spring-training base in Vero
Beach, on the east coast of Florida, for several days of
organizational meetings.
</P>
<P>
   There, he will evaluate the proposals from the Naples meetings.
He also will formulate plans for pursuing Brown, free-agent
left-hander Randy Johnson and switch-hitting catcher Todd Hundley
of the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Malone has vowed to trade anyone to make the Dodgers better,
``even my mother if it would improve the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The only untouchable is pitcher Chan Ho Park, who, at Malone's
suggestion, pulled out of the ongoing series in Japan between
major-leaguers and Japanese All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   With back-to-back 30-home-run seasons, though, Mondesi has been
considered a cornerstone to the Dodgers future.
</P>
<P>
   But as with the $50 million the club owes Sheffield during the
next five years, Mondesi's long-term contract hurts the Dodgers'
financial flexibility. He is owed an average of $9 million for the
next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   There also are many in the organization who believe Mondesi, 27,
never will reach his enormous potential. He remains undisciplined
at the plate and did not draw a base on balls from June 30 to Aug.
11 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, who turns 35 in April, has had a Hall of Fame career in
his native Cincinnati, but he expressed a desire to leave last
season after a series of salary purges. The Reds, however, are
expected to buy out frugal majority owner Marge Schott and have
vowed to increase payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, 31, has been slowed by injuries the past few seasons
after a career year under Reds manager Davey Johnson, now with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The combined salaries for Larkin and Sanders in 1999 will be
roughly $1 million more than Mondesi. Dodgers slick-fielding
utility infielder Juan Castro, who signed a two-year deal with the
club on Thursday, was included in the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sheffield, who could not be reached for comment, Malone
said the Bonilla trade did not appear to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found our dinner very positive,'' Malone said. ``Bobby Bo is
a friend of his, but he knows what we're trying to do. We're trying
to put the best possible team on the field.''

BOGUS ID SEIZURE WORTH $80 MILLION, FEDS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Federal agents have seized more than 2 million
fake identity papers, exposing a thriving underground market that
officials said served illegal immigrants, criminals and even
college students.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest raid of its kind, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service said Thursday it confiscated $80 million in
bogus Social Security cards, driver's licenses and other identity
papers in Los Angeles and suburban Eagle Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were stacked from the floor to the ceiling in a 10-by-12
storage room,'' said Aaron Wilson, INS supervisory special agent.
``I and my investigators were stunned to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents were sold nationwide and across Los Angeles and
the suburban San Fernando Valley, with nearly 90 percent ending up
in the hands of illegal immigrants who needed IDs to secure jobs,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some were sold to criminals seeking a new identity or to defraud
credit card companies, cash traveler's checks and commit welfare
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But what surprised agents the most during their four-month
surveillance of the suspected ringleader's restaurant in the city's
MacArthur Park area is that the customers included college students
from UCLA and USC who wanted fake IDs so they could drink
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Some got while-you-wait service from restaurant employees in
just 15 minutes, but others had to return the next day, Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were doing hand-to-hand transactions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers would turn over an ID-size photograph and the
necessary biographical information and then specify what kind of ID
they wanted, such as a California driver's license, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents confiscated the fake licenses but didn't arrest the
students so as not to hinder the investigation into the
counterfeiting ring, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to buy IDs, he said, adding, ``I could probably do
it with a police-raid jacket on.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the INS, the seizures were a crushing blow to the
United States' biggest distributor of fraudulent documents, which
has been linked to 80 other INS cases nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, MacArthur Park and Huntington Park were the top
places to buy fake identification in Los Angeles, but the ring also
supplied sellers in several San Fernando Valley neighborhoods,
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Canoga Park, they operate on Sherman Way between Variel and
Independence, and in adjacent Van Nuys, they ply their trade near
the intersections of Victory and Kester with Van Nuys Boulevard,
Wilson said. Some also sell the counterfeit documents in nearby
Pacoima off Van Nuys Boulevard, he said.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests were made in the Valley in connection with last
week's raids.
</P>
<P>
   Nine men were arrested in the series of raids, including Juan
San German, a 30-year-old Mexican citizen believed to be the
ringleader, INS officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the seizure, the ring has already had an immeasurable
impact over at least six years of operation, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really could have an impact on the national economy,'' he
said. ``The quality is extremely good.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on information from confidential sources and from
documents seized in last week's raids, INS undercover special
agents on Tuesday searched two storage facilities, at 1282 Sunset
Blvd. and 3810 Eagle Rock Blvd., and found the stash of documents.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sunset Boulevard site, agents seized instructions for
operating a printing press, a print-negative machine, printing
plates and rollers, and four boxes of handgun and shotgun
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   In Eagle Rock, agents confiscated more than 2 million
counterfeit documents, enough paper materials to make 250,000 phony
INS permanent resident cards, and 95 printing plates used to make
the forged documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, a hundred thousand is a lot,'' said INS acting district
director Rosemary Melville, commenting on the magnitude of the
seizure.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the federal building downtown, INS
officials showed off the seized goods, including resident alien
cards, INS employment authorization cards, driver's licenses from
nine states including California, Social Security cards, Mexican
birth certificates and even California state vehicle title
certificates.
</P>
<P>
   The INS is searching for San German's sister, Rosa, who is
believed to be in this country and sometimes uses the alias Martha
Monnie Martinez. Juan San German was actually arrested on a Texas
warrant from a 1995 INS counterfeiting scheme and will be
extradited there before coming back to California to face trial,
Melville said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's investigation goes on, she said, so vendors of
fraudulent documents shouldn't think the worst is over. ``They
should indeed be very scared,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from MacArthur Park on Thursday afternoon, a
seller who appeared to be about 20 stood against a wall at the
southeast corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street, waiting
for customers willing to pay the $50 needed for a fake driver's
license. He had been in the country about a month, hadn't heard
anything about the arrests and the name Juan San German meant
nothing to him, he said in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any effect on sales of counterfeit documents, he
wasn't aware of it yet, he said. ``It's still easy to get them,''
he added, smiling.

HELP ON THE WAY FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Defensive help appears to be on the way for
the Kings, but not because of an early return from injury by Rob
Blake or Doug Bodger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's 6-foot-6, 222-pound defenseman Mark Visheau who is
almost ready to play six weeks after breaking his left hand in a
preseason fight with Stu Grimson of the Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson said Thursday that when Visheau is ready to
play in the very near future, he probably will replace rookie Jan
Nemecek in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   For Visheau, this comes not a moment too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hand feels really good,'' said Visheau, known for dropping
the gloves. ``I can do what I was able to do before. It's been five
years _ five long years _ as a pro to get to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Visheau, 25, was drafted by Winnipeg in 1992, and appeared in
one game for the Jets (now the Phoenix Coyotes) during the 1993-94
season. He hasn't played in an NHL game since, competing for eight
teams in three minor leagues in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to explain it,'' said Visheau, who signed
with the Kings as a free agent a year ago and played last season
for Milwaukee in the IHL. ``Pick something you've really wanted for
five years. It's not just a hockey game for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Another coach: Entering Thursday's game against Nashville, the
Kings had lost more faceoffs than they'd won in nine of their first
15 games, including the previous four. Additionally, in the
previous two games, they'd allowed key goals off faceoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Robinson had veteran center Ray Ferraro coaching the
Kings' other centers on faceoff technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been around a long time and he's a good faceoff man,''
Robinson said. ``He knows the little tricks. As he pointed out,
there's not enough importance given to faceoffs. If you win all
your faceoffs, you gain possession 100 percent of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Former King Jan Vopat has scored three of the four
goals this season by Nashville defensemen. The Kings sent Vopat to
Nashville in June in a trade for future considerations. . . .
Goalie Jamie Storr (groin strain) did not skate Thursday morning
but said he still intends to play a couple of games for the Long
Beach Ice Dogs when he is healthy. Storr practiced twice with the
Ice Dogs this week but stopped when soreness returned. ``I didn't
re-injure it,'' he said. ``I just don't think it was 100 percent.''
He is listed as day to day. . . . Robinson changed two of his
defensive pairings, playing Sean O'Donnell with Nemecek, and
Mattias Norstrom with Steve Duchesne. ``With Matti and Steve
Duchesne, we've got two of our fastest skaters together,'' Robinson
said. ``They can play against quicker lines. And O'Donnell's
steadying influence allows him to go with a younger kid.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVID Sine, the quarterbacks coach at Willis High School, will
get in his car this afternoon and start the long trek to Manhattan,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   So will Artis and Ethel Bishop, as they have done for every
Kansas State home game in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of the people in the little town 50 miles north
of Houston will be sitting in front of a TV Saturday afternoon,
hoping to see the hometown hero come through with a victory in the
most important game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Michael Bishop was leading the Willis Wildkats
to the state playoffs. Now, he is hoping to lead the Kansas State
Wildcats to a national championship. But the big hurdle comes this
weekend against Nebraska, a team Kansas State hasn't beaten in 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Michael is down to the big game,'' Sine said. ``He has
been waiting for this all year. It's finally here. Everybody in
Willis is excited about what Michael has done, and everybody will
be watching this game.''
</P>
<P>
   In four seasons of college football, Bishop's only loss came
last year at Nebraska. He led Blinn College to two national
championships, which never had been done in the NJCAA. Now, he has
a chance to lead Kansas State to its first national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael hates to lose,'' said Artis Bishop, Michael's father.
``He has been like that ever since he was playing at the YMCA as a
kid. Tears would well up in his eyes when he lost a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing is a rare occurrence for a team that has Bishop as its
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is the best player I've ever coached and probably the
best I ever will coach,'' Sine said. ``I'm very proud of him. But
the thing that's just as important to me is that Michael is on pace
to graduate in May. If he takes a full load next semester, he will
earn his degree (in social science).''
</P>
<P>
   It will be quite an achievement for a young man who had to go to
junior college first before he could get in a Division I school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael didn't have his core (curriculum) at that time,'' said
Willis head coach Mike Hufstetler. ``We thought Blinn would be a
good fit for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping he would end up at a Texas school. He came close
to going to Baylor when coach (Chuck) Reedy was there, but it looks
like he ended up in the right place at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's parents also would have liked to see their son stay in
Texas. ``But after we talked about it, I felt pretty good about him
going off,'' said Ethel Bishop, Michael's mother. ``He still calls
home every night, and sometimes he calls around midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethel Bishop is the job coach of the life-skills program at
Willis High for students who attend school half a day and work half
a day. When school ends on Friday, the Bishops are ready to hit the
road. They have attended every Kansas State game this season except
the Colorado game in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the Bishops also drive further north to watch
Michael's brother, Artis Jr., play fullback at Huron University, an
NAIA school in South Dakota. Artis Jr. is a year older than
Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are 8-2 this year and made the playoffs on the strength
of Artis' running,'' said Artis Sr. ``They are off this week, so
Artis Jr. is coming down to watch his brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethel Bishop is a little concerned about this trip because of
the snow that has fallen in the Midwest this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we may have to go through some bad weather this
time,'' she said. ``We've driven through rain going up there but
never snow. A couple of weeks ago, we had to work our way through
some flooded streets. But we've gotten used to the long drive now.
We just go straight through for 12 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long journey for Michael Bishop to reach this
point in his career as one of the best quarterbacks in the nation.
But Hufstetler said he never doubted Bishop would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew from the first day I saw him that he was going to be in
the NFL someday,'' Hufstetler said. ``He reminds me a lot of (Green
Bay Packers quarterback) Brett Favre because Michael is so strong
and so determined. He has that no-lose attitude, and he isn't
afraid to express it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a freshman, he started for us at wide receiver. I'm honored
to have had the opportunity to coach him. He did a fantastic job
when he was here. Michael is very talented, but he's also a very
hard worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Hufstetler said Bishop and Sine had a close relationship when
Bishop was in high school, and they have remained close four years
later. Sine made the trip to Arizona last year to see Bishop play
in the Fiesta Bowl. He hopes to go back in January, which would
mean a national-championship game for Bishop and the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We e-mail each other, and we talk on the phone once a week,''
Sine said. ``I consider Michael a friend. He has a lot of God-given
ability, but he also has a great work ethic. He gives 110 percent
at every practice. He is such a competitive person. He hates to
lose, and he wants to make up for that loss to Nebraska last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people would like to know how Bishop feels about the
situation, but Kansas State coach Bill Snyder does not allow Bishop
to talk to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop hasn't been allowed to speak to a reporter since the
Colorado game Oct. 10. Snyder also yanked Bishop away from a live
TV interview after a game last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael and I have talked about it a little,'' Sine said.
``But the bottom line is he's grateful for what coach Snyder has
done for him. I think Michael understands which people have taken
care of him along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bishop's parents aren't so sure, wondering if the lack of
media exposure has hurt Bishop's chances at winning the Heisman
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it quite a bit,'' Ethel Bishop said. ``But I
don't think Michael worries about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Artis Bishop said people often ask him why Michael doesn't get
the kind of publicity that Ricky Williams receives at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand that Michael has to get permission from
Bill before he can speak,'' Artis Bishop said. ``Snyder is like
that. One time, Snyder told Mike he has to be careful because the
media will twist things around.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the games, we wait for Mike to come out and ask him if
he talked to the media, but he says his name wasn't on the list. He
has been off-limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Artis Bishop said things started out differently this year
before Snyder was angered by a comment he saw in a Kansas paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone quoted Mike talking about (running back) Frank
Murphy,'' Artis said. ``They wrote that Murphy told Mike that the
first time he touched the ball on his own 20-yard line, he was
going to go 80 yards for a touchdown. But Mike told me he didn't
say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was it, because Bill believes in the team concept and
doesn't want one guy to stand out. But I don't know how much
difference it makes. I mean, look at all the attention Peyton
Manning got last year, but he didn't win the Heisman. All Mike
really wants to do is win the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   No Texas team has been in the running for the national title in
a long time, but Artis still would have liked to see his son play
closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice,'' Artis Bishop said. ``We all thought
he was going to Baylor, but Mike ran into so many situations that
he didn't expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop also considered Texas A&AMP;M and Texas, but he had specific
reasons for ruling out both schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;M flat-out told him that they wanted him to play wide
receiver,'' Artis Bishop said. ``But Mike told them he was going to
play quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike also talked to (former) coach (John) Mackovic at Texas,
but Mike knew James Brown had one year left. Mike asked Mackovic
about that, and Mackovic told him he wanted Mike to beat James out.
Mike thought about that awhile and said, `I'm not doing that to
that guy. He has worked too hard to get to this point.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was an academic formality that caused Bishop to
leave Texas. A junior-college player in Texas must pass the Texas
Academic Skills Program exam before he can take upper-division
classes or obtain an associate's degree, which is necessary to be
able to play for a Division I school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike took the TASP test, but something went wrong and they
told him he had to retake it,'' Artis Bishop said. ``By that time,
he saw that a lot of his teammates at Blinn were leaving the state
to go to Division I schools. Coaches were telling the kids they
could bypass the test by going to a school out of state.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, cornerback Keith Black of Waco Connally and wide
receiver Quincy Morgan of South Garland High all ended up at Kansas
State after leaving Blinn and transferring to a junior college in
Kansas. Bishop went to Independence Community College in Kansas in
the spring of 1997, obtaining the associate's degree he needed to
transfer to a Division I school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael played baseball for them that spring,'' Artis Bishop
said. ``As it turns out, his commencement exercises for the school
were on the same day as one of the baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going up to see Mike's brother in South Dakota, then
coming down to see his graduation ceremony. But his coach wanted
Mike to skip it and play the baseball game. Mike told him he was
going to the commencement because we were coming up to see it. The
coach was mad, but he later apologized, and now he comes to some of
Mike's games at Kansas State.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches, friends and family will be watching with pride Saturday
to see if Bishop can continue on his path of success. But Bishop
and the undefeated Wildcats have three tough games to go _
Nebraska, Missouri and likely the Big 12 Championship Game _ before
they can earn that shot at the national title.
</P>
<P>
   The people who know and care about Michael Bishop believe he
will find a way to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is a winner,'' Sine said. ``He also is fortunate he
ended up with a team that has so many great athletes. Now, he's so
close to his ultimate goal, which is to win the national
championship. But first, he has to take care of business this
weekend and just keep rolling.''

 &HT;    Professor connects with black legacy through fellow poet of the
past
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Deborah Ellen Stokes knows her legacy. She is the
daughter of the late Rembert E. Stokes, a former president of
Wilberforce University. Her parents were lovers of words and
education, and they passed that love on to their daughter, who is a
professor of English literature at Central State University, as
well as a poet.
</P>
<P>
   She knows, in the words of her friend, artist Willis ``Bing''
Davis, ``who she is and whose she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as artist in residence at the Paul Laurence Dunbar State
Memorial, she wants to make other black Americans aware of their
legacy. Dunbar, the Dayton-born poet who died in 1906, is a part of
that legacy, as well as other ``veterans in the black struggle who
contributed to the paradigm of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, she'll help to honor four such people, ``icons''
of Dunbars, all of whom are buried in a small cemetery outside of
Wilberforce: Hallie Q. Brown, an intellectual and Dunbar's mentor;
her brother, Jeremiah Brown, one of Ohio's first black legislators;
W.S. Scarborough, a president of Wilberforce; and Martin Delaney,
an abolitionist.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes will read two of her poems at the 1 p.m. ceremony and
wreath-laying, and Ann Steiner, chair of Central State's humanities
department, will read Dunbar's Ode to Ethiopia. The poems, along
with illustrations by Davis, will be inscribed on 70
limited-edition prints, which will be handed out at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes is the second poet to serve as artist in residence at the
Dunbar Memorial. Her residency is funded by the Ohio Historical
Society.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to spend the year reading her own work to school
groups, and to spread Dunbar's words far and wide. Dunbar is not so
much found in poetry anthologies as he is passed down orally,
Stokes says. She never learned about him in public school, and
while her students at Central State may have heard of Dunbar, most
haven't read his poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes right back to legacy,'' she says. ``There is no
crueler type of oppression than isolation from who we are, than to
cut a people off from their heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers her father reading Dunbar's dialect poem, ``Little
Brown Baby,'' to her and her sisters when they were young. Later,
as a teen-ager, she came across his somber poetry _ ``We Wear the
Mask,'' and others that dealt with oppression.
</P>
<P>
   She loved ``Little Brown Baby,'' but it annoys her that Dunbar
is considered by many to be ``a dialect poet.'' It's a myth
perpetuated by people ``who don't want the black man to sound
literate. He wrote in dialect, from his heart, in the language of
the people with whom he was raised. But two-thirds of his poetry
was written in standard English, and it is beautiful, beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   She hopes this year to initiate an ``I Remember Dunbar'' series,
in which people can share how his poetry or his life influenced
them. For Stokes, ``his life gives me hope for the future of black
people. He lived during one of the most hellacious times in
American history. He was alive during Wounded Knee, the end of the
American Holocaust. The year he died, almost 150 black people were
lynched.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be read for his own sake, and to understand
American history.''
</P>
<P>
   When she stands at Massie's Creek Cemetery today, Stokes will
connect past, present and future, both personal as well as
cultural. ``My father is buried in that cemetery. And my mother has
bought the gravestone _ it's where I'll be buried, too.''

CARDINALS IN CHASE BUT FANS REMAIN CAUTIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD TIJERINA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Phoenix this week, sports talk radio shows are buzzing. On
Tuesday, hosts Mike Golic and Bruce Jacobs at KGME did their best
to transform area Cowboys fans into Cardinals fans. One man
appeared in the parking lot and burned his Cowboys T-shirt. Another
cut the star from his T-shirt and tacked it onto the studio walls.
</P>
<P>
   It's showdown week between the Cardinals and Cowboys, of course,
with the NFC East lead on the line. And for once this late in the
season, the Cardinals are players in the equation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bandwagon process has been a slow one for the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little more like they don't quite believe it. The
Cardinals have been so desperate for so long,'' said Mark Weber,
afternoon producer at KGME. ``You're finding very few who are
saying, `Sure, the Cardinals will kick their \Rrears\S.' It's more
like they're checking themselves. A lot of `Wouldn't it be nice?'
It's not a very confident Cardinal fan right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not confident? Why not? The Cardinals, after all, have won five
of their past seven games, including their past three. Last week,
Joe Nedney booted a last-second field goal to down the Redskins and
keep Arizona one game behind the East-leading Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   But as good as quarterback Jake Plummer may be playing, as
welcome as a return of a running game has been received and as
strong as a defense led by Aeneas Williams and Simeon Rice has
been, there are those whispers in the Valley of the Sun, ``Maybe
we're not that good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There still are some of them who are ready to put their foot
on the bandwagon,'' coach Vince Tobin said, ``but they haven't all
jumped on yet.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at the Cardinals' schedule may explain why.
</P>
<P>
   The combined record for the opponents Arizona has defeated this
season is 11-34. The Cardinals have beaten teams with quarterbacks
like Charlie Batch, Bobby Hoying, Trent Green, Erik Kramer and Tony
Banks. Last week, they beat a Washington team that hadn't won a
game until the week before, and only scraped the victory with
Nedney's 47-yard kick after blowing a 9-point lead with three
minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cowboys already handed them a 38-10 loss earlier this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a confidence level here, but being where we are now is
nowhere near where we want to be at the end of the season,'' said
Rice, who will be part of one of the game's two marquee matchups
(Rice against offensive tackle Larry Allen and Williams against
receiver Michael Irvin).
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can beat them at home and be tied for first with six
games to go, it would be a big step for this organization and this
team,'' Tobin said. ``But even then, we will still have six games
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, however, are the only team remaining on Arizona's
schedule with a winning record. Take out the Cowboys, and the rest
of the Cardinals' opponents this year are a combined 17-37.
</P>
<P>
   After stumbling to a 2-4 start, the Cardinals (5-4) are above
the .500 mark for the first time since 1994. And now, here they
are: a winning team with momentum on its side, playing for a share
of the division lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hungry still,'' Rice said. ``This is a great moment for
us in time, and we want to take our opportunity now while we have
it. We can end up anywhere from the Super Bowl to out of the Super
Bowl, from in the playoffs to out of the playoffs. We're not so
much gearing up for the end. We're gearing up for the beginning.
Each game now is a new game. It's a novelty.''

QUAKE-RAVAGED APARTMENTS WHERE 16 DIED REOPEN NEARLY FIVE YEARS
LATER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHARLINE CHIANG  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It was the site of the worst death and mayhem
caused by the 1994 Northridge Earthquake, but it now has become a
symbol of beauty and hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Northridge Meadows apartment complex, the most visible and
memorable icon of the massive quake, has been reborn as the
luxurious Parc Ridge. The 158-unit apartment complex was built on
the site in suburban Northridge where the building collapsed during
a magnitude-6.7 quake Jan. 17, 1994, killing 16 people --
one-quarter of the final death toll.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen melaleuca trees line the entryway like soldiers in
silent commemoration, one for every person killed in the temblor.
</P>
<P>
   While Northridge Meadows was built about 30 years ago with
wooden beams, Parc Ridge was constructed according to current
earthquake safety building codes, using steel beams over a thick
concrete base, contractors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In plain speak, there is no relationship to what you had seen
there and the one now,'' said builder Robert Kleiman, head of
Structure Development Group of suburban Woodland Hills. ``They're
two different buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, 45 new residents have signed leases. The first are
scheduled to move in Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's grand opening, which drew about 100 people, Mayor
Richard Riordan touted the $15 million complex as a symbol of
triumph for the San Fernando Valley, and for partnerships between
the city and private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Parc Ridge was funded with $5.3 million from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and $8.5 million from the Los Angeles
Housing and Urban Development Department. Forty percent of its
units have been reserved for moderate-income families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard work. It took a lot of leadership. So
congratulations, San Fernando Valley. We're not just back, we're
much better,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Developers and contractors pointed out how Northridge Meadows
and Parc Ridge differ in both appearance and content.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge Meadows consisted of one three-story building with a
double-decker garage behind it. The Parc Ridge complex is 12 two-
and three-story buildings with an underground parking lot, said
Kleiman, whose company was the general contractor and construction
manager on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Meadows' plain stucco exterior, Parc Ridge's stylized
buildings are painted in modern shades of crimson and yellow. A
visual highlight is a Space Age-looking cylinder that rises four
floors, each holding an airy studio apartment. For two-bedroom
units, rents range from $850 to $1,350 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The new complex, owned by Northridge Redevelopment Group, also
includes a full gym, a waterfall, a playground, and an outdoor pool
and jacuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants who qualify for moderate-income housing can rent
units starting at $521 per month for a one-bedroom or $623 per
month for a two-bedroom. A family of four could qualify for an
apartment if members combined earn $30,780 or less.
</P>
<P>
   The Meadows had been home to 400 people. On Thursday, Shannon
Gilchrist, 26, was the only former resident who attended the
official-studded grand opening.
</P>
<P>
   Toting her 3-week-old son, Jordan, in a baby carrier, she said
she has no interest in renting at the new complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings back too many memories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilchrist, who now lives in suburban Canyon Country, said
she welcomes the shiny new building where the remains of the
Meadows had become a heartbreaking reminder and eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad because there's going to be new life now,'' she said.
``I know it won't bring back the people who passed away. But I know
this is a new building with new life, so people can live here and
be happy in Northridge like we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The reopening comes six months after the grand opening of a
similar site in suburban Sherman Oaks. A $25 million residential
and entertainment complex called the Premiere opened in July at the
former location of the Oakwood Apartments, which suffered the worst
property loss when they were destroyed in the Northridge
Earthquake.

UCLA WINS EXHIBITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's exhibition Thursday night at Pauley
Pavilion was over before it began _ like, five days before. That's
when the Bruins' opponent, the Taiwan National Team, lost to Cal
State-Stanislaus by 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, UCLA had no trouble winning its second and final
tuneup, riding Ryan Bailey in the first half and JaRon Rush in the
second to a 98-65 victory before 6,029.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, a 21-year-old sophomore guard and younger brother of
Toby, scored 11 points in 11 minutes of the first half as the
Bruins closed with an 18-4 surge. Rush, the heralded freshman
forward, sparked a 9-0 post-halftime spurt and finished with a
team-high 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman center Dan Gadzuric made his UCLA debut after missing
Tuesday's exhibition (sore knees). Gadzuric, whose hulking presence
exceeds that of Jelani McCoy, had 11 points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese shot 46.2 percent from the field as the Bruins
repeatedly fell for pump fakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one thing was exposed, it's that we have to continue to
work on our defensive footwork,'' coach Steve Lavin said. ``We were
coming out of our stance like popcorn poppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Sophomore guard/forward Rico Hines has not played or
practiced in two weeks because of a sprained knee and is
questionable for the Nov. 19 season opener against Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he'll be ready to play, I'm not sure he'll have
his rhythm and timing,'' Lavin said.

RIOT POLICE BATTLE INDONESIAN STUDENTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf for updating)  By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In a last line of defense, riot police
officers fired tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets Thursday
night to keep student demonstrators from invading the grounds of
Parliament as they did six months ago when they helped force the
ouster of President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   One police officer was killed and scores of people were reported
injured in confrontations around the city as columns of students
dodged or bullied their way through police lines. Banks and shops
pulled down their shutters in fear of new rioting.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations have built in number and intensity this week
as Parliament meets to lay the groundwork for a new election that
would replace the transitional government of Suharto's chosen
successor, President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary session is to conclude on Friday with a series
of strenuously debated decrees that will help shape the future of
Indonesia's fledgling attempt at democracy. The students say they
will be on the streets in force, ready to demonstrate their
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Although the electoral process has been generally endorsed by
the country's leading opposition figures, it is not enough for most
of the students, who are demanding an immediate break with the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the momentum of their victory over Suharto in May, the
students have taken over major streets in the capital this week by
the tens of thousands, marching and chanting, proud to make their
mark on history as the revolutionary ``class of 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have proved to the people that we are not just ignorant
boys and girls,'' said Benny Yuliawan, 23, a philosophy student.
``I have an obsession that this week will be as great an event as
May, only without the riots.''
</P>
<P>
   With their jeans, sandals, long hair and guitars, this is a
student movement to take its place alongside those of the French
and the Americans in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Their continuing campus demonstrations kept alive the country's
timid opposition to Suharto after he was anointed for a seventh
five-year term in March. And it was the killing by security forces
of four students at Trisakti University in mid-May that set off
three days of devastating riots that shook Suharto's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the students' ebullient and fearless weeklong
occupation of the Parliament building was the most visible part of
the end game that forced Suharto to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here see the students as an essential moral force,
assuring that Parliament will not back away from its outline of
democratic reforms. As the four-day parliamentary session continued
Thursday, delegates inside the building repeatedly asked reporters,
``What's happening outside?''
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where all government institutions and almost all
public figures are holdovers from the 32-year Suharto era, the
students are the most insistent voice for a genuine change. And in
a country that does not yet have a true democracy, their voice must
be heard from beyond the spiked fence that surrounds the Parliament
building.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not a unified movement with clear leaders, and a
foreign diplomat said that in recent weeks they have increasingly
fragmented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they are kind of leaderless and some have abandoned their
positions of nonviolence,'' the diplomat said. ``The movement is
fracturing all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Their various agendas seem to converge on a demand that the
military withdraw from its dominant role in politics and that the
government investigate Suharto's wealth. Many students are
demanding the immediate resignation of Habibie, although a split in
the movement has emerged over that issue.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the students are still demonstrating against Suharto
and his legacy, demanding the completion of Indonesia's revolution.
Among the many cheers and slogans chanted on the streets this week,
the most popular by far is ``Hang Suharto.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will watch the conclusion of the session, and if Suharto is
not punished, we will be back again,'' said Raja Maures, 19, a
student of management at Trisakti University.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the student movement is itself a legacy of
Suharto, the product of the rapid economic development he achieved
and the emerging middle class that was one of its results. The
students, with their vision of an open democratic society, are
Indonesia's first truly middle-class generation.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old philosophy student, Yuliawan, despite his bold
talk of revolution, is fascinated by the centrist politics of Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that not all the people agree with us,'' he said of
the students' political agenda. ``But our role is educational. By
staging our protests, we are saying to the people that it is
possible to speak out. For many years, we were held down. Now we
break the fence and move forward.''

VIEW OF MESA AWE-INSPIRING, ER, NOT SO GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Back from the GM meetings in Florida, baseball's bag
ladies acquired two rare items that anyone less experienced at
discard tables or garage sales would have overlooked as junk.
</P>
<P>
   In relief pitcher Mark Leiter, the Mariners have a Heathcliff
Slocumb wannabe with a double achievement unique in major league
history. He led the National League in losses one year (17 in '97),
then followed up this past season by leading in saves blown (12).
These are not niggling feats, especially for one making $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   In fellow reliever Jose Mesa, they have added another history
maker. In the seventh game of the '97 World Series against Florida,
the Cleveland closer allowed the game-tying run in the ninth inning
_ setting up a collapse that was the first time in 93 championships
that the team leading the ninth inning of Game 7 was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   To bring these two together in the same bullpen ... well, it
requires a majestic vision unimagined by the great unwashed.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner fans stand in awe.
</P>
<P>
   Slackjawed, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the Mariners also managed this week to unload Mike
Timlin and Paul Spoljaric, relievers acquired from Toronto at
midseason 1997 in order to create a valuable hole in left field by
unloading Jose Cruz Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The hole must have been valuable because the Mariners have kept
it for the past two seasons, and figure to have it through '99,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent Timlin on Thursday signed a four-year, $16 million
deal with the Baltimore Orioles, mostly because the Mariners
offered $10.5 million over three years. The Orioles offered that
much because they have big revenues from a new ...
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Wait a minute. The Mariners have a new ballpark too.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Orioles offered that much because they want to win.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, that's it. The Mariners, as we have been told often by
management, want to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   With whom, and for what, remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, what is left now from the Cruz trade is Leiter,
who for his 36th birthday in April will find himself with his
seventh team in nine years. Whether he makes it eight in 10 depends
on the quality of his season. If he has a good one, he's gone, just
like Timlin.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Mariner tradition. As baseball followers know,
tradition gets so little regard anymore, it's good to see a team
cherish its past.
</P>
<P>
   While Leiter's dozen fluffed saves last year suggest that he
will fit in well with his new bullpen mates, the curious part of
the transaction was the sendoff given Spoljaric by Woody Woodward,
the Mariner baseball chieftain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spoljaric will be a fine pitcher before it's all over,'' he
told the P-I this week. ``He's got a very good arm. Somebody's just
got to teach him how to throw quality strikes, and if they do,
they're going to have a good pitcher. But we think we can get more
out of Leiter than Spoljaric, at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the teaching of strike-throwing is an exotic
discipline unknown in the Mariner organization, perhaps on the
order of sword-swallowing or fire-walking.
</P>
<P>
   Given the club's history of seeing its own pitching prospects
flourish in other jerseys, the fact that the Mariners themselves
assume that Spoljaric will be fine somewhere else is just a small
step short of O.J. Simpson saying, ``Yup, I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   It might occur to a Mariner fan to suggest that perhaps an
investment in a quality pitching coach, or even a franchise-wide
pitching system, would be worthwhile. But the Mariners apparently
find it more amusing to relentlessly churn their pitching roster,
which now includes more than 60 names over the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was apparent during his time in Seattle that
Spoljaric wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, he is only 28
and unlikely to get dumber. Leiter is unlikely to get younger or
better, particularly in the major league pitchers' graveyard of
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa, at least, has a chance to be adequate, a descriptive term
that also will serve as the franchise's goal for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In his last 20 appearances for the San Francisco Giants, where
he was a set-up reliever for closer Rob Nen, Mesa had a 1.83 ERA in
20 innings that included 18 strikeouts and 9 walks.
</P>
<P>
   In his prime of 1995-96, Mesa was a fearsome closer for the
Indians. But his shattering moment in the '97 Series, as well as
his trade from Cleveland after he was found innocent of a highly
publicized rape charge, suggest that he has lost some of his
gumption.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the closer role is where the Mariners will put him.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Mariners will get lucky, as they were in '95 when
injured Norm Charlton was picked up from the Phillies' scrap heap.
</P>
<P>
   Or as lucky as they were last year with free agent Billy Swift,
who at 36 found 145 unexpected innings in his battered arm.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the Mariners have acquired the '99 versions of Dennis
Martinez and Tony Fossas.
</P>
<P>
   When all nickels are spent at the discard table, it's all luck
and no clue.
</P>
<P>
   At least Leiter and Mesa are in a good situation. They will each
make about $3 million at the end of their careers and won't endure
the nuisance of someone helping them throw strikes.

MARINERS SIGN FREE AGENT CLOSER JOSE MESA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Jose Mesa filed for free agency this fall, he
told his agent to try hard for a deal with the Mariners. Mesa knew
the Mariners had bullpen problems, and he figured they needed a
closer.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa was half right. The Mariners indeed had a shaky bullpen,
but with the way Mike Timlin pitched in the second half, they
thought they'd found their closer. All Seattle needed was to keep
him.
</P>
<P>
   But at the general managers' meetings in Naples, Fla., this
week, it became apparent that Timlin was a popular item. So the M's
rekindled conversations with Mesa, and Thursday signed the
33-year-old right-hander to a two-year deal for just over $6
million, with a club option for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Timlin, meanwhile, signed with the Baltimore Orioles for four
years and $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that I can be the answer, because I think I still can
do the job, I still can pitch,'' Mesa said from his home in the
Dominican Republic. ``With the Seattle Mariners, it's a new
opportunity for me to show the world what I still can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa spent last year as a setup man for the Cleveland Indians
and San Francisco Giants. Timlin also began the year in a setup
role, but saved 19 games in 20 chances after the All-Star break and
said he thought he'd return to Seattle. Timlin was asked Thursday
if he was surprised he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard they're a small-market team,'' he said. ``For some
reason, just seeing some of the dollars they give out, I don't
really consider them a small-market team. But I believe the
Mariners pursue pitchers in a different manner than (other) teams.
They're more of an offensive team. They look at big run producers
and they try to beat you that way, instead of balancing it out a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mariners vice president of baseball operations Woody
Woodward, who will pay Mesa, Mark Leiter, Jeff Fassero, Jamie Moyer
and Bobby Ayala nearly $15 million next year: ``I don't think
that's even worth a response.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners wanted to re-sign Timlin in September, but Timlin,
who passed up free agency two years ago by re-signing with Toronto,
decided to test the market.
</P>
<P>
   When Rod Beck returned to the Cubs and Jeff Shaw to the Dodgers,
Timlin became the most sought-after closer on the market, with as
many as 12 teams showing serious interest. The Mariners offered
Timlin $10.5 million over three years, but with several four-year
offers available, Timlin declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the Mariners) had come in at four years and $12-13 million
(in September), that would have been hard to turn down,'' agent
David Sloane said. ``But they're trying to save money to sign (Ken)
Griffey and (Alex) Rodriguez, and I guess this is one place they
feel they can save it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward denied that, saying Seattle had allocated a certain
amount of its budget to bolstering the bullpen, and Timlin's asking
price was too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Four years) is a long contract for a pitcher, but if a club
wants to make it, that's fine,'' Woodward said. ``I'm not going to
second-guess Baltimore, but we weren't going to go four years and
$16 million. It was mostly (a matter of) years, but partly dollars,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who are keeping this year's payroll at last year's
$53 million level, felt a four-year deal was too much of a risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have loved to have had Mike stay,'' Mariners
president Chuck Armstrong said. ``That was our first choice. But we
couldn't work something out, and I think we're in good shape with
Mesa. We came out just fine on that, they're both 33 years old, and
we don't have a four-year (contract).
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw what happened last year with Randy Myers and his
contract. We received severe criticism for not stepping up and
paying for Myers, but (last year), the Blue Jays couldn't wait to
unload him. Two years with an option for Mesa, at the dollars we
settled on _ I think we made the right choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa's best season was in 1995, when he helped Cleveland to an
ALCS victory over Seattle. With 46 saves in 48 chances, Mesa was
the runner-up to Randy Johnson for the American League Cy Young
award, and also placed fourth in MVP balloting. The next season, he
saved 39 games and made his second All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   But 1997 brought off-field problems and on-field misery. Before
the season, Mesa endured a highly publicized rape trial that ended
in an innocent verdict. At the end of the season, he blew a save in
the ninth inning of Game 7 of the World Series against Florida. The
Indians went on to lose in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   As a setup man last season, Mesa went 8-7 with a 4.57 earned-run
average. He had an especially tough time against left-handers, who
batted .338 off him. But after a July trade to San Francisco, Mesa
came on strong, posting a 1.83 ERA in his final 20 games as the
Giants made an unexpected playoff push.
</P>
<P>
   Though Timlin has been a closer more recently, Mesa has 32 more
career saves, with 104.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Mike Timlin's and Jose Mesa's career records, and
Mesa has a much better record as a closer than Timlin,'' said one
American League scout. ``Who's to say Mike Timlin is going to do
the things Mesa's done?
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing Mesa gives you is he's still got arm
strength, and he has experience as a closer. There's a lot to be
said for that _ someone who's been through the wars, had his ups
and downs. And he's relatively young. You get a guy like that for
two years, it's worth a gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   Next on the M's shopping list, Woodward said, is a left-handed
reliever (free agents Dennis Cook and Scott Radinsky remain
available), and the club continues to search for another starter.
This week's acquisitions of Mesa and Leiter, who will earn $3
million in the last year of his contract, don't seem to leave much
spare cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's going to make it tough to continue to sign
players is the way these signings are going (around baseball),''
Woodward said. ``That's the difficult part.''

KINGS LOSE THE BEAT, GET BEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ With a team from Music City making its initial
visit, the Kings picked the perfect night to orchestrate a
discordant symphony of sour notes.
</P>
<P>
   They came out and grabbed an early lead against Nashville's
hockey heroes, then never lit the red light again. The expansion
Predators gradually found their rhythm, and third-period goals by
Sergei Krivokrasov and Darren Turcotte sent the reeling Kings to a
3-1 loss Thursday night before a small but surly Forum crowd
announced at 9,956.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Kings (5-8-3), the start of the postseason
is five months away. If the playoffs began today, the first-year
Predators (6-7-1) would be in, and the 32nd-year Kings would be
out. Nashville is 3-2 on its six-game trip, and the Kings are 1-4-2
in their first seven home games.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the second straight for the Kings, who are 1-5-1 in
their last seven games overall. Coach Larry Robinson had considered
lineup changes following the Kings' previous loss _ a sloppy 5-4
overtime setback in Calgary two nights earlier _ but decided not to
after reviewing videotape of the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play that bad,'' Robinson said of the Calgary loss.
``Overall, yes, there were mistakes, and yes, we got away from our
game plan, but it wasn't just one line staying out there too long.
It was a collective thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once your temper cools down and you're thinking positively
instead of blowing off steam... the nice thing about having
videotape is, when you give a guy crap about doing something, then
you see the tape and say, `Oh, I know why he did that.' But we
definitely got away from the game plan. Now is the time for the
players to stick to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Robinson won't be patient indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's up to the guys to do it,'' Robinson said. ``If not,
then we'll think about changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, it looked like the Kings were ready to turn
their game around.
</P>
<P>
   They grabbed a 1-0 lead on Vladimir Tsyplakov's shorthanded goal
2:02 into the game _ he has scored in four consecutive games _ and
controlled the first period, outshooting the Predators, 14-2.
</P>
<P>
   But the shooting margin didn't translate into a larger lead.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Kings' power play was a key culprit, failing three
times in the opening 20 minutes. The Kings have no power-play goals
in their last three games, only one in the last seven games and
only five in the season's first 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Kings, they didn't get any power plays in
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   But they were shorthanded once in the second period _ being
shorthanded is a situation that often leads to their best scoring
opportunities. And this situation was no different, yielding two
excellent chances for Steve Duchesne, who hasn't been nearly as
successful this season on the power play, where he was expected to
thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Duchesne's shorthanded chances were thwarted by
Nashville goalie Mike Dunham, and gradually, the Predators began to
produce some of their own scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   One of those resulted in the tying goal, 11:53 into the second
period, when Ville Peltonen _ one on one with Kings defenseman
Garry Galley _ cut to his right and lifted a 20-foot backhander
over the glove of Manny Legace.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings almost regained the lead when Dunham was caught out of
his net with Glen Murray in possession of the puck. But Murray's
shot at the open net hit the right post, and the teams entered the
third period in a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Krivokrasov scored from the slot off a pass from Peltonen
less than two minutes into the final period, and Turcotte scored a
strange goal, banking the puck in off Garry Galley about 10 minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had a chance to cut the deficit to one shortly
thereafter, when Dunham again was caught out of his net, but Matt
Johnson's shot at the empty net was wide.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times, the Kings did manage to get the puck on net in the
third period, but none were especially difficult tests for Dunham.
The Kings spent much of the night passing the puck into each
other's skates and displaying a general lack of chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   The small crowd had no such difficulty producing a collective
effort, joining together to boo the Kings off the ice after the
final buzzer.

DEMOCRATS CHOOSE L.A. AS FINALIST FOR 2000 CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- L.A. has been named as one of three finalists
competing to host the Democratic National Convention in 2000, and
officials were confident of winning if the city will raise its
$35.3 million bid.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was chosen with Boston and Denver from among six
cities. A source involved in the Los Angeles bid said Democratic
party leadership strongly supports the city as the convention site,
and Boston and Denver may have been named to force Los Angeles to
up the ante on its bid -- already the highest of the three cities.
</P>
<P>
   A negotiating team will visit the three cities, and the final
selection will be made early next year by party officials,
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the party leader said the competition is close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the cities recommended by the Site Advisory Committee
would provide a great setting for the first Democratic convention
of the 21st century,'' said Steve Grossman, national chairman of
the DNC, adding that each of the finalists is ``uniquely qualified
to carry forth the message of the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Los Angeles Convention 2000 said they are confident
the city will be picked based on the strength of its bid and
California's 54 electoral votes, an important prize for the
Democratic nominee in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That political importance was illustrated Thursday by Gore, a
likely contender for the party's nomination, who visited the city
to meet with Democrats, among them Latino leaders.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks studio co-founder David Geffen, a co-chairman of the
Los Angeles bid committee, said the city has always been important
to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent election further demonstrates its importance as a
political and financial base for the Democratic party as well,''
said Geffen, who co-chairs the committee with businessman Eli Broad
and mayoral confidant Bill Wardlaw. ``It is the perfect choice to
host the Democratic Party convention in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very, very strong bid,'' Wardlaw said. ``California
is absolutely essential for the Democratic nominee to carry . . .
to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy McCoy, director of Los Angeles Convention 2000, said she
suspects the committee will seek additional commitments when its
negotiating team comes to Los Angeles in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take this final bid process very seriously,'' McCoy said,
adding, ``There's always room for negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's place on the list is no surprise because Grossman is
from Massachusetts, while Denver's selection may have something to
do with the fact that DNC co-chairman Roy Romer is the governor of
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles beat out Miami, Minneapolis and New Orleans.
Philadelphia withdrew after it was named to host the Republican
National Convention in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic convention could bring 30,000 visitors and $137
million in revenue to Los Angeles, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Convention 2000 bid includes $6 million in city
transportation and security services and the use of space in the
Los Angeles Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is cash for expenses and in-kind
contributions, including a waiver of rent at the Staples Center,
where the convention would be held, said Mike Monosmith, a
spokesman for the Los Angeles group.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said the city's bid is ``several million dollars'' higher
than the bids of the other two finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican, said he is delighted that
Los Angeles remains in strong contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great tribute to our city and to the Los Angeles
Convention 2000 committee's proposal to the DNC,'' Riordan said.
``Los Angeles looks forward to welcoming the selection committee
back to Los Angeles to convince them they should say yes to Los
Angeles in 2000.''

SEAHAWK DEFENSE REMINISCENT OF TEAM'S 1984 UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND _ It would be difficult to find someone more familiar
with the evolution of the Seahawks' defense than Tim Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering the NFL in 1988, the Raiders' all-time leading
receiver has faced some pretty good defenses and some pretty bad
ones while playing the Seahawks twice a year. But none, in his
estimation, has been better than the Seahawks defense Brown and the
Raiders will face Sunday for the second time in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been in the league, which is 11 years now, I can't
remember seeing a better group of guys assembled up there,'' Brown
said this week. ``They've played well this year. A lot better than
they've played in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   So how do you explain the Seahawks' defense being ranked only
21st in the league after nine games?
</P>
<P>
   It takes a closer look at the numbers to decipher what this
defense has meant to this 5-4 team. The league ranks defenses by
average yards allowed. The Seahawks are allowing 318.1 yards per
game because the defense has been left on the field for too many
plays by its own inability to stop the run and its own inefficient
offense. For example, the Hawks defense was left to face 85 snaps
at San Diego three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ 74 plays in Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs; 85
in San Diego three weeks ago; 72 at Pittsburgh in Week 4; 78
against the Redskins in Week 3.
</P>
<P>
   A better indication of the defensive performance, and a truer
measure of its contribution to the overall effort, is average yards
allowed per play. The Seahawks rank fifth (4.6) in the league
behind Oakland, (4.0), San Diego, (4.1), Kansas City (4.3) and
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   (4.5). However, the Chargers, Raiders, Chiefs and Dolphins also
rank 1-2-3-4 in average yards allowed per game.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity? The Seahawks defense has been on the field for
628 plays _ 61 more than the Raiders, 65 more than the Chargers, 68
more than the Chiefs and a whopping 93 more than the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   , compared to 567 for the Raiders, 563 for the Chargers, 560 for
the Chiefs and 535 for the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, of course, is points allowed. The Seahawks
defense is allowing an average of 14.2, third-best in the league
behind the Cowboys (13.4) and Dolphins (13.7).
</P>
<P>
   Another huge factor for the defense has been turnovers. The
Seahawks have forced 22 _ second in the AFC to the Raiders (23) and
tied for third in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   with Carolina behind the Cardinals (27), Falcons and Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   It is not so much that the Seahawks have forced turnovers, but
when and where they have done it. They have returned five
interceptions for TDs _ two each by cornerback Shawn Springs and
linebacker Darrin Smith and one by cornerback Willie Williams. They
also have set up three TDs and two field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Six other turnovers have come inside the Seahawks' 20-yard line
and two more inside the 31, meaning the defense not only stole ball
but also a scoring opportunity from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of the way we are,'' linebacker Chad Brown
</P>
<P>
   said. ``We have a tendency to tighten up once the ball gets near
our goal line.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a give-and-take routine that has been reminiscent of the
'84 Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   That was the season strong safety Kenny Easley was named NFL
defensive player of the year, the Seahawks led the NFL with 63
takeaways and the defense ranked No. 6 in the league _ still the
best finish in the 23-year history of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   That also was the season that whenever the opposition was
moving, you could almost always count on a big play to stall or
stop the drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really made that comparison,'' said Dave Brown, a
Pro Bowl cornerback on that '84 team who now coaches the position
for the Seahawks. ``This defense is distinctly different. They're a
special group of guys and when they decide to play together and
play good solid defense, boy, they make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   So did that '84 team, which also included a three-man line of
Jacob Green, Joe Nash and Jeff Bryant; linebackers Keith Butler and
Fredd Young; and free safety John Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just went out and made plays and had the attitude that
whatever happened, we weren't going to let them score,'' Brown
said. ``But if they scored, we wanted it to be three (a field
goal), not seven (a touchdown).''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said it is unfair to compare the two defenses until after
the season, but these Seahawks have a little of those Seahawks in
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, we have stepped it up whenever we have had to,''
coach Dennis Erickson said. ``All year, we've been able to get
turnovers and make things happen with this unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Brown agrees. His tenure in Los Angeles and now Oakland
started with the Seahawks winning their only AFC West championship
by defeating the Raiders on the final Sunday of the 1988 regular
season. It continued through 1990, 1991 and 1992, when the
Seahawks' defense was the only one in the NFL to rank among the top
10 all three seasons; and 1993-96, when the Seahawks never ranked
better than 23rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done well getting a solid defense together,'' Tim
Brown said. ``They've kind of pieced it together, but the pieces
are now in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Tackles Cortez Kennedy and Sam Adams, left end Michael Sinclair,
middle linebacker Dean Wells and strong safety Jay Bellamy are
holdovers from the pre-Erickson era. Free safety Darryl Williams
and right end Phillip Daniels were added in 1996. Chad Brown,
cornerbacks Williams and Springs and tackle Dan Saleaumua joined
the mix last year. Smith and versatile but now injured safety Mark
Collins were signed this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Seahawks have a connection with those defenses of the
past. They have forced turnovers _ 22, from nine different players.
They have collected sacks _ a league-high 37, from 11 different
players. They have had problems stopping the run _ allowing an
average of 129.8 yards per game and 4.1 yards per attempt. They
have had coverage breakdowns, leading to big pass plays _ only
seven of 25 yards or more, but four in the last game against the
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   They can, and must, do even more, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about 85 percent of what we can be,'' Chad Brown said.
``We've got to put people away. When we've got them down, we've got
to take their heart out and take a bite out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: C Kevin Glover will not play this week to rest a
pinched nerve in his back and it is looking more like Smith also
will miss his second game in three weeks, this time with a pulled
hamstring. ... WR Brian Blades also sat out practice with a pulled
muscle in his hip. He will be re-evaluated Friday. ... QB Warren
Moon took the entire offensive team to dinner at Ruth's Chris
Steakhouse on Wednesday. ``We wanted a feel-good atmosphere,'' Moon
said. ``The guys have been hearing and reading a lot about how
we've struggled. So this was the right time to do this.'' ... In
Oakland, the mystery over whether QB Jeff George might play ended
when George told reporters, ``I'm out this week.'' Donald Hollas
will start. ... Also, rookie CB Charles Woodson did take some snaps
at wide receiver. ``We'll see what happens in the course of the
game. We're not going to disrupt his rhythm as a cornerback,''
Raiders coach Jon Gruden said.

GETTY MUSEUM ACQUIRES ``SUNRISE'' BY IMPRESSIONIST MASTER MONET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The J. Paul Getty Museum has bolstered its small
but select Impressionist collection by acquiring Claude Monet's
``Sunrise,'' one of the first paintings in the style that gave rise
to the genre, museum officials announced.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, one of six that Monet did of the northern French
port of Le Havre in the spring of 1873, has rarely been exhibited
and was acquired at a private sale for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This literally represents the beginning of Impressionism, and
that's why it's so exciting to us,'' said Deborah Gribbon, deputy
director of the museum and a specialist in 19th-century French art.
``It's the most important acquisition we've made in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunrise'' is set to go on permanent display Tuesday, joining
two other works by Monet and paintings by his contemporaries also
exemplifying the Impressionist school, including Pierre Auguste
Renoir, Camille Pissarro and Edward Manet.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty has been collecting Impressionist and
Post-Impressionist paintings for 15 years, and museum officials
regard ``Sunrise'' as a key acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it beautiful, but it represents a great moment in
art history and will serve important education purposes for our
audiences,'' said Barry Munitz, president and chief executive
officer of the J. Paul Getty Trust.
</P>
<P>
   In June, another painting by Monet, ``Waterlily Pond and Path by
Water,'' fetched $33 million, the highest price paid for any French
Impressionist painting. The buyer was anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The highest known price paid for any painting was $53.9 million,
which Australian industrialist Alan Bond paid for Vincent van
Gogh's masterpiece ``Irises'' in 1990. The Getty bought that
painting three years later for an undisclosed sum when the
overheated art market had cooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunrise'' is in remarkable condition, reflecting the ephemeral
play of light, water and air that remained Monet's subject for the
rest of his career, Gribbon said. The painting marked a new phase
in his career, one in which he took painting outside, directly from
nature, to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty's new acquisition was painted on Monet's same trip to
Le Havre in which he created ``Impression, Sunrise,'' which gave
the theory of painting its name. That painting is on display at the
Marmottan Museum in Paris. Critics derided it as unfinished when it
was displayed in Paris in 1874, Gribbon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought (paintings of this style) were just sketches, and
so they made fun of the style by calling the artists
Impressionists,'' she said. ``The paintings would be done outdoors,
but he would bring them back to the studio and continue to work on
them, so the impression these paintings give, that they were
painted quickly, is in fact an artful illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Getty's other works by Monet are an early still life of
flowers and a winter scene from 1891 in his Wheatstack series.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a teaching tool for children who visit the museum,
``Sunrise'' could become the centerpiece for an exhibition of other
Monet pieces, if they can be borrowed from other museums, Gribbon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of the painting illustrates the Getty's strategy
of collecting key works that exemplify a particular genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are after the most important paintings by the most
important artists that are in the best condition,'' Gribbon said.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials hope the new painting alone will draw visitors,
although they caution that parking reservations are still required
by calling (310) 440-7300.

COWBOYS MEAN CASH FOR CARDS  
 EXPECTED SELLOUT TO LIFT POOR ATTENDANCE FIGURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until last season, the Cardinals could count on two things when
the Dallas Cowboys came to Sun Devil Stadium: a loss on the field
and a victory at the turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed a bit last year when the Cardinals won, 25-22, in
overtime, to break a 13-game losing streak to Dallas. The crowd of
70,060 was the largest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are hoping for a similar outcome Sunday. A win
over Dallas will propel them into a tie with the Cowboys for first
place in the NFC East. And the expected sellout crowd of more than
72,000 would give them a much-needed boost at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Through four home dates, the Cardinals' average attendance is
47,363, which ranks 28th out of 30 NFL teams, according to ``Street
and Smith's'' ``SportsBusiness Journal,'' which weekly tracks the
league's attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland and Tennessee have drawn smaller crowds on average. But
the Cardinals are playing to only 65 percent capacity at Sun Devil
Stadium, the worst percentage in the league.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Cardinals games against Philadelphia (39,782)
and Washington (45,950) are among the 10 smallest in the league
this year.
</P>
<P>
   That's better than Tennessee, which has four of the league's 10
smallest crowds, and Oakland, which has three.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bidwill said Cardinals officials are encouraged by the
community's enthusiasm over the franchise this season.
</P>
<P>
   Season-ticket sales increased by about 2,300 to 31,019 even
though the team went 4-12 last year, and the club's recent success
should help sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has improved and provided some real exciting
games,'' said Bidwill, a vice president and general counsel with
the team. ``There is clearly a lot of interest in us, and people
are interested in seeing the remaining games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a while since we've been in the middle of November
having people speculating about us being in the playoff hunt and
playing for a first-place position.''
</P>
<P>
   If there aren't any no-shows this Sunday, the crowd of 72,994
will give the Cardinals an average attendance this year of 52,492,
which is about 6,000 more than they averaged through the first five
games of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it will give the team its third crowd this season of more
than 50,000, one more than they had last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are playing a fifth-place schedule this year,
meaning they are playing several teams coming off poor seasons.
That's great if you are trying to turn around a perennially bad
franchise. It's not so good if you hope to attract bigger crowds.
</P>
<P>
   After Dallas, the remaining home opponents are the New York
Giants, New Orleans and San Diego, none of which has a winning
record or is a great box office draw in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for our fans to see this team winning
games,'' Bidwill said. ``That's probably more important than the
opponents we're playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans have already started to express an interest in buying
tickets to remaining games. Some of our existing account holders
are calling and saying, `I need more tickets than what I have. I
have more customers that want to go to games.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals were to remain in playoff contention, they
could have one the best attendance records in team history. By
averaging 40,000 in their final three games, this would become
their fourth best season ever in attendance. &QL;

NOTHING PLAIN ABOUT THIS SMITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The world has its Einsteins and it's
Eisensteins.
</P>
<P>
   Einsteins are the geniuses who make great contributions. Your
basic Eisensteins, close relatives of talk-radio hosts, run amok
making statements that often boggle the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Like those made last year when it was said Dallas Cowboys
running back Emmitt Smith has taken too many hits; his body has
grown old and sore before its time. He's no longer a dominant
running back.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Eisensteins can tackle him, because NFL defensive
fronts aren't doing a very good job of it this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Smith, who has rushed for 871 yards, is on pace
to record a 1,457-yard rushing season, his best since 1995, when he
had a career-best 1,773 yards, and on a par with the majority of
seasons during his career. The Cardinals would kill for a
1,000-yard back.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has four rushing and three Super Bowl titles on his
re sume, was victimized by his own success. He's currently the No.
8 rusher in the history of the NFL, just 16 yards away from passing
Franco Harris for No. 7 and 139 yards away from passing Marcus
Allen at No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   If he improves Sunday just a tad on the 124-yard, 29-carry
performance he had in the season opener against the Cardinals,
he'll pass them. Facts: Harris played 13 years, Allen 16. Smith,
29, has played nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmitt is running with new confidence,'' guard Nate Newton
said. ``You can see the confidence in the way he walks, the way he
moves around.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime teammate Darren Woodson, the All-Pro strong safety from
Arizona State, concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmitt is Emmitt,'' Woodson said. ``He knows we expect him to
make plays and that's it. If he gives a great performance on a
weekend, I don't even bother to say `Great game' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about his dominance surfaced two years ago, when his
production dropped to 1,204 yards after the brilliant '95 season,
and escalated last year when it dropped to 1,074. His touchdown
totals dropped from 25 in '95, to 12 and then four last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of circumstances to Emmitt not having the
type of year that people were accustomed to,'' Cowboys Coach Chan
Gailey said. ``But to put all of it (offensive problems) on Emmitt
and say he was down the tubes, is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson adds, ``People who questioned him don't understand the
game and what we went through last year. And defenses now have
eight- or nine-man fronts. They can stop anybody if they bring up
that many people. This year we have weapons to go to like Ernie
Mills, Billy Davis and Michael Irvin, who can spread the field and
open up holes for him.''
</P>
<P>
   True. Last year, the 6-10 Cowboys were Team Turmoil. Smith was
without fullback Moose Johnson. His offensive line had its best
moments at the emergency room at Dallas' Parkland Hospital. And
gun-toting Coach Barry Switzer was not a lovable creature.
</P>
<P>
   It was a happy but feisty Smith who handled questions in a loose
and loud locker room on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest difference this year is we're winning,'' he said
of the 6-3 record. ``You have to look at the overall picture. We've
got a new coach, a new offensive scheme, new offensive coaches, a
new attitude and a newly found direction. All that helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, yes, the fun has come back to the game for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey brought in a new offensive system relying more on zone
blocking, which makes lineman responsible for an area. It has
turned Smith into more of a read-and-react runner, but he's still
using that quick burst of speed. He's letting his play silence his
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is I still have to play the game, which isn't
won in the papers,'' he said. ``People are entitled to their
opinion. I'm just doing the best I can, which is all I can ask of
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   If Valley fans think Smith and the Cowboys might be looking past
the Cardinals, or harbor disrespect for a team they have beaten 15
of the past 16 games, they're very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what breaking Tony Dorsett's career team rushing
record last week meant to him, Smith replied, ``That's old news to
me. I have more important things ahead of me now. The next
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys whipped the Cardinals, 38-10, in Week No. 1. Can
they be considered a serious threat?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' he asked. ``Why not? One win and they're tied with
us for the division lead. They handled us last year. Smoked us.''
</P>
<P>
   A 25-22 loss in overtime on a field goal that bounced off the
upright isn't exactly smoking, but it might as well have been to
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us. It was a loss,'' he said. ``And it was the start
to everything else that happened last year. When they played us in
September, they played us tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defensive front seven is as good as any other front
seven in the league, honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   As for returning to Sun Devil Stadium, seemingly a home away
from home judging from the abundance of silver and blue in the
stands during past games, Smith said:
</P>
<P>
   ``That started to change last year. I think you'll probably see
a lot more (Cardinals red) in the stands. The Cowboys fans are
starting to filter out. Either that or they might have been too
embarrassed to call themselves Cowboys fans and didn't show up.'' &QL;

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A documentary on the life of Frank Lloyd Wright, who spent a lot
of time in Arizona, aired this week on PBS. Meanwhile, the work of
another architect is starting to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Evans brought a blueprint with him when he was hired as
Arizona State's basketball coach in April. It's basically the same
set of plans that provided form and function at Mississippi, where
in six years Evans built a program brick by brick, from the ground
up.
</P>
<P>
   At ASU, Evans has better materials with which to work, but the
concept is the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't try to build the roof before you build the
foundation,'' Evans said on the eve of the Sun Devils' opener
tonight against San Jose State at Wells Fargo Arena. ``You've got
to build a sound foundation. And then you start building the walls.
And then you've got the roof. And then you've got a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing Evans does is haphazard. In his 52 years, 22 of which
were spent as an assistant before he became the head coach at Ole
Miss, he learned the importance of organization, of drawing up a
plan and sticking to it. In brief, this is how he envisions ASU
basketball rising into the sky:
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys who are on the road to graduation,'' he said. ``Guys
having success on the basketball court. Fans excited about what's
going on, on the court and off.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans are most excited about guys having success on the court. In
other words. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Championships,'' Evans said. ``Pac-10 championships. Win the
Pac-10 championship, then you've got a chance to do something
nationally. Winning the Pac-10 championship is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans inherited an Ole Miss program with the worst facilities
and least tradition in the Southeastern Conference. From a
gymnasium with no heat to assistant coaches working in cubicles,
conditions were substandard. In his fifth season, Ole Miss won a
conference title. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASU Athletic Director Kevin White, who hired Evans, had a
special view of the project. White's son, Michael, played for Evans
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a cornerstone piece to Rob, it's a guy who's
extremely straightforward,'' White said. ``Deliberate. Strong and
insightful. He is very thoughtful and just, in my view, a stand-up
professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has got the innate ability to not only recruit but manage
student-athletes in an environment that's a bit challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the first things Evans did at ASU was ``get the best staff
in the country,'' he said. ``I had to get a staff that's going to
be in the boat with me, a staff with a tremendous work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans brought Russ Pennell and Dan O'Dowd with him from Ole
Miss, and lured his cousin, Tony Benford, from New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, we had to find some guys who would help keep us
above water until we could recruit some high school kids,'' Evans
said. &QL; 
No write-off &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he first got here, Evans made a commitment to returning
veterans Bobby Lazor and Mike Batiste that ``we weren't going to
write this year off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans and his staff brought in junior college transfers Alton
Mason, Derrick Davis and Lohnnie Tape, plus Awvee Story, an
Illinois transfer who is eligible next season.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of building the foundation was letting the current
players know, clearly, concisely and directly, where Evans stood on
matters ranging from discipline to classroom attendance to the
importance of playing defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to understand what the laws are and what type of
person I am, on the way in,'' he said. ``If you don't like it, let
me know, because either you don't need to be here, or I don't need
to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Evans has been available for any and all public
functions, preaching the gospel of Sun Devils basketball. That
included a summer coaches clinic. About 50 coaches from the state
were expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we got 150,'' he said. ``That's just touching base. But
that's 150 who are going to talk with another 150, who are going to
talk with another 150.''
</P>
<P>
   Concurrent with ``that,'' recruiting for next season began in
earnest. Evans caught a break when, as an assistant coach of a U.S.
team playing in the Dominican Republic, he got to send a third
assistant, O'Dowd, out to recruit. Usually, only two are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told kids, `We're the only staff that all four coaches
liked what they saw of you,' '' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   In its first, full-blown recruiting effort, the Evans staff
landed a class that is ranked among the nation's best.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase is this season. With Lazor, Batiste (who becomes
eligible on Dec. 19) and guard Eddie House, ASU can be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to set the tone for the way this program is going to
be for a long time,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   As the walls start to go up, the next recruiting cycle already
has begun. Evans will continue to make himself visible and
accessible and win a few games, too. Construction will continue,
and even after the work is complete, heavy maintenance and upkeep
is required.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need more pieces of the puzzle to get us to where we
want to go,'' Evans said. ``We're going to constantly stay on
(players) to make sure they're doing what they're supposed to be
doing in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ongoing process of building trust between you and the
players. You've got to continue to talk to them. Not only me but
all our staff members. Kids are not going to tell others to come
here if they don't believe in you.''
</P>
<P>
   With architecture, patience is more than a virtue, it's a
necessity. Evans is prepared to be patient, to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother used to tell me, `Sometimes the shortest way home is
the longest way around,' '' he said. ``Sometimes you have to go the
long way to get home, but when you do get home, there's a lot of
substance there. There won't be any shortcuts here.'' &QL;

TEAM COMES FIRST FOR CAMPBELL 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-CAMPBELL-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Steve Campbell's big moment. Sun Devil Stadium was
buzzing. The quarterback was about to start the second half.
</P>
<P>
   And he was ticked.
</P>
<P>
   The news that he had been yanked from special teams because a
quarterback shouldn't do both didn't sit well. He charged down the
sideline and got in Arizona State assistant Kevin Wolthausen's
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not taking me off the field-goal team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Wolthausen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I'm not different just because I'm playing now. I still
want my special teams!''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. If Campbell's personality got lost in his
limited appearances at ASU, it surfaced during Saturday's 55-22
victory over the Golden Bears. He is the consummate team player.
</P>
<P>
   Call him ``Capbll'' because there is no ``me'' in the senior.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, in some unexplainable way, the reward for his behavior is
his probable start Saturday at Oregon in place of the injured Ryan
Kealy. He is approaching it with enthusiasm rarely reserved for
someone who has spent the majority of 42 games warming the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard him talk to a group once,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder
said. ``He said, `You know, I had a choice. I could do something
positive and make the best out of it. Or I could become negative. I
could pout. I could blame the coaches. I could blame fate.
Whatever. I chose to be positive.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said, ``It's basically a matter of do you want to be in
a bad mood every day or a good mood every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of last season, when Campbell made his only career
start in the Sun Bowl, Snyder has raved about his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wish you had 100 guys like him,'' quarterbacks coach John
Pettas said.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, when coaching is off-limits, Campbell
organized seven-on-seven drills and players-only meetings to keep
the team focused.
</P>
<P>
   Early this season, when the Sun Devils' struggles became
apparent, Campbell marched into Snyder's office and said, ``What
can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to the team at several Sunday meetings and led other
sessions that encouraged teammates to speak up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost felt like if I didn't do it, who was?'' Campbell
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the season, he ached to contribute and begged Snyder to
get him on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tight end?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   So it became special teams. He already has blocked two field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still wanted to be part of this team,'' he said. ``Did I
want to start? Of course. But it can't just be me, me, me, me. And
it's fun to be just around these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when Campbell was sure his playing days were over, Kealy
hurt his knee late in the second quarter against California. As ASU
went into halftime with a comfortable lead, Snyder had a decision
to make: Does he go with redshirt freshman Chad Elliott, who showed
promise against Notre Dame? Or does he pick Campbell, who had been
practicing well? It was senior day.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, Snyder suggested Campbell might be his
choice as a backup in situations in which the Sun Devils led. He
went with him, and the senior completed 7 of 11 passes for 106
yards and three touchdowns and had the best game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he said the absence of pressure made the difference.
He wasn't competing for a job. He knew his career was nearing its
end.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes one wonder: What kind of career could Campbell have
had if he had always played with that mental approach?
</P>
<P>
   Campbell admits he has beaten himself up over that lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the last camp I was thinking, `I haven't had a bad practice
yet. Where the hell was this last year?' ''
</P>
<P>
   When the team returned to the Valley, Campbell met with Pettas,
who said, ``You had a great camp. If you would have been this
relaxed at the last camp, you may have been the starter here.''
</P>
<P>
   When Campbell looks back at Tontozona in 1997, he knows what
made the difference when he and Kealy were competing for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kealy) was coming in with the approach he had nothing to
lose. There was no pressure. Freshmen aren't supposed to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably put too much pressure on myself. I thought, `If I
don't get this job, I'm done with football. I'm never going to
start here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now he has only one thing in mind: beating Oregon and having fun
while doing it. After that, he'll just see what unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   He has his life pretty well mapped out. He will marry his high
school sweetheart in the summer and pursue a coaching career. In
the back of his mind, he still holds out a little hope that he can
continue playing football beyond college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never given up the dream,'' he said. ``But I've come to
the realization that I've got to be smart and not put all my eggs
in one basket. But I don't want to talk about that far ahead. I've
got Oregon to worry about.'' &QL;

NO CLICHE: CARDS MUST BEAT DALLAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We don't know what goes on behind closed doors. We don't see the
Vince Tobin his players see.
</P>
<P>
   To us, he is mild-mannered, a man of few words, but we won't be
there in that private moment before Sunday's big game when Vince
circles his team around him in the pin-drop silence of the locker
room and looks at each player, eye to eye, and says . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Men, forget the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   (at)( the Dallas Cowboys!
</P>
<P>
   This is our game. Our place. Our time.
</P>
<P>
   In a few minutes we're gonna run out that door _ if it's locked,
knock it down _ and show the world who we are.
</P>
<P>
   We're the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   You and you and you and you . . .
</P>
<P>
   We control our destiny.
</P>
<P>
   We can put up or shut up. Sink or swim. Go forward or go
backward. Fish or cut bait.
</P>
<P>
   We won't retreat because you know what hump spelled backward is?
</P>
<P>
   It's pmuh.
</P>
<P>
   Outside this room nobody gives us much chance. But when we get
out there _ by the way, we're not punting the ball to Deion _ keep
this in mind: when you wish upon a star, it makes no difference who
you are, and men, you're winners. Every one of you.
</P>
<P>
   Winners never quit.
</P>
<P>
   Quitters never win.
</P>
<P>
   There's no ``I'' in ``team.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's safety in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the first day of the rest of your lives.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk about Dallas a minute. They have Emmitt Smith. Well,
we have Mark Smith. They have Deion Sanders. I'll take Frank
Sanders, thank you. They've got Eric Williams. Aeneas Williams,
stand up. Take a bow.
</P>
<P>
   We're a good football team.
</P>
<P>
   And if we join hands and play our game _ not somebody else's
game _ we can fight fire with fire and keep the home fires burning,
and if there's a single one of you in this room who can't stand the
heat, then get up right now and walk out of the kitchen and don't
look back because, gentlemen, the buck stops here.
</P>
<P>
   People say we can't do this. Can't do that. Well, when I was
just a pup, my grandfather called me to his side as he lay on his
deathbed and told me something I'll never forget. I want to share
it with you.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa said before you criticize a man you should walk a mile
in his shoes. That way, when you criticize him you'll be a mile
away . . . and have his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Have I said winning isn't everything?
</P>
<P>
   It's the only thing.
</P>
<P>
   Every time you lose you die a little.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to get Mr. Bidwill off the critical list.
</P>
<P>
   Offense, especially you linemen, put your shoulder to the wheel
and take the bull by the horns. But for God's sake, no holding
penalties!
</P>
<P>
   We don't have to march down the field. Except where they use the
metric system, football is still a game of inches. It only takes 12
of 'em to make a foot. Three feet will get a yard. And 10 yards
gets us a first down.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it's third and 12.
</P>
<P>
   Who's got Leon Lett?
</P>
<P>
   Jake, watch the blitz.
</P>
<P>
   We've won five, lost four. If my arithmetic is correct, after
Dallas we'll be 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   But we can't look ahead. If we count our chickens before they
hatch, we're not counting chickens. We're just counting eggs. Think
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we can't put all our eggs in one basket.
</P>
<P>
   Too risky.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody use the bathroom?
</P>
<P>
   OK then, guess that's about it. Button your helmets and remember
the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
</P>
<P>
   If we all give 110, we shall not flag or fail. We shall fight
'em on the beaches. We shall fight 'em in the fields and in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And if you remember nothing else, remember this:
</P>
<P>
   Play within yourself, because when you play without yourself
it's awfully lonely.
</P>
<P>
   An idle mind is the devil's workshop.
</P>
<P>
   It ain't over till it's over.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nedney, lead us in a word of prayer . . .

COYOTES GET BREAKS WITH TEAM ON ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sergei Fedorov banked in that flukey, back-breaking goal
off the back boards in pivotal Game 6 of last year's first-round
playoff series against the Coyotes, the Detroit center could only
shrug his shoulders and smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team is on a roll, the lucky bounces always seem to go
your way,'' Fedorov said. ``That seems to be the way it is in this
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the red-hot Coyotes, who fast are becoming the talk of
the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are they getting their fair share of the bounces and
breaks on the ice, which helped them climb to the top of the league
standings entering Thursday's games, but they also have been
extremely lucky off the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Take their injury situation, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Drake, the right wing on the team's No. 1 line, is
thought to be out four to six weeks with a fractured ankle. A
couple of days later, it turns out to only be a bad bruise, and he
missed only one game.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Corkum, the club's best faceoff man and a catalyst on the
league's third-best penalty-killing unit, is supposed to be
sidelined a week after twisting an ankle while in-line skating on
his day off. He plays the next night, plus the night after that,
and doesn't miss a beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time we got some luck,'' said team captain Keith
Tkachuk, who extended his point-scoring streak to seven games with
his eighth goal during a 2-0 victory Wednesday over Dallas, which
pushed the Coyotes' undefeated streak to seven (5-0-2). ``But we
``have'' been pretty fortunate so far, haven't we?''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, for instance, suffered a freak hand
injury earlier this week in practice when a slap shot somehow
penetrated his blocker glove. But after a couple days' rest, the
swelling subsided, and he now has been pronounced reasonably fit to
play Saturday when the Coyotes try to improve on their
record-setting 7-2-2 start by playing host to the Tampa Bay
Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, backup Jimmy Waite started consecutive games and
has looked like a Vezina Trophy winner, notching a 1-1 tie with
Colorado and a huge victory over the rival Stars to improve to
2-0-1 and boast the NHL's top-rated goal-against average (0.65) to
boot.
</P>
<P>
   It only gets better from there. In the Dallas win, defenseman
Oleg Tverdovsky and center Jeremy Roenick each got their bells rung
by Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor. Tverdovsky left the game and did
not return after getting run from behind and hurting his right
elbow. Roenick, meanwhile, got his face flattened when Sydor flung
him headfirst into the Plexiglas support beam next to the Dallas
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Both incidents looked painfully destructive. But amazingly, both
Tverdovsky and Roenick are expected to be in the lineup Saturday
against Tampa Bay and former Coyote center Craig Janney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have somebody on our side this year,'' said
Roenick, who suffered a slight case of whiplash on the Sydor hit.
``We have to maintain a very good attitude and go straight home
after practice and not do too many bad things to keep whoever's on
our side on our side. . . . It's been a nice change.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, after losing a league-high 473 man-games to injury last
season, you count your blessings ``and'' knock on wood every chance
you get.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get some luck sometime, especially after the
frustrating season we had last year,'' said Tverdovsky, who said
his injury probably looked a lot worse than it was. ``We had so
many guys get hurt last year, and hopefully it's not going to
happen this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Things couldn't be much better right now for the Coyotes. They
have the best team goals-against average (1.43) in the league. They
have allowed only 16 goals in 11 games. They're healthy. Their role
players are putting in headline-type performances. And so are their
stars, such as Tkachuk, who's on pace for a 60-goal season.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky or not, ugly or not, this has been Tkachuk's greatest time
in the NHL to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, especially when you get a start like this and
there's a lot of pressure on the team and yourself after a
disappointing year last year,'' he said. ``You want to come out,
get an early lead and jump ahead of the pack. We've done that, but
it's still a long way to go.'' &QL;

BOBEK TO SKIP SCOTTSDALE SKATE EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nicole Bobek will avoid having to qualify for the U.S. Figure
Skating Championships after all.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of skating at the Pacific Coast Sectional, Dec. 6-12 in
Scottsdale, the five-time national medalist is expected to be given
a bye so she can represent the United States at the Canadian Open
on Dec. 5. That meet in Kitchner, Ontario, is an International
Skating Union open competition.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. Figure Skating Association said
Thursday that there is no reason for the bye not to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Local skating officials had been told Bobek was required to
skate at the sectional because she is not the reigning national
champion _ Michelle Kwan is _ or an Olympic or World medalist from
the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
   Bobek, 21, was excused from regional competition because she
participated in Skate America, finishing fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, Bobek has placed third or higher in four national
championships, winning the senior ladies title in '95.
</P>
<P>
   The top four finishers in Pacific Coast senior, junior and
novice divisions at Cellular One Ice Den qualify for 1999
nationals, Feb. 7-14 in Salt Lake City. &QL;

KINGS LOSE TO NASHVILLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ With a team from Music City making its initial
visit, the Kings picked the appropriate night to orchestrate a
discordant symphony of sour notes.
</P>
<P>
   They came out and grabbed an early lead against Nashville, then
never lit the red light again. The expansion Predators gradually
found their rhythm, and third-period goals by Sergei Krivokrasov
and Darren Turcotte sent the reeling Kings to a 3-1 loss Thursday
night before a small but surly Forum crowd announced at 9,956.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Kings (5-8-3), the start of the postseason
is five months away. If the playoffs began today, the first-year
Predators (6-7-1) would be in, and the 32nd-year Kings would be
out.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville is 3-2 on its six-game trip, and the Kings are 1-4-2
in their first seven home games. The loss was the second straight
for the Kings, who are 1-5-1 in their last seven games overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should win these games,'' Kings coach Larry Robinson said.
``They outworked us. Maybe we got more chances, but they outworked
us. They had a game plan, and they stuck with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had pondered lineup changes following the Kings'
previous loss, a sloppy 5-4 overtime setback in Calgary two nights
earlier, but reconsidered after reviewing videotape of the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's debacle, Robinson said he again was considering
altering the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe sooner than you think,'' said Robinson, whose team plays
host to Carolina on Saturday night. ``We've got to do something.
We're not winning with what we've got. We've got healthy guys
sitting out. It's only fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, it looked as if the Kings were ready to turn
their game around.
</P>
<P>
   They grabbed a 1-0 lead on Vladimir Tsyplakov's shorthanded goal
2:02 into the first period _ he has scored in four consecutive
games _ and outshot the Predators, 14-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were from the perimeter,'' winger Glen Murray said,
describing most of the Kings' shots. ``We didn't get in front of
the net, didn't drive to the net. If (Nashville goalie Mike Dunham)
sees the shots, I don't think they're going in, the way he's
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the shooting margin didn't translate into a larger
lead, and as usual, the Kings' power play was a key culprit,
failing three times in the opening 20 minutes. The Kings have only
five power-play goals in the season's first 16 games and were 0 for
4 against Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, the momentum shifted, and the Predators
began to produce some of their own scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   One of those resulted in the tying goal, 11:53 into the second
period, when Ville Peltonen, one-on-one against Kings defenseman
Garry Galley, cut to his right and lifted a 20-foot backhander over
the glove of Manny Legace.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings almost regained the lead when Dunham was caught out of
his net with Murray in possession of the puck. But Murray's shot at
the open net hit the right post, and the teams entered the third
period in a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys, `You can't fool around with the puck at the
blue line,''' Robinson said. ``In the first period, we did it and
outshot them. Then, we turned around and started trying to carry it
in again. We're getting chances, but we're not getting the second
efforts, the third efforts for rebounds in front. There's
absolutely no traffic in front of the net.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, Krivokrasov scored the game-winner from the
slot off a pass from Peltonen after less than two minutes, and
Turcotte scored a strange goal, banking the puck in off Galley
about 10 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had a chance to cut the deficit to one shortly
thereafter, when Dunham again was caught out of his net, but Matt
Johnson's shot at the empty net was wide.
</P>
<P>
   At the final horn, the dwindling crowd booed the Kings off the
ice, and Robinson was left to speculate about what's happened to
his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of wondering if our conditioning is what it should
be,'' Robinson said. ``I'm trying to ease off a little bit in our
practices only because we're playing a lot of games over a short
period of time. But there's always a question of whether the guys
are looking after themselves away from the rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not getting his rest and he's not looking after
himself, certainly he's going to be tired. You have to ask a lot of
questions because the bottom line is we're not getting the results
from the guys we've got on the ice now.''

SHADY DEALERS PLAY THEIR HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's that time of year. The frost is on the pumpkin. The
snowbirds are on the the golf courses. Terry Bradshaw's concussions
are showing.
</P>
<P>
   And fantasy football owners are trying to cheat.
</P>
<P>
   This is when those quaint little deals are struck, where one
owner decides to trade his best running back to his buddy for a bag
full of door knobs. Or Bam Morris, whichever moves slower.
</P>
<P>
   Some (the guys pulling off the deal) call this creativity.
</P>
<P>
   I have a different name for it _ collusion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I wouldn't dare suggest that an owner with a dismal record
might try to help a buddy with the idea of cashing in later.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yeah, I would.
</P>
<P>
   In a league where all the owners are friends, this can lead to
some ugly confrontations. Yes, even uglier than the first half of
the Cardinals-Redskins game.
</P>
<P>
   I just love the look on the guilty party's face when you bust
him:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean I can't trade Terrell Davis for Gary Busey?''
he says, feigning shock. ``What kind of operation you running
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there can be hard feelings and, even worse, a whole lot
of whining.
</P>
<P>
   While I live for these little moments, a good commissioner can
avoid them by adopting some hard and fast rules governing
transactions in the late part of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In my league, I ban all non-injury transactions beginning in
Week 11. Usually, even the worst also-rans can hang on this long,
so they're less likely to dump their top talent for, uh, future
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Since our playoffs start in Week 14, I allow owners to replace
injured players until then. Of course, these must be real injuries,
landing the guy on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Terry Glenn doesn't count.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, just put a clause such as ``anything not covered by the
rules will be decided by the commissioner.'' This will head off any
hanky-panky before the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of trades, a lot of NFL quarterbacks are trading in
their jerseys for body casts, or are just being yanked because they
emit an offensive odor. What we know, up to the moment:
</P>
<P>
   Dallas: Troy Aikman suffered a cut and sprained finger against
the Giants but still finished the game. Expect him to start against
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Denver: John Elway has dinged up ribs. X-rays were negative,
however. He may start against Kansas City, but Bubby Brister could
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City: Elvis has left the building. Coach Marty
Schottenheimer (can we go ahead and fire him now?) has benched
Grbac for the mobile Rich Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville: Mark Brunell strained his groin Sunday but said he
could have played in the second half against Cincinnati. He'll
start.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota: Brad Johnson is out four weeks because of a broken
thumb. Randall Cunningham had minor knee surgery Monday but still
will get the nod against the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland: Jeff George aggravated his groin pull Sunday and
probably is a scratch for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego: Lovable Ryan Leaf has been benched for Craig
Whelihan.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco: The Packers beat on Steve Young two weeks ago,
and he's still feeling it. He was held out of the Panthers game
with an abdominal strain, but he'll gut it out (heh, heh) and start
against Atlanta. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tip of the week &QL; 
 &QL; 
Calling all Jets. Vinny Testaverde and the gang should romp and
stomp against Indianapolis, which is waving the white flag on
defense. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL; 
 &QL; 
With Karim Abdul-Jabbar's injury, John Avery should take over the
starting running back job in Miami. Avery had a nice game against
the Colts, with 100 yards rushing and a touchdown. Oilers receiver
Kevin Dyson would be a nice pickup. &QL; 
 &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL; 
 &QL; 
This week it's Atlanta tight end O.J. Santiago, who had two
touchdowns and 53 yards Sunday on three catches. Santiago is
decent, but he may not score again all year for the Falcons. &QL;

KNIGHT BACK AS STARTING CORNERBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A hamstring injury to J.B. Brown has helped cornerback Tom
Knight work his was back into the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who returned from a four-game absence to play in nickel
situations in last week's victory over Washington, will start at
right cornerback in Sunday's game against Dallas at Sun Devil
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He will make his first start since suffering a hamstring injury
on Oct. 1 in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tommy has been well, he has played pretty well,'' Coach
Vince Tobin said. ``In training camp, I saw a difference in the way
he covered. He did pretty well in nickel situations last week, and
the knee is more sound this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight, a 1997 first-round pick, wants to shake the label that
he is injury-prone. He almost missed all of the preseason because
of a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awkward at first last week,'' Knight said. ``As the
game went on, I got into shape, and I feel much better about having
to play a whole game this week. Now, I have a chance to be more
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   If Brown can't play, J.J. McCleskey is expected to be the nickel
back and second-year pro Ty Howard will be activated. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Making noise &QL; 
 &QL; 
Never before in the 11 years the Cowboys have been playing at Sun
Devil Stadium have they prepared by bringing in recorded crowd
noise to practice.
</P>
<P>
   But first-year Coach Chan Gailey, fearful that the sellout crowd
will be mostly Cardinals' fans, had crowd noise piped in at
Wednesday's workout in Irving, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means they respect us,'' Cardinals offensive tackle Lomas
Brown said. ``They know we've got the city rejuvenated and will
have a lot of people cheering for us at the game. They're trying to
take every precaution.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Better prepared &QL; 
 &QL; 
When the Cardinals and Cowboys met in the opener, first-round draft
pick Andre Wadsworth played 12 hours after signing.
</P>
<P>
   He was matched against one of the NFL's best offensive tackles,
Erik Williams, who is expected to return Sunday from a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not the best I've played against, he's the meanest,''
Wadsworth said. ``I don't mean that he's mean in a bad way. He's a
very aggressive football player.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
New nickname &QL; 
 &QL; 
Defensive end Simeon Rice now refers to Wadsworth, the third pick
overall in last April's draft, as ``The Gift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sent here for us to get better,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   In Wadsworth's first season, the Cardinals (5-4) have their
first winning record after nine games since 1988. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Walking wounded &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill presented team doctor Wayne Kuhl with
a special game ball for the 20-7 victory over Chicago last month.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhl suffered a fractured leg on a sideline collision when wide
receiver Frank Sanders caught a pass and was run out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves it,'' Bidwill said. ``He paid the price.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
 &QL; 
Starting offensive guard Lester Holmes (ankle) didn't practice
again Thursday but said he expects to play Sunday. He would be
replaced by Matt Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals haven't beaten the Cowboys in back-to-back years
at home since 1989 and '90. &QL;

QUICK STUDIES  
 JEFFERSON AMONG 5 KEY CATS FRESHMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE _ Richard Jefferson got the message.
</P>
<P>
   It's great that he has the quick first step to the basket for
highlight-reel dunks. It's good that he can keep defenders guessing
with his three-point shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But if he wants to start for Arizona, Jefferson, a freshman from
Moon Valley High, also has to defend and rebound. Coach Lute Olson
made that clear by starting Justin Wessel ahead of Jefferson in an
exhibition game Sunday after Jefferson was the leading scorer in
the final intrasquad scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson (6 feet 6, 210 pounds) responded to the challenge,
coming off the bench to score 17 points and grab seven rebounds in
a rally from 14 points down to a 72-64 win over Salakai Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   That elevated Jefferson into the lineup in his first college
game tonight when the 18th-ranked Wildcats open their season
against No. 9 Tennessee in the Black Coaches Association Classic.
New Mexico takes on DePaul in the second game.
</P>
<P>
   Another freshman, Traves Wilson (6-2, 228), is expected to start
at shooting guard as the Wildcats rebuild after losing four
starters who took them to the 1997 NCAA championship and the 1998
Pac-10 title and West Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   In all, five true freshmen are expected to get into the game for
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   UA's only returning starter is 6-10 senior center A.J. Bramlett,
who grew up in Albuquerque. Jason Terry (6-2, 172), one of the
better sixth men in college basketball the past two seasons, moves
into the starting point guard position. Eugene Edgerson (6-6, 219),
a key role player for two seasons, is the likely starter at power
forward, although he is being challenged daily by freshman Michael
Wright (6-7, 235).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are slow learners because we are young, but we are getting
better all the time,'' Jefferson said. ``I do have to be more
aggressive with the rebounding. On the defensive end, I have to get
in my man's face. It's clear that I still need to work on things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just started with what we are going to accomplish this
year. We have a lot of talent. At Arizona, it is not like we
rebuild, we just reload. You look at the teams they have had here
in the past, and they are always stocked with very good players.
But I think that had the six of us gone to any school, we would
have become a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jefferson has been encouraged to emphasize rebounding and
defense, he hasn't lost his scorer's mentality altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time that I have an open shot, I am going to take it,'' he
said. ``When there is an open shot and I am in my rhythm, I should
take it, even if I am a freshman.''
</P>
<P>
   The scoring has to come from somewhere. Bramlett is the most
experienced of the Wildcats but never has been a dominating scorer
inside. UA got its points outside from Mike Bibby, Miles Simon and
Michael Dickerson. They're now gone.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson moves into Dickerson's spot, and Simon will be
replaced by Wilson and Ruben Douglas, yet another freshman.
</P>
<P>
   The onus will be on Terry to create scoring from the point and
to set an example with his trademark defense. He is 44 steals away
from the UA career record.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Terry faces an early tough test from Tennessee's Tony
Harris, a freshman All-American last season who, like Terry, is
among the 25 nominees for the John Wooden Award.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has all five starters back from a 20-9 team that
played in the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats never have beaten the
Vols, although they have not met in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   With such an inexperienced team, Olson would have preferred a
later start against a lesser foe. He acknowledged that UA
``probably will take some lumps'' this season while the team comes
of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they're willing to work, we'll make progress,''
Olson said. ``This could be a pretty good defensive team. We have
good quickness and we've got inside guys who will work hard.'' &QL;

<P>
   &UR; STANFORD &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Coach: Mike Montgomery (13th year at Stanford, 235-132; overall,
389-209). &QL; 
 &UR; Last year: 30-5 (15-3 Pac-10, tie second), lost to Kentucky in NCAA
national semifinals. &QL; 
 &UR; Key players: G Arthur Lee, 6-1, Sr. (14.5 points a game, 4.5
assists a game); F Mark Madsen, 6-9, Jr. (11.7 ppg, 8.1 rebounds a
game); C Tim Young, 7-1, Sr. (11.3 ppg, 8.1 rpg). &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: With five starters back from the Final Four team and
plenty of depth, expectations are running high. The Cardinal
uniform this year features a bull's-eye on the back. &QL; 
 &UR; ARIZONA &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Coach: Lute Olson (16th year, 373-113; overall, 565-205). &QL; 
 &UR; Last year: 30-5 (17-1, first), lost to Utah in NCAA West finals. &QL; 
 &UR; Key players: G Jason Terry, 6-2, Sr. (10.6 ppg, 4.3 apg); C A.J.
Bramlett 6-10, Sr. (10.4 ppg, 7.4 rpg); F Richard Jefferson, 6-6
Fr. (Moon Valley High School). &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: Point guard Terry takes over a team so young that Olson's
hair already was white when many of them were born. Three freshmen
will start. Look for March Maturity. &QL; 
 &UR; UCLA &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Coach: Steve Lavin (third year, 48-17). &QL; 
 &UR; Last year: 24-9 (12-6, third), lost to Kentucky in NCAA South
semifi nals. &QL; 
 &UR; Key players: G Baron Davis, 6-3, So. (11.7 ppg, 5.0 apg); C Dan
Gadzuric, 6-11, Fr. (Den Haag, Holland); F JaRon Rush, 6-7, Fr.
(Kansas City, Mo.) &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: Tons of talent, but the Bruins are even younger than the
Wildcats, and Davis is coming back from reconstructive knee
surgery. Can Lavin teach the youngsters? &QL; 
 &UR; CALIFORNIA &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Coach: Ben Braun (third year, 35-24; overall, 368-259). &QL; 
 &UR; Last year: 12-15 (8-10, tie fifth). &QL; 
 &UR; Key players: G Geno Carlisle, 6-3, Sr. (17.9 ppg); F Sean Lampley,
6-7, So. (8.4 ppg, 5.2 rpg); G Thomas Kil gore, 6-2, Sr. (12.9
ppg). &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: Off probation and with virtually everyone back from last
year, the Golden Bears help make the Bay area a hoops hotbed.
Carlisle moves to point, and Lampley is a budding star. &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Coach: Bob Bender (sixth year, 68-72; overall, 128-129). &QL; 
 &UR; Last year: 20-10 (11-7, fourth), lost to Connecticut in NCAA East
semi finals. &QL; 
 &UR; Key players: C Todd MacCulloch, 7-0, Sr. (18.6 ppg, 9.7 rpg); G
Donald Watts, 6-4, Sr. (16.9 ppg); G Deon Luton, 6-4, Jr. (15.4). &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: Plenty of punch provided by a strong inside-outside attack
centered on MacCulloch. Bender has some quality depth, but point
guard and defense remain concerns. &QL; 
 &UR; ARIZONA STATE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Coach: Rob Evans (first year; over all, 86-81). &QL; 
 &UR; Last year: 18-14 (8-10, tie fifth), lost to Hawaii in NIT first
round. &QL; 
 &UR; Key players: F Bobby Lazor, 6-9, Sr. (16.8 ppg, 7.8 rpg); F Mike
Batiste, 6-8, Sr. (15.3 ppg, 7.8 rpg); G Eddie House, 6-1, Jr.
(11.3 ppg). &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: Evans, the only new coach in the conference, will have the
Sun Devils playing defense. Lazor, Batiste (ineligible until Dec.
19) and House can score, but who else? Point guard and depth are
questionable. &QL; 
 &UR; OREGON &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Coach: Ernie Kent (second year, 13-14; overall, 103-94). &QL; 
 &UR; Last year: 13-14 (8-10, tie fifth). &QL; 
 &UR; Key players: G Terik Brown, 6-1, Sr. (12.8 ppg); F A.D. Smith, 6-8
Jr. (10.4 ppg, 4.4 rpg); G Darius Wright, 6-0, Jr. (West Valley
Junior College, Calif.). &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: The Ducks will be bigger and deeper than last year. Brown
needs a more consistent shooting hand, and newcomer Wright has to
solidify a shaky point-guard position. &QL; 
 &UR; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Coach: Henry Bibby (third year, 26-30). &QL; 
 &UR; Last year: 9-19 (5-13, eighth) &QL; 
 &UR; Key players: F Jarvis Turner, 6-8, Jr. (10.6 ppg, 5.3 rpg); F Adam
Spanich, 6-7, Sr. (12.0 ppg); F/C Brian Scala brine, 6-9, So.
(Highline Community College, Wash.). &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: Bibby brags about the athletes he has, but this is
basketball, not the decathlon. &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON STATE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Coach: Kevin Eastman (fifth year, 59-59; overall, 183-134). &QL; 
 &UR; Last year: 10-19 (3-15, tie ninth). &QL; 
 &UR; Key players: F Chris Crosby, 6-7, Jr. (11.8 ppg); G Blake Pengelly,
5-10, Sr. (8.0 ppg, 4.1 apg); G Mike Bush, 6-5, Fr. (Kent, Wash.). &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: In four seasons under Eastman, the Cougars have won 18,
18, 13 and 10 games. The trend continues. &QL; 
 &UR; OREGON STATE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Coach: Eddie Payne (fourth year, 26-61; overall, 185-170). &QL; 
 &UR; Last year: 13-17 (3-15, tie ninth). &QL; 
 &UR; Key players: G Deaundra Tanner 6-2, So. (9.0 ppg); C Jason Heide,
7-0, So. (3.6 ppg); C George von Backstrom, 7-0, Jr. (Western
Nebraska Commu nity College). &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: Corey Benjamin? Gone. J.B Bickerstaff? Gone. Seventy-nine
per cent of the offense? Gone. Payne after this season? . . . &QL;

 &UR; Outlook: Brand inside, Langdon out side and a new starting point
guard, William Avery, who might be better than Steve Woja. . .
Steve Woji. . . Wojo. &QL; 
2. Connecticut &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Coach: Jim Calhoun. &QL;

ppg, 7.1 rpg). &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: Hamilton is terrific and El-Amin el-ectrifying. Calhoun
has never reached the Final Four, much less won it all. If they
don't do it now, lots of Huskies fans will prefer not to grant him
another chance. &QL; 
3. Michigan State &QL; 
 &QL;

Obinna Ekezie, 6-10, Sr. (12.8 ppg, 6.5 rpg); G Steve Francis, 6-3,
Jr. (junior college). &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: It's always Duke and North Carolina, North Carolina and
Duke in the ACC, right? Not this year. This should be a very
Profitable season for the Terps. &QL; 
5. Kentucky &QL;

Turner, 6-2, Sr. (9.3 ppg); Heshimu Evans, 6-6, Sr. (8.8 ppg, 5.4
rpg). &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: Some of the defending champs were off-court chumps as the
result of running afoul of the law. But talent usually prevails,
and the Wildcats usually have it. &QL; 
6. Temple &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Coach: John Chaney. &QL;

Rasheed Brokenborough (11.8 ppg); F Kevin Lyde, 6-10, Fr. &QL; 
 &UR; Outlook: Whoooooo are these guys? Temple always plays defense. Now
the Owls can score, too, especially if Rasheed repairs his broken
shooting touch. &QL; 
7. Stanford &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; See Pac-10 preview, C10 8. Tennessee

Black, 6-8, Jr. (12.6 ppg, 6.8 rpg); G Brandon Wharton, 6-3, Sr.

(10.3 ppg, 5.0 apg).
 &UR; Outlook: Another 20-win season is in the bag for Boeheim. Whether

DEFENSIVE LINE ANCHORS CATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Arizona is the secret that the national media say it is,
there are reasons other than the empty seats at home games that
have helped to make it so.
</P>
<P>
   Look along the defensive front line.
</P>
<P>
   Now, go ahead and ask the question:
</P>
<P>
   Who are those guys?
</P>
<P>
   In large part, the answer tells the story to the Wildcats ride
from predicted mediocrity to No. 9 in the ``Associated Press''
poll.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Cochise near Douglas in mid-August, Arizona Coach Dick
Tomey was talking about a committee approach to filling the roles
along the defensive front.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest surprise in a surprising season has been
that each new member has played like an incoming chairman of the
board.
</P>
<P>
   As it has turned out, there's been nothing common about the
line's performance, a key to a top-rated Pac-10 defense that has
allowed only three touchdowns and 231 yards rushing over the past
four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is amazing is that we've had so many different
guys come up and they've had their day in the sun,'' said Tomey,
whose team is favored to win its 10th game for only the second time
in school history Saturday at California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's been one of the neat things about this season.
We don't really have a star-guy or a high-profile guy. We just have
a lot of guys doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Wildcats have had one, senior Daniel Greer, who
has acted as the committee's chairman. Greer has started at
defensive tackle through 10 games. All around him, however, the
numbers and faces have changed, changed and changed.
</P>
<P>
   The first big change came with a slight back injury to Joe
Tafoya, one of the few who was seen as a starter from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   With Tafoya sidelined, Tomey looked around and found Mike
Robertson, a transfer from Nevada. Robertson was a key to a victory
over Oregon State and suffered a shoulder injury on crushing tackle
against Oregon. Enter sophomore Idris Haroon, who was credited with
2{ sacks against Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, three young players _ Eli Wnek, Keoni Fraser and
Ben Alualu _ continued to surprise. Wnek, a redshirt freshman from
Glendale Ironwood High, spent last year on scout teams. He spent
time in the weight and class rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eli is just growing into himself,'' Tomey said of the
6-foot-2, 240-pound end, who in street clothes doesn't look like
the hulk so often associated with defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   For Fraser and Alualu, Tucson's desert setting, college football
and the Arizona campus are a new world altogether. A year ago, they
were playing high school football in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, Fraser has emerged as a consistent starter and
sometime star. Arizona's late victory at Washington was the first
game in wich Arizona began to attract some national attention.
Tomey says Fraser's role was a key to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made big play after big play,'' said Tomey, who wouldn't be
surprised to soon see Alualu at the same level. Alualu was
sidelined early in the year by a slight knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of any real prep hype about Fraser and Alualu is a
factor that makes both so intriguing. Neither was a highly rated
phenom in any of the many recruiting magazines. Even in Hawaii,
they weren't the most-sought-after prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Fraser often sounds as though he's homesick.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the mainland, it's everybody to themselves,'' Fraser said.
``Back home, everybody is together.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if Fraser has found a little bit of home along
Arizona's defensive front. &QL;

REDMOND EXPECTS TO PLAY; KEALY PROGRESSING

<P>
   Coach Bruce Snyder, in need of good news, received some
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback J.R. Redmond, who has been nursing a right ankle
injury, is almost at full strength and likely will play Saturday in
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Ryan Kealy, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on
his right knee Monday, was able to throw in practice and is healing
quicker than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now (Steve) Campbell will start, unless (Kealy) just
really bounces back,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said the playing status of Redmond and Kealy will be
game-time decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.R. predicted he'd be 100 percent today, and he was close,''
Snyder said. ``He's going on the trip and wants to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Gerald Green's left-shoulder sprain has improved. He
practiced Thursday and likely will play. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Block it out &QL; 
 &QL; 
Chop-gate just won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   The furor prompted by Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti's charge that
ASU's offensive line is guilty of ``questionable tactics'' was kept
alive by the Pac-10's supervisor of officials, who said the Sun
Devils should have been cited for a chop block in their victory
Saturday over California.
</P>
<P>
   The play in question was on the first snap from scrimmage and
resulted in a knee injury to Bears defensive lineman Jerry DeLoach.
ASU center Grey Ruegamer was involved in the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was missed,'' the Pac-10's Verle Sorgen said. ``Those can
be difficult to pick out because there is so much congestion in
that area.''
</P>
<P>
   California Coach Tom Holmoe submitted a videotape to the league
office on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bellotti has a curious ally in Bears defensive coordinator Lyle
Setencich, ASU's linebackers coach in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something wrong with that, and every football coach
knows it,'' Setencich told the ``San Jose Mercury News.'' ``Bruce
Snyder knows it, and offensive coordinator Dan Cozzetto knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   While reviewing the play, Setencich said, ``Take a look at the
center. See what he's aiming for? That's not an accident. There's
nothing but intent and purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Cozzetto and Snyder have been adamant in their stance that they
don't coach the technique and have been backed by current and
former players.
</P>
<P>
   Bellotti, by the way, is an assistant coach for the West team in
the postseason East-West Shrine Game. Ruegamer will play for the
West team. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Recruiting update &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mountain Pointe High School kicker Mike Barth has given the Sun
Devils an oral commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 205-pound Barth originally committed to California
but changed his mind and said he wants to play for the Sun Devils.

Last year: 32-4, lost to Kentucky in NCAA South final. &QL; 
Key players: C Elton Brand, 6-8, So. (13.4 ppg, 7.3 rpg); G Trajan
Lang don, 6-3, Sr. (14.7 ppg); F Shane Battier, 6-8, So. (7.6 ppg,
6.4 rpg). &QL; 
Outlook: Brand inside, Langdon out side and a new starting point
guard, William Avery, who might be better than Steve Woja. . .
Steve Woji. . . Wojo. &QL; 
2. Connecticut &QL; 
 &QL; 
Coach: Jim Calhoun. &QL; 
Conference: Big East. &QL; 
Last year: 32-5, lost to North Caro lina in NCAA East final). &QL;

min, 5-10, So., (16.0 ppg, 4.2 apg); C Jake Voskuhl, 6-11, Jr. (6.9
ppg, 7.1 rpg). &QL; 
Outlook: Hamilton is terrific and El-Amin el-ectrifying. Calhoun
has never reached the Final Four, much less won it all. If they
don't do it now, lots of Huskies fans will prefer not to grant him
another chance. &QL; 
3. Michigan State &QL; 
 &QL; 
Coach: Tom Izzo. &QL; 
Conference: Big Ten. &QL; 
Last year: 22-8, lost to North Caro lina in NCAA East semifinal. &QL;

Antonio Smith, 6-8, Sr. (7.9 ppg, 8.7 rpg); F Jason Klein, 6-7, Sr.
(11.2 ppg). &QL; 
Outlook: Cleaves, a dynamic point guard, might be the most exciting
player in the country and Smith is a load up front. There are
others, too. &QL;

Obinna Ekezie, 6-10, Sr. (12.8 ppg, 6.5 rpg); G Steve Francis, 6-3,
Jr. (junior college). &QL; 
Outlook: It's always Duke and North Carolina, North Carolina and
Duke in the ACC, right? Not this year. This should be a very
Profitable season for the Terps. &QL;

Turner, 6-2, Sr. (9.3 ppg); Heshimu Evans, 6-6, Sr. (8.8 ppg, 5.4
rpg). &QL; 
Outlook: Some of the defending champs were off-court chumps as the
result of running afoul of the law. But talent usually prevails,
and the Wildcats usually have it. &QL; 
6. Temple &QL; 
 &QL; 
Coach: John Chaney. &QL; 
Conference: Atlantic 10. &QL; 
Last year: 21-9, lost to West Virginia in NCAA West first round. &QL;

Rasheed Brokenborough (11.8 ppg); F Kevin Lyde, 6-10, Fr. &QL; 
Outlook: Whoooooo are these guys? Temple always plays defense. Now
the Owls can score, too, especially if Rasheed repairs his broken
shooting touch. &QL; 
7. Stanford &QL; 
 &QL; 
Coach: Mike Montgomery (13th year at Stanford, 235-132; overall,
389-209). &QL; 
Last year: 30-5 (15-3 Pac-10, tie second), lost to Kentucky in NCAA
national semifinals. &QL; 
Key players: G Arthur Lee, 6-1, Sr. (14.5 points a game, 4.5
assists a game); F Mark Madsen, 6-9, Jr. (11.7 ppg, 8.1 rebounds a
game); C Tim Young, 7-1, Sr. (11.3 ppg, 8.1 rpg). &QL; 
Outlook: With five starters back from the Final Four team and
plenty of depth, expectations are running high. The Cardinal
uniform this year features a bull's-eye on the back. &QL; 
8. Tennessee &QL; 
 &QL; 
Coach: Jerry Green. &QL; 
Conference: Southeastern. &QL; 
Last year: 20-9, lost to Illinois State in NCAA West first round. &QL;

Black, 6-8, Jr. (12.6 ppg, 6.8 rpg); G Brandon Wharton, 6-3, Sr.
(15.2 ppg). &QL;

right up there, too. &QL; 
9. Oklahoma State &QL;

Capel, 6-8, Fr.; F Ademola Okulaja, 6-9, Sr. (8.0 ppg, 5.6 rpg). &QL; 
Outlook: Antwaun Jamison, Vince Carter and Shammond Williams all
went in the NBA draft. So why are the Tar Heels here? Why is the
sky Carolina blue? It just is. &QL; 
11. Arizona &QL; 
Coach: Lute Olson (16th year, 373-113; overall, 565-205). &QL;

Bramlett 6-10, Sr. (10.4 ppg, 7.4 rpg); F Richard Jefferson, 6-6
Fr. (Moon Valley High School). &QL; 
Outlook: Point guard Terry takes over a team so young that Olson's
hair already was white when many of them were born. Three freshmen
will start. Look for March Maturity. &QL; 
 &QL; 
12. Xavier (Ohio) &QL;

Coach: Skip Prosser. &QL; 
Conference: Atlantic-10. &QL;

Brown, 6-2, Sr. (14.7 ppg); G Gary Lumpkin, 6-2, Sr. (12.3 ppg, 4.5
rpg). &QL;

If they aren't sick of each other, they'll take the X-men far. &QL; 
13. Purdue &QL;

Jaraan Cornell, 6-3, Jr., (12.3 ppg); G Carson Cunningham, 6-0, So.
(Ore gon State transfer). &QL; 
Outlook: We could talk about Cardi nal's intense play, or the
impact of Cunningham, and a great recruiting class. But it all
comes back to Keady's hair. &QL; 
14. UCLA &QL; 
Coach: Steve Lavin (third year, 48-17). &QL; 
Last year: 24-9 (12-6, third), lost to Kentucky in NCAA South
semifi nals. &QL;

Gadzuric, 6-11, Fr. (Den Haag, Holland); F JaRon Rush, 6-7, Fr.
(Kansas City, Mo.) &QL; 
Outlook: Tons of talent, but the Bruins are even younger than the
Wildcats, and Davis is coming back from reconstructive knee
surgery. Can Lavin teach the youngsters? &QL; 
15. Utah &QL; 
 &QL; 
Coach: Rick Majerus. &QL;

Mot tola, 6-10, Jr. (12.5 ppg, 5.3 rpg); F Alex Jensen, 6-9, Jr.,
(6.8 ppg, 5.8 rpg). &QL; 
Outlook: You think Majerus would have stayed if the Utes were going
to be crummy this year? &QL; 
16. Cincinnati &QL; 
 &QL; 
Coach: Bob Huggins. &QL; 
Conference: USA. &QL;

Levett, 6-3, Sr. (14.1 ppg); F Pete Mickeal, 6-7, Jr. (junior
college). &QL; 
Outlook: Year in and year out, the Bearcats consistently put the
``ath lete'' back in ``student-athlete.'' &QL; 
17. Arkansas &QL; 
 &QL; 
Coach: Nolan Richardson. &QL;

NICARAGUA TUG-OF-WAR OVER EMERGENCY AID 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT COLLIER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua _ Nicaraguans are fighting again, but it's
not with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the deadly visit of Hurricane Mitch, a political
tug-of-war is raging over the torrent of emergency aid that is
pouring into the country.
</P>
<P>
   As during the Contra rebel war of the 1980s _ which, like Mitch,
inflicted devastating blows to the nation's economy and
infrastructure and caused thousands of deaths _ Nicaraguans are
busy wrestling for power amid the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle pits the municipal governments in the affected
areas, most of which are controlled by the leftist Sandinistas,
against President Arnoldo Aleman, a feisty conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaraguan officials and foreign aid experts say the dispute is
likely to worsen, undercutting the country's chances of recovering
from a disaster with damage estimated to be equal to half the gross
national product.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Posoltega, where about 2,000 people were killed
and 13,000 made homeless by an enormous mudslide caused by the
hurricane, townspeople accuse Aleman of holding off aid deliveries
for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received almost nothing from the government,'' said
Felicita Zeledon, Posoltega's Sandinista mayor. ``Aleman wants to
push us aside and use the aid for his own political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have serious needs here, people who need help, back-country
roads that need fixing, and all he does is try to make things look
pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the only government aid coming into the area this week
was being funneled to the president's Constitutional Liberal Party.
Along the region's major highway, local peasants were hard at work
Thursday, cutting down grass and weeds. The party, they said, was
paying their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman downplays the criticism, calling it ``much ado about
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going fine,'' he said earlier this week. ``With
God's help, we'll rebuild our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Posoltega was by far Nicaragua's hardest-hit town, the
president has pointedly not visited and is not expected to do so
soon.
</P>
<P>
   When Aleman visited Leon, the nation's second-largest city, he
was loudly booed by crowds after he announced that all government
aid nationwide would be channeled through the conservative Catholic
Church rather than through municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
   Independent observers say that Aleman's motivation for blocking
aid and the local mayors' reason for protesting are the same: pure
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Aleman government is sectarian,'' said Controller Agustin
Jarquin, the chief auditor of government spending. ``There's
political manipulation of the emergency aid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have, just like we did in the 1980s, is a train wreck
of political interests,'' Jarquin said. ``The right hates the left,
and the left hates the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarquin, the leader of the small centrist Social Christian
Party, has repeatedly clashed with Aleman over the past two years,
charging cabinet ministers and top officials with corruption. In
return, Aleman has tried, and failed, to strip Jarquin _ who is an
elected official _ of his investigative powers.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman's decision to channel all government aid through the
Catholic Church bore a surface resemblance to the move made by
President Carlos Flores in neighboring Honduras, where aid
distribution was assigned to the Catholic, Protestant and
evangelical churches.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras, the churches have no strong political role. But in
Nicaragua, the Catholic Church is anti-Sandinista, while many
Protestant and evangelical churches are pro-Sandinista.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aleman's move benefited one sector at the expense of the
others, and that's not the best way to manage aid,'' said Simon
Ticehurst, Nicaragua director for the British aid agency Oxfam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like if there were a hurricane in the U.S. South, and
President Clinton decided to send all government aid through the
Baptist church. What would people say then?''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign aid organizations have been eager to help in Nicaragua,
and they have successfully pressured the government to permit them
to deliver assistance directly to stricken communities.
</P>
<P>
   Since he assumed office in January 1997, Aleman has had a
tempestuous relationship with the nongovernmental groups, which he
often accuses of being pro-Sandinista.
</P>
<P>
   The Posoltega region, located about 40 miles northwest of
Managua, the capital, has been relatively prosperous by Nicaraguan
standards. Corn, sugar, peanuts and sesame produce bumper crops on
the fertile plains under a chain of 4,000-foot volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Posoltega is lucky in another sense: The local priest is an
iconoclast within the Nicaraguan hierarchy and has cooperated with
Zeledon, the Sandinista mayor.
</P>
<P>
   With his shoulder-length hair, goatee, blue jeans,
Harley-Davidson watch and American hiking boots, the 30-something
Rev. Benjamin Villarreal cuts an unusual figure _ just as he does
during the several months each year that he lives in the Orange
County town of Huntington Beach, giving Mass at a Catholic Church
there.
</P>
<P>
   In Posoltega, Villarreal and the mayor have agreed to share the
aid that the church gets from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has tried to politicize the aid, and that's
what has happened in other towns,'' the priest said. ``But here,
even though we haven't received enough, we work together with the
town government.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the two bustled about in Posoltega's hectic town hall,
where hundreds of people made homeless by the mudslide were seeking
food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Peasants clamored for help to resettle in their devastated
homes. ``I want to go back to my little ranch, because that's all I
have,'' said one. The priest, the mayor and an army official asked
people to be calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough for you, but you have to stay where you
are in the emergency shelters,'' said Mayor Zeledon. ``You have to
organize yourselves to pressure the government so that it will give
you what you need.''
</P>
<P>
   The political passions worry international aid officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this moment of crisis, Nicaragua needs to be unified, not
divided,'' Ticehurst said, adding that international aid groups
``are worried that as the period of emergency aid changes to the
period of rebuilding the country, the situation will become even
more divided.''

SCIENTISTS DISCOVER FOSSIL OF NEW DINOSAUR SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID Perlman  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    Once upon a time _ 100 million or so years ago _ the world of
dinosaurs was filled with strange and exotic creatures, and now
scientists have excavated one of the strangest and most formidable
of all:
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have discovered the fossil bones of an entirely new species
of meat-eating creature with a long thin snout like a crocodile,
thick legs like tree trunks, huge curved claws like meat hooks, and
evidence from its teeth and stomach that indicates it often dined
on fish and smaller plant-eating dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   The team of paleontologists found their huge fossil in Africa's
remote Tenere Desert in central Niger, south of the Sahara, where a
vast lakebed once lay during the geologic period known as the
Cretaceous. And from earlier discoveries it appears that the
creature had evolutionary relatives as far off as Egypt, England
and even Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was announced in Washington, D.C., Thursday by its
expedition leader, Paul Sereno of the University of Chicago. A
detailed account of the fossil dinosaur's anatomy is being
published Friday in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Sereno and his colleagues have named their creature Suchomimus
tenerensis _ souchos is Greek for crocodile, and tenere for the
name of the desert, which has yielded rich troves of other dinosaur
fossils in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The beast, apparently a young one, was already 36 feet long and
12 feet high at the hip, according to Sereno, and was easily the
size of Tyrannosaurus rex. Its rows of teeth were curved and the
claws on its forearms carried huge curved thumbs more than a foot
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``With its forearms and its jaws, it would have been able to
take down just about anything,'' Sereno said. ``It was the dominant
predator of its time.''
</P>
<P>
   The formidable creature, together with its relatives, was a
member of a mysterious group called spinosaurids whose backs
carried long, finlike sails. From fragmentary fossils found
elsewhere, they apparently lived as dominant beasts between 90
million and 125 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The fossilized stomachs of other dinosaurs related to Suchomimus
tenerensis contained fish bones and scales apparently etched by
digestive juices, as well as the remains of small plant-eating
dinosaurs, according to Thomas R. Holtz Jr. of the University of
Maryland, who wrote a commentary on the Sereno expedition's find in
Science.
</P>
<P>
   The creature's sharp teeth, Holtz said, would ``function better
as piercers and graspers rather than as slicers and slashers _ that
is, as meat hooks rather than steak knives.'' Just how the varied
species of spinosaurs arose in so many different parts of the world
remains a mystery. Sereno believes they must have crossed land
bridges in the era when Earth's continents were joined in
supercontinents, but that theory is highly controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a cool animal, and since we're always trying
hard to understand how the stranger and more bizarre creatures
evolved, every bit of evidence we can unearth can help a lot,''
said Kevin Padian, a specialist in dinosaur evolution at the
University of California at Berkeley.

computer is becoming a requirement for anybody who expects to
succeed in college or in the workplace, and this fact of life will
become even more pronounced in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The signs are everywhere. Many colleges expect students to show
up with computers, and some others give laptops to all incoming
students and expect them to know what to do with them. Starting
this fall, the only way to apply to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology is by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Well-prepared professionals from automobile maintenance to
graphic design cannot leave home without the computer, or a good
understanding of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to use a computer has now become so basic, to come
to work without it would be like a carpenter reporting without a
hammer,'' said Bart Keith, a training supervisor with Siemens AG,
the German electrical engineering and electronics company.
</P>
<P>
   Given this new reality that governs education and the workplace,
what about young people who fail to become computer-literate?
</P>
<P>
   The computer have-nots could be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with educators, employers and policy-makers underlined the
importance of young people gaining not just a knowledge of computer
technology, but also a comfort level that comes most readily from a
home environment that includes the computer and an Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no longitudinal studies yet that track the experience
of a youngster with a home computer, against a youngster without
one, to show what happens later to each of them,'' said Kathy
O'Neill, director of instructional technology at Georgia State
University. ``But we do know that kids who have access at school
and at home gain a better familiarity with computing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts emphasized that once young people get the computer
bug, it is best that they get everyday access that allows them to
become comfortable with the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an overall advantage to all our employees to be
computer-literate,'' said Nancy Seipel, a human resources
specialist with Georgia Power. ``Though we do not require the
ownership of a computer when we talk to job candidates, it is my
opinion that it would be extremely helpful if a person used a
computer every day at home, where they could get a working
knowledge of the machines and the software that makes them run.''
</P>
<P>
   For students, experts emphasize the need to learn the range of a
computer's uses, and to learn that it is most of all a window on a
larger world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child needs connection to the Internet because that is
what expands her access to knowledge,'' said Richard Skinner,
president of Clayton College and State University in suburban
Atlanta. ``In my view, without Internet connection, your computer
is not much more than a typewriter.''
</P>
<P>
   Many states and cities have fully embraced that idea, making
Internet research an integral part of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   One day last month in Judy Mack's third-grade classroom at
Normandy Elementary in Centerville, Ohio, a group of girls
clustered around a computer connected to an Internet site about the
sun. The girls rattled off solar facts, carefully recording their
findings on pads of paper. Beside them, Annie Lee, 8, surfed sites
as she developed a report on Neptune, excitedly announcing to her
neighbors that Voyager II visited the planet the same year she was
born.
</P>
<P>
   But wealthier school districts are more likely to provide such
technological enhancements. About 75 percent of students in richer
districts, where most students don't qualify for federally
subsidized lunch programs, used the Internet at school, the
Education Department reported in 1996. At poorer districts, where
most students were in the lunch program, only about half used the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For some districts, getting computers is only half the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Whittier Elementary School in Dayton, Ohio, is eligible to
receive top-of-the-line Pentium computers, but the building's
electrical system cannot handle the load of four computers switched
on at one time in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have these computers, but if you can't plug them in
they are a paperweight,'' said Principal Judy Warren.
</P>
<P>
   At Belmont High School, Dayton's computer technology magnet
school, the only Internet access in teacher David Kraus's lab is
through his laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Nealon, chief information officer for Dayton Schools, said
wider Internet access depends on the district getting ``e-rate''
funding, money from telecommunications companies that is now being
held up by bickering in Congress and challenges from the companies.
</P>
<P>
   While some experts believe that children can significantly
improve their computer skills by using them at schools or
libraries, others are certain computers are needed in homes _ as
long as they are used for more than just playing games.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I have learned is that familiarity with computers
develops other skills, skills that could be just as attractive as
computing skills,'' said Nancy Hamilton, program director of a
nonprofit agency called Apple Corps, which offers free computers to
parents who volunteer to learn the machines and then commit
themselves to service in the schools of their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you cannot run a computer without reading. You can't
work a computer very long without being a problem-solver. You learn
flexibility as a computer operator,'' said Hamilton. When that
screen suddenly goes blank, you have to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What industry wants is problem-solvers, and people with the
flexibility to keep learning, keep developing in school and
competence. Well, familiarity with the computer is the beginning of
a lot of those skills.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as wealthier school districts are often better equipped
with technology, home computers are found mostly in high-income
households. More than 75 percent of U.S. households earning more
that $75,000 owned a computer in 1997, the Commerce Department
reported, compared to about less than 20 percent of households
earning under $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   This has sparked efforts by some private groups to create
computer centers where children can have ready access.
</P>
<P>
   Some centers have been established by businesses and church
groups. In Georgia, DeKalb County has established a half dozen
``family computer'' centers where children and parents can use the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the falling prices of computers and allied equipment
such as printers and monitors, financial affordability may become
less of a factor in who owns a home computer, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   New computers are now available for less than $500, the price of
a fancy cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems beyond dispute to me,'' said Lyndon Wade, president
of the Atlanta Urban League, ``that computers must become at least
as handy as telephones, because they are that kind of basic need.''

RECORD WITHIN REACH FOR COWBOYS' DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ This is not the greatest Cowboys defensive unit
scheduled to face the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. But this group
could set a club record, distancing itself from past units that
helped win Super Bowls in the 1970s and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have allowed 33 points in five NFC East games this
season. This has put them on pace to break the 1971 club record for
fewest points allowed against division opponents (86) in a
nonstrike season.
</P>
<P>
   NFC East offenses are as weak as they have ever been. Aside from
Cowboys players, Arizona wide receiver Frank Sanders is the only
performer in the division ranked among the top 14 in the NFL in
rushing, passing or receiving.
</P>
<P>
   No one was doing cartwheels around Valley Ranch when mention of
the would-be record came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing really good right now, but I don't want to get
too caught up in what we've done over the last three or four
games,'' strong safety Darren Woodson said. ``Just when you start
to get overconfident, another team can come through here and put 28
points on us, and it can get Denver-ish in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Denver. It seems like eight months _ not eight games _ ago
when running back Terrell Davis and company ran through the Cowboys
for a 42-23 triumph. The Cowboys have since rebounded well. They
lead the league in scoring defense, allowing 13.4 points per game.
They have not given up a touchdown in the past nine quarters. This
streak covers a span of 25 drives and dates to Chris Penn's 13-yard
touchdown reception over Kevin Smith on Oct. 18 at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey praises his defense for the streak,
the club's longest since 1996. But he gives partial credit to his
offense and special teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys lead the league in kickoff coverage, with opposing
teams starting post-Cowboys scoring drives at an average of their
own 20-yard line. And because the Cowboys' offense has one turnover
on its own side of the field _ a Jason Garrett desperation pass on
the next-to-last play of the loss in Chicago _ the opposing team
usually begins drives deep in its own territory.
</P>
<P>
   These elements combined last week to pin the Giants on or inside
their own 20 on seven of their nine drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for any offense to score touchdowns when they have
to drive the length of the field,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Teams have tried to shorten the field by completing long pass
plays or runs, but the Cowboys are tough to score on inside the 20,
allowing a league-low six touchdowns in the red zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look around most of the league, when a team has a big
play in a drive _ a 20-yard run or a 25-yard pass _ usually that
drive ends with a touchdown,'' defensive coordinator Dave Campo
said. ``Whenever we give up a big play, we talk on the field with
the attitude that we've got to make something happen right now.
Guys don't get down. Guys are not demoralized. Because if you are,
that's when the offense strikes again for a score.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have been beaten for big plays, but have usually
responded with a big play of their own. In the past two games,
Woodson has an interception and a sack in the red zone, thwarting
touchdown drives by the Eagles and Giants. That sack, of Giants
quarterback Danny Kanell, ended the best touchdown threat against
the Cowboys since the Bears game.
</P>
<P>
   While the players are proud of their latest defensive stand,
each knows the Cardinals present the stiffest offensive challenge
the Cowboys have faced in several weeks. Cardinals quarterback Jake
Plummer has completed 67 percent of his passes the past two games.
Running back Adrian Murrell rushed for 107 yards against the
Redskins last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are in the classroom really watching film,'' Woodson
said. ``Then we practice hard. With the talent we have, if we know
our assignments and do what we are supposed to do during the week,
we'll have a pretty good team. If not, we'll be just average.''
Notes
</P>
<P>
   After missing a second day of practice, center Clay Shiver
(sprained right foot) is listed as doubtful against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Erik Williams (sprained left foot) practiced and
appears ready to start against the Cardinals.

<P>
   The intensifying showdown with Iraq leads at the Washington
Post, Los Angeles Times, New York Times and USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. increased its bomber presence in the Persian Gulf,
the total isolation of Saddam Hussein became apparent. Thursday
Egypt, Syria and six other Gulf countries signed a declaration that
blamed the crisis on Iraq's intransigence. Even France and Russia _
which traditionally have supported Iraq's argument that sanctions
should be lifted _ have voiced no opposition to a possible U.S.
attack.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. rhetoric was sharp: Defense Secretary William Cohen warned
that military strikes, if they occur, ``will be significant.''
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said, ``We have thought
well beyond Hour One and Day One and Week One.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz reiterated
Iraq's stance that sanctions should be lifted before weapons
inspectors are reinstated. Aziz did indicate, however, that Iraq
would welcome U.N. intervention _ but Kofi Annan, who has been
burned too many times by Iraq's broken promises, shows no
inclination to head to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT says that ``an attack on Iraq, and possibly a massive
one,'' could come at ``virtually any moment.'' The WP is more
cautious, citing U.S. officials who say that ``military action is
not likely for 10 days, although it could come sooner.'' Possible
reasons for delay include President Clinton's upcoming swing
through Asia and a last chance for diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal fronts a story on how E.W. Scripps Co.,
owner of Home and Garden Television, broke into the ``clubby'' and
expensive cable programming business _ in which would-be
programmers must even pay cable systems for channel space. Scripps
essentially got lucky _ after stumbling on the concept of using
``retransmission rights'' as a bargaining chip _ and its
boomer-friendly content took off, once aired. Nonetheless, Scripps
had no free rise: It initially had to promise 25 percent of its ad
revenue to cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   A nerve-racking USAT cover story says that airports nationwide,
in an effort to accommodate more traffic and increase runway
efficiency, are practicing ``the simultaneous use of intersecting
runways.'' One jet could be taking off and another landing on
intersecting runways; it is presumed that the landing jet will stop
well before the intersection. Though a number of near-misses have
been reported, the FAA wants to extend the practice to flights at
night and in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT and LAT front stories on the $433 million lawsuit
against the gun industry filed Thursday by the city of Chicago. The
suit charges that stores in Chicago's suburbs knowingly overstocked
guns, confident that they would be distributed to illegal outlets,
and that the gun industry constitutes a ``public nuisance'' _ that
is, by enabling illegal gun sales, it increased the burden on
Chicago's civic services. The lawsuit, reminiscent of the fight
against Big Tobacco, may serve as a model for upcoming suits in
Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In a long NYT op-ed, Tony Blair writes deferentially of how
``America is once again responding to the call of duty'' in the
Iraq crisis. Using the Iraq context as a springboard, Blair opines
the U.S. shoulders too much responsibility for European and
international affairs. Europe should be more organized, he says.
``America's trans-Atlantic commitment has made Europe a safer
place. But Europe needs to do more to repay that debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology grows ever more bizarre: A human skin cell nestled
in a gutted cow egg turned into an embryo and divided _ or so
claims a small biotechnology company in Worcester, Mass., according
to a WP story. This extraordinary revelation, made public Thursday,
has spawned questions not only about the legitimacy of the results,
but also about possible misuse of federal funds. If the experiment
is true, its implications are so surreal that they bear repeating:
The first human embryo may have been cloned _ with the aid of a cow
egg.

   Art Helms, a software project manager for Applied Management
Systems of Rockville, Md., must be one heck of a boss.
</P>
<P>
   After Helms had spent three afternoons a week on dialysis for
three and a half years, his doctors told him in May that his
kidneys would have to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   He told his staff that after the operation, he would be on a
waiting list for a donor kidney and expected to be out of the
office for weeks. He never expected the reaction he received.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nearing, a systems analyst at the company, offered him one
of her kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gesture blew me away,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   At first Helms didn't quite take her seriously. But Ms. Nearing
did some research and determined that she was, indeed, a match. ``I
don't think he was prepared for someone bouncing into his hospital
room saying, `Guess what? We can do this,' '' she said. ``And this
was probably the first time I'd ever seen him outside of work.''
</P>
<P>
   If they weren't close friends, why would Ms. Nearing, a mother
of two who has worked two days a week for the company since 1995,
offer a kidney to her boss?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a guy who does all the things you want a boss to
do,'' she said. ``He gives you the tools you need to do your job
right. He bends over backward to facilitate whatever schedule you
need so that you can actually have a family life. Wouldn't you try
to keep it going?''
</P>
<P>
   One might ask where the ethical conundrum is in this
extraordinary story. Clearly, Ms. Nearing's act is one of great
altruism. Between July 14, when he had his kidneys removed, and
Sept. 10, when he received Ms. Nearing's, Helms experienced
congestive heart failure twice. Essentially, Ms. Nearing saved her
boss' life.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical issue is implicit in Ms. Nearing's rationale for
donating her kidney: She cares about Helms as a boss and wants to
keep that relationship going. But her gift to Helms _ which you
would otherwise jump to call selfless _ crossed many a workplace
boundary.
</P>
<P>
   And so her act of charity leaves tough questions in its wake:
Most bluntly, how does Helms ever fire Ms. Nearing, should the need
arise? Less bluntly, how will the transplant affect work
relationships?
</P>
<P>
   Such matters can seem tacky, at best, and Helms and Ms. Nearing
never discussed them. Neither did anyone else at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never entered my mind,'' said Margaret Hutchison, the
director of administration, whom Ms. Nearing called to arrange for
time off to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
   The only time the issues came up was during a visit by Ms.
Nearing with a psychiatrist, something that the Georgetown Medical
Institute requires of donors before a transplant. Ms. Nearing was
taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really hung up on the fact that he was my manager,''
she said of the hospital. ``It was uncomfortable, and it made me
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   The company should have discussed the issues with her and with
Helms, said Sharon Daloz Parks, a co-author of ``Common Fire:
Leading Lives of Commitment in a Complex World'' (Beacon Press,
1996) and associate director of the Whidbey Institute, a career
development group in Clinton, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is doing this in hopes that it preserves continuity in her
work life, but if, in the future, she needs to be reviewed for any
type of underperformance, who does that?'' Ms. Parks asked. ``What
happens if other workers begin to feel that she is in some way
inadequate, but she's forever with us because she gave a kidney to
the boss?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nearing does sense that something has changed in her
relationship with Helms _ that they and their families have grown
closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not 100 percent sure Art would ever fire me if he had
to,'' she said. If she felt she was getting favors she didn't
deserve, she added, ``then I'd have to go find another job _ and I
don't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms says he would be able to move Ms. Nearing to another job
if, for example, she ever had a really tough year. ``That's my
job,'' he said. ``I hire and I fire.'' But, he added, ``I had to
make it clear to Nancy how much I appreciated what she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people try to keep work and personal lives separate, even
as the boundary grows murky. Many find it natural to discuss the
implications of personal decisions with family members. Far fewer,
it seems, have such talks with co-workers when they are the ones
involved. But they should.

A GENERATION UNAFRAID OF THE DARK  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)

<P>
   Two years ago, Peter Shankman had what he called the ``coolest
job in the world'': working in the digital newsroom at America
Online. It was a coup for Shankman, a self-described techno-geek
who had been a journalism major, and he hoped to stay awhile.
</P>
<P>
   But his plans changed one gray November morning in 1996, when he
and dozens of his colleagues were greeted with pink slips.
Shankman, then 24, spent the next few days in a fog, wondering how
his dream had evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two years later, he is president of Geek Factory Inc., a
public relations firm in Manhattan with mostly high-technology
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than find another full-time job, I thought, `Why not go
into business for myself?' '' he said. ``This isn't the 50s, where
you took a job and worked for 40 years and retired; job security
doesn't exist anymore. I'd rather take the risk when I don't have
any liabilities, not even a goldfish.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is only six months old and he still has no staff,
except for an unpaid high-school intern. But he is long on hope.
</P>
<P>
   In leaving the corporate cocoon for the risky but potentially
more rewarding life of an entrepreneur, Shankman is like many other
people in their 20s and early 30s _ a generation that grew up
hearing the success stories of people like Bill Gates and Ted
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, some 46 percent of business start-ups were by people 35
and under, according to the Entrepreneurial Research Consortium at
Babson College in Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Other signs of the trend abound. At least 500 colleges offer one
or more courses in entrepreneurial studies, up from 240 in 1990 and
just 80 in 1979, according to George Washington University's Center
for Family Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly 700 teachers and students attended the recent
convention of the Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organization, run by the
University of Illinois at Chicago, up from 550 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are willing to take risks, whereas 10 years ago
it was kind of an oddity,'' said Rieva Lesonsky, editorial director
of Entrepreneur Media of Irvine, Calif., publisher of Entrepreneur
magazine. ``They're not ashamed of failure. Older generations
thought they should exile themselves if they failed, but kids today
think: `Why kill myself? I'm 26 years old; I have my whole life
ahead of me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That is how Paul Brinberg felt when he left New York three years
ago for San Diego, to help start a record label, PC Music.
Brinberg, now 33, had been working in the finance department of
Atlantic Records when a co-worker mentioned that he was
contemplating starting his own company. Would he be interested in
joining him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about to turn 30, and I thought, `It's now or never,' ''
he recalled. ``I couldn't do that at 40 with a family.''
</P>
<P>
   So Brinberg and his wife packed their belongings and drove off
to unknown territory. He and the business partner set up shop on a
dining-room table and began cold-calling. ``It's very much a
bloody-knuckles business; you've got to keep knocking on doors,''
he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company has signed six bands. Last year he was able
to pay himself a salary, albeit only half of what he was making in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, business ownership has always attracted the younger
generation, but in previous decades the most likely candidates
seemed to be people with an almost genetic predisposition toward
running their own show.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Diane Heppting, now 39, who started while still in
grade school. When she was 10, her father helped her invest in a
mutual fund, which the two monitored daily. At 15, she opened a
car-detailing business, because ``I was asthmatic and couldn't mow
lawns.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, after graduating from the University of Colorado with a
degree in organizational management and personnel administration,
Ms. Heppting founded a company that sold medical-billing systems to
hospitals and large clinics. Within a year, she and her partner
were building computer clones, eventually latching onto a
revolutionary new technology called CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy _ she recalls that a bank manager once told her
to ``get married and have her husband apply for the loan.'' But she
said it was worth it. ``The hardest thing was not giving up too
early,'' said Ms. Heppting, who now does consulting for other
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Shankman has a way to go before he achieves such business
success. But he has already found something more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant learning experience, but it's hard not to fall
in love with the freedom,'' he said. ``The best thing that ever
happened to me was getting the job at AOL. The second best was
getting laid off.''

GURU OF DOING IT RIGHT STILL SEES MUCH WORK TO DO  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn.)  (af) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard to believe that Dr. Joseph M. Juran is 93 years old.
</P>
<P>
   His hazel eyes still alternately twinkle and pierce, his smile
fluctuates between gracious and sardonic, his wit is keen and
sharp.
</P>
<P>
   And never mind that he has spent two days holding court in a
conference room at the Warwick Hotel in New York, patiently doing
one-on-ones with reporters wanting to hear his take on whether
American industry finally has its problems with quality under
control.
</P>
<P>
   He looks rested and positively dapper in his dark suit and bow
tie, fielding yet another stream of queries.
</P>
<P>
   But then, novelty tends to perk up anyone. And for Dr. Juran,
arguably the world's pre-eminent living expert on quality in
products and the organizations that produce them (W. Edwards
Deming, after all, died in 1993), sitting still for interviews is
novel indeed. Then again, he is writing his memoirs, so maybe this
is a dry run for a book tour.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his reasons for opening up, when Juran talks quality,
people listen.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Romania who emigrated to Minneapolis with his family
at the age of 8, Juran graduated from the University of Minnesota
with an electrical engineering degree in 1924 and has been stumping
the campaign trail for quality ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a law degree from Loyola of Chicago in 1936, in case
he needed something to fall back on during the Depression, but he
never found law as compelling as management.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, decades before re-engineering became a management
buzzword, Juran was applying his then-radical concepts of empowered
worker teams and continuous quality improvement to reduce defects
at Western Electric's Chicago Hawthorne Works. During World War II,
he and his techniques helped cut the time it took to process
military supply orders from the front to 36 hours from 99 days.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Quality Control Handbook,'' published in 1951, and
``Managerial Breakthrough,'' in 1964, have been hailed by
management gurus like Peter Drucker as springboards from which
American manufacturers could launch their sporadic leaps into
quality.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, such praise has been heaped on various speeches and
white papers and consulting projects that his Juran Foundation has
churned out since he founded it in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, Juran does not mince words when he talks about
how Japanese companies from carmakers to electronics whizzes have
cleaned corporate America's clock on quality issues. He refuses to
name today's offenders _ ``it would be unethical for me to point to
companies that just can't get their quality right,'' he said _ but
he readily condemns companies for quality sins of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese started their quality revolution right after
World War II, and it took them until 1975 before they caught up
with the West in quality,'' he said. ``Our companies didn't start
fighting back until 1980, and even then, most of their initiatives
failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the poor record? In Juran's mind, the buck stops squarely at
the top. ``CEOs have always left quality to chance or to
committees, never to people high-level enough to make decisions,''
he said. ``So the workers would use statistical tools to quantify
costs and defects, and they'd set goals and monitor progress toward
them.'' Why is that so bad? He explained: ``Say there's always been
a chronic scrap problem that could be solved, but that the workers
just think is inevitable and gets built into the goal. It's a
problem, but it's treated like a fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Juran has no patience with talk about motivating workers to
produce higher-quality products. ``Companies like General Motors
would post big slogans like `Do it right the first time' on every
plant wall,'' he said. ``Well, that sounds great on the
transmitting end, but considering that operator mistakes and
oversights cause maybe 15 percent of quality problems, it's pretty
insulting on the receiving end.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is no cranky pessimist. He reckons that swelling numbers
of companies are finally getting it right on quality _ raising
service and customer-satisfaction levels as costs, defects and
product-development cycles plummet.
</P>
<P>
   They are the companies that have learned to do triage on their
quality problems. They let line workers deal with the ``trivial
many,'' the hundreds of little glitches from a screw that needs
oiling to an inefficient mail delivery schedule _ minor quality
problems that nonetheless add up.
</P>
<P>
   But these companies do not hesitate to devote plenty of
high-level resources to the ``vital few'' _ the materials or
procedures or people that cause the most problems.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of the auto company and the leaky cabs. By
Juran's recollection, anyone driving that company's trucks in the
rain got wet. But not all the truck cabs leaked in the same places,
so the design errors were not easy to ferret out.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than let workers keep plugging isolated leaks, the
company asked a team to diagram exactly where the leaks were
occurring in a host of cabs. They found that three locations
accounted for 90 percent of the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They redesigned just those spots,'' Juran recalled. ``Now,
instead of an average of three leaky spots in every cab, they have
an average of just one leak in every three cabs.''
</P>
<P>
   The solutions are not always so predictable, leading Juran to
point out another attribute of companies that know how to tackle
quality: ``They are prepared to turn over a rock and deal with some
pretty strange stuff underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: A few years ago, another auto maker, realizing
that too many of its cars were going out with unbalanced wheels,
formed a team to figure out why. The trouble turned out to be not
in the wheels but rather in the testing equipment: It gave
inconsistent results, and the readouts were too small for plant
workers to see without hunkering close.
</P>
<P>
   So what started as a project to overhaul wheel making turned
into a joint project with the supplier of the testing machine to
calibrate the equipment better and provide it with a bright digital
readout.
</P>
<P>
   Once the new gear was in use, ``fewer cars needed servicing
because of imbalanced wheels, and as a bonus, the company could
actually cut its field service staff,'' Juran recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to dissect a problem into chewable chunks is another
characteristic of a quality-savvy company, Juran said. The example
he cites is, of all things, a Hawaiian-themed resort with a troupe
of hula dancers who were not dancing up to par.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel managers told them to solve their problem or else. So they
trained a video camera on themselves and analyzed the tapes,
spotting which dancers made which missteps at which points in the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some steps every dancer had trouble with, so they changed the
choreography,'' Duran recalled. ``Good dancers that got a few steps
wrong got better training. Dancers that made lots of mistakes on
lots of steps just got canned.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Gingrich not to blame for GOP losses; campaign
didn't matter
 &HT;    By Martin Gottlieb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich lost his job over a misunderstanding. The
Democrats gained five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives,
so he had to go, because the president's party never gains seats in
a midterm election. Something must have been wrong with the
Republican campaign. And the speaker is the political leader in
House elections.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he was in pretty weak position before the election.
His biggest problem was his consistently low poll ratings. His
colleagues felt that his unpopularity complicated their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Just as obviously, though, if the Republicans had done well in
House elections this year, Gingrich would have been re-elected
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   His demise because of the election is absurd. It represents a
universally held and fundamentally wrong theory about how elections
work: that political strategy (message, symbols, media manipulation
and all that) is crucial in determining who wins.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the television talk shows. Read the commentary. It's a
given among Republicans, Democrats and nonpartisans that the
Republicans lost votes by getting too hung up on Clinton-bashing
and impeachment in the campaign. Gingrich essentially accepted the
charge in his post-election press conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Republican governors who won re-election
overwhelmingly did so on the basis of a message built around policy
issues free of the Clinton matter. He took responsibility for the
House defeat. (Specifically, he said his
</P>
<P>
   mistake was failing to realize that the Monica-obsessed media
would make people hate the whole subject of President Bill Clinton
and impeachment).
</P>
<P>
   But let's think about this: The pattern that was broken here -
presidential losses in midterm House elections - had lasted 65
years. Would it have lasted so long if it could be undone by
something as common as strategic mistakes?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the alleged experts explain almost ALL election
outcomes in terms of mistakes or failures by the losing side. So
are we to believe that for the last 65 years, the nonpresidential
party has run a good campaign in every election except this one?
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich led the GOP to control of the House in 1994, he
was hailed as a strategic genius. When things have gone wrong
since, he's been lambasted as poor competition for Clinton. To
believe he went from being a genius to a
</P>
<P>
   chump requires wanting to believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: A great many important people want to believe
it. If political strategy and tactics are seen as crucial in
election outcomes, the consultants, pollsters and academics who
make their livings posing as experts on such things can continue to
get rich. And journalists can continue to write about the stuff
that interests them.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists quote the consultants, pollsters and academics
as ``experts,'' not as members of an interest group.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, expert standing can't be lost. Almost no nonpartisan
expert predicted the Democratic gains. Just days before the
election, analyses were appearing in newspapers saying that, while
the election outcome might have been in some doubt until then, the
Republican financial advantage would come into play now. The party
would spend more money and win more seats as a result.
</P>
<P>
   (In 2000, the experts will again be emphasizing the crucialness
of money before the election. Count on it. Experience has no
effect.)
</P>
<P>
   OK, so what about the historical pattern? Why was it broken?
Let's think first about why it existed. Pundits seldom do. They
settle for saying ``history is on the Republicans' side,'' which is
nearly mindless.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's grant that the historical pattern is
counter-intuitive. If we were to guess, we would all guess that
popular presidents would gain House seats in midterm elections in
good times, and unpopular ones would lose seats
</P>
<P>
   in bad times. But, no, even the popular likes of Dwight
Eisenhower, John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan have failed to gain
seats in the best times.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The answer has to be about the swing voters: the people
who, for example, voted overwhelmingly for Reagan in 1984, then put
the Democrats back in control of the Senate in 1986, though nothing
had gone wrong for the country between 1984 and 1986.
</P>
<P>
   What's with these people?
</P>
<P>
   The best guess is that they are somewhat inclined to balance
their votes.
</P>
<P>
   When they elect a president, they do so with some qualms about
his views. (If they had no qualms, they would be members of his
party, not swing voters.) So they go the other way the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Again, this is counter-intuitive. We never hear people SAY they
are trying to balance the president's power. Still, at the very
least, the midterm criticisms of the president's direction must
give them a special degree of pause, determining their vote at
least in the absence of strong pro-con feelings about a particular
House candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, however - unlike any other midterm election in 65 years
- a vote for the opposition party did not feel like a vote to
restrain the president. It felt like a move to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   And the independents certainly didn't want to do that. We know
who wants to remove Clinton, and it's not the independents.
</P>
<P>
   The reason a vote for a Republican candidate felt like a vote
for impeachmentwas not that the Republicans were campaigning for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't. They hardly mentioned Clinton until some ads in
the final days.
</P>
<P>
   So long as an impeachment process is going on, it will
INEVITABLY dominate public thoughts about politics. It will be the
biggest story going.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans made a mistake this year, it wasn't in the
campaign. It was in beginning impeachment proceedings. But that
wasn't Gingrich. That was absolutely every Republican member of the
House. A few of the Democrats voted with the Republicans; no
Republicans voted with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mainstream Democrats supported an impeachment process
(though a watered-down one). Maybe they knew something.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans proceeded toward impeachment because it seemed
to make sense. A president who is reduced to fighting for his job
must surely have problems in a midterm. Turns out, though, that the
decisive, independent voters see midterms only as a midcourse
correction, not a chance to make a new beginning. The latter is
what presidential elections are for.

 &HT;    Cardio kickboxing surges in popularity
 &HT;    WITH SIDEKICK
 &HT;    By James Hibberd
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Jeff Ross can't handle any more pain.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving his spot in the back row, he staggers out of the
training room, wincing and holding his inner thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled my groin,'' Ross moans. ``Do you have an ice pack? I
think I kicked too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Combat Arts owner Jeff Esquivel takes Ross into his office and
gets an ice pack out of the fridge. Ross winces as he plops into a
chair, and the two men glance at the Kickbox Xtreme class through
the observation window. They look, but are careful not to stare.
Linger too long and the women glare back: What are you lookin' at?
</P>
<P>
   Ross is not a wimp. The Austin Community College student works
on a ranch and trains with weights. But in his class, where 30
toned young women and a couple of token men relentlessly kick and
punch to a 120-beats-per-minute techno soundtrack, Ross is a
lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple days I was in there, I felt like I was about
to die,'' Ross says. ``Ninety-nine percent of the women in there
are in better shape than me. That's why I stand in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all guys stand in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Cardio kickboxing (or aerobic kickboxing) is an odd marriage of
a masculine sport and a feminine exercise. Enormously popular for
nearly a decade on the coasts, the number of Austin cardio
kickboxing classes has doubled, tripled, quadrupled in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's booming in Austin because woman are tired of `step up,
up, down, down,' `everybody smile,' and the dancey choreography of
aerobics,'' says Kickbox Xtreme founder and New York transplant
Shirley Domicoli. ``Kickboxing is basic training; women can
de-stress and get their aggressions out.''
</P>
<P>
   Students warm up and stretch for 10 minutes, then engage in
about 35 minutes of rigorous aerobic shadowboxing and toning
exercises (there's no physical contact) followed by a 10-minute
warm-down. Muscle and Fitness magazine says cardio kickboxing burns
more fat _ about 1,000 calories per class _ than any other
cardiovascular exercise.
</P>
<P>
   At Combat Arts, Ross' class has 20 minutes left, yet the limbs
of some sweat-drenched students are going slack. They're tired of
pummeling invisible opponents, and fists drop in exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Instructor Paige Gore won't allow any rest breaks. She paces
around the room like an angry rock star, shouting commands to keep
students motivated. Her tanned biceps are as big as a child's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon!'' Gore yells. ``Give me 10 more!''
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted students take a deep breath, regain some motivation
and put up their dukes again: Must ... Keep ... Kickboxing ...
</P>
<P>
   Not kickboxing to defeat the undead, like Sarah Michelle Gellar
on ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' Not kickboxing to escape a serial
killer's basement, like Ashley Judd in ``Kiss the Girls.'' But
kickboxing to attain that toned, sports-drink commercial appearance
and confidence possessed by women like Judd and Gellar. The Lara
Croft, uber-girl, abs-and-ponytail look. One student heard about
Domicoli's class by asking a stranger in a bikini: ``Where'd you
get your body?''
</P>
<P>
   ``After my first class I was crippled for three days,'' says
Kickbox Xtreme member Clara Eliot. ``I couldn't use my arms. I
couldn't even eat.''
</P>
<P>
   A trend is born
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter for Steve Doss' Power Kickbox program tells the
story of karate competitor ``Big Becky'' Perkins. In 1983, Doss,
the No. 3-rated welterweight kickboxer in the world, trained the
170-pound Perkins for seven weeks to compete in the first-ever
Texas women's kickboxing tournament.
</P>
<P>
   At the weigh-in on the night of the fight, Perkins had dropped
to 148 pounds while her opponent weighed-in at 205. Doss and
Perkins had to plead with the judges, who were concerned Perkins
might get injured, to allow her in the ring. The judges relented,
and Perkins won the contest in less than one minute.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter concludes this modern Cinderella story:
``(Perkins) was no longer called 'Big Becky.' It was now `Babe
Becky!'''
</P>
<P>
   Tough is sexy. Femininity is a sports bra. Doss remembers that
15 years ago, ``You couldn't get a woman to do anything like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, I was the only guy in town who taught
kickboxing,'' says Doss. ``Today there are as many kickbox classes
as there are karate schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Doss credits himself with introducing kickboxing to the
Southwest and says he's the third martial arts instructor to ever
teach a cardio version. He's also taught seminars throughout the
country and sold 420 franchise kits to martial arts instructors.
The secret, he says, is striking a balance between kickboxing and
aerobics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really have a class that appeals to men and women at
the same time,'' he says, noting his classes are nearly guy-free.
``Almost all women are sick of aerobic classes, saying the teachers
act like it's a fashion show. Yet (punching) bag classes aren't
successful either. Women put gloves on, and it makes their hands
stink. They break their fingernails and, if they punch next to a
guy, their little hands are bouncing off the bag while you're
punching holes through it. And what does that do? Makes them feel
like the weaker sex. In this class, they can feel strong and
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Empowerment
</P>
<P>
   Strong and confident, yes. But do cardio kickboxing students get
a false sense of security?
</P>
<P>
   Cardio kickboxing takes basic kickboxing moves, subtracts the
punching bags and pads, subtracts the opponents and all but
subtracts training with the opposite sex. Constant movement is
emphasized over proper form, and instructors don't teach
self-defense education. Yet students leave class saying they can
kick butt and call it a ``kickboxing'' class.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my kicks aren't high enough _ whatever,'' says physical
therapist Michelle Merrill. ``If my punches aren't straight enough
_ whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she says, ``I feel like I can defend myself. I could take
out a knee.''
</P>
<P>
   Instructors contend the most important element of self-defense
is appearing confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never call it a self-defense class; we're trying to build
self-esteem,'' Domicoli says. ``Technique is important, but when
you're trying to have your toes positioned just perfect, your heart
rate drops. So if you want to slack off a little bit, that's OK,
you can slack off.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Doss: ``Self-defense isn't about skills or beating people
up. This class gives you confidence. After teaching several
thousand women in Austin, only a couple times has anybody ever used
their training. One was a girl who fought off a guy on Sixth
Street, and the other punched some girl who grabbed her friend's
hair. Both came out OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Domicoli and Doss have recently added full-contact classes,
where pads and gloves are used to give students a more realistic
feel for fighting. But the big money-maker remains the cardio
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives women what they want,'' Doss says. ``It burns body
fat in spades and makes them feel strong. And that's why it's a
workout that's here to stay.''

   Austin opera on the road
</P>
<P>
   WITH PHOTOS
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Barnesc. 1998 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin
Lyric Opera, with only 12 years of experience but many accolades
tucked under its breastplates, is going national. In the coming
months, the upstart company plans to export operas, already seen
here, to the larger markets of Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Paul,
Phoenix and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin's opera is very well respected,'' said John Humleker,
general manager of the 35-year-old Minnesota (cq) Opera. ``It's
considered innovative and on the upsurge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a recognition of the artistic quality here,'' said Joseph
McClain, artistic director of ALO, which this weekend is opening
its new season with ``Otello.'' ``More established opera companies
in other cities are asking to put our productions into their
seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the shared shows is the enormous financial risk
of mounting operas. Companies all over the country are teaming to
shoulder the start-up costs of new productions _ meaning new sets,
costumes, and (usually) new interpretations _ which can cost
$500,000 to $1 million per show.
</P>
<P>
   Once co-producers have staged an opera, it is not uncommon for
midsize companies to rent most, if not all, of their productions
from either the co-producers or traditional creative centers such
as San Francisco, Seattle, Houston and Chicago. ALO can reap up to
$50,000 for each show that it rents out to another company.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's operas are attractive because of the reputations of
McClain, considered one of the country's more inventive directors,
and designer Christopher McCollum. The company also is known for an
efficient scene shop, run by manager Steve Parks and featuring
painting by Stefan Passernig, an Austrian emigre who lives in
Dripping Springs. When an ALO show hits the road, Parks leads a
small staff of technicians to rework sets and costumes in each new
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reasons, Austin is becoming a proving ground for
opera productions,'' said McCollum, who designed not only
``Otello,'' but also Austin Musical Theatre's ``Gypsy,'' which
opens today at the Paramount Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   In facing today's opera economics, it also helps that Austin's
company has expanded its annual budget rapidly. At almost $3
million, it matches the revenues of the New Orleans Opera
Association, founded in 1943, in a city that has supported opera
since 1796.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing great stuff (in Austin),'' said Arthur Cosenza,
longtime general manager of New Orleans Opera, now retired. ``We've
never experimented with new works. And it's about time. Austin's
'Baby Doe' was very credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Produced in Austin two seasons ago, ``The Ballad of Baby Doe''
is headed for New Orleans in November 1999. With acclaimed settings
by design star Michael Yeargan, the opera of the Old West was ALO's
first by an American composer. The original Austin leads _ Cheryl
Parrish, Mark Delavan (who is singing in ``Otello'' here) and
Melanie Fonnenberg _ will accompany director McClain to the Big
Easy.
</P>
<P>
   Other export plans include:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Otello,'' which reframes the Shakespearean story of
green-eyed Othello, will travel to St. Paul's Ordway Music Theatre
in January 1999, taking along scenery by McCollum.
</P>
<P>
   _ A vest-pocket version of ``The Barber of Seville,'' also with
sets by McCollum, toured Austin schools for months. It has been
reproduced for the Lyric Opera of Chicago for future use in
educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season's ``Andrea Chenier'' has been picked up by Arizona
Opera for January 1999. The opera about love against the backdrop
of the French Revolution won critical praise, if not box office
success, in Austin. McClain will restage his version, with sets by
McCollum, in Phoenix and Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Besides these preliminary artistic tentacles, ALO is developing
co-productions of ``Die Walkure(cq),'' an exportable staging of
``Carmen'' that mixes audience with performers, and a co-commission
of a new opera from American composer Carlisle(cq) Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ALO is not the first Austin arts group to attempt an expansion
beyond regional boundaries. The Paramount Theatre launched a
high-dollar touring version of ``Dracula'' in the 1980s, but it
died on the road. Directors of Zachary Scott Theatre and Austin
Musical Theatre have taken Austin style to other cities, although
usually without local scenery, costumes or many of the performers.
Also, Austin-based theater producer Charles Duggan has navigated
his commercial touring empire of ``Tuna'' shows, musicals, concerts
and comedies from Austin for almost five years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Austin Lyric Opera is the first local nonprofit group to
distribute its material so widely. Much of the credit for the early
success goes to operatic salesman McClain, who heads the artistic
initiatives committee of Opera America, a national service and
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have every intention for Austin to become a center of
opera,'' McClain said. ``We are creating real 'music theater,' with
music-making and theater-making coming together in a powerful way.
That's what I'd like for us to be known for.''

 &HT;    Southern cooking sounds highbrow if you make it that way
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Back home from our recent tour de France, I was
comforted to find a copy of Don O'Briant's new book, ``Backroad
Buffets and Country Cafes: A Southern Guide to Meat and Threes and
Down-home Dining'' on my desk. Although the title is a mouthful (no
pun intended), it was a tremendous help in recovering from both
culture shock and jet lag. I was about up to my tonsils in crepes
and fancy sauces.
</P>
<P>
   O'Briant often passes himself off as some sort of an editor at
the Journal-Constitution in Atlanta. Actually he is Sonny Bubba
Ferguson, a good old boy from South Carolina who turned out to be a
fairly talented writer despite having gone to Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   While researching his latest venture into the literary arena,
O'Briant personally sampled more than 200 eating joints in the Old
Confederacy, ranging from Thelma's in downtown Atlanta to my
favorite oyster bar located at the end of a dirt road in St.
Mark's, Fla. The result is a diner's guide to authentic
high-cholesterol Southern cooking that ought to be issued to all
Yankee tourists and other foreigners looking for honest native fare
at an affordable price.
</P>
<P>
   In my world travels I've been appalled at how little is known
about Southern cooking. This was painfully evident throughout a
dinner conversation in Lyon, the gastronomic capital of France, a
country responsible for both goose liver pate and quiche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't suppose you people from Georgia are overly familiar
with French cuisine,'' said one of our scholarly touring
companions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the contrary,'' I replied. ``Many of our favorite dishes
are directly descended from great French chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collard greens are an example,'' I continued, ``Collard is a
French word. Pronounced kah-lod. Collard greens were a favorite of
Louis IV and were frequently served at state dinners in his palace
in Versailles. In fact, collards became so closely associated with
opulence of French royalty that they were banned after the
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the distraction of being kicked in the shins by my
spouse, I continued. Northern friends should be enlightened
whenever an opportunity arises.
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out that Benjamin Franklin, on one of his visits to
Paris, was able to smuggle a small packet of collard seed back to
Virginia, where they proliferated until all true Southerners became
addicted.
</P>
<P>
   I explained how collards can be garnished with a rare onion that
grows only on a small patch of sandy loam in the south of Georgia,
and how they are enhanced by a glass of cow's milk fermented in an
earthen container warmed on the hearth of an open fire, and then
churned with a wooden dasher.
</P>
<P>
   I explained how collards are seasoned with ham hock, enhanced by
a powerful concoction of red peppers and vinegar, and consumed with
a special kind of bread, either baked pone-shaped in an oven, or
cooked flat in a stovetop skillet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of historical fact,'' I threw in, ``what Marie
Antoinette really said was, ``Let them eat hoecake.''
</P>
<P>
   I was recovering from another shin kick when one of our table
companions, a schoolteacher from upstate New York, spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all about collards,'' she said. ``Slaves in the South
were forced to cook great pots of them to make juice, which they
called pot likker. Since the pot likker was rich in minerals and
nutrients it was considered by the slave masters to be a great
health food. They made the slaves give them all the pot likker. The
slaves had to eat the leaves with the minerals and nutrients boiled
out, and so they were undernourished and had a lot of diseases
while their cruel masters got fat and started a war.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not making that up. That's exactly what the lady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid,'' smirked my loyal wife as I limped from the
restaurant, ``that you just lost the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Told you so:
</P>
<P>
   Since about 11:15 on election night, pundits and pollsters have
agonized over how their crystal balls failed them. I hate to brag
about it, but mine didn't.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 10, in this space, I told about calling on my Uncle
Donald to find out who was going to be our next governor. Since
Uncle Donald's been batting about .900 for as long as I can
remember, I always make discreet inquiries when in doubt about
political races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being as he's shy about publicity, I can't tell you who is
going to be Georgia's next governor,'' I reported on Sept. 10.
``However, I will suggest that everybody be real nice to Roy Barnes
between now and November.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't suppose you people from Georgia are overly familiar
with French cuisine,'' said one of our scholarly touring
companions. ``To the contrary,'' I replied. ``Many of our favorite
dishes are directly descended from great French chefs.''

 &HT;    Celebrating how we all end up on `Sesame Street'
 &HT;    WITH ILLUSTRATION
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For those born before Big Bird, the ``Sesame
Street'' phenomenon has been something to see. Today, as
Nickelodeon rules children's airwaves and Blue's Clues continues to
make inroads as preschoolers' new must-see TV, it's time to pay
homage to the show that started it all, the show that dared to be
hip and childlike and educational.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, ``Sesame Street'' has been fulfilling its stated
goal of ``delighting and educating'' children on a global scale,
expanding from a never-simple hour's programming on public
television to a multimedia force. The spinoffs are innumerable,
from Tickle-Me Elmo to www.ctw.org, the Website of Children's
Television Workshop, Sesame Street's parent organization.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``Sesame Street'' games for your Gameboy and your home
computer. There are magazines (Sesame Street Magazine, Sesame
Street Parents, Kid City, Contact Kids, Padres de Sesame Street)
and books, videos and audios and a touring theatrical show. A
feature film (``Elmo in Grouchland'') is scheduled for an October
1999 release. There are toys and soaps and toothbrushes, Band-Aids
and collectibles. There are T-shirts and backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, Japan, and Langhorne, Pa., there are theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   All done without crossing the street.
</P>
<P>
   But all this would be for naught if the show did not do its job
of delighting and educating. Luckily, that hasn't been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch it. Of course we do,'' said Cindy Fleimor of Dayton,
whose preschooler Mark continues a lifelong (three years)
fascination with Aloysius Snuffleupagus, sometimes known as Snuffy,
the brownish pachyderm who's Big Bird's best friend. Fleimor says
that while her son watches the show intently, she has ``no idea''
if it's helping him learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm sure of one thing,'' she added. ``It doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sesame Street'' has made inclusiveness and diversity a strong
undercurrent to its programming. In 1971, Maria and Luis, a
Hispanic couple, started teaching a little Spanish. In 1974, a
National Theater for the Deaf performer taught sign-language
basics; 1976 brought a firm but gentle attack attack on gender
stereotyping with the addition of Olivia, a photographer, who was
cast to serve as a good role model for girls. Big Bird went to
China in 1982. A Japanese art student came to the street in 1989.
Big Bird went to Montana to tape a series of segments in Crow
Indian country, and in 1992, the show went on location to film in
and around Navajo, Cherokee and Iroquois tribes.
</P>
<P>
   It has tackled the hard topics as well, using any opportunity to
expand a child's universe with restraint and sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   The show won an Emmy for its treatment of the death of Will Lee,
who played Mr. Hooper, a series regular. Mr. Hooper died as well,
and the creators and writers used the event to talk to young
children about death. Another regular couple, Susan and Gordon,
adopted a baby boy, Miles, leading to an examination of adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, ``Sesame Street'' is quietly doing its part for world
harmony.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the show debuted a 70-episode series produced through
a cooperative effort with Children's Television Workshop, Israel
Educational Television and Al-Quds University's Institute for
Modern Media, making it an Israeli-Palestinian co-production
encouraging mutual respect and understanding. Also this year, CTW
collaborated with Shanghai Television to produce a Chinese ``Sesame
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   All without crossing the street. In 1993, the show took its
viewers ``around the corner,'' thereby expanding the world of the
street's inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   The show's 30th year has been full of celebration, all leading
to the season premiere on Monday, where it will undoubtedly
continue to delight and educate further generations of children.
</P>
<P>
   Though they long ago stopped watching ``Sesame Street'', it was
been an important part of growing up for the Smith kids, who live
in Moraine: Jason, 14, remembers it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just something about Big Bird,'' he said. ``He's dumb,
but not dumb ... I used to sit on the floor and just stare. I'd eat
breakfast in front of the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Margo, 12, nods in agreement. ``We wouldn't leave the
family room. Snuffy, especially, is my favorite. Maybe Mom used the
show as a babysitter, but it did the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Jen, smiles. ``When your kids are in front of
`Sesame Street', you've got no worries,'' she said.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Tyler Ulm's 3-year-old body is covered with
bright red patches of raised skin. Every toe on his left foot has
been amputated. His right knee, stripped of its original muscle, is
so weak and stiff that he drags the leg when he walks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to Tyler's parents, his infirmities are miracles, his
never-ending physical therapy a joy. They realize how lucky he is
to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Tyler contracted meningococcemia, an uncommon and brutal
disease that kills up to 60 percent of its victims. What seemed
like the stomach flu in the afternoon began destroying his skin and
muscles by nightfall. His hold on life grew so shaky that a
hospital chaplain twice prepared Tyler's parents for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The boy fought off the disease in three days. The work to repair
its damage may last for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be dealing with this the rest of his life one way or the
other, whether it be physical or emotional,'' said his father,
Dayton resident Jamie Ulm.
</P>
<P>
   Meningococcemia is an especially pernicious disease because it
begins innocently. By the time anyone realizes what's happening, it
can be too late. That is almost what happened to Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   On May 23, at the end of a long stay with relatives in
Cincinnati, the boy developed a high fever and began vomiting. His
parents say they took him to Children's Hospital Medical Center in
Cincinnati and were assured that he simply had the flu.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 p.m., small red spots broke out on Tyler's body. They
looked like chicken pox, hardly an alarming disease for a child.
Tyler's parents put him to bed without worry.
</P>
<P>
   But later that night, about 1:30 a.m., Tyler's mother checked on
him. What she saw made her breath catch in her throat.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's lower legs had become a mass of dark purple bruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like Mark McGwire had taken his baseball bat and was
practicing his home-run swing on (Tyler's) legs,'' recalled Jamie
Ulm. ``It was awful. My mom and dad both said that if they weren't
there that night, they would have swore that we beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to them, meningococcemia had reached its end game.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is similar to meningitis, but it attacks the
bloodstream instead of the tissue covering the brain. Both
conditions are caused by bacteria that reside in the throat and
nasal passages of a small portion of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria can be spread by close, prolonged contact. Most of
the time it doesn't cause any problems, but for reasons no one
understands, it occasionally becomes a monster.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Brilli, a Children's Hospital physician who is
conducting a national study of the disease, said meningococcemia
annually strikes 2,000 to 3,000 Americans, most of them children
(Ohio health statistics do not separate meningococcemia from
meningitis). Various studies put its fatality rate at 20 to 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with flu-like symptoms: fever, nausea, a stiff neck,
severe headaches and drowsiness. It quickly grows much worse.
</P>
<P>
   The disease chews up the lining of veins and arteries, causing
blood clots. The surrounding tissue is starved of oxygen and begins
to die. That is what caused the horrific bruises on Tyler's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Ulm called Children's Hospital when he saw the marks, and
45 minutes later, Tyler was in its intensive care unit. Doctors
gave him antibiotics to kill the bacteria and drugs to make his
heart beat stronger. They put him on a respirator to support his
lungs and force oxygen to his starving tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's life was in doubt for the first two days. But at last,
doctors stopped the bacteria's attack.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler then went to Cincinnati's Shriners Hospital for Crippled
Children. The hospital specializes in burn victims, and Tyler had
lost so much tissue that he was treated as if he had been in a
fire.
</P>
<P>
   He endured a dozen surgeries in less than two months. Surgeons
excised the dead tissue, amputating his left toes, cutting away
large muscles in his legs and removing smaller ones in his arms.
They took a muscle from his belly to support his right knee. They
performed numerous skin grafts, turning Tyler's small body into a
scarlet patchwork.
</P>
<P>
   They also put Tyler in a pressure suit _ essentially, a
neck-to-ankle Ace bandage that prevents scarring. He wears it 23
hours a day, shedding it only to take a bath.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ordeal, the boy was an ideal patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids do great with everything,'' said Dr. Glenn Warden, chief
of staff at Shriners. ``People say, `Gee, I feel sorry for these
kids,' (but) kids are perfectly wonderful ... much better than
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   By early September, the doctors had finished their repair work.
Tyler came home to Dayton and plunged into a five-day-a-week
rehabilitation at The Children's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Physical therapist Dorie Marek started one recent session by
putting Tyler on his back and stretching his legs. She was trying
to increase the flexibility of both muscle and skin.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's reconstructed right leg is so weak and stiff that he
doesn't like to put any weight on it, so Marek has devised drills
that force him to do so, from walking up stairs to kicking a soccer
ball with his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have told the family that Tyler's rehabilitation could
last until he is 21 or beyond. As he grows, his many skin grafts
could split, or his muscles could stiffen again. He may even lose
that stubborn right leg _ Jamie Ulm said it doesn't seem to be
growing properly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no doubt Tyler is fortunate. Warden said other
children who have faced meningococcemia ended up losing several
limbs. And Tyler shows no sign thus far of the learning
disabilities and psychological disorders many young survivors of
this disease develop.
</P>
<P>
   For a child who has withstood so much, Tyler seems as normal as
can be. He loves race cars, Nintendo, soda pop, cookies and
irritating his younger sister. His parents hope to start him in
preschool before the year is over.
</P>
<P>
   As Tyler settles into his dramatically altered life, Jamie Ulm
said he wants other parents to be aware of the warning signs no one
detected in his son's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could just get one family to catch this early, that
would be more satisfaction than somebody dumping a pickup truck
full of $100 bills in our front yard,'' he said.

 &HT;    Better tools can improve craftsmanship
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Every new woodworker has to decide whether he's going
to go first class with his tools or try to save some money. Some
have no choice _ they can't afford to go first class.
</P>
<P>
   A recent thread on the Internet was sparked by a very
intelligent question on the matter, to wit:
</P>
<P>
   ``What does the extra thousand dollars do for the furniture I
will build? Will I really be able to make tighter joints on a
Unisaw than on a contractor's saw using a similar blade and fence?
Is the issue of bearing spacing the critical factor and does that
allow the blade to remain more stable? Will the larger motor help
any way other than speed? I appreciate the aesthetic of a well-made
tool, but my question here is how the extra money will affect the
furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the replies were very thought provoking.
</P>
<P>
   The first came from Judy Monihan, an instructor at the
University of California in Santa Cruz:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have millions of hours on Unisaw, Powermatic and
contractor's saws,'' she responded. ``You will be able to cut tight
joints on any of them. The big guys are a lot more fun to use.
Someone once told me `Keep your standards high. Everyone else will
lower them for you, but only you will be there all the time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This was the consensus of the thread _ quality work can be done
with a good contractor's saw, but it's somewhat more difficult, and
the contractor's saw won't hold up as long. It's generally a matter
of how easy it is to get the saw into proper alignment, how long it
will remain aligned, the increased working surface of the larger
saw, and its much greater stability. As for horsepower, this isn't
so much a matter of speed as it is power _ a 1 hp motor might bog
down in a 4-inch-thick piece of hard, dense South American torture
wood, while a 3 hp motor would get through it without undue
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   The most thought-provoking response, though, came from an
anonymous woodworker.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as saving money I totally disagree on the
possibilities,'' he said. ``I first purchased a planer and jointer.
What I had in mind at the time was to buy rough-sawn green oak to
build a solid oak stairway. Well, that's what I did and spent $700
on the equipment, $175 on the wood and wound up with a beautiful
staircase. The lowest bid that I had from anywhere with milled wood
was $1,400. I might add that the saw mill was willing to provide
some pieces that no one else would even think up like 1x10 x18-foot
pieces of oak or 2x6x18-foot oak. All square-edged furniture grade
(no knots) for $1.15 a board foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have since then bought a Jet 3 hp cabinet saw and built, for
$80, a three-piece bookcase in oak, market value $300 a piece. With
the addtion of a couple of routers, 1 1/2 and 3 1/4 hp, a
dovetailing jig and some router bits I built a raised-panel,
30-linear-foot oak kitchen for around $1,000. No particle board
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also trimmed out a 1,500-square-foot house with 3/4-inch oak
for $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will admit that I have worn out that poor Jet 12-inch planer
and plan on getting a 15- or 20-inch unit soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just to sum things up here, I think that I'm way ahead in
the game of saving money, and will do even better now that I bought
1,500 board feet of rough-sawn oak for $200, 1,500 board feet of
rough-sawn cherry for $300 and 1,500 board feet of hickory for
$200.''

 &HT;    Visit to 19th-century school renews joy of history in modern-day
kids
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Kathryn Staigers tapped the glass cover of the
memorabilia wall at Collins School, a 19th-century one-room
schoolhouse in Greene County. ``That's my grandfather's
signature,'' she said, pointing to the name ``Clyde Beatty,''
scrawled on plasterboard, along with dozens of his classmates, and
dated April 20, 1898.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of Ohio history came alive for Staigers, a teacher's
aide at Five Points Elementary School in Fairborn. And you could
see the same thing happening for the classroom of fifth-graders who
spent the school day Monday as children in the 19th century would
have done _ complete with outhouses, McGuffey readers, prairie
dresses and suspenders.
</P>
<P>
   History is reputed to be out of vogue with today's children. You
wouldn't know it from the Five Points students' exuberance as they
added sums on slates, made sampler and marble bags, and played
vociferous rounds of ante-over.
</P>
<P>
   Living history was the idea back in 1986, when the late Helen
Brantley re-opened the school she had attended as a child, and
which her great-grandparents had founded in 1854. Since then,
nearly 30,000 area schoolchildren have spent a day in Ohio's past.
</P>
<P>
   During renovation, workers discovered a time capsule of sorts _
the plasterboard signature wall. Brantley must have considered it a
good omen to find her mother's name, Florence Bryson, on the wall
as well as that of Carrie Ray, her mother's beloved childhood
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Until shortly before her death in December 1996, Brantley came
to the school every day to share its history with the students. Her
daughters, Janine Montgomery and Betsy Crandall, continue that
traditon today. ``One of my mother's biggest things before she died
is that we please continue to tell the history of Collins School,''
said Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Students are prepped by their teachers to make the experience as
authentic as possible. No Lunchables or Happy Meals allowed. No
sandwich baggies or aluminum foil, either. Food is to be packed in
baskets or lunch pails and wrapped in wax paper. Most of the girls
wear bonnets and long dresses _ some borrowed, some handmade _ and
the boys wear suspenders or overalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad you're so well-dressed,'' Montgomery welcomed the
students. ``The time you took makes you feel you're really
traveling back in time. You're in a living history museum.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's 144-year history with Collins School began when
Samuel and Rebecca Collins deeded the land to the Xenia Twp.
trustees for a new schoolhouse. Two stone buildings stood on the
property before the current building was built around 1876.
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic country red brick schoolhouse, closed in 1945 and
rescued from dilapidation by Brantley and her husband, Virgil. ``It
had started looking like a jungle there, with windows knocked out
by vandals,'' Montgomery said. ``My mother loved that school and
had such a good time there. So when the land went up for sale, my
parents were overjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brantley got the idea for a full-day, seasonal school _ it's
open spring and summer, free of charge _ from a similar project in
North Carolina. The original cast-iron stove keeps the classroom
warm, apparently the only piece of equipment that couldn't be
hauled out when the building was used as a storage shed.
</P>
<P>
   Antique desks once again stand in neat rows in the classroom.
The inkstand holes mystified students, so teacher Naomi Whitaker
demonstrated, dipping a girl's braid into an imaginary inkwell.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker is one of a trio of retired Xenia teachers, along with
Peg Fife and Ann Stratton, who lead the classroom, making constant
comparisons between then and now.
</P>
<P>
   Fife holds up a reproduction of a 1902 Sears and Roebuck catalog
for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much does this gun cost?'' she asks, pointing to an ad.
</P>
<P>
   A boy's hand shoots up: ``$398!''
</P>
<P>
   ``A good guess,'' Fife says, ``but it's $3.98.''
</P>
<P>
   Five Points fifth-grade teacher Linda Ferguson said this is one
field trip her students always remember. ``And they also learned
how preparing for school has changed,'' said their teacher, Linda
Ferguson. ``They have a better appreciation for how a lot of things
are much easier for them than for children back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Brown, 11 _ winner of the blackboard math relay _ showed
off his overalls and pronounced the day ``really fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to see what it was like in the 1800s, and the writing
and reading they had, and the games they played,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One more kid won over to the joys of history. You can thank
Helen Brantley for that.

 &HT;    Sifting through `Ashes' with author McCourt
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Everyone loves Frank McCourt's memoir,
``Angela's Ashes,'' but why?
</P>
<P>
   Why would anybody want to read about some New York high school
teacher's poverty-stricken childhood in Limerick, Ireland? What
pushed it onto the best-seller lists and kept it there for 112
weeks?
</P>
<P>
   McCourt has given the question considerable thought, since
interviewers keep posing it to him. ``I didn't know for a long
time, but I think I've narrowed it down,'' he says. ``I think it's
the perspective of the voice of the child. Children are generally
honest. They don't learn to lie until we teach them. It's
disarming.'' McCourt's voice sounds Irish, but not like a stage
Irishman.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by phone from New York prior to his appearance this
weekend at the Texas Book Festival at the Capitol, he says he tried
to tell his story many different ways before choosing the simplest
manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled for a long time. I wrote a version of this a long
time ago when I was going through my Ernest Hemingway period, my
Scott Fitzgerald period, my James Joyce period, my William Faulkner
period. Then I one day just stumbled on going back to my earliest
memories and writing it from the perspective of the child that I
was.''
</P>
<P>
   The story the child tells is lively, funny and matter-of-fact,
though clearly the father is an alcoholic and the family's poverty
is extreme: babies drinking sugar water instead of milk and wearing
rags for diapers while the father drinks away any money he earns.
</P>
<P>
   McCourt says he did not embellish their poverty. ``I had to cut
back
</P>
<P>
   . . . (Our life) was squalid beyond my powers of description.
Nobody wants to read a book like that after they've had their
dinner. I could've described a lavatory in greater detail. I could
have described sores and abscesses and ulcers and boils and bad
teeth and oozy eyes and dandruff . . . but people wouldn't be
buying the book if it was just depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't know how to write about poverty, McCourt says.
``Very few writers deal with poverty. You have to be a connoisseur
of it. You know, the way people write restaurant reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teacher, he stressed simplicity, clarity and entertainment.
He used to have students read Mimi Sheraton's restaurant reviews in
The New York Times. ``She was not only a ruthless critic, but her
writing was superb. I knocked my head against the wall figuring out
how to reach those students. I'd have them write restaurant reviews
and reviews of the school cafeteria and Mom's chicken last night,
and they became quite eloquent.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, McCourt no longer teaches at Stuyvesant High School.
The success of ``Angela's Ashes'' has left him with a new
challenge: How to write a sequel. ``I struggled all day yesterday,
and I wanted to commit suicide. It's much more difficult to write
about New York and going to college here and becoming a teacher
than it was writing about Limerick. That was a fairly simple
straightforward story.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've made Limerick into sort of a tourist spot, I hear?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Oh, I'm tellin' you. They have an 'Angela's Ashes' tour
now. It's on a Japanese Web site. The Japan/Ireland Friendly
Society . . . and on the Japanese Web site there's a map of
Limerick with little red crosses showing where Frankie went to
confession and so on. All the hospitals and churches and schools .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did you name the book ``Angela's Ashes''?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I was going to bring it all the way up to the time my
mother died in New York in 1981 and when we had her cremated and we
brought her ashes back to Limerick and scattered them. But I didn't
get that far . . . I reached the age where _ born in New York,
taken to Ireland, returned to New York _ and my editor said,
`That's it. That's your book.' I just kept the title. Now there are
various academic types saying it has to do with the ashes of my
mother's life from which we rose like phoenixes. Or the ashes in
the fireplace. Or the ashes on her cigarette. The ashes of life . .
. It's what they call the deeper meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your brother Malachy has written a book, ``A Monk Swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I haven't read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will any other of your siblings come out with one?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The youngest brother is muttering about writing one, too.
And my daughter, who's 27. She's threatening. When she gets mad at
me, she says, `I'm going to write a book and show the world what
you're really like.' That cloud is over my head, too. See what I've
started up? And in Limerick itself, everybody is writing a memoir.
Three or four of them. The shelves are beginning to fill. All are
saying their story is the true one. Limerick wasn't like that at
all. Nothing but rosy-cheeked children running around. And nobody
without shoes. Everybody was happy and well-fed in this best of all
possible worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an Irish friend whose elderly mother wanted to know
how you could write `ugly things about your mother, about her going
up in the loft with that terrible fellow.' Do you get a certain
amount of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I do. Well, I got it from myself when I was writing that. I
was going to leave it out. But then, I realized I would be leaving
out a major element . . . I realized later on my mother had to
submit to this man to keep a roof over our heads. In this sense, it
was a sacrifice by her.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get past all the pain in your life to be able to
write about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I think in my case it was diluted by the years of teaching.
I would tell them an occasional story, and they'd tell me, 'You
should write a book.' But I also learned from teaching that you
have to get rid of your ego and develop a sense of fairness.''

 &HT;    No license to discriminate
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Astronaut John Glenn's inspirational message to
older Americans was lost on a Texas lawmaker who wants to ground
Texas drivers 75 and older who don't have the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Due to his age, 77, Glenn's ability to drive a car is
automatically suspect by Rep. Tony Goolsby, R-Dallas, who has
introduced a bill to take the car keys away from older Texans who
can't pass a special mandatory driving test.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is covered up in bad drivers. The insurance industry knows
who they are. And, as a group, they are not older drivers who
typically are placed in the category of preferred drivers.
</P>
<P>
   In the last legislative session, Goolsby introduced a bill to
crack down on young people who get their bodies pierced without
parental permission.
</P>
<P>
   Goolsby, who is 65, appears to have a thing about age.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I support mandatory I.Q. testing for politicians who
represent a far greater danger to society than older drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But Goolsby is right that motorists should have to prove they
are roadworthy before turned loose on Texas highways and byways.
</P>
<P>
   Requirements to obtain a driver license in Texas and other
states are far too lax.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for licensing unskilled drivers, Americans depend
on a huge government bureaucracy to maintain traffic safety.
</P>
<P>
   We regulate speed, lane changing, starting, stopping and
turning. Cars must be equipped with this or that safety feature,
which is never enough. All equipment must be inspected and used
according to government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   No other country on Earth could afford the safety bureaucracy
Americans substitute for required driving skills.
</P>
<P>
   Planes would be falling out of the sky if we dumbed down the
requirements for a pilot's license to the level of a drivers
license.
</P>
<P>
   In general, American drivers have become so dependent on the
government to protect them when they are behind the wheel that they
have lost the ability to think for themselves. It's more important
to have the right of way and the law on their side than use common
sense and driving skills to avoid an accident.
</P>
<P>
   America's Big Brother safety industry predicted with loud
assurances that traffic fatalities would skyrocket out of sight if
Congress raised the national 55 mph speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995 Congress lifted this widely ignored, unrealistically
low speed limit and America now enjoys record-low traffic deaths on
national roads.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Goolsby should forget trying to single out older drivers
for road testing and instead boost the driving requirements for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   A license to drive on public roads is a privilege, not a right.
It makes sense to require that only skilled drivers are licensed to
operate cars, just as it makes sense that only skilled pilots are
licensed to operate airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for citizens to obtain the
skills needed to obtain a driver license any more than they should
pay for lessons needed to obtain a pilot license.
</P>
<P>
   But the government should be in charge of the testing, which
should be rigorous and include highway speed emergency maneuvers.
Testing also should be more frequent than it is today.
</P>
<P>
   The failure rate would go up, of course. That happens when you
raise standards. That's the breaks. But people adjust and meet the
new standards.
</P>
<P>
   The result would be increased traffic safety with less reliance
on government and more on personal accountability.
</P>
<P>
   If Goolsby wants to pick on bad drivers, he should pick on all
of them, not just those 75 and older.

 &HT;    Racism divides campus, Miami University students say
 &HT;    By John Keilman and Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Ohio _ In the wake of a racist episode at a black
studies center and two days of demonstrations, some Miami
University students said their campus seems to be divided by color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (relations) are strained,'' said 25-year-old graduate
student Tamika Miller, who is black. `` ... I would say that it is
a lack of knowledge, fear, people's unwillingness to step out of
their comfort zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Miami has suffered a plague of
well-publicized racial incidents, including the savage off-campus
beating of a black student in January.
</P>
<P>
   The latest occurrence came Oct. 30 at the Center for Black
Culture and Learning. Racist notes were posted on the center's
bulletin board and placed on its computer screen savers.
</P>
<P>
   Some students, frustrated at what they felt was a lack of
response from the administration, blocked traffic on an Oxford
street Tuesday and Wednesday. Oxford police arrested seven students
during Wednesday's protest.
</P>
<P>
   Students also held a campus rally Wednesday night, where
numerous speakers vented their anger.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Rachel Cohen, 20, a white student, was at the rally. She
said it was long on frustration but short on solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just speak loudly and protest and not follow it up
with other progressive policies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Miami's student body has always been light on minorities,
the administration has stepped up its recruitment of nonwhite
students in recent years. The university has nearly doubled the
number of black students enrolled at the Oxford campus in the last
decade, from 369 in 1988 to 616 this fall, according to university
spokesman Richard Little. Overall, the campus enrolled 16,145
students in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the school's graduation rate for black students _
67 percent _ is the highest among Ohio's 13 state-supported
universities. Miami also has doubled the amount of money set aside
for minority preference scholarships in two years, from $1.7 to
$3.3 million, Little said.
</P>
<P>
   Many professors also stress ideas of diversity and tolerance in
their classes, according to 18-year-old freshman Jill Weinberg, who
is white.
</P>
<P>
   But she added: ``They're drilling into us that we need to be a
diverse campus, but they're not really doing anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really segregated,'' said white student Ryan Humphrey,
18. ``There are so many people here who are racist ... that it's
pretty much a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Bruce Richards, 25, said black students like himself
don't seem to have much in common with their white peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the people are coming here from suburbia where there
aren't many black people, and then they get here and have to deal
with it and there's problems,'' he said. ``You mix the two
environments here and they don't really mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Some black students had vivid memories of racist taunts, and
said they did not feel safe walking around campus at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can break into (the Center for Black Culture and
Learning), you're afraid they'll break into your house,'' said Mike
Cross, 18, a black sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Little said the campus' crime statistics show it to be
relatively safe, especially compared to some students' home
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has had no hate-related physical assaults on campus since
the black student's beating in January. The attackers _ who were
arrested and convicted and given jail terms _ were not connected to
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   While Little acknowledged that racist verbal attacks still occur
occasionally, he said they happen primarily off campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of progress, and there's been a lot of change
... but we're still not there yet,'' Little said.

 &HT;    Thrasher plan for pension payoffs may face delays
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Police officers and firefighters who helped
create an all-Republican state government last week may have to
wait just two months to get their multimillion-dollar payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a week after police officers appeared in television ads
for Gov.-elect Jeb Bush, sponsored billboards for him and helped
slam Democratic opponent Buddy MacKay in radio ads, House
Speaker-to-be John Thrasher on Thursday promised a January special
session to pass a bill increasing their pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Thrasher (R-Jacksonville) said he and Senate President Toni
Jennings (R-Orlando) agree the two chambers should convene the week
after Bush's Jan. 5 inauguration solely to override outgoing Gov.
Lawton Chiles' veto of the measure last spring.
</P>
<P>
   David Murrell, executive director of the Florida Police
Benevolent Association, said his group and other police and
firefighter unions asked for the special session rather than wait
for the March regular session because their issue would get ``mixed
in with the other business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a wrong that needs to be righted,'' Murrell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Thursday he had neither asked for nor heard of
Thrasher's plan for a special session, adding only that the pension
bill was something he would have signed. Jennings, through a
spokeswoman, said that she and Thrasher have spoken generally about
veto overrides but that she has not committed to a special session.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the governor calls a special session, both House speaker
and Senate president must agree to hold one. One presiding officer
alone cannot call one.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles vetoed the measure last spring at the urging of
municipalities who complained that the law would cost them at least
$50 million. In a detailed, five-page veto message, Chiles wrote
that he had unsuccessfully suggested some changes to the bill that
would have put off any immediate costs to cities while still
providing the laudable goal of giving officers in high-risk
occupations a bigger pension than other city employees.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of summer, virtually every police and firefighters
group in the state _ including some that had endorsed Chiles in his
two governor's elections _ came out in support of Bush. MacKay and
many Democrats attributed the endorsements directly to Chiles'
veto, which MacKay said he supported.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell said that the state PBA had endorsed Bush over Chiles in
the 1994 governor's race, and likely would have endorsed Bush
again, even had Chiles signed the bill. ``This just added a little
more ummph to it,'' Murrell said. ``This made it more personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida League of Cities lobbyist Carol Marchner said Thrasher's
promise for quick action does not surprise. ``The unions have been
saying all summer that there was going to be a special session . .
. and they were going to override that veto in a New York minute,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles and other Democrats also found the need for a special
session curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor thinks that's very interesting,'' said
spokeswoman Edie Ousley, adding that police and firefighter
pensions is not exactly a burning public policy issue. ``This isn't
something that a lot of people are talking about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether this is grounded in good public
policy,'' said state Democratic Party chairman Mitch Ceasar. ``Or
is it simply political payback for a political endorsement?''
</P>
<P>
   Thrasher denied any quid pro quo for a special session, saying
the 36-1 vote in the Senate and the 104-11 vote in the House in
favor of the bill justified a prompt override. Overrides are only
allowed when the Legislature is in session, which has not happened
since Chiles vetoed the measure.

 &HT;    Austin venture capital hits new record
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin companies have outdone themselves in
raising venture capital money in 1998, beating last year's record
in just nine months.
</P>
<P>
   During the first three quarters of this year, 31 Central Texas
companies raised $165 million, according to the
PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm. That tops the 1997 record,
when 33 area companies raised $164.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we've broken the record reflects that there's a
lot of capital available for good ideas at every stage of their
development,'' said Paul Hurdlow, an attorney with Gray Cary who
works with Austin tech start_ ups. ``You've got people ready to do
$250,000 seed transactions, all the way up to very large
transactions. As we all know, there's a lot of interest in Austin,
and the VCs are looking, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Money from venture capital firms helps companies get started,
develop products and build markets for their products. Third_
quarter investments range from later_ round financing of companies
seeking to gain market share to early_ round investments for those
just getting off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   This year is also expected to be a record_ breaker nationally.
U.S. investments for the first nine months total $10.5 billion,
compared with $11.5 billion in all of 1997, according to
PricewaterhouseCoopers. The firm estimates nationwide investments
will approach $14 billion, making this the biggest year on record.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, 17 companies _ 15 of them tech_ related _ raised $70
million in the third quarter. In Silicon Valley, 204 companies
raised $1.24 billion during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The following Central Texas companies raised more than $1
million in the third quarter:
</P>
<P>
   _ Deja News raised $11.7 million from Austin Ventures, Prime New
Ventures and others. The company's Web site offers newsgroup

 &HT;    Emporia State's Shay shrugs off ever warmer spotlight
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He has carried the ball for more yards than
anyone in NCAA college football history, simultaneously carrying
himself into the national spotlight. He has done one aggressively
and methodically, done the other reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't enjoy it much,'' says Brian Shay. ``I'd rather keep to
myself. But it comes with the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it ever. In the month since the Emporia State senior
halfback passed former Texas A&AMP;I star Johnny Bailey on the NCAA
career rushing list, the retiring native Kansan has done interviews
with Sports Illustrated, the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times,
New York Times and 58 other assorted media outlets, including a
sports radio show in Los Angeles that asked the inevitable:
``Ginger or Mary Ann.''
</P>
<P>
   Shay's response: ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little young for that,'' he says, apologetically.
``Gilligan's Island was before my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those hapless castaways, though, Shay has been
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Brian had his way he would play the game and go home and
take a nap,'' said his coach, Manny Matsakis. ``He's not interested
in records and is embarrassed by all of the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that Shay couldn't get ANY attention. An
all-state prep halfback, Shay was only 5 feet, 9 inches, 180 pounds
and couldn't break 4.8 seconds in the 40-yard dash. Kansas and
Kansas State wouldn't even spare an official visit on him, though
both invited him to walk-on. By form letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why walk on somewhere and get lost in the shuffle?'' Shay
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shay, who sports a shorn head and goatee that makes him look a
little like Stone Cold Steve Austin, had been recruited by all the
Big Eight wrestling programs after winning back-to-back state
titles at 160 and 185 pounds, completing a four-year varsity career
record of 124-9. He toyed with the idea of concentrating on that
sport, but decided to go with his first love.
</P>
<P>
   He took a full football ride from Emporia State, whose list of
football greats starts and ends with Leon Lett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, when I came to Emporia I figured I'd get four years
of football out of the way, get an education and move on with my
life,'' Shay said.
</P>
<P>
   You might say that for once, Shay had sold himself short. All
his life he heard about being too small and slow, and he made a
life out of proving that talk wrong, but even he wasn't prepared
for what football held for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kick myself every time I think about what he would have
accomplished if he had been able to have a redshirt year,''
Matsakis said. ``Eight thousand yards, 10,000 all-purpose yards and
100 TDs would all have been within reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Shay has had to settle for 6,785 yards rushing, 9,018
all-purpose yards and 86 touchdowns. But he still has one more game
to go, Saturday's showdown against Northwest Missouri State that
will decide the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association's
conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Shay's records more remarkable is the type of offense
Emporia State runs. It's the sting-and-shoot, an offshoot of the
run-and-shoot, in which Matsakis has recruited high school running
backs, made them receivers, and then plunked Shay down in the
backfield.
</P>
<P>
   When Shay broke a 75-yarder against Central Missouri on Oct. 24
to break Bailey's record, school officials stopped the game and
gave him the ball. Then everything continued as normal. There will
be no street named after him and though his number is likely to be
retired at some point, university official are mum on the
particulars. The College Football Hall of Fame requested his helmet
(which is striped like the hind end of a Hornet, the team's
mascot), but they'll have to wait until after the season, and even
then it's probable they'll have to settle for a substitute. ``I'm
going to try to take this one,'' Shay says.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be his little token. A thousand miles south, Ricky
Williams is closing in on Tony Dorsett's Division I-A record and
though he's still 204 yards shy, he's already got a Sports
Illustrated cover, a Doak Walker Award (and another likely on the
way) and Heisman Trophy waiting on ice.
</P>
<P>
   Shay doesn't get to see much of Williams, just the occasional
highlight on TV, but he understands and respects what he's doing.
``Tell Ricky Williams I wish him the best and all the success,''
Shay says, ``and I hope he breaks the record.''

 &HT;    Emporia State's Shay shrugs off ever warmer spotlight
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He has carried the ball for more yards than
anyone in NCAA college football history, simultaneously carrying
himself into the national spotlight. He has done one aggressively
and methodically, done the other reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't enjoy it much,'' says Brian Shay. ``I'd rather keep to
myself. But it comes with the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it ever. In the month since the Emporia State senior
halfback passed former Texas A&AMP;I star Johnny Bailey on the NCAA
career rushing list, the retiring native Kansan has done interviews
with Sports Illustrated, the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times,
New York Times and 58 other assorted media outlets, including a
sports radio show in Los Angeles that asked the inevitable:
``Ginger or Mary Ann.''
</P>
<P>
   Shay's response: ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little young for that,'' he says, apologetically.
``Gilligan's Island was before my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those hapless castaways, though, Shay has been
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Brian had his way he would play the game and go home and
take a nap,'' said his coach, Manny Matsakis. ``He's not interested
in records and is embarrassed by all of the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that Shay couldn't get ANY attention. An
all-state prep halfback, Shay was only 5 feet, 9 inches, 180 pounds
and couldn't break 4.8 seconds in the 40-yard dash. Kansas and
Kansas State wouldn't even spare an official visit on him, though
both invited him to walk-on. By form letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why walk on somewhere and get lost in the shuffle?'' Shay
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shay, who sports a shorn head and goatee that makes him look a
little like Stone Cold Steve Austin, had been recruited by all the
Big Eight wrestling programs after winning back-to-back state
titles at 160 and 185 pounds, completing a four-year varsity career
record of 124-9. He toyed with the idea of concentrating on that
sport, but decided to go with his first love.
</P>
<P>
   He took a full football ride from Emporia State, whose list of
football greats starts and ends with Leon Lett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, when I came to Emporia I figured I'd get four years
of football out of the way, get an education and move on with my
life,'' Shay said.
</P>
<P>
   You might say that for once, Shay had sold himself short. All
his life he heard about being too small and slow, and he made a
life out of proving that talk wrong, but even he wasn't prepared
for what football held for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kick myself every time I think about what he would have
accomplished if he had been able to have a redshirt year,''
Matsakis said. ``Eight thousand yards, 10,000 all-purpose yards and
100 TDs would all have been within reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Shay has had to settle for 6,785 yards rushing, 9,018
all-purpose yards and 86 touchdowns. But he still has one more game
to go, Saturday's showdown against Northwest Missouri State that
will decide the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association's
conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Shay's records more remarkable is the type of offense
Emporia State runs. It's the sting-and-shoot, an offshoot of the
run-and-shoot, in which Matsakis has recruited high school running
backs, made them receivers, and then plunked Shay down in the
backfield.
</P>
<P>
   When Shay broke a 75-yarder against Central Missouri on Oct. 24
to break Bailey's record, school officials stopped the game and
gave him the ball. Then everything continued as normal. There will
be no street named after him and though his number is likely to be
retired at some point, university official are mum on the
particulars. The College Football Hall of Fame requested his helmet
(which is striped like the hind end of a Hornet, the team's
mascot), but they'll have to wait until after the season, and even
then it's probable they'll have to settle for a substitute. ``I'm
going to try to take this one,'' Shay says.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be his little token. A thousand miles south, Ricky
Williams is closing in on Tony Dorsett's Division I-A record and
though he's still 204 yards shy, he's already got a Sports
Illustrated cover, a Doak Walker Award (and another likely on the
way) and Heisman Trophy waiting on ice.
</P>
<P>
   Shay doesn't get to see much of Williams, just the occasional
highlight on TV, but he understands and respects what he's doing.
``Tell Ricky Williams I wish him the best and all the success,''
Shay says, ``and I hope he breaks the record.''

   PARIS-PARENTS _ PARIS _ AJC staff writer Arthur Brice writes of

years, my parents decided they wanted to spend one more spring in
this eternal city. Now in their mid-70s, it had been 13 years since
they last visited. But they aren't the spry golden-agers they once
were and didn't feel comfortable traveling so far by themselves. So
they asked me to come along. I didn't hesitate in agreeing.
Somewhere along the invisible continuum that marks the passage of
our lives, we had traded places. Though they are still
self-sufficient and in charge of their lives, the son now would
watch after them. Lend a steadying hand when needed. Offer fresher
eyes, a stronger back and firmer legs. Just like they had for me a

 &HT;    Better tools can improve craftsmanship
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Every new woodworker has to decide whether he's going
to go first class with his tools or try to save some money. Some
have no choice _ they can't afford to go first class.
</P>
<P>
   A recent thread on the Internet was sparked by a very
intelligent question on the matter, to wit:
</P>
<P>
   ``What does the extra thousand dollars do for the furniture I
will build? Will I really be able to make tighter joints on a
Unisaw than on a contractor's saw using a similar blade and fence?
Is the issue of bearing spacing the critical factor and does that
allow the blade to remain more stable? Will the larger motor help
any way other than speed? I appreciate the aesthetic of a well-made
tool, but my question here is how the extra money will affect the
furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the replies were very thought provoking.
</P>
<P>
   The first came from Judy Monihan, an instructor at the
University of California in Santa Cruz:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have millions of hours on Unisaw, Powermatic and
contractor's saws,'' she responded. ``You will be able to cut tight
joints on any of them. The big guys are a lot more fun to use.
Someone once told me `Keep your standards high. Everyone else will
lower them for you, but only you will be there all the time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This was the consensus of the thread _ quality work can be done
with a good contractor's saw, but it's somewhat more difficult, and
the contractor's saw won't hold up as long. It's generally a matter
of how easy it is to get the saw into proper alignment, how long it
will remain aligned, the increased working surface of the larger
saw, and its much greater stability. As for horsepower, this isn't
so much a matter of speed as it is power _ a 1 hp motor might bog
down in a 4-inch-thick piece of hard, dense South American torture
wood, while a 3 hp motor would get through it without undue
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   The most thought-provoking response, though, came from an
anonymous woodworker.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as saving money I totally disagree on the
possibilities,'' he said. ``I first purchased a planer and jointer.
What I had in mind at the time was to buy rough-sawn green oak to
build a solid oak stairway. Well, that's what I did and spent $700
on the equipment, $175 on the wood and wound up with a beautiful
staircase. The lowest bid that I had from anywhere with milled wood
was $1,400. I might add that the saw mill was willing to provide
some pieces that no one else would even think up like 1x10 x18-foot
pieces of oak or 2x6x18-foot oak. All square-edged furniture grade
(no knots) for $1.15 a board foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have since then bought a Jet 3 hp cabinet saw and built, for
$80, a three-piece bookcase in oak, market value $300 a piece. With
the addtion of a couple of routers, 1 1/2 and 3 1/4 hp, a
dovetailing jig and some router bits I built a raised-panel,
30-linear-foot oak kitchen for around $1,000. No particle board
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also trimmed out a 1,500-square-foot house with 3/4-inch oak
for $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will admit that I have worn out that poor Jet 12-inch planer
and plan on getting a 15- or 20-inch unit soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just to sum things up here, I think that I'm way ahead in
the game of saving money, and will do even better now that I bought
1,500 board feet of rough-sawn oak for $200, 1,500 board feet of
rough-sawn cherry for $300 and 1,500 board feet of hickory for
$200.''

THESE CRUSTY PROTESTERS HURT A JUST CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I've been asked the question a dozen times.
``Didn't you LOVE it that the mayor got a pie in the face?'' A
dozen times I've said no.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to love it, partly because I am pretty disappointed in
and frustrated with Willie Brown, the mayor of San Francisco.
Partly, too, I work to stay vigilant against losing my '60s
liberalism and becoming a narrow-minded old fogey who automatically
condemns radical protest on its face.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I tried to love the Biotic Baking Brigade's recent
pie attack because the people who launched it hold near and dear
many of the same causes I do. According to a brigade spokesman
known only as Agent Apple, the group's members have smashed pies in
the faces of public figures like Brown, city Supervisor Gavin
Newsom, economist Milton Friedman and the chief executive of the
Pacific Lumber Co., Charles Hurwitz, to call attention to the
following:
</P>
<P>
   The disregard and degradation of the homeless, the trashing of
the global environment, and ``multinational corporations and big
business running roughshod over our rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Those issues are the kind that make my blood boil, and I'm all
for calling attention to them. But I cannot get comfortable with
the brigade's methods.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1, there is something fundamentally fascistic and sadistic
about a person physically sneak-attacking another and humiliating
him or her in public. The act seems to contradict, if not negate,
the attacker's status as a compassionate and sensitive soul.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing fake blood on people who wear fur coats is the same.
Like a pie in the face, it's a violent, ugly, dehumanizing act
whose very execution can't help but drag the protesters down to the
allegedly inhumane level of their enemy.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a decidedly un-Christian act, in that it's impossible
to imagine the mother of all compassionate protesters _ Jesus _
ever engaging in such tactics. (Turning over the money lenders'
tables in the temple doesn't qualify; that was a physical assault
on inanimate objects. And it wasn't done to humiliate anyone.)
</P>
<P>
   No. 2, as a protest, throwing pies sends confused and confusing
signals. The act tends to overshadow and trivialize the
significance of the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Said Agent Apple: ``While the issues we try to tackle are
serious _ clear-cutting redwoods and the global economy _ there's
something very valuable in getting people to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect ... no there isn't, not when you're trying
to gain public sympathy and support for a serious subject. People
in comedy shows get pies smashed in their faces. It's a traditional
slapstick vehicle for eliciting laughs. Why would you want
slapstick laughs around homelessness, the raping of the environment
or runaway corporate greed?
</P>
<P>
   Chaining one's self to a redwood tree or stump is solemn,
powerful, pain-in-the-butt-of-authority civil disobedience.
Imitating the Three Stooges is not.
</P>
<P>
   The Biotic Baking Brigade has its roots in the International
Patisserie Brigade, which was created by the Belgian critic and
actor, Noel Godin. This past February in Brussels, Godin's brigade
hit Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates in the face with a pie.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Guardian newspaper in London, Godin started
smashing pies in famous faces back in 1965. His first target:
French novelist Marguerite Duras. Her crime? Godin felt she wrote
with ``a kind of intelligence that serves only her own vanity.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't funny, it's arbitrary, brutish and the act of a bully
_ the very sort of mentality that groups like the Biotic Baking
Brigade rightfully abhor.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Apple and the rest of you brigadiers, don't join the
enemy. Your hearts are in the right place, just correct your aim.

 &UR; (1,400 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By RICK RODGERS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; From ``Thanksgiving 101'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this colorful and informative piece, Rodgers, a popular
cooking teacher known as Mr. Thanksgiving, offers facts and lore
about three staples of the holiday dinner: turkey, cranberries and
pumpkin. A few tidbits: Israelis eat the most turkey of any
nationality. Farm-raised turkeys are so chest-heavy that they
cannot get close enough to mate, so females must be artificially
inseminated. Colonial Americans called cranberries ``bounce
berries'' because bounciness was an indication of a cranberry's
freshness. (slugged:

   In this second piece from Mr. Thanksgiving, Rodgers uses a Q&AMP;A

the market: fresh, frozen, hard-chilled, self-basting, free-range,
wild, etc. This is an invaluable article for the confused consumer.

   Why do we celebrate Thanksgiving on the last Thursday of
November? Because of the 19th-century crusade by Sarah Josepha
Hale, editor of ``Godey's Lady's Book,'' who persuaded Abraham
Lincoln to proclaim the holiday, history buff Malehorn tells us.
Before that Thanksgiving was a haphazard celebration _ in fact, in
colonial times the word ``celebration'' was not quite apt. It was a
somber, religious occasion, spent in prayer in chilly village
churches. (slugged:

 By HAL MALEHORN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Nearly all American schoolchildren learn the standard
Thanksgiving story: how the Pilgrims survived their first miserable
winter, and how the following fall they feasted with friendly
Indians to celebrate a successful harvest.
 &HT;    But many of us are unaware that the holiday is rooted in
European tradition, that it was a somber, religious holiday in
colonial times and that it was through the efforts of one
determined 19th century woman that it became celebrated on a fixed
day in November.
 &HT;    Many misconceptions surround that first Thanksgiving. It is
indeed true that the Pilgrims' tables were spread with nature's
bounty that 1621 autumn. But the foods were quite different from
those on which we feast today. Turkey might well have graced the
boards, but there likely was other wild game as well, so readily
available from the woods nearby.
 &HT;    Bee-tree honey and native fruits, berries and nuts also likely
satisfied appetites at that banquet, along with fish and shellfish
that abounded close to shore.
 &HT;    Corn, native to the New World, was probably prepared either as a
pudding or baked into cakes. Pumpkins (or pompions, as they were
called) were eaten boiled, for there was little molasses or flour
to bake them into pies.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving in America actually had its origins in Europe well
before any westbound voyagers from that continent ever hoisted
sail. In many parts of the Old Country, in fact, residents had for
centuries held observances of ``Harvest Home,'' a time when farmers
joined forces with neighbors to bring in their crops. This shared
labor was usually followed by festive dancing and food and drink.
 &HT;    Sometimes European governments decreed days of rejoicing among
the populace in thanks for a major victory in battle, or for the
end of a plague or for deliverance from some natural disaster.
 &HT;    In the early decades of American colonial life, Thanksgiving Day
did not always call for making merry. To the contrary, some church
fathers took a dim view of too much jollity. Attendance at worship
was required, where thanksgivers endured hours-long sermons and
prayers in chilly village churches.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving long ago was not uniformly observed on a single
date. Sometimes two or more Thanksgivings were announced within the
same calendar year. For example, during our War of Independence
special days of gratitude were proclaimed following our major
victories on the battlefield.
 &HT;    Similarly, the Continental Congress ordered a day of thanks
after our military alliance with France was signed. Several years
later there was a call for a national celebration of the British
surrender at Yorktown. On each such occasion grateful citizens
thronged to churches to express their thanks.
 &HT;    When the Constitutional Convention gathered in 1787, one
delegate proposed mandating an annual day of thanksgiving across
the land. However, as most of his fellow delegates saw the matter
as rightly belonging to the 13 states-to-be, that provision was
omitted from the landmark document.
 &HT;    In spite of this early congressional reluctance, Presidents
George Washington and James Madison each proclaimed a nationwide
thanksgiving observance. For his part, though, Thomas Jefferson,
viewing the presidency as a strictly civil post, found himself ``in
no position to direct the religious exercise of constituents.''
 &HT;    Since most thanksgiving observances early in our nationhood
occurred only at the discretion of the governor of the various
states, the time chosen for such an event ranged from September
through January. The success in fixing a single date on which to
observe Thanksgiving can be attributed to Sarah Josepha Hale,
editor of ``Godey's Lady's Book.''
 &HT;    In 1846 she began a crusade to set aside the last Thursday in
November as an official national holiday. Each autumn thereafter
she published in her magazine's pages an enthusiastic editorial on
the desirability of such an event.
 &HT;    Each year her November issue focused on that special day,
relating warm stories of family reunions. Mrs. Hale encouraged her
readers to urge their governors to agree on just one date.
 &HT;    When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Mrs. Hale's campaign
faltered for a while. But after the Union victory at Gettysburg,
President Abraham Lincoln set aside a day of thanksgiving and
prayer. Relieved at the recent repulse of Robert E. Lee's rebel
forces, Northern citizens had ample reason to rejoice.
 &HT;    Six weeks later the persistent Mrs. Hale wrote to Lincoln,
urging him to establish Thanksgiving as an annual national event.
Because the last Thursday was already being so proclaimed by
governors of most of the northern states, Mrs. Hale argued, Lincoln
should make it official.
 &HT;    And so, on Oct. 8, 1863, Lincoln decreed a national Thanksgiving
for the last Thursday in November _ not in honor of military
success, but rather ``for a year filled with blessings of fruitful
fields.''
 &HT;    The following year Lincoln renewed his proclamation, and ever
since our nation has seen fit to continue the tradition. And so
today millions of Americans gather each November to enjoy families,
friendships and abundant food _ the same blessings so important to
the Pilgrims in 1621.

 &UR; By Rick Rodgers &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; From ``Thanksgiving 101,'' published by Broadway Books &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TURKEY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is only assumed that wild turkeys were served at that first
Thanksgiving in 1621. The firsthand accounts of the menu simply
mention ``fowl.'' We do know that the Pilgrims had venison, cod and
lobster on the table, so why don't we have surf and turf or fish
cakes instead of turkey?
</P>
<P>
   The turkey is an impressive bird, with its bronze feathers,
unusual head markings and showy tail. Even a hardened critic like
Brilliat-Savarin _ a French gourmand who, in 1825, uttered the
phrase, ``Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are'' _
said, ``The turkey is certainly one of the handsomest gifts the New
World made to the Old World. ... [It] is the largest and, if not
the most subtle, at least the most tasty of our domestic birds.''
Just looking at its corpulent figure it gives one a feeling of
abundance and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The wild turkey is native to North and Central America and was
domesticated by the Aztecs. No one knows when the first turkeys
traveled to Europe, but they seem to have been brought to Spain by
conquistadors in the early 1500s. The turkey quickly established
itself as the bird to serve at festive occasions, especially in
Italy, France and England, and was bred into a plumper version.
</P>
<P>
   This new improved turkey was brought back to the Americas, where
it was crossbred with its wild cousin to make the breed we know
today. The turkey was not a strange bird to the Pilgrims _ they
were well acquainted with it, and must have been relieved to find a
familiar food in this strange land.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows how the turkey got its name. There are many
explanations, none definitive. Some think that early explorers,
believing they were close to India, misidentified the bird and
called it tuki, an Indian name for peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Because it also resembled the guinea fowl, which came from
Africa via Turkish merchants, it could have picked up the name by
another misappropriation of origin. (Guinea fowls were also called
turkeys.) Or it could have gotten its name from one of its calls,
which sounds like ``turk, turk, turk.''
</P>
<P>
   Because turkeys were so abundant in Colonial America, they were
a major source of nourishment for our country's forefathers. In a
well-known letter to his daughter, Benjamin Franklin expressed his
dismay over the eagle's being chosen as the official United States
bird.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the eagle's ``bad moral character,'' he went on to
say, ``I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the
representative of our country! The turkey is a much more
respectable bird, and withal a true original native of America.''
</P>
<P>
   While about 675 million pounds of turkey are served each
Thanksgiving, in recent years its healthy profile and versatility
have changed the turkey from a holiday bird to one that competes
with other meat and poultry on a year-round basis.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Americans do not eat the most turkey. In 1997, it
was estimated that Israelis ate about 25.7 pounds per capita, while
we weighed in at 18.7 pounds. Runner-up was France, at 13.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most turkeys are of the White Holland variety, which have a lot
of the white breast meat that more than 70 percent of Americans
prefer. In fact, farm-raised turkeys are so chest-heavy that they
cannot get close enough to mate. All farm-raised female turkeys are
artificially inseminated.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRANBERRIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure that cranberries were served at the first
Thanksgiving, but the cranberry was a very important food to the
Pawtuxet Indians, so historians assume that they would have offered
it as a contribution to the feast. Instinct must have taught the
Indians that the tart berries are an excellent source of Vitamin C,
because they used them in many dishes.
</P>
<P>
   They ate them raw and boiled with maple syrup, but perhaps the
most common use was in pemmican, which was a kind of low-tech
energy bar made with berries, dried venison meat and melted animal
fat. Pemmican kept well, and went with the Indians on long
journeys.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrims probably referred to cranberries as ``fenberries,''
a common fruit in old England which they resembled. The cranberry,
however, gets its modern name from the Dutch and German settlers,
who called it a ``crane berry.'' When the cranberry vines bloom,
the blossom looks like the head and bill of a crane. Eventually,
the name became cranberry.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial Americans called them ``bounce berries,'' referring to
their bounciness. Bouncing berries are an indication of freshness;
bruised, old berries don't bounce.
</P>
<P>
   A recipe for cranberry sauce is included in the very first
printed American cookbook, Amelia Simmons' ``American Cookery,''
which appeared in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   Canned cranberry sauce first hit the shelves in 1912, a product
of the Cape Cod Cannery Company, which eventually became the Ocean
Spray Preserving Company. The president of the company was a Boston
lawyer, Marcus L. Urann. In 1930, Urann organized a merger between
his company and two other cranberry canneries to form the Cranberry
Canners, Inc., a cranberry farming cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative, which eventually acquired Urann's former
company name after a few months of squabbling, now provides more
than 70 percent of the world's cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever wondered how many cranberries are in a 12-ounce
bag, the number is 360, give or take a few berries.
</P>
<P>
   PUMPKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin pie was certainly not included in the first feast. The
Mayflower's stores of wheat had long been depleted, and the first
planting had failed. No wheat, no pie crust. As with so many other
foods, the Indians taught the Pilgrims about pumpkin. Along with
beans and corn, it was one of the three major foods in the Native
American diet throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   There is some argument over the pumpkin's origin. Some botanists
say it is a New World vegetable, and others claim it was known in
Europe before the Exploration Age. It is likely, however, that the
European ``pumpkins'' in the pre-Columbus era were really gourds,
and that we can truly claim the pumpkin as an American native that
deserves a place of honor at the Thanksgiving meal.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians probably roasted pumpkin over an open fire or boiled
it with maple syrup. Pumpkin pudding became one of the favorite
dishes of the Puritan era. The pumpkin flesh was scooped out, mixed
with milk, spices and syrup, then returned to the pumpkin shell,
where it was roasted for hours in hot ashes. It is easy to see
where the basic recipe for pumpkin pie filling came from.
</P>
<P>
   Known to the settlers as pompion _ the name given by French
explorers in the late 1500s _ pumpkin saved them from starvation in
the lean early years of their colony.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first recipes for pumpkin pie appeared in 1655 in a
British book called Queens Closed Open. This version represents the
then current taste for highly seasoned foods and includes thyme,
rosemary, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, cloves and apple. Amelia
Simmons included ``pompkin pie'' in the first American cookbook,
published in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the modern pumpkin pie can be dated back to 1929.
In that year, Libby, McNeil and Libby bought a small pumpkin pie
cannery, Dickinson Canning Company. The little cannery's pride and
joy was its special eating pumpkin, now called the Dickinson
variety. Eating pumpkins, very different from the jack-o'-lantern
varieties grown for their size and appearance, are elongated and
buff-colored with thin walls. The Dickinson is noted for its bright
orange color, creamy texture and fresh taste.
</P>
<P>
   Libby's took years to develop its own strain, improving upon the
Dickinson, called ``Select.'' Today, Libby's, a division of Nestle,
Inc., plants more than 4,000 acres of pumpkins annually.

 By ELIZABETH LEVANG  
 From ``Holiday Hope: Remembering Loved Ones During Special Times of
the Year,'' published by Fairview Press 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The holiday season calls up wistful memories and returns us to
faraway places, to scenes filled with the scents and sounds of
warmth and happiness. No other time of year evokes such strong
images of family togetherness.
 &HT;    For all its nostalgia and sentimentalism, however, the holiday
season is a difficult and often debilitating period for those who
are bereaved. More than anything, the holidays seem to accentuate
what others have and they have lost.
 &HT;    A time of year that once was joyous now often becomes almost
unbearable. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year's are
days to endure rather than enjoy.
 &HT;    A friend whose 17-year-old son died in a car accident once
confided, ``I'd like to rip Dec. 25 off my calendar forever.''
 &HT;    Those with loved ones who have died experience a special pain or
burden during the holidays. Your lives have been altered, and your
family togetherness has been disturbed forever. Trying to reconcile
your reality with the idealized picture of the holidays projected
by the media causes even more emotional pain.
 &HT;    The expectations put on the bereaved, both socially and
emotionally, can feel overwhelming. You may have parties to attend,
gifts to purchase and a tree to be bought and trimmed. You are
expected to get in the spirit and join in the festivities just like
everyone else, yet in your heart is a gnawing pain and the constant
fear that you won't make it.
 &HT;    A close friend once remarked how much she had come to hate
Thanksgiving. ``The family focus hurts me,'' she said. ``I feel
somehow out of place. It's a depressing and lonely time for me.
Both my parents are dead and I don't really feel like I have much
to give thanks about.''
 &HT;    Comparing yourself to others, isolating ourselves, feeling
jealous, lonely, depressed or angry are some of the reactions that
you may experience during the holiday season. Many also feel guilt
from time to time, or are totally overwhelmed with sorrow.
 &HT;    Still, there are ways to survive the holidays, and with a change
in attitude and a bit of planning, they can become tolerable, and
even enjoyable. How can you better handle your grief during the
holidays?
 &HT;    First, acknowledge your pain. You miss your loved one. It is
agonizing not to be able to spend this joyous time with him or her.
Feel free to share your pain with friends and family. By
acknowledging and sharing your feelings, you allow others to
support and care for you. Rather than pushing your feelings down
and hoping they will stay hidden, you need an opportunity to
resolve them. Only by letting the hurt out will you make room for
healing.
 &HT;    Second, take charge of your life and don't leave things to
chance. This does not mean putting yourself on a rigid schedule,
but rather deciding in advance what you would like to do and with
whom. By taking charge, you give yourself things to look forward to
rather than things to dread. Occupying yourself lends a purpose to
your days and keeps you from feeling sorry for yourself.
 &HT;    Third, think more realistically and positively. What you think
has a dramatic effect on how you feel. When you form positive yet
realistic expectations for the holidays and accept your own
limitations, you reduce the tensions and pressure you face. Now,
how do you put these three new attitudes into practice? Here are a
number of specific coping strategies:
 &HT;    + Be honest. Your feelings are legitimate. Trust that you know
what is best for yourself. If a gathering of family or friends is
too painful, make your apologies and leave.
 &HT;    + Accept and seek support. Let your family and friends know how
they can be of assistance. If hanging ornaments on the tree feels
overwhelming, ask a friend to lend a hand. If neighbors offer to
bake cookies or wrap gifts, graciously accept their help and good
intentions.
 &HT;    + Be kind to yourself. Look for ways to nurture and care for
yourself throughout the holidays. Perhaps buy yourself a special
gift, sign up for a massage or do that something you've always
wanted to do. And at the very least, treat yourself to an
occasional smile.
 &HT;    + Have a plan. Talking with friends and family about what you
want and don't want to do during the holidays can be very helpful.
Being prepared lessens anxiety.
 &HT;    + Alter traditions. Since circumstances have changed, old
traditions may need replacing. Even simple changes, like serving
another dish instead of turkey or opening gifts later in the day,
may make you more comfortable.
 &HT;    + Start a new tradition. Start afresh by adding one new
tradition each year. Attending a seasonal play, decorating a
special tree outdoors or reciting a favorite poem before opening
gifts are some examples.
 &HT;    + Shop early. Avoid the holiday atmosphere by completing
shopping early. Rely on catalogs or the telephone, or enlist the
aid of a supportive friend.
 &HT;    + Decrease your commitments. Grief saps energy, so you may need
to pare down your commitments. Consider buying instead of baking
cookies, cutting down on the number of cards you send or having an
artificial rather than a fresh tree.
 &HT;    + Cherish your memories. Religious services, Christmas concerts
or other holiday events can trigger memories of your loved one.
While some may be painful, memories need to be cherished, for they
are an enduring and intimate connection to your loved one.
 &HT;    + Give tribute. The holidays can be a special time to honor your
loved one. Donating money to a special cause, offering to help
someone in need or volunteering your time and talents to a local
charity are some ways to do this.
 &HT;    + Be hopeful. The pain and stress of the holidays is very real.
Still, with some trial and error, things will get better.
 &HT;    + Remember the life of your loved one. More than anything else
at this time of year, you may feel a strong need to know that your
loved one has not been forgotten. Setting a plate at the table,
hanging a stocking on the mantle or retelling stories about him or
her are just a few ways to reassure yourself that the spirit of
this special person lives on.

 By RICK RODGERS  
 From ``Thanksgiving 101,'' published by Broadway Books 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Rick Rodgers, often called Mr. Thanksgiving, gives holiday
cooking classes nationwide. Below he answers questions about
choosing from among the myriad types of turkey on the market.
 &HT;    + Other than gender, are there any differences between hen and
tom turkeys? Is one more tender than the other?
 &HT;    Hens are female turkeys, weighing from 8 to 16 pounds. Male
toms, bred to yield a high proportion of the white breast meat that
most Americans prefer, weigh 14 to 26 pounds. The size of the bird
relates to its age. Turkeys are often labeled ``young,'' because no
commercial turkey is much older than 26 weeks.
 &HT;    Thanks to modern animal husbandry methods, there is no
difference in flavor or tenderness between toms and hens. In the
old days, a younger bird meant a more tender one, and while an old
tom had plenty of flavor, it was also tougher.
 &HT;    + What are the differences between fresh and frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    There are actually three designations for fresh and frozen
turkeys.
 &HT;    _ ``Frozen'' turkeys have been deep-chilled at 0 degrees or
below. They are at their best if defrosted and cooked within one
year of purchase. (If you've ever wondered how your supermarket can
give away free frozen turkeys as premiums at Thanksgiving time,
it's probably because they are using up last year's surplus.)
 &HT;    _ ``Fresh'' birds have never been chilled below 26 degrees, and
have a correspondingly short shelf life. (Turkey freezes at eight
degrees lower than water does.) Fresh turkeys are readily available
at supermarkets or butchers. You rarely have to special order them
anymore, unless your butcher requires that you do so or you are
concerned about getting a certain size. Buy fresh turkey no earlier
than two days before roasting, even if the ``sell-by'' date on the
label is later. I always buy a fresh turkey.
 &HT;    _ Turkeys kept at temperatures between 0 and 26 degrees are
considered ``hard-chilled.'' You won't see turkeys labeled
hard-chilled, though, as each turkey producer is allowed to create
its own name for this designation, as long as it isn't misleading.
Holding turkey at this temperature range prolongs shelf life and
has little effect on quality.
 &HT;    + What about frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    Frozen turkeys are the least expensive, but freezing dries out
the meat, and more moisture is lost down the drain during
defrosting. Good turkey producers always inject the birds with a
moistening solution to replace the lost liquid. The best frozen
turkeys have been injected only with wholesome ingredients like
broth, vegetable oil and seasonings.
 &HT;    Also, frozen birds require advance planning to defrost. I hardly
have enough room in my refrigerator at holiday time as it is,
without a huge turkey taking up all the space while it thaws for
three to five days.
 &HT;    Considering the minor difference in price between frozen and
fresh (or hard-chilled, which is almost as good as fresh) turkeys,
why not get the best you can afford?
 &HT;    + If I do buy a frozen turkey, how do I defrost it?
 &HT;    First and foremost, never defrost a turkey at room temperature.
 &HT;    Allow enough time for the turkey to thaw. It takes a full 24
hours to defrost each five pounds of turkey in the refrigerator.
So, if you want a 25-pound turkey to be thoroughly defrosted by
Thanksgiving morning, you must buy it by the preceding Sunday at
the latest. (I'd buy it on Saturday, just to be sure.)
 &HT;    If you are in a hurry, a second-best option is to defrost the
bird in a large sink of cold water, allowing 30 minutes per pound,
changing the water and turning the turkey often. Do not add warm
water to hasten the process.
 &HT;    Don't defrost a turkey in the microwave oven. The turkey is
irregularly shaped, and some parts of the bird will cook while
others are still defrosting. Besides, most microwave ovens won't
hold a bird larger than 12 pounds.
 &HT;    + What about self-basting birds?
 &HT;    Self-basting birds, available fresh and frozen, have been
``enhanced'' (in the eyes of the producer) with flavorings, some
natural and some artificial. They purport to make the turkey moist
_ I say these make the turkey soggy and wet, and predisposed to
fall apart when lifting it from the pan.
 &HT;    They say the basting liquid makes the turkey taste better _ I
say a turkey tastes good enough without fake flavorings. I want to
promote turkeys that taste like turkey, not canned soup.
 &HT;    And I like to baste the bird, so the concept of ``self-basting''
leaves me cold. Not only does opening the oven and basting give the
cook an idea of the turkey's progress, but the hot basting liquid
helps to brown and seal the skin and hold in the juices.
 &HT;    + My farmers' market has organic, free-range birds. Are they
worth the price?
 &HT;    The terms organic and free-range are not recognized by the USDA.
Butchers, farmers and restaurants can use them as marketing terms,
but they cannot use them in labeling (although they can be written
on signs advertising the product).
 &HT;    Generally, ``organic poultry'' has been raised on organically
grown, antibiotic-free feed. ``Free-range'' turkeys, which are
often organic, have been raised in a relatively spacious
environment that gives them access to open spaces.
 &HT;    Many turkeys that are not called free-range may have been raised
in henhouses with the same amount of space. The term free-range may
make you think of wide-open skies, but it's no guarantee that the
birds have ever been outside _ it just means that the door to the
henhouse is open and they can go out if they want to.
 &HT;    These birds can be excellent, but, again, they still need to be
cooked carefully for fine results. They are significantly more
expensive than ordinary fresh turkeys, and whether they are worth
it or not is up to you.
 &HT;    + My specialty butcher carries wild turkeys. What are they like?
 &HT;    Today, most wild turkeys are actually farm-raised. They are very
full-flavored, but not gamy like hunter-bagged wild turkeys. Most
true, wild turkeys are so tough that cooks roast only the tender
breast and stew the dark meat. I like to say they are to regular
turkeys what sourdough bread is to white bread. Some people just
like the complex flavor of the former better than the latter.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys look much different from regular ones, with a high,
humped breastbone and freckled white skin. While wild turkeys may
look meaty, they actually have a very low meat-to-bone ratio. Their
weight ranges from only six to 12 pounds. Allow about 1 1/2 pounds
per person.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys are very lean and should be roasted only to 170 to
175 degrees, or the meat will dry out. The dark meat may be a
little pink, but it is safe to eat. If you prefer your dark meat
more well-done, just pop the sliced meat back into a 400-degree
oven for a few minutes _ it will probably be cooked by the time you
get around to serving the mashed potatoes.
 &HT;    + My neighbor swears by kosher turkeys. What makes them
different?
 &HT;    Kosher turkeys are raised free-range in a manner similar to
organic turkeys and are fed antibiotic-free feed. They are
slaughtered and salted according to Jewish dietary laws. Some cooks
feel that the method of slaughtering gives the birds a fresher,
cleaner taste. The salting seasons the turkeys and makes their meat
somewhat firmer than that of regular birds.
 &HT;    These extra steps are labor-intensive, so kosher turkeys always
cost more. Many kosher turkeys are frozen, so be sure to defrost
them properly to protect your investment.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: SADDAM'S LATEST HISTORY LESSON
 &HT;    (EDITORS: RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT)
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Nov. 15
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eight years after World War II, Germany and Japan,
the vanquished powers, had risen anew as prosperous allies of the
United States. Eight years after the Persian Gulf war, Iraq remains
mired in poverty while facing the threat of another U.S. air
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Why the difference?
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, the allies hanged or jailed the axis leaders
who failed to commit suicide. But in Iraq, loser Saddam Hussein
remains in power, able to summon CNN on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   When Iraq's forces collapsed in 1991 after a 100-hour land
campaign, then-President Bush surmised Saddam couldn't long survive
in power. Essentially, President Clinton is making the same bet by
dispatching fresh forces to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   While there are those who claim the administration lacks a
coherent policy in the region, six key elements can in fact be
deduced.
</P>
<P>
   1. Strive to disarm Iraq until Saddam is history.
</P>
<P>
   2. Isolate Iraq regionally until Saddam is history.
</P>
<P>
   3. Block Iraqi oil exports until Saddam is history.
</P>
<P>
   4. Maintain an embargo on imports until Saddam is history.
</P>
<P>
   5. Use the CIA to destabilize Iraq until Saddam is history.
</P>
<P>
   6. While seeking world support for those goals, be ready to go
it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Top policy makers here fail to take into account the Middle
East's prevailing mind set _ one that allows events of 1,000 years
ago, such as the Crusades, to be viewed as having happened, say,
only 10 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam sees history in this way. He models his actions on those
of another tyrant, Nebuchadnezzar II, the Babylonian king who lived
from 604 to 562 B.C., and who destroyed Solomon's Temple and
enslaved the Israelites.
</P>
<P>
   For Saddam, the morality of using ``weapons of mass
destruction'' pales before the prospect of similar greatness. He
began his drive to power as a secular socialist, so his passionate
hatred of Israel has nothing to do with militant Islam. For him,
lying and cheating are not moral issues. To bargain with him is, by
definition, an exercise in futility.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's immediate Arab neighbors understand this dynamic quite
well. Interestingly, the further one ranges from Baghdad, the more
ardent followers Saddam seems to draw.
</P>
<P>
   While the Saudi royal family faults Iraq alone for the current
crisis, al-Ahram, Egypt's leading semi-official daily, insists that
Baghdad's demands are ``perfectly legitimate'' and calls on
Washington to stop threatening a new war.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians take the middle ground, believing the crisis serves
the political interests of both sides. As the instigator, Saddam
gains because the bombs that could fall on his nation would enable
him to blame Washington for the Iraqis' desperate plight. And
Clinton gets to change the subject again from the (already
unpopular) House impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The equation is clear,'' Khairallah Khairallah (cq) writes in
the Jordanian daily al-Ra'i. ``There is a U.S. administration which
thinks the embargo on Iraq must continue indefinitely until the
current regime is replaced, so it has to find pretexts for
maintaining the embargo irrespective of what it inflicts on
ordinary Iraqi citizens.''

NOT ALL `GREAT ADVANCES' LIVE UP TO THE BILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's quite possible _ even likely _ that by reading this you
will misunderstand my position on the No. 233rd ranked hot-button
issue of our era _ public funding for scientific research at
universities and colleges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (I have, by the way, rechecked my long list of positions on
public issues and am confident I am accurately reporting here what
my stand is, with only a 3-point margin of error.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To minimize confusion, I want to be at least as careful and
clear about this as Bill Clinton was recently when he declared,
``It depends on what the meaning of the word `is' is.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My position, thus, is that _ at least in principle _ I support
giving tax dollars to universities for scientific research. In
fact, I believe we should support this by writing our
representatives in Congress, demonstrating on alternate Fridays in
front of any handy federal building and sending our offspring to
college to become scientists whose work depends on public bucks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to be clear about this because I've been reading the
annual ``Great Advances in Science'' report from the Science
Coalition, which represents more than 400 groups, schools and
individuals trying to keep tax dollars flowing to universities and
colleges to do scientific research. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, frankly, some of these advances don't seem especially
great. In fact, I'm struck not by what has been achieved in this
research but, rather, by important research that doesn't seem to be
getting done at all, at least based on what's in this report. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Stanford University (where Chelsea Clinton hangs
out to avoid the embarrassment of living at the White House) has
been working on developing a tractor that requires no farmer to
drive it. Instead, it can whip around fields using a
satellite-based automatic control system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is obviously a good idea. Farmers, after all, have better
things to do than sit on a tractor all day. Instead, they should be
working on how to make their farms smell better, and the
technological breakthrough of driverless tractors just might give
them time to do that. So three cheers for this research, I say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But isn't there agricultural research that might be equally _ or
even more _ crucial? For instance, why can't we put some public
funding behind the quest to find broccoli that tastes like
chocolate and, thus, will be eaten by children? It seems so little
to ask. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two other universities _ Brown and the University of Arizona _
are using funding provided by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (the outfit that twice now has shot John Glenn into
space and may have to do it a third time because he keeps coming
back) to study the temperature on the surface of Jupiter's moon
Io. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Volcanoes on Io, it turns out, have the highest recorded surface
temperatures of any planetary body in our solar system. And
scientists studying this say it may help us understand the early
history of Earth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, fine. I'm all for understanding Earth's history _ even all
the way back to when Strom Thurmond was running on the Pro-Dinosaur
ticket. But before we spend much more public money on moons of
other planets, shouldn't we first hire some university scientists
to figure out why, when our moon is full, people do wacky things?
Or why, nearly 30 years after a man first set foot on our moon,
there's not yet a Gap store or a McDonald's there? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another bit of publicly funded research has found the split
second when our brains encode a memory. This is supposed to help us
know better what will be remembered. No doubt this is important.
But where is the research that could help me recall the brilliant
comment I was going to make about it? &QL;

WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT TV'S APPALLING QUALITY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 50 years after commercial television invaded American
life, an obvious question is why so much of it _ especially on the
networks _ is so arid, vacuous and bleak. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A less obvious question is whether the soulless sex- and
violence-laden dreck that fills prime time TV matters any more,
given the explosion of alternative information and entertainment
choices. (Yes, it does, but maybe not as much.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast industry, after all, has atomized. This means more
people can ignore the insipid debris on commercial TV by choosing
instead to plug into satellites, get specialized cable channels
(the History Channel is a wholesome example) and surf the Internet
(sometimes on a medium-blurring device called Web TV). Though, of
course, those sources also harbor sludge amid more uplifting
offerings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hopeful evidence, as ratings show, is that some formerly
heavy TV viewers may be making better choices, leaving behind the
network offal of murder and body fluids as entertainment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans,'' says Henry Labalme, executive director of a
nonprofit advocacy group, TV-Free America, ``are finally moving
beyond the old debates about whose show is better than whose and
recognizing that all TV-watching displaces interactions and
activities that are simply healthier, more productive and more
fun.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In short, some folks are discovering a liberating truth: Much of
commercial TV is cultural pollution. Indeed, says Labalme's group,
this past April a record five million people joined in National
TV-Turnoff Week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody,'' he says, ``ever lay on their death bed wishing they
had spent more time watching Geraldo Rivera or Rosie O'Donnell.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even if repugnant situation comedies and violent dramas are
a smaller percentage of what's on network TV, they're still there,
drawing millions of viewers. Why? No doubt for many reasons, but
one is compellingly clear: Much of our culture _ because it relies
on lowest-common-denominator commercial success _ is equally vapid
and disheartening. (How else to explain brand loyalty to products
that clog arteries or cause lung cancer?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sobering reality is that commercial TV offers a reasonably
accurate picture of who we are _ a people mired in a culture of
celebrity, afraid of life-affirming risk, leery of real creativity
and willing to do almost anything to avoid hard questions about
ultimate meaning. Cowering in living rooms, demanding to be
anesthetized by cheap, tawdry entertainment, people who watch the
drivel on commercial TV get what they deserve because they buy the
products for which the medium creates demand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And let's be clear: Commercial TV's main function has not
changed from the late 1940s, when Jack Benny and Milton Berle were
becoming its first stars. It exists to sell brand-name soap. Well,
soap, beer and cars, not to speak of aspirin, computers and soft
drinks. It is nothing less than a magnet advertisers use to attract
a critical mass of customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everything else is secondary. Everything. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This role explains much of the astonishingly puerile, stupefying
prime time shows I watched recently to reacquaint myself with the
sort of bilge I have refused to watch for decades. They all seem to
be about nothing but irresponsible, casual sex. Some highlights: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ On ``Suddenly Susan,'' an NBC show, a sidekick character
observes star Brooke Shields' unmarried character's
out-of-the-ordinary breakfast and concludes it means but one thing:
``You're having sex! Way to go!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shield's lying response: ``The closest thing I have to a sex
life is when my Thighmaster slips.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ On ABC's ``Home Improvement,'' the unmarried sister of star
Tim Allen's TV wife has sex in Allen's house with Allen's unmarried
TV brother. Allen dismisses it as inconsequential. Allen's wife
tells him, ``You'd be comfortable doing it with a relative in the
room.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ On ``Clueless,'' a UPN show on which actors without skill
recite lines without meaning to advance a story without plot, a
euphemism for sex is ``going downtown.'' When the female star (Who
cares what her name is?) gets interrupted while waiting for a kiss,
she says, ``Hello! Girl and tongue waiting!'' The to-be-continued
episode ends when fake human feces (soon eaten by an actor) in a
swimming pool breaks up a party. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Spin City,'' an ABC show, opens with star Michael J. Fox's
unmarried character telling a slim, unmarried model, ``Look, just
because we've been on a couple of dates doesn't mean there's any
pressure.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She responds by removing her blouse. We next see her lying on a
bed in just her bra and panties. The actual intercourse, bless ABC,
occurs off camera. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That was amazing,'' he says afterward. She yodels, explaining,
``I like to yodel after sex.'' He responds, ``I prefer the wave,''
and raises both his arms. Later she complains to him, ``You don't
know anything about me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But already I know too much: She has apparently unprotected sex
with anyone she wants, then wonders why her sex partners don't get
to know her. Such people once were called tramps and wolves; now
they're stars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notice I've said nothing about daytime TV's lurid soap operas or
the animated Comedy Central hit ``South Park,'' in one episode of
which the muffled, elementary-school character Kenny uses vulgar
anatomical language to describe female body parts he likes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a sad use of a potentially (and sometimes an actually)
marvelous medium. If, as one A.C. Nielsen study shows, children
watch nearly 4 hours of TV a day (other studies report the time has
fallen to 90 minutes), it's no wonder that 95 percent of Americans
between the ages of 13 and 17 can name the actor who played the
Fresh Prince of Bel Air on TV (Will Smith) but only 2 percent can
name the chief justice of the United States (William Rehnquist). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Television,'' Marshall McLuhan once said, ``is teaching all
the time.'' Indeed, one of its lessons should be this: Art doesn't
require a laugh track. But a recent ``New Yorker'' article quotes
Jamie Tarses, ABC Entertainment president, as essentially saying
viewers are idiots: ``People will wonder, Am I supposed to think
this is funny or serious? People need the comforting aural cue of
laughter.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The technology to deliver all this is improving rapidly. We're
moving toward wide availability of High Definition Television
(HDTV), Digital Video Discs (DVD) and ``Flat TV,'' which uses
plasma, or charged gas, to light color pixels that make up images. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what difference will that make if we burn time watching this
still-vast wasteland's rubbish? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 years ago, author E.B. White saw a demonstration of TV
and declared, ``We shall discover either a new and unbearable
disturbance of the general peace or a saving radiance in the
sky.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget the saving radiance. After all, commercial TV's
spiritually empty role is to collect zombies to buy the advertised
products, a job built on the lie that more stuff will make us
happy. But whether TV continues to be an unbearable disturbance is
up to us. Our job, after all, is to be discerning and responsible
in this new era of choices. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A couple of days ago, reporter Dejan
Anastasijevic sat down to write a story for his political journal
when he suddenly stopped himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized,'' he said over whiskey and cigarettes in a cafe,
``that I was sitting as far away from my keyboard as possible. My
arms were extended fully. It was as if I was physically distancing
myself from the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Anastasijevic downed his whiskey and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything I write could shut my newspaper down, and I don't
even know what's right or wrong. This is what censorship does to
you,'' he concluded ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters here have to be careful what they write. If someone in
the paranoid regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
decides that an article or a broadcast _ even one sentence _ is
disloyal, the news organization that carries it risks being shut
down and its editors fined.
</P>
<P>
   Already, four newspapers and magazines and two radio stations
have been closed. More disheartening to dissidents and Western
diplomats, some have shut down themselves after being accused
rather than risk the wrath or legal expense of battling the
government.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper was closed for reporting that another newspaper
had printed eight blank pages as a protest against the media
crackdown. The paper that printed the blank pages was not closed.
</P>
<P>
   While American diplomats are wary of admitting it publically,
many have privately concluded that economic sanctions aimed at the
Milosevic regime are not working.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, Milosevic has used economic sanctions to
appeal to Serbs that the whole world is against them, and many
believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Many Western diplomats say that if Milosevic is to go, the Serbs
must get rid of him democratically. Only a free press can expose
Milosevic's abuse of power and show how he has needlessly made his
country an international pariah. No one knows how to accomplish
this, however, in a country that is still culturally communist,
with widespread voting fraud and the institutional suppression of
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republic of Serbia, which with Montenegro forms the
Federation of Yugoslavia, one can spend a day talking to people in
its capital and not find one who likes Milosevic. More revealing,
perhaps, is the difficulty many have to name a replacement. One
reason he remains in power is the disarray of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs don't like Milosevic, but they don't know who they
like better,'' says Bratislav Grubacic, general manager of The
Belgrade Times.
</P>
<P>
   According to Goran Milicevic, a professor of urban economics at
Belgrade University, the biggest problem in toppling Milosevic
democratically is that Serbia has neither democratic institutions,
nor the desire to create them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are almost genetically engineered to be loyal to our
domestic leaders,'' he said. ``The regime play that card, our
glorious past. We used to be a country of 25 million, now it's 10
million. Everyone still believes we are a powerful country. We are
not. We are broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Milicevic's research lends credence to his argument. In the 10
years since Milosevic triggered the wars that led to the breakup of
the former Yugoslavia, the country's gross domestic product has
dropped from $30 billion to $10 billion. A third of the 3 million
people who had been &UR;  &LR; employed in non-agricultural jobs, have lost
them since 1990, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even during the hyperinflation of 1993, noted Milicevic,
``People didn't think about getting rid of the regime. They were
thinking about surviving.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Milosevic understands the complacency of his
people, and has &UR;  &LR; slowly crushed dissent. The Yugoslav leader began
by breaking up the student groups that led the 1996-97 protests
against election results favoring him that were widely viewed as
fraudulent. &UR;  &LR; Last spring, Milosevic restructured the university
system to silence dissident intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   University professors had been hired by department committee.
But Milosevic changed it so that all authority in hiring and firing
rests with a dean loyal to the regime. Tenure was scrapped and
professors now must sign a loyalty pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Students say they have been approached and asked to spy on
teachers. ``It's Germany, 1933,'' said Milicevic.
</P>
<P>
   If dissidents and Western diplomats are concerned with these
developments, the public does not appear to be.``People here have
no expectation of a free press, of free expression,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   It is against this backdrop of apathy that Milos Vasic is trying
to mobilize opposition to the media crackdown. Vasic, president of
the Independent Journalist Association of Serbia, said the absence
of constitutional protection leaves reporters and news
organizations at the mercy of the regime. One tactic is to publish
or broadcast in neighboring Montenegro, which has its own
Constitution protecting free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to smuggle newspapers across the border like
cigarettes, we will,'' Vasic promised.
</P>
<P>
   Filip Svarm, executive editor of Vreme, said under the new law
an accused journalist is presumed guilty, unlike in a criminal
court, and has just 24 hours to prove that the story is true after
the government levels a charge.
</P>
<P>
   The law, meanwhile, is written to dissuade appeals. Fines are
not stayed pending appeal. The government begins impounding
property immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The ``judge'' who will determine guilt a low-ranking
administrator who serves at the whim of the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Vasic was present last week when the police shut down the
newspaper, Danas. He said the police inspector, who is a lawyer,
apologized. ``He said, `don't resist.' He was nice about it. The
cops know there is no constitutional basis for the crackdown.
They're under orders,'' said Vasic.
</P>
<P>
   The new law was not even made public until a half-hour before
the parliament rubber-stamped it on Oct. 21. Since then, Vasic and
a bevy of lawyers have been searching for loopholes. They know they
have an uphill battle.

NOT SO NICE TO MEET YOU, JOE BLACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
MEET JOE BLACK 
Directed by: Martin Brest 
Screenplay by: Ron Osborn, Jeff Reno, Kevin Wade, Bo Goldman 
Starring: Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani, Jake Weber,
Marcia Gay Harden, Jeffrey Tambor 
Running time: 180 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (an accident scene, some sexuality and brief strong
language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black,'' the new Brad Pitt package, is a remake of
``Death Takes a Holiday.'' Given the surprising vacancy of Pitt's
performance as Death, it's no holiday this time around. It's more
like a leave of absence. And at three hours, it's a slow death. Or
an overextended piece of marketing. Mostly, the film is about
Pitt's golden gorgeousness. In his love scenes with the daughter of
the guy he's there to pull the plug on, he displays a passivity not
often associated with death. Presumably the idea here is to sell a
female fantasy, dangling before women in the audience the chance to
imagine that they, and not Claire Forlani, are initiating Pitt's
naive but eager Death into sex.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Pitt mostly just stands around with his face
hanging out because the film hasn't really figured out how to
reinvent the character of Death. Pitt looks great in a tux, and he
brings a goofball humor to the fish-out-of-water stuff, like his
discovery that he loves peanut butter. He's momentarily interesting
when he stops the sexy murmuring, takes the gloves off, and reminds
Anthony Hopkins that he's calling the shots and can whisk them both
off to the afterlife any second. He's only sticking around and
forcing himself on Hopkins as an unwanted house guest because he's
curious about the human experience and wants to sample it.
</P>
<P>
   The film never really goes anywhere with a possibility that
could have worked for the '90s _ Death as anything but omnipotent,
just a '90s-style slave to his job as an ethereal escort service.
And the movie never goes anywhere with what's supposed to be the
sexual fireworks between Pitt and Forlani because her character, a
rich man's daughter who works as a doctor in order to do something
useful with her life, is left to do all the romantic work. This
overlong remake also loses one of the entertaining elements of the
1934 original starring Fredric March _ showing what happens when
nobody dies because of Death's timeout. The closest it comes is the
introduction of an ailing Jamaican woman who spots Pitt as Death.
</P>
<P>
   The real love story here, the one we believe in, is the
father-daughter love between Hopkins and Forlani. She's refreshing,
he's magnificent, even in as meager a role as this one is. Still,
it breaks ground in one respect. Hopkins, who played a thinly
disguised Rupert Murdoch in a play called ``Pravda'' this time
appears as perhaps film's first admirable media baron ever. His
65th birthday party is shaping up as a real bummer. First, Death
shows up to cart him away, then starts fooling around with his
daughter. Not only that. He's also about to be subjected to that
humiliating banana peel reserved for plutocrats _ a corporate
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hopkins's silken deliveries and vesuvian rage are the
only signs of life here, apart from Forlani's outpouring of spirit
and vulnerability as she remains blissfully oblivious to the fact
that the guy she's fallen for is there to take her father away
permanently. Alongside Hopkins, Pitt turns invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' is lovely to look at, especially when it
segues to a Narragansett Bay mansion bathed in moonlight and
fireworks. But the gorgeous visuals can't begin to conceal that the
film is stretched fatally thin. For all its stardust, ``Meet Joe
Black'' seems destined to fulfill only those who are into Brad
Pitt, or boredom, or both.

TEEN VOLUNTEERISM ON RISE, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raising hopes that the next generation of Americans will be more
socially conscious than their predecessors, a new study has found
that teenagers are more likely than adults to donate their free
time to charities or causes.
</P>
<P>
   But for many in the local philanthropic community, an increase
in volunteering doesn't necessarily mean kids are being more
generous _ only that they log more hours in school
community-service programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists worry teens are being forced to volunteer, as
both private and public schools increasingly encourage, or even
require, community service participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask if it's legitimate volunteering, if the kids
have no choice,'' said Mark Yurkies, executive director of Boston
Cares, a clearinghouse for people who want to give their time.
``You have to ask if they see it as punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the numbers seem heartening to those who have fretted
about a lack of civic-mindedness among young people: Fully 59
percent of people between 12 and 17 reported volunteering at least
once a week in 1996, according to a new report by Independent
Sector, a national forum on philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, only 49 percent of adults gave of their time
weekly, a number that has remained steady since 1991. The
proportion of teen volunteers increased by 7 percent during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Half the teens said they were first exposed to volunteering at
school. But almost all said they continue to devote time out of a
desire to give back to their communities, not to get credit. Only
7.5 percent of the teens in the study said formal coursework was
their motivation.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the number of young people volunteering
through public school programs skyrocketed from 53,000 in 1996 to
169,000 in 1997. Many, like Holyoke's Yasmine Pereira, 18, a peer
leader for Girls Inc., said they became involved in volunteering
through school programs, but continued past their required time.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason teens cited for volunteering was ``compassion
for people in need,'' the study said. The second reason was to ``do
something for a cause that was important to them.'' The third
reason was the belief that ``if they helped others, others would
help them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love helping the girls here,'' said Pereira. ``It's just
something I want to do. It makes me feel good about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this is surprising to Martha Morkan, director of
Massachusetts Promise, the organization responsible for
implementing the ideas addressed in the President's Summit for
America's Future, hosted by retired General Colin Powell in
Philadelphia in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education reform hasn't taken hold as much as young people
themselves grasping the idea that they are not just recipients of
services, but that they can really contribute to their
communities,'' Morkan said, adding that 290,000 teens currently
volunteer regularly in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Young people's return to religious values also plays a large
part. According to the study, the volunteers who weren't inspired
to give of their time through schools became volunteers through
religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Casey, director of external affairs for City Year in
Boston, agreed that the increasing number of teen volunteers
reflects the civic-minded spirit of America's youth. Her
organization began in 1988 in Boston with just 50 members, and has
grown to 925 members in 10 cities.
</P>
<P>
   Because of increased requests from pre-teens, City Year has
launched a new program called Young Heroes, aimed at middle school
students who want to do community work.
</P>
<P>
   Kafer Nevins, now 20, began volunteering when he was 17. Now a
member of City Year, he is viewed as a leader in his neighborhood.
``I did a project at a school where we made masks for little
kids,'' said Nevins. ``And I got more out of that one day than I
got out of years working'' at a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists offered various theories on why teens are giving
more time to their communities, other than being required by
schools. Morkan said that increasing poverty among America's
children may have contriubted to an awareness among young people of
need among their own.
</P>
<P>
   Casey said that this generation's place as the first Americans
to be without a significant ``foreign enemy'' has made them turn
inward in search of meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the American lore there is this patriotic obligation to
service,'' Casey said. ``That has been transformed with the new
generation to celebrating and strengthening our nation with
activism on a local level.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its happy news, however, the Independent Sector report
revealed a disturbing trend: Teens of color were far less likely to
be asked to volunteer than white teens.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fact that teens were four times more likely to
volunteer if asked, that result is a higher percentage of white
teens volunteering; 63 percent of white teens volunteered, compared
to 45 percent of nonwhite teens.
</P>
<P>
   Among the teens who were asked to volunteer, Hispanic teens _
who may be of any race _ were the least likely to. Where only 85
percent of Hispanic teens asked to volunteer did so, 94 percent of
white teens and 90 percent of black teens did.
</P>
<P>
   Among all teens, the same percentage of males and females
volunteered.

WALL STREET WANTS A WORD WITH BOSTON SCIENTIFIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Scientific Corp. has hit a lot of bumps in the road
lately: the recall of an important new medical product, an
accounting issue that could complicate its torrid acquisition
strategy, and an embarrassing gaffe that overstated sales in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Peter Nicholas thinks they are inevitable but
minor setbacks suffered by a company growing fast and competing
against medical-product giants. But if he's listening, Nicholas
would hear that Wall Street is trying to tell him something.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Natick-based Boston Scientific have been cut nearly in
half since mid-August, a market-value decline in the neighborhood
of $8 billion, though none of the company's operational problems
seem especially severe. And this is not the first time Boston
Scientific shares have taken a hard fall for missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and others who follow the stock say this is the price
of a company culture that keeps a tight grip on information and
prefers to let performance numbers speak for themselves. That's
fine when business hums, they say, but it engenders scant good will
to smooth over the tougher days. At its heart, investing is a
relationship business.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the raps against this company is that management hasn't
fully made the transition to acting like a public company,'' said
analyst Frederick Wise of Bear, Stearns. ``They are not a small,
stealth, private company anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst David Lothson of PaineWebber sees a similar problem at
Boston Scientific. ``As they moved in the public world, they failed
to appreciate the degree of information today's institutional
investor has come to expect of companies of this type,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One institution that owned a large number of Boston Scientific
shares dumped its entire stake beginning in September, just as the
company was riding over its series of bumps. ``Communication was a
big issue,'' said a spokesman for the institution, which declined
to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The ``stealth'' company was a phrase Nicholas himself used, even
at the time Boston Scientific went public in 1992. He doesn't care
for the criticism that the company has problems talking to its
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a little unfair,'' Nicholas said Thursday in a rare
interview. ``We are a company that has historically expressed its
values in terms of being evaluated on our deeds and not our words.
In good times and bad, we have never tried to hype the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been an innovator and a pioneer and a risk-taker.
Those things don't happen because of what you say, but what you do
and who you are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas points out that Boston Scientific insiders are not
insulated managers with scant financial interest beyond their
paychecks. He and cofounder John Abele are each multibillionaires
today, among the very richest people in New England, as a result of
big stock holdings in the company they created.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas insists the balance between protecting information from
competitors and communicating with people who have a sincere
investing interest . Boston Scientific, he said, is still young and
learning.
</P>
<P>
   But weak corporate communication may have magnified the series
of problems and complications that have beset Boston Scientific in
the last month. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _The accounting problem. Boston Scientific's third-quarter
report Thursday was weeks behind schedule because the company was
working out accounting and valuation issues surrounding its recent
$2.1 billion purchase of a Pfizer Inc. unit. The problem was not
serious, but it delayed release of the final details for the
purchase of Schneider Worldwide. The word Thursday: a $671 million
charge for purchased research and development. Acquisition
accounting is important to a company like Boston Scientific, which
has purchased more than 20 companies in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   _The Japan problem. Boston Scientific announced two weeks ago
that it had improperly booked $40 million to $50 million of sales
in Japan during the first nine months of the year. The company
described the situation as an ``irregularity'' and fingers began to
point in many directions. Shareholder lawsuits followed. Two
executives left the company, though Boston Scientific declined to
discuss their departure and at least one of the managers,
international division chief James Corbett, insisted he had no
involvement and had been planning to leave the company. Boston
Scientific Thursday reported a charge of $79 million to cover the
discrepancy. ``Japan really took our breath away,'' Nicholas said
on a conference call last night.
</P>
<P>
   _The stent problem. The company decided last month to recall one
of two stent systems it had introduced in the United States six
weeks earlier, after doctors reported difficulty using the device.
The stents are designed to enhance clot-removing angioplasty
treatments. A provision of $31 million to cover the expense was
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts worry about what it all adds up to and what else,
if anything, they haven't heard about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that there is simply too much for management
to do, too many fires to put out, too many wrongs to right in what
will have to be a relatively short period of time,'' analyst
Michael Weinstein of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. wrote in a
research report dated Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts who cover Boston Scientific said chief financial
officer Larry Best has to shoulder the blame for the company's
problems communicating with its shareholders. Most analysts said
Best is spead thin in a lean organization, but some others pointed
to a tough style that
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Daniel Lemaitre of S.G. Cowen &AMP; Co. said Best ``put us
in the penalty box for a little while'' earlier this year, freezing
the firm out because he believed it had been spreading false rumors
about Boston Scientific.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to canvas institutional investors and ask about
investor relations at Boston Scientific, it would seem like an
oxymoron,'' Lemaitre said. ``They have not spent a lot of time and
money there.''
</P>
<P>
   Best defends Boston Scientific's reputation with investors, but
adds that the ups and downs of the young company's business are
sometimes hard on institutional shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the relationship with Wall Street is pretty good,'' he
said. ``Unfortunately, we have been an unpredictable company for
the last several years. Wall Street loves predictability.''
</P>
<P>
   Best also defends his own track record with investors and points
to his recent award of 250,000 Boston Scientific options this fall
as evidence directors are happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they want me to stay,'' said Best. ``They would not
have granted that to me unless they thought I was doing a pretty
good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Lemaitre responded: ``If you were to poll shareholders
right now, I bet there would be a spirited debate about that.''

ABC IS MISSING SOME STARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom O'Connell says he's just a working stiff. And he's not
lying, especially when compared with the high-priced talent he has
worked with over the last 23 years on ABC's ``Monday Night
Football'' _ O.J. Simpson, Howard Cosell, Fran Tarkenton, Fred
``The Hammer'' Williamson, Don Meredith, and Frank Gifford, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   While those on-air personalities have received most of the
attention, O'Connell is one of the camera operators who has given
them and millions of viewers something to watch and talk about.
Without pictures, ``Monday Night Football'' might as well be on
radio. And as far as O'Connell is concerned, that is where the last
two broadcasts should have been.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell is one of the 2,200 members of the National
Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians. Earlier this
month, they staged a 24-hour strike to protest what they described
as ABC's failure to disclose details of a health care plan proposed
by the parent Walt Disney Co. ABC responded by locking out
NABET-represented employees _ camera operators, videotape editors,
couriers, engineers, and some writers _ until the union gave the
network assurances that a strike wouldn't recur. The union hasn't,
and ABC has used shadow crews to work the football games.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell did not work the first game of the lockout, Nov. 2
between the Cowboys and Eagles, nor did he work Monday's game in
Pittsburgh between the Steelers and Packers. Instead of operating
Camera 3 at the 20-yard line, O'Connell was picketing and handing
out union leaflets to ticket-holders outside Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game began, O'Connell watched with a few union members.
They didn't like what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shadow crews know how to handle a camera,'' he said.
``They know how to focus and zoom. But it seems as though they are
picking and clawing their way through. They are not finding that
one unique shot. The fans are suffering. They are receiving
second-class coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC Sports spokesman Mark Mandel strongly disagreed. ``We got
pictures, commentary, and replays,'' he said. ``We have had to
scramble a little bit, but we're pulling it off. I dare anyone to
detect anything different about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension between the union and ABC has simmered for the last 19
months since NABET's contract with the network expired. A year ago,
workers staged a similar 24-hour walkout that forced cancellation
of ABC's live third-round coverage of the PGA Tour Championship in
Houston. In July, the union filed a complaint with the National
Labor Relations Board on the medical dispute. ABC has claimed it
doesn't have the information sought by the union.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the lockout forced ABC to switch its usual Monday
night pregame show with Chris Berman and Gifford from ESPN's
SportsZone in Baltimore to Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, where
Al Michaels and Boomer Esiason performed the duties.
</P>
<P>
   There's no end in sight. In a prepared statement, the network
said it ``cannot and will not allow our programming to be held
hostage to sneak attacks by the union.'' The statement further said
the job actions ``have only one purpose _ to try to put pressure on
ABC at the bargaining table.''
</P>
<P>
   True or not, union officials said the quality of ``Monday Night
Football'' won't be the same until a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even a good ESPN college football game broadcast,''
said Jim Joyce, an ABC technical director. ``There are terrible
camera angles and shots, a number of high-end graphics and digital
effects that are missing, a few number of isolated replays, and
inconsistent audio levels.''

A SHERPA BREAKS BARRIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT EVEREST BASE CAMP, Nepal _ Kaji Sherpa squinted in the
morning sun toward the summit of the world's tallest mountain.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 Sherpas have hacked their way to the top of Everest,
mostly breaking trail and pitching tents for western expeditions
that treat Sherpas more like servants than saviors. Fifty-five of
them have died on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Kaji Sherpa planned to climb it, and in record time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have big fear,'' he said in broken English. ``I do this
for Sherpas, for Sherpa pride. Important for Sherpas to be known.''
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, on Oct. 17, Kaji Sherpa made his assault. He
succeeded in every way. His 20-hour, 24-minute ``dash'' to the top
bested a Frenchman's 8-year-old record to the summit from the
Nepalese side of Everest.
</P>
<P>
   He also broke a culture barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, western chauvinism has been part of the
relationship. The Sherpas are frequently seen as slaves,'' said
Vincanne Adams, an anthropologist from Princeton University.
``There at the core is the source of Sherpa resentment and the
significance of Kaji.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaji's face now appears on billboards across Nepal trumpeting
his triumph. There is the prospect of more sponsorships (Tuborg
beer sponsored this climb), and ceremonies at the royal palace.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Kaji was prepared for the celebrity that his feat has
earned him. Sherpas, after all, are used to working for others.
They are not used to getting the credit.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, Sherpas, who are Buddhists, would have frowned
on any attempt to bolster their egos on Everest _ Chomolungma in
the local tongue, or ``Mother Goddess.'' The Buddhist manner is to
suppress the ego, not flaunt it on top of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1953, Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay
Sherpa of Nepal made their historic climb. Hillary was knighted by
a young Queen Elizabeth. Tenzing became known as ``the other guy''
in western circles, if he was mentioned at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherpa, one of 50 ethnic groups in Nepal, may have gained
the respect of his countrymen, but he had also become a
high-altitude baggage handler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We push, we pull climbers, up, down, we set the path, carry
and pitch their tents, cook their food, and sometimes have to go
places we know are dangerous,'' said Chuldin Norbu Sherpa, a member
of a recent trek. ``Crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who wrote ``Tigers of the Snow'' two years ago to explore
the fluid relationship between western visitors and Sherpas, added,
``It's no secret that almost every high Himalyan expedition since
has been a joint effort that included, and often depended on,
Sherpas.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonds between westerners and Sherpas are complicated. In her
book, Adams writes, ``Accommodating Western interests for a
particular sort of Sherpa is part of who Sherpas are.'' It becomes
``unclear where the boundary is between who Westerners would have
the Sherpas be and who they truly are. Sherpas are constructed to
be not simply what the Westerner is, but what the Westerner
desires.''
</P>
<P>
   Real change occurred in 1982, when the first all-Sherpa team
reached the summit of Everest. Then in 1993, Pasang Lhamu Sherpa
became the first female Sherpa to climb the mountain, after
ignoring the warning of a local Buddhist priest, or lama, that her
venture would be unsafe. She died on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lama knows these things. But she had too much at stake as
first Sherpa woman,'' Kami Sherpa, 38, the leader of a trek in the
Everest region, explained last month. ``We're not noticed
sometimes. An expedition ends, the Sherpa is paid, then leaves. The
people take the victory photograph without us.''
</P>
<P>
   An exception appears to have been the opening at the Boston
Museum of Science in March of the IMAX film chronicling the Everest
ascent by Jamling Norgay, son of Tenzing. At the event, at least
two Sherpas who carried cameras for the expedition took bows. Such
acknowledgement is rare.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Kaji, a 33-year-old father built like a cinderblock, and
the first Sherpa player in the Everest game to dare to lead the
pack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Kaji climbed from Base Camp (17,600 feet) to Camp 2
(21,300 feet) in three hours. That stretch winds through the Khumbu
Icefall, a moonscape of ice towers and crevasses on a glacier that
creeps down about 4 feet daily. The icefall is lethal, responsible
for 19 of the 148 deaths reported through January of last year on
the mountain, according to statistics compiled in Broughton
Coburn's book ``Everest, Mountain Without Mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Marc Batard of France climbed from Base Camp in Nepal
to the summit in 22 hours, 29 minutes. Kaji figured that if a
physically fit Sherpa could thread the icefall at almost 4,000
vertical feet an hour and live, he could conquer the mountain in 18
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Kammerlander of Italy holds the ascent record of 16 hours
and 45 minutes, but it was made in 1996 from the Tibet side of the
mountain, generally considered the easier route.
</P>
<P>
   Kaji prepared by training daily with a regimen that included a
two-hour jog, then a two-hour swim, then another two-hour jog. He
kept it up almost without a break for one year. He had to. Kaji
planned to make the ascent without supplemental oxygen. ``Too
heavy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His plan, he explained a few days before a climb, was to stop
only twice for a total of about 30 minutes to drink tea and eat
rice. The entire ascent rises two vertical miles, the final 3,000
feet of which he would be accompanied by two Sherpa friends. They
would not touch him until he reached the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they carry me down,'' he said, oblivious to a nearby
avalanche cutting loose in this amphitheater of glacier and rock.
</P>
<P>
   And his plans after the attempt?
</P>
<P>
   ``Social work. I want to give back to Nepal,'' Kaji said.
</P>
<P>
   Had Kaji not encountered hurricane-force winds and waist-deep
snow midway up the last leg, he would have made it in 18 hours, he
would later tell reporters.
</P>
<P>
   After his success, Kaji refocused his plans. Sherpa pride was at
work. ``I'm looking for more sponsors,'' he told Reuters. ``I'm
going to break more records.''

SEEING THE FRUIT OF ONE'S LABOR

<P>
   Q. I recently switched from a small, hands-on company to a
large, hierarchical one. Adjusting has been a bit of a struggle.
Before, I had a say in all aspects of the business, and I saw the
impact I had. Now, I'm a widget handler and wonder if I am adding
any value to the company's products. What should I do: stay put and
work my way up to a position where I'll clearly make a difference,
or go back to being a big frog in a small pond?
</P>
<P>
   A. As far as corporate culture shock goes, nothing is quite as
depressing as feeling that you've signed on to be an
inconsequential drone in a giant cubicle hive. But before you rush
back to your former pasture, make sure you're not just suffering
from the grass-is-greener syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Compile a list of everything you loathed about your old employer
and reflect on whether the problems were related to the small,
entrepreneurial nature of the place. (To keep you honest, talk with
friends who can remind you how you complained while working there.)
</P>
<P>
   Try to assemble as complete a picture as possible of your
personality and work style, advised George Zeller, a senior
employment specialist with Career Moves, a counseling service in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   You may even want to take one of those personality tests
intended to reveal whether you're best equipped to be the chief
financial officer of a multinational corporation, a French teacher
or a zookeeper. But don't expect any big revelations, Zeller
warned. In some ways, these tests just mirror what you already
know.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you might be discovering that you have landed in the
wrong environment for your personality type. I asked Joseph Frey, a
clinical psychologist in Augusta, Ga., for the Highlands Program, a
career development firm, about your case, and he said you sounded
like a ``structural generalist.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``structural'' part of that phrase means that you need a
hands-on type of job. You enjoy having a product that you can feel,
see, or touch at the end of the day. But as a generalist, Frey
said, you also like being part of a team and want a bit of
diversity in your workday.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies are ideal environments for structural
generalists, Frey said, while large, hierarchical firms often force
such folks to choose between their dominant personality traits.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you decide to stay with the larger firm, start planning
your rise from dronedom. According to Zeller, a lot of people just
want to get lost and be invisible, so you need to make it clear
that you are (italics)not(end italics) one of them. Volunteer for
different assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Acquire as many skills and experiences as you can. Maintain a
diary of your accomplishments. After a while, go to the boss and
say, ``For the past few months I did this. I did that. I went to
training and picked up these skills. I helped Sally with that
project. Now I want to take on a new project.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, of course, do not allow such cross-pollination
among departments or positions. In that case, your only option may
be to seek a less-rigid hive.

GETTING UGLY LOOKS GOOD ON `THE PRACTICE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE PRACTICE 
Starring: Dylan McDermott, LisaGay Hamilton, Steve Harris, Camryn
Manheim, Kelli Williams, Lara Flynn Boyle 
On: ABC, Sunday at 10 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I heard Tony Danza was set for a four-episode stint playing
a lawyer on ``The Practice,'' worlds collided. He's the hammy actor
who thinks hyperactivity, flashy white teeth, and a big fat grin
are the keys to comedy. ``The Practice'' is the sharpest drama on
TV, a brilliantly twisty take on the law, lawyers, and the
post-Court TV world sprung from the quirkily wise mind of David E.
Kelley. Surely Danza belongs on Kelley's wackier legal series, the
litigation-happy ``Ally McBeal,'' stunt-casted as one of Ally's
major loser dates?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but Danza and his pearly whites match perfectly with ``The
Practice,'' which is plainly obsessed with the staginess and
amorality of today's courtrooms. As a lawyer of questionable
integrity, he fits right into the show's scrappy Boston atmosphere,
locking horns with the firm of Donnell, Young, Dole &AMP; Frutt, and
particularly with Camryn Manheim's ferocious Frutt, who can be
overheard yelling at him, ``We've got no problem getting ugly.''
Indeed, in the pressure cooker that is ``The Practice,'' just about
everyone has the chance to get ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Danza's visit to ``The Practice,'' which begins Sunday night at
10, coincides with some of its finest episodes so far. The series
started off as a promising midseason replacement in March 1997, but
it has quite exceeded its expectations, thanks mostly to its strong
ensemble of performers and the writers who provide them with scene
after scene of crack dialogue and ethical complexity. You don't
find TV actors much more compelling than Manheim, who makes you
feel every roll of Ellenor Frutt's eyes, and Kelli Williams, whose
explosions in court _ as Lindsay Dole _ walk the line between
petulence and righteousness. With the help of his wide eyes, Dylan
McDermott projects a dark, morally compromised intensity as Bobby
Donnell. (This season, by the way, he seems to have discovered the
razor.) And Lara Flynn Boyle has finally brought a nice reality to
her bottled-up assistant D.A., coldly looking at the pleading
father of a murder victim saying, ``And you are ... ?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice'' has also perfected what many shows _ even
``ER'' _ fumble in the age of Attention Deficit Disorder TV: serial
plot lines that develop over the season. Sunday's episode revives
the tension-packed murder trial of Anderson Pearson, a character
who appeared early in the series as the smug lawyer for a cigarette
company. It also cleverly picks up last week's beheading case, as
the brother of the murdered woman lays a $30 million lawsuit on
Donnell and Co. for falsely accusing him on the stand. This case,
which features Danza as the opposing lawyer, promises to be classic
Kelley, as the lawyers themselves face trial for the questionable
tactics they use in court. It's the kind of plot line you hope for
from a show that strives to be as tough-minded, tenacious, and
theatrical as its best lawyers.

1999 CAMRY SOLARA COUPE: RISK-FREE BALM FOR BOOMERS

 By MICHELLE KREBS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ It was last January at the Detroit auto show, and
Toyota had just pulled the wraps off its Camry Solara. The gleaming
coupe, yet unseen by the public, spun slowly on a turntable.
</P>
<P>
   But a glance over one's shoulder, across the convention center,
found a strikingly similar car rotating on another turntable a
couple of displays away. That coupe, a Honda Accord, was already of
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Given the two cars' close resemblance, from the lines of their
front ends to the flow of sheet metal along their sides, a casual
onlooker could be forgiven for thinking these were two versions of
the same car.
</P>
<P>
   And just as Honda executives had explained their game plan
months before, Toyota officials were saying that coupes, which
commanded a huge share of the American market in the 1960s, but
lost their lead to more practical sedans by the 1980s, could yet
make a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are betting that affluent, aging baby boomers _
their children grown, their nostalgia raging _ are ready to climb
out of four-door cars, mini-vans and even sport utilities, if they
were only offered a dash of style; roomy, comfortable
accommodations, and a reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
   The formula worked for Honda with the Accord coupe and for Acura
with its CL models. Now Toyota has borrowed that recipe for its
1999 Camry Solara. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toyota officials say the Solara (pronounced so-LAHR-uh) will
appeal to baby boomers entering their peak earnings years who are
``nostalgic for the sports car of their youth but need more room
and comfort than a sport car can provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Honda says buyers of the Accord coupe are equally
divided between single people and married couples, between women
and men. Buyers' median age is 46 and median income is a relatively
high $73,000.
</P>
<P>
   Data on initial buyers of the Solara, which went on sale this
fall, will not be available until early next year, but its
demographics are likely to be similar. (Although Toyota's marketing
efforts suggest that the Solara is particularly aimed at women.)
</P>
<P>
   At once sleek and conservative, the Solara is slightly sporty,
but its styling does not break any new ground. Designed at Toyota's
studio in California and built in Cambridge, Ontario, the Solara
has tapered flanks defined by a distinctive crease that runs from
the front fender along the length of the car to a swoopy rear end
with narrow taillamps.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the Solara cabin is more elegant and comfortable than
those of most sporty coupes, befitting the expanding physiques of
aging boomers. The test car, a top-of-the-line SLE _ a less
expensive SE is also available _ was outfitted in attractive beige
and taupe leather.
</P>
<P>
   Clean and uncluttered, the interior was reminiscent of a Camry
sedan, though definitely upgraded. Controls and instruments were
simply and logically laid out, with one glaring exception: The
power control for the outside mirror is on the dash, hidden behind
the steering wheel. Toyota is usually more careful about such
things.
</P>
<P>
   The Solara technically seats five adults, but four will feel
much more comfortable. Rear headroom and legroom are relatively
generous for a coupe. The rear seat splits and folds to expand the
roomy 14.1-cubic-foot trunk.
</P>
<P>
   The lid is also lower, making it friendlier to aching backs than
the Accord coupe, which has a very high liftover because of its
uplifted rear end.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Camry sedan, the Solara can be ordered with a
four-cylinder engine (a 2.2-liter, dual-overhead-cam unit producing
135 horsepower) or a V6 (3 liters, dual-overhead cams, 200
horsepower). The Accord's four-cylinder is more powerful than the
Camry's, but the Honda V6 has less torque). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both engines can be paired with either a four-speed automatic
transmission or a five-speed manual. I usually favor a manual, but
after driving V6-powered Solaras with both, I decided I would opt
for the automatic. The stick shift was notchy and imprecise, and
the clutch was not smooth.
</P>
<P>
   No matter: Few buyers are likely to be bothered with a manual
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Based on its styling, one might expect the Solara to perform in
a somewhat sporty fashion. Yet the looks are deceiving: despite a
suspension tuned to be tighter than the Camry sedan's, and the
availability of a sport package with larger tires and an even
firmer suspension, the Solara's handling is unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   In aggressive driving on curving mountain roads, the Solara felt
nervous and confused. And although the steering has been tuned to
provide more road feel than one gets from the sedan, the Solara
seemed slow to respond to the driver's commands, with a lag between
the turning of the steering wheel and the car's response.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a lot of Solara buyers will not notice. Target
customers are unlikely to be aggressive drivers; indeed, many will
be moving out of Camry sedans that handle similarly. And like the
Camrys they traded in, the Solara provides a comfortable, quiet
ride.
</P>
<P>
   It is well-suited to crosstown travel and downright comforting
in highway cruising. The excellent V6 has plenty of pep.
</P>
<P>
   The level of quality in the Solara is predictable as well. The
overall fit and finish are as close to perfection as any
manufacturer achieves. You can bet that reliability will be superb,
as it is with all Toyotas.
</P>
<P>
   Prices start at $19,000, with standard features like a cruise
control and power windows, locks and mirrors. The premium SLE, at
$25,408, has the V6, antilock brakes, leather trim, power driver's
seat, automatic climate control, a Homelink transmitter for garage
doors and security gates, keyless entry, a security system and a
200-watt stereo with cassette and CD players. Options include side
air bags up front.
</P>
<P>
   The price range, which tops out at $27,000, is close to the
Accord's. And in nearly every other way, the two cars' hardware is
so similar that a shopper could make a choice on ``software'':
brand loyalty, dealer preference, even the feel of the seats. Both
are safe bets, offering a little style and a dab of sport without
sacrificing comfort or room.

GETTING ANAGLYPH DOWN TO PLASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 15, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have several ceiling medallions in my Victorian house, made
of plaster and nice looking. They have been painted a million
times, and now I wonder how I can remove all that paint to reveal
the attractive detail.
</P>
<P>
   MARGARET SANFILIPPO, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The medallions are called anaglyphs (from the Greek words to
carve), and they are indeed handsome. Remove the paint with
chemical paint remover. Apply the remover, wait 15 minutes, and
scrape off bubbling paint with a narrow putty knife. Repeat as
necessary. Use a putty knife with rounded corners to prevent
gouging the plaster, which will be unaffected by the remover. As
you remove more layers of paint, you can apply one last coat and
rub it off with coarse steel wool. Use lots of ventilation when
working with the remover. Standard removers are good but toxic and
caustic; Citristrip, a citrus-based remover, is milder but possibly
slower working. Don't use a hot-air gun; it is a fire hazard
indoors and does not work well on plaster.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The silicone caulk on my tub, where the tub meets the tub
surround, has turned black, and nothing seems to clean it up.
Bleach does nothing. How can I clean it up and keep it clean?
</P>
<P>
   SHIRLEY MOFFAT, Everett, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Caulking is a modern way of filling such joints; someone got
the brilliant idea of using caulking instead of grout, which is the
``old-fashioned'' way used years ago, and, frankly, grout is stil
the better way to go. That black may be mildew, but it is in the
caulking, not on top of it, so bleach does not lighten it. If the
silicone is paintable, paint it with an oil-based, indoor-outdoor
enamel.
</P>
<P>
   If the joint is between tub and tile, you are better off taking
that caulking out completely and inserting grout, which is like
mortar, and the stuff that is between the tiles. It will fill the
space neatly and if it gets dirty or mildewy, you can clean it with
bleach. If the joint is between tub and a fiberglass or other
non-tile surround, you have to stick with caulking.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I bought a house in Concord, Vt., I pulled off a lot of
the wallpaper, planning to paint. The paper came off without a
hitch; I just grabbed a corner and pulled. But the backing stayed.
How can I take that off before painting? The house was built in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   MARY LAMBERT, Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A house of that vintage has plasterboard walls, which make it
difficult to remove anything without gouging the plasterboard
paper. If the backer paper is tight on the wall, you could paint
it, and the paint may fill the seams; at least the seams will be
disguised. Apply one coat of enamel undercoater and finish off with
a latex wall paint.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to try to take off the backer paper, use a
minimum of water. A rented steamer will do, but try this first: Use
E-Z Gell walpaper remover, a gel that sticks tenaciously to the
walls to allow easy scraping, using as little water as possible. It
is sold in wallpaper shops; if you can't find it call the
manufacturer, Roman Adhesives of Calumet City, Ill., at
800-488-6117 for a place near you.

   Rising damp rears its ugly head again, and thereby hangs a small
controversy. What is rising damp? It's moisture in the cellar,
coming up through the concrete floor. It can decay bricks at the
bottom of the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   A caller told the handyman that the bricks at the bottom of his
chimney in the basement were deteriorating badly, and wanted to
know how prevednt further deterioration. The handyman suggested
building a wall of concrete all the way around the chimney, at
least to keep the chimney from collapsing, which it could do
eventually without support.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good, our friend Allen Hill of Winchester, Mass.,
but that is only a temporary cure. Hill is a restoration architect
who specializes in old houses.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a concrete wall around the chimney will only cause the
rising damp to go farther up the chimney, above the concrete wall,
said Hill. Then you will get the deterioration higher up the
chimney. If the deterioation is left to continue, the chimney could
collapse, he added. It would take a long time for this to happen,
Hill said, but it would eventually.
</P>
<P>
   The ony cure, Hill said, is to rebuild the bottom of the
chimney, either by shoring up the chimney and removing all brick
and installing new brick, or by replacing one brick at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Good point, Allen Hill, and as usual, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, where is this rising damp coming from? It is
coming up through the concrete floor, or at the base of the
chimney, from the ground below.
</P>
<P>
   You can't stop this migration of moisture, but you can dissipate
some or all of it by ventilating the basement. Keep windows and
doors open for cross-ventilation from April to October. If you
don't have any vents or windows to open, or not enough, put some
in. Ventilation is your only practical choice. And it is a good one
because it costs nothing.

 FINDING HER STAGE IN THE COSTUME RACKS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't fear that made Suzy Benzinger pass out on stage 26
years ago, during her high school's production of ``Fiddler on the
Roof'' in Orchard Park, N.Y., a Buffalo suburb. It was exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was she acting in the play and running the box office,
but she had designed the sets and posters and, with a teacher, sewn
the costumes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lesson for a teen-ager intent on a career in the
theater: You can't do it all.
</P>
<P>
   There were more false starts before she learned to channel her
ambition toward what came naturally _ costume design _ and years of
work before she hit the big time designing costumes in 1991 for the
Broadway musical ``Miss Saigon'' and later for three Woody Allen
films, most recently ``Celebrity,'' with Kenneth Branagh and Judy
Davis, which opens in theaters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, she often entered talent contests but never won.
``But I always had the best costumes,'' she said. ``Lots of
crinolines.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State University of New York at Stony Brook on Long
Island, she told the chairman of the theater department she wanted
to be a director. ``He told me to be something else,'' Ms.
Benzinger said. ``He offered to put me in charge of the costume
department.''
</P>
<P>
   The same professor also instilled pragmatism. In one class, she
said, he distributed a map of Broadway theaters that pinpointed all
the neighborhood delis, so students would know where to order
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   After a fight with her college boyfriend, Ms. Benzinger dropped
out of school in 1978, a few months shy of graduation, hoping to
get a job at the Studio Arena Theater, a professional house in
Buffalo. Told there were no openings, she decided to apply Woody
Allen's maxim that 80 percent of success is showing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Studio Arena and said I was there for the work-study
program, even though I knew they didn't have one,'' she recalled.
``Fortunately, someone in the costume shop had quit that morning,
and they assumed I'd been sent as his replacement.''
</P>
<P>
   The job paid only $50 a week but was rewarding in other ways.
``One week I was coffee girl for Tennessee Williams,'' she said.
``The producer warned me not to let him out of the building before
lunch or else we'd never see him again.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of that season, Ms. Benzinger had done shows with
famous costume designers like Theoni V. Aldredge, Florence Klotz
and Jane Greenwood.
</P>
<P>
   After the final curtain in Buffalo, Ms. Benzinger would finally
get to the Great White Way. Ms. Greenwood secured her a job at the
Brooks Van Horn Costume Co. in Manhattan, where she worked as a
shopper _ gathering materials for costume designers _ at the regal
salary of $109 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Ms. Aldredge hired her as an assistant, at $500
a week. Over the next decade, Ms. Benzinger worked with Ms.
Aldredge on shows like ``Dreamgirls,'' ``Annie 2,'' ``Gypsy,''
``Merlin,'' ``Chess'' and ``Blithe Spirit,'' as well as on the Tony
Award-winning costume designs for ``42nd Street'' and ``La Cage aux
Folles.''
</P>
<P>
   Just mentioning the ``Blithe Spirit'' revival, starring Richard
Chamberlain and Geraldine Page, makes Ms. Benzinger cringe. ``I
ruined my feet because of Geraldine Page,'' she recalled. ``It was
midnight and there weren't any shoemakers open, and Geraldine's
boots had to be stretched by morning. I soaked athletic socks in
alcohol, put them on my feet and then laced the boots up very
tightly and slept in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Costume design can demand other spontaneous acts of creativity.
On the set of ``Ghostbusters,'' one of a few movies that Ms.
Benzinger and Ms. Aldredge worked on, the director gave Ms.
Benzinger an hour to produce weathered-looking leather jackets. ``I
went down to Eighth Street and bought them right off people's
backs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benzinger set out on her own in 1991 and soon got her big
break. Cameron Mackintosh, the producer, had liked her work on
other shows and asked her to design costumes for ``Miss Saigon.''
She would receive design credit, a fee and royalties for as long as
the musical ran. (It's still running.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Saigon'' made her enough money to buy a spacious loft in
TriBeCa but was no guarantee of future success. Her next job was
designing costumes for ``Ain't Broadway Grand,'' which turned out
to be anything but. It closed after two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was just as well. ``I was totally drained,'' she
said. ``When you work on a show, it's 24-hour days, seven days a
week. You have no life.''
</P>
<P>
   To get away from it all, she volunteered to assist her
brother-in-law, a veterinarian in the Park Slope section of
Brooklyn. ``I loved it,'' she said. ``The day had a beginning and
an end. And I didn't have a director or choreographer coming up to
me and saying, `I really think that the dog should look like this.'
''
</P>
<P>
   But she would be gone before the end of tick season. The
production designer Santo Loquasto tracked her down as she was
organizing heartworm vaccinations and invited her to meet with
Allen to design costumes for ``Deconstructing Harry.'' That led to
the jobs on the other Allen films.
</P>
<P>
   She spent last summer designing costumes for the musical
``Mirette'' at the not-for-profit Goodspeed Opera House in East
Haddam, Conn. She acknowledged that her pay of $5,000 didn't even
cover expenses, but said she couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give me the freedom to design whatever I want,'' she
said, adding with a laugh, ``It's an investment in restoring my
sanity after doing movies or a Broadway show.''

IN THIS FILM'S CASE, SILENCE WOULD BE HOLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS 
Written by: Harris Goldberg and Tom Nursall 
Directed by: Arlene Sanford 
Starring: Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Jessica Biel, Gary Cole, Adam
Lavorgna 
Running time: 88 minutes 
Rated: PG (some crude humor) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Certainly, no one expects new Christmas films to be as
eternally delightful as ``It's a Wonderful Life'' or as wickedly
funny as ``A Christmas Story.'' Let's face it, most of the folks
who make films these days just aren't that talented. But is there
any excuse for a holiday film as utterly devoid of charm as ``I'll
Be Home for Christmas''?
</P>
<P>
   How hard can it be to make a decent Christmas movie?
Unbelievably difficult if this terrible little movie is any
indication. The shockingly uncharismatic Jonathan Taylor Thomas of
TV's ``Home Improvement'' stars as Jake, the resident scam artist
at Palisades College in California. He has no plans to spend
Christmas with his family back in New York, preferring to spend his
break in Cabo San Lucas with his girlfriend, Allie (Jessica Biel).
But his father (a slumming Gary Cole) wants his boy home, so he
makes Jake a deal: if he arrives by 6 p.m. Christmas Eve, he'll get
his father's prized lovingly restored 1957 Porsche. Along with
mistletoe and chestnuts roasting on an open fire, bribery just
makes for a fine holiday tradition, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, when one of his schemes _ helping jocks cheat on exams _
gets derailed, the muscle heads, with the help of his rival Eddie
(Adam Lavorgna), kidnap Jake, dress him in full Santa regalia, and
dump in the desert. Jake then tries to hitchhike his way home so he
can drink eggnog, sing carols, and get his greedy little hands on
that engine-red Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line, we're all supposed to be moved as Jake
transforms from self-centered jerk to someone who comes to
understand the true meaning of Christmas. That's an awful lot to
ask, considering the wheels come off this sorry wagon within the
first 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has obviously (and unfortunately) spent far too much time
hanging around his ``Home Improvement'' co-star Tim Allen. Copping
every expression, gesture, and line delivery, Thomas isn't so much
acting as he is channeling Allen, who made ``The Santa Clause,''
his own vaguely amusing Christmas film, a few years back. Thomas
doesn't get much help from Arlene Sanford's tired direction nor the
feeble script from Harris Goldberg and Tom Nursall.
</P>
<P>
   Forget ``ho-ho-ho.'' This film is a no-no-no. ``I'll Be Home for
Christmas'' doesn't make you want to deck the halls so much as deck
those responsible for it.

TRICKS FOR VARYING THE PAY TO MOTIVATE THE RANKS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill.)  (af) 
 By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Employee incentive plans are not just for motivating top
executives any more, a new survey has found; they are spreading to
cover workers on lower rungs of the organizational ladder. But that
doesn't necessarily mean that the plans are working.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 159 companies, more than a third of them in the
Fortune 500, found that 72 percent now have variable pay plans, up
from 47 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Such plans may involve cash awards or gifts for individual or
team performance on specific tasks, or benefits like profit-sharing
or stock ownership that spread the wealth from companywide success
to employees at many levels.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen percent of the companies surveyed said they planned to
expand their plans to include more employees in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   But only 22 percent of the companies surveyed said their plans
had helped them achieve all of their business objectives; 28
percent said their plans had achieved none of them.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   According to Ken Abosch, a consultant at Hewitt Associates, the
Chicago-based firm that conducted the survey, plans may fail to
deliver on their intended goals because employees are not told
enough about them and are not kept up to date on the plans'
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-nine percent of companies that regularly communicated
with employees said their plans had met their goals, versus only 57
percent of companies that did not discuss them regularly.
</P>
<P>
   There are five keys to a successful plan, Abosch said:
</P>
<P>
   _ Goals that are clear and are fully supported by management.
</P>
<P>
   _ Goals that are realistic _ not too difficult or too easy to
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   _ Regular communication with employees about the plan. ``People
want a scorecard,'' Abosch said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Simplicity. ``It has to pass the elevator test,'' he said.
``Can you explain it on an elevator ride?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Consistency with the company's current goals. ``There are very
few organizations that have the same business objective for five to
seven years,'' Abosch said.
</P>
<P>
   As for pitfalls, Abosch listed two: too little oversight and
poor plan design. ``The striking thing is the number of companies
that don't monitor their plans closely,'' said Abosch, adding that
plans often pay out even when business results do not warrant it.

THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY OF MARY BAKER EDDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biographies and histories can tell great stories. But, in some
cases, the story of writing the book is as interesting as the work
itself. I once happened upon a slender volume called ``Looking for
Steinbeck's Ghost,'' published by the University of Oklahoma Press
in 1988. In it, Steinbeck biographer Jackson Benson discusses the
research that led to his 1990 book, ``The True Adventures of John
Steinbeck, Writer.'' It's a fascinating story.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there is quite a tale behind Bedford writer Gillian
Gill's eight-year struggle to publish her biography of Mary Baker
Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science Church. Eddy, one of the
most successful female entrepreneurs of the 19th century, led a
tumultuous life, scarred by personal tragedies and near-constant
litigation. The church is extraordinarily protective of her image
and has even expressed displeasure with a generally flattering
three-volume biography by the late Robert Peel, a church official.
(Unlike Peel, Gill is not a Christian Scientist. Although admiring
of Eddy, her book is not hagiographic.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Gill and her lawyer began negotiating for access to
church archives. The church relaxed its demand for veto power over
the book only when Virginia Harris, appointed chairman of the board
in March 1992, intervened. But that was just the start. Like the
KGB, the Christian Science church doesn't offer outsiders an index
of its holdings. So, to procure a document, you must first know it
exists and how to identify it.
</P>
<P>
   The church even mounted its own small-scale intelligence
operation against Gill, who is best known as the biographer of
Agatha Christie. In 1994, two staffers from the church's legal
department managed to crash an informal members-only talk Gill gave
at the Union Club and took copious notes during her presentation.
Given that Gill and her lawyer were then negotiating for access to
church archives, she describes the ``unheralded presence of these
women (as) a breach both of club etiquette and, as I was later
informed, of legal practice.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Gill how the book has been received by Christian
Scientists. ``On the one hand, they have to make it clear that my
view of Mrs. Eddy is not the right one. On the other hand, they
feel that I can make Mrs. Eddy interesting to a larger audience,
and that could work for them.'' A talk she was slated to give at
the Mother Church last month was canceled. Gill thinks The
Christian Science Monitor's review of her book, by former church
director Richard Bergenheim, was a bit rough. ``On the official
level, there is deep ambivalence.,'' she says. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon has been bombarding us with
press releases about its little war with Bowdoin and Colby
Colleges, which have shut down fraternities on campus. But I
couldn't care less. I want to know about their ridiculous ``Mount
Dekemore'' logo and about the prospects for yet another American
president hailing from the frat that partially inspired Hollywood's
immortal tribute to higher education: ``Animal House.''
</P>
<P>
   The 155-year-old frat, which was founded at Yale (of course) and
is generally known as ``Deke,'' has designed a ``Mount Dekemore''
logo depicting all the US presidents who were members. What a
distinguished crew! Rutherford B. Hayes, Teddy Roosevelt, Gerald
Ford, and George Bush. There would have been five faces on
``Dekemore'' if Dan Quayle had made it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Deke's very cheery national spokesman, David Easlick, boasts
that the frat is taking over America. Speaker-presumptive of the
House Robert Livingston pledged Deke, as did president-in-waiting
George Bush Jr., now cooling his heels as governor of Texas. Isn't
Deke just for morons who drink all day and blow off classes? ``We
have that reputation, but it's more than that,'' Easlick assures
me. Isn't that what Bush Jr. seems to have done at his father's
alma mater, the World's Second Greatest University? Easlick:
``Sounds like he might have, because every time you turn around,
he's apologizing for something in his past.''

A MEATY APPROACH TO `CANNIBAL: THE MUSICAL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALLAN ULRICH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Andrew Lloyd Webber, eat your heart out. On
second thought, let Alferd Packer do it for you, and he'll munch on
your liver and spleen at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Packer is the wrongly accused flesh-eating hero of Troma Team's
first, honest-to-badness lyric extravaganza, ``Cannibal: The
Musical.''
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Evita'' flopped on the screen and ``Phantom of the
Opera'' is stalled somewhere, director/writer/composer/star Trey
Parker has forged ahead with an all-singing, all-dancing,
all-chomping tribute to the palmy days of MGM. It's finger-licking
good, a tasty 90 minutes of yummy production numbers and intense
spiritual crises.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought the movie musical was dead? Naah, it just went
back to the buffet table for seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Is cannibalism not a fit subject for musicalization? Well, some
years ago, an opera based on the Donner Party saga hit the stage in
San Francisco; those folks were serious, and the results were
terrible.
</P>
<P>
   But Troma, no stranger to cheesy sendups of genre pictures,
gives you both a feast of brilliant parody episodes, the leavening
(or the sorbet course, if you wish) and production numbers to
congeal the blood in a vegan's veins.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Troma is merely releasing the movie, which was
conceived and produced independently by the zany Parker, long
before he hit it big as co-creator of television's ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously shown on cable and released on commercial video,
``Cannibal: The Musical'' was simply too big and too delicious for
the tube. Hacked limbs and bloody viscera register so much better
on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's been touted as a midnight cult film elsewhere,
Troma obviously feels San Francisco has enough foodies to support a
regular engagement at the Lumiere.
</P>
<P>
   Packer, apparently, was a real gold prospector in the 1870s, the
only American ever convicted of cannibalism in this country. From
this historical factoid, Parker (who portrays the protagonist under
the name Juan Schwartz), has conjured an epic of Old West justice
centering around an average guy and his faithful horse, and what
happens when he leads a gold prospecting team into the Rockies and
alone survives to tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the prospectors are stranded in the wintry wilds and
the snow is soon stained red. That's what happens when one of your
group is a butcher by profession.
</P>
<P>
   Plot counts less than artful burlesque. Parker lards the movie
with takeoffs on Rodgers and Hammerstein in their ``Oklahoma!''
period, as his hero rides through the landscape, singing that ``my
heart is as full as a baked potato.''
</P>
<P>
   He bastes his narrative with cunning facsimiles of those Agnes
de Mille dream ballets. And he spices his tale with a frontier
production number, ``Hang the bastard,'' that might give Michael
Kidd indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp-eyed Parker has some fun, too, at the expense of
post-dubbing in musicals, at slain horror movie victims who won't
stay dead and at Hollywood's habit of casting native Americans with
any actors who look vaguely Asian, a gag worthy of Mel Brooks in
his prime.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, ``Cannibal: The Musical'' seems a bit overextended;
the soppy ballad delivered by the newspaper reporter who believes
in the hero's innocence doesn't make it even as bogus R &AMP; H. But it
will take a truly jaded soul to push away from the table before
this often hilarious meal is over. Bon appetit!

<P>
   During a lunch break at work this summer, Allen Crane tapped
into the Internet on his desktop computer, looking for life
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Within half an hour, Crane, a recently married computer
programmer in Fort Worth, had looked at prices from a couple dozen
companies. Later, he talked with his wife, Laura, and then, on
another lunch break, went back to an Internet site called
Quickquote and bought a $500,000 policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked being able to comparison-shop,'' Crane said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet shopping is booming these days, and shares in companies
like Amazon.com, which peddles books, and Ebay, an online auction
service, are surging. But it is not just books, collectibles and
electronic gear that are popping up on computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   As Crane's experience shows, more and more people are searching
the Internet for good deals in insurance as well. Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass., says it expects Internet insurance
sales to approach $155 million this year and to soar to $4 billion
within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when insurance sales were just beginning on the
Internet, about the only kind you could buy was term life, the
least complicated form of life insurance. But now, several Internet
distributors are offering auto insurance _ listing various
companies' offerings on a single Web site _ and some have added
homeowners', health and disability policies, too.
</P>
<P>
   The pricing of auto insurance, with its many variables, is
difficult to translate over the Internet. But because it is
mandatory in almost every state, it holds the most potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty million households have to buy or renew auto insurance
each year,'' said Linda Maurer, a spokeswoman for Insweb, an
Internet distributor in Redwood City, Calif., that is betting
heavily on auto insurance. ``About four million people buy term
life.''
</P>
<P>
   For most people, shopping for insurance is not quite as onerous
as major surgery. But it is a long way down the pleasure list from
planning a vacation in the tropics. Many customers say they just
want to see what is available, know how much it will cost, make
decisions and pay.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Internet can handle most of those desires for
comparison-shopping. Closing the deals is another matter _ few can
actually be completed on line. And most companies still refuse to
lop off the commissions they would otherwise pay an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Information on life insurance seems to be easiest to come by.
Customers can peruse a wide range off offerings and choose coverage
with the click of a mouse. But customers must sign and return an
application, and the policies generally will not take effect
without a visit from a paramedic who takes blood and urine samples
and checks blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   For other insurance, distributors are not yet able to do more
than provide a handful of prices. Shoppers often have to wait to
get prices in a return e-mail or telephone call from an agent. Even
so, some people say the Internet saves them time and money.
</P>
<P>
   In about an hour, Shirley Mathews, a retired commercial
insurance administrator in Cincinnati, lined up full coverage for
the three cars that she and her 28-year-old son drive. She got a
price of $1,400 a year, $300 less than for her current policy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mathews is an experienced Web surfer. But it still took a
while to find a distributor _ in her case, Insweb.com. Punch in the
words ``life insurance'' or ``auto insurance'' and hundreds of
Internet sites will pop up, representing individual companies or
agents, distributors with multiple listings and billboards. Without
an Internet address from an article or an advertisement, there is
little alternative to trial and error.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the biggest problems with the Internet,'' said
Dan Wager, an insurance agent who runs Quickquote in Incline
Village, Nev., which provides prices for 28 companies. ``But it's
still a lot better than going through endless interviews with
agents who typically represent only one or two companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Laurence, the chairman of Itech Automated Life Insurance
Quotation Systems in Point Richmond, Calif., which sells policies
from 60 companies through a combination of the Internet and agents,
warns that shopping for life insurance by computer is not without
pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   People with medical conditions like high blood pressure, for
example, are apt to apply for the lowest-priced coverage, then,
when they are turned down, accept a more expensive policy from the
same company even though better deals may be available elsewhere.
An agent, Laurence said, could help these customers find
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Another company that combines research on the computer with an
agent's advice, Answer Financial Inc. in Los Angeles, sells
exclusively through workplace groups. It offers life, auto and
homeowners' insurance from 55 companies.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, agents can be helpful. But Jay Angoff, a former
Missouri insurance commissioner, cautioned that agents will be
agents, however well-intentioned. ``The legal duty of the agent to
the customer is very, very minimal,'' he said. ``The agent does not
have a duty to inform the customer about other coverage that is
available or that might be beneficial. The agent is the company's
agent and not the customer's agent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, of course, is hardly going to make agents
disappear. Steven Aldrich, the president of Quicken Insure Market
in Alexandria, Va., sees a combination of machines and agents well
into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``About a third of the people are going to be very comfortable
buying online, without any human contact,'' said Aldrich, whose
company is owned by Intuit Inc., the financial software concern.
``Others are going to be happy to finish up with a telephone
conversation. And another third are going to use the Internet to
find an agent who will walk them through the entire process.''

I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER 
Directed by: Danny Cannon 
Written by: Trey Callaway 
Starring: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy Norwood, Mekhi Phifer,
Matthew Settle, Freddie Prinze Jr., Muse Watson 
Running time: 96 minutes 
Rated: R (gory violence, drug use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, Alex, I'll take ``Stupid Teen Slasher Movies'' for $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is, `I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. What is one of the more asinine and inane sequels of
recent memory?
</P>
<P>
   When ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' became a sleeper hit
last year, it was inevitable that there would be yet another movie
with dopey teenagers hightailing it from a testy hit-and-run
victim, with _ quite literally _ a nasty right hook. The original
wasn't great, but compared with this dull-witted sequel, the 1997
film is as thrilling as ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Love Hewitt returns as Julie, one of the few survivors
from last year's slice-and-dice. She's now a college student in
Boston, but can't quite shake her memories of Ben Willis (Muse
Watson), the guy whose body she, her boyfriend Ray (Freddie Prinze
Jr.), and two friends dumped in the river after accidentally
running him down. The problem is Ol' Ben didn't die, and he's spent
a great deal of time wiping out her friends.
</P>
<P>
   She's so haunted by thoughts of Ben, she carried pepper spray,
triple-locks her doors, and sleeps with a knife next to her bed.
What she needs is a getaway _ which conveniently arrives when her
roommate Karla (Brandy Norwood) wins tickets for four to a Bahamas
resort. And it just so happens to be the July Fourth weekend, the
anniversary of all that messy business with Ben. So off Julie goes
with Karla, Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), Karla's very horny boyfriend,
and Will (Matthew Settle), a much-too-earnest young man who has the
hots for Julie. She's still faithful to Ray, although she's
unwilling to return to her home in Southport, N.C., fearing Ben
will waiting for her.
</P>
<P>
   When the quartet arrives in the Bahamas, they learn it is the
last day of the tourist season, but the beginning of the annual
storms. The resort is pretty much deserted except for a few
workers, and not-so-gentle Ben, who somehow got his trusty hook
through airport security to join his pals in the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   Ben, who's still stumbling about in that drab fisherman's
ensemble (perhaps something more fashionable would cheer him up),
works the body count into double digits. In fact, he can do so many
things with that hook, he deserves his own infomercial. Instead of
just handling his business with Julie, and catching the red-eye
back to the mainland, he takes out everyone on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other contemporary horror films, ``I Still Know''
heaps on the gore and fake blood where true suspense and tension
would have been more effective. Maybe things would have fared
better if horrormeister Kevin Williamson, who wrote the original
and both ``Scream'' films, had been in on this one. Instead, Trey
Calloway serves up a trite script, whose main objective is to get
from one graphic murder to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the acting is adequate, but really, how many thespian
muscles are you flexing when all you have to do is run, duck, and
scream? After only two outings, this ``Summer'' series is showing
its age. Perhaps it's time to give this would-be franchise itself
the hook.

THE BOOT FOR NEWT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Hurricane Newt, downgraded to a tropical storm, is
blowing himself out. Speaker Gingrich was bad news for American
politics, bad news for the Republican Party, and bad news for a
civil society.
</P>
<P>
   With a troubling combination of intellect, aggression, a
take-no-prisoners hostility to his enemies, and a self-destructive
streak like none other, this brilliant, brawling, bellicose bully
has been blackjacked by the very mini-Newts he spawned. It was his
cunning and his oratory which crafted the Republican takeover of
Congress just four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Vandals and the Goths falling on the carcass of the
Roman Empire, Newt and his outriders were better at combat than
running the country they took over. The most confrontational
national figure since George Wallace, he may have eclipsed the
former segregationist governor of Alabama as the most divisive
American politician since Senator Joe McCarthy, the red-baiting
terror of the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   He was the architect of the Republican Revolution of '94, and
the bomb-tosser who ultimately chose to walk the plank before his
Republican crewmen tossed him over the side. Four years is all he
lasted: life as high school. Over and done. Sign my yearbook, see
you later, have a nice life.
</P>
<P>
   Politics can be cruel and callous. And that was just how Newt
played it. His face, with the jowly scowl, the mean eyes, the mouth
that sneered and denigrated liberals, the white-thatched dome that
covered the most fertile brain in present American politics, became
symbols too dangerous for his party to sustain. His own henchmen
determined that all they'd gained under Gingrich four years ago was
lost if they kept him around.
</P>
<P>
   The man who did more to poison the well of contemporary
political practice than any other was ditched by the gang he rode
in with. ``Churchillian,'' his former followers called him, voicing
one more feeble attempt to flatter the man they'd just shoved out
of the fuselage without his parachute. ``Cromwellian'' is more like
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Winston knew you cannot lead a great nation by deriding the
opposition as traitorous. In the '94 campaign, Newt's political
machine, GOPAC, sent GOP House candidates a list of nasty words to
use on Democrats. ``Traitor'' was one; ``sick,'' ``pathetic,''
``insecure,'' ``bizarre,'' ``permissive,'' ``radical'' were others.
</P>
<P>
   GOPAC's cover letter was directed to candidates who said, ``I
wish I could speak like Newt.'' The 133 negative words for
Democrats should be repeated frequently, said GOPAC. ``Read them.
Memorize as many as possible.'' When the press got questioned the
use of the word ``traitor'' to describe Democratic candidates, the
GOPAC director, Kay Riddle, temporized. ```Traitor' was
inadvertently used. It was in no way meant to imply patriotism or
lack of patriotism. When we do use it, we would mean it more as
traitor to the district, someone elected as a moderate who became a
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   See? To be a liberal is to be a traitor; Newt was very fond of
splashing the napalm about. Perhaps his lowest stunt was to seize
upon the heinous murder of two young boys by a deranged mother.
``The mother killing her two children in South Carolina vividly
reminds every American how sick the society is getting and how much
we have to have change,'' Gingrich said. ``And the only way you get
change is to vote Republican.'' Democrats, he said piously, had
destroyed the American family.
</P>
<P>
   How low could Newt go? As low as it took. He became the
not-very-pretty face of the resurgent GOP and its
our-way-or-the-highway right-wing majority, rampant in the Sun Belt
and the heartland. His New Age nostrums, honed in endless
chicken-dinner speeches to conservatives desperate to be reassured,
helped him mesmerize the disorganized Republicans of the heartland.
He was Barney Rubble with a laptop, Primitive Political Man
carrying the millionaires' blessing and a set of brass knuckles for
close-in work on the Democrats. Newt married the Christian
Coalition, a Republican front which hijacked the label of western
civilization's dominant religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   Newt was not just the brains, but often the fist of these
muscular in-your-kisser right-wingers, who wanted to chop
government and make government more stingy to all but the worthy,
i.e., the voting blocs who greased the GOP's PACs. He led a
takeover of mammoth proportions, making astonishing gains in
virtually privatizing government for insurance companies who wanted
no national health insurance, telecommunications barons who wanted
no limit on their reach into consumers' pockets, oil and timber and
cattle and agricultural fief-holders who wanted no brake on their
pillaging of public lands. Newt was their guy. Remember the $4.5
million ``book contract'' Rupert Murdoch tried to slip him on the
eve of the telecommunications giveaway? If you got to Newt, you
didn't need anyone else to co-opt Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Newt snuck a $50 billion tax break for the Lords of Tobacco into
the failed tobacco bill. But his own backbenchers ultimately choked
on his 4,000-page budget deal that proved too porky for
conservatives to swallow. In the end, even his own gang turned on
him, the ultimate fate of a bully.

EVEN WOMEN VOTERS SPURN EQUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE -- Anne Symonds sees the dagger coming at her
engineering business. She winces not so much because she must get
ready for the wound. Women in the male-dominated field of
engineering are used to discomfort. Her pain comes from who threw
the knife.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew that white men would firmly support Initiative 200
to kill state-sponsored affirmative action in Washington state.
Everyone knew that African-Americans and Latino men and women, what
few there are here, would overwhelmingly oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   No one was quite sure what white women would do. In early
October, I-200 had a 20 point lead in the polls. But as white women
listened to debates and counterattack ads reminding them that they
have been the biggest beneficiaries of affirmative action in a
state that is 84 percent white, the gap narrowed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ali, senior vice president of Mason/Dixon Political
Research, said, ``On Election Day, the majority of women are going
to vote against this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day, white women chose to support I-200 by 51-49
percent. With 66 percent of white men voting for the initiative, it
easily passed, 58-42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Symonds, 46, runs a water works and waste water engineering firm
in Seattle and Portland with 42 employees. Almost $3 million of the
$3.8 million in contracts that her company earned last year came
through affirmative action programs. With the passage of I-200, she
expects to lose out on contracts and have to let go of workers.
There are still too many men in engineering who make life
uncomfortable and unfair for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that women have made tremendous
progress,'' Symonds said. ``That may make women look around them
and see that there no longer are any major barriers for them. That
would be wonderful if it's true. But even with the progress we have
made, I wonder how many women can honestly say they have achieved
such power that we don't need affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every woman saw power like I do, they might see it
differently. When I bid on contracts and have to negotiate, I see
who is on corporate boards. I see who the CEOs are. I see who makes
the final decisions. It's still almost all men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the past year, I had a top man at a state agency tell
me that my company didn't get a job because women engineers were
seen as too feminine or that they were too aggressive. I was told,
`You're never going to get jobs like this because we always deal
with that other company.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It burns me up when women tell me that affirmative action is a
handout. Firms run by women get 3 percent of state contracts. I
don't consider that a handout. And I don't think we're going to get
even that without affirmative action programs, no matter how
competitive our bids are. The old boy network is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally dismayed is Cathy Allen, a local political consultant
and the national vice president of the National Women's Political
Caucus. When California ended state-run affirmative action two
years ago with the passage of Proposition 209, 58 percent of white
women voted for passage, joining the 66 percent of white men who
voted for it and turning their backs on people of color.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the vote for I-200 was ironic, considering that last
week's elections give Washington a legislature that will be 39
percent women. The state senate will be 45 percent women and the
house will be 37 percent women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women get elected in record numbers, and then they go ahead
and kill the best tool we ever had to level the playing field,''
Allen said. ``Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think two things are happening. One is that almost every
white woman has had a husband, boyfriend, brother, or son gripe
about losing a job or a promotion to a black person. It gets to the
point where women themselves talk this ancedote to death and to the
point where it becomes institutional memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the economy's good. We voted to raise the minimum wage,
and that will help far more women than men. When everyone knows a
white male who's alleged reverse discrimination, it's easier to
believe in a good economy than affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Symonds is preparing for an immediate slowdown. When the Port of
Tacoma put aside affirmative action in 1992 to try a more voluntary
program of considering bids from companies run by women and people
of color, the percentage of such companies that won contracts
dropped from 20 percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been 20 years since the days of separate
construction job lists for men and women,'' Symonds said. ``It's a
lot better today, but when it comes down to who gets these high
priced contracts, there are still too many men who will not take us
as seriously as they do other men, unless they are required to.''

SAW DOCTORS RISE WITH THE `SUN' 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It's a good bet that you won't hear the Saw Doctors, a band that
hails from County Galway in Ireland, on commercial radio, spot them
on MTV or VH1, or read about them in a glossy, or for that matter
underground, rock magazine. Neither will you see them at the
Paradise tonight ... if you don't have a ticket now, that is. The
show sold out on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of our audience has built up by word of mouth,''
explains singer-guitarist Leo Moran. ``People telling people about
the album. And, of course, we have been touring for the last couple
of years pretty intensively. It's broadened out wonderfully for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a good chunk of their audience comes from Irish-in-America
community, but it has moved beyond that as well, owing in part to
their participation in the Guinness Fleadh, a New York-based
festival of Irish bands and roots-oriented rockers. The Saw Doctors
are both of those, although the overt Celtic influences are fewer
now than they've ever been.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely true,'' says Moran, ``but, also, people tend
to think we were more influenced earlier on, whereas we were really
fans of rock 'n' roll, pop, and punk with a touch of Irishishness,
only a hint really.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saw Doctors, which are co-fronted by singer-guitarist Davy
Carton, began 11 years ago and have been playing clubs in the
United States since 1991 _ their local debut at the now-defunct
Channel was a smash _ but the recently released ``Songs From Sun
Street'' CD (on Paradigm) is their first US release of new
material. (``Sing a Powerful Song,'' a best-of compilation culled
from their first three albums, came out last year.) For the last
few years, the Saw Doctors wrestled with the dual realities of
commercial success in their native country _ or ``above the poverty
line,'' as Moran puts it _ and frustration because their discs were
next-to-impossible to find in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a Globe interview three years ago, Moran said the Saw Doctors
got comments from record company executives such as ``I think
you're great lads, but I don't know how we could market it.'' Moran
would respond: ``It's just music, just a load of songs. ... We're
making pop music.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Moran says, ``Paradigm were interested in us and came
to see us at the Fleadh and just thought, `God, there's definitely
an audience that could be interested in this' so they went in, had
a go at it with the compilation album. That went well because there
had been a built-up demand over the years. Hopefully, there's a
demand for the new one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs From Sun Street'' is a a case of truth in titling. The
Saw Doctors' world of song is not a strife-free zone, but they have
put together a collection of tunes in which optimism is the theme.
In ``Heading For the Sunshine,'' they sing about passing from
darkness into the light. In ``Good News,'' they're watching the
news _ about pollution, hunger, wars, lying politicians _ and
singing, ``Just give the good news/You can keep the bad/Happy not
the sad ... It's been a hard old century/There's a better one to
come.'' In ``Sugartown,'' ``The kids have dreams ... They're in
control of a bright new future.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Saw Doctors, which includes bassist-singer Pearse
Doherty and drummer-singer John Donnelly, gulping happy pills?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good times in Ireland at the moment, for a lot more
people than it used to be,'' says Moran. ``And I suppose, it's good
times for us _ we've been lucky. That's not to say there's not
difficulty for people, long-term unemployment or whatever, but in
general there's a wave that has influenced people's thinking and
created a great deal of optimism. Mind you, I always treat these
swings and trends with a pinch of salt because they always have to
swing back, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Also, says Moran, they coincidentally watched a documentary
about the Band recording its ``Music From Big Pink'' album while
they were working on ``Sun Street.'' Moran says the Band members
``said when they were putting songs together they insisted that no
matter what the song, it have an element of optimism.'' It
resonated with the Saw Doctors.
</P>
<P>
   All four Saw Doctors write and sing, which Moran says, lends ``a
variety pack'' element to the disc. In many ways, it's has a
``heartland'' feel to it, even a little cornball element. In
``Catriona Tells Lies'' they haul out a ``liar, liar, pants on
fire'' refrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard on the ears,'' says Moran, with a laugh. ``The
main thing we try and create is just simple, catchy tunes with
half-decent lyrics. They're simple songs. They're not gonna change
the world a whole lot.''

`MEET JOE BLACK' IS A POWERFUL ENCOUNTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some movies are quick, cold showers. Some are swirling Jacuzzis;
a few are hot with steam. And some, like ``Meet Joe Black,'' are
big, beautiful, blissfully warm baths.
</P>
<P>
   Like all good soaks, this one is long _ three hours, give or
take a few minutes of leisurely toe-wiggling. And it's bubbly: A
$90 million film about an elegant billionaire and the gorgeous hunk
of Death who comes to get him doesn't exactly qualify as cinema
verite. There's nothing here that smacks of gritty realism. Yet
taken on its own terms _ and at its own, unhurried pace the movie
works a subtle kind of magic, conjuring delicately affecting scenes
out of poetic dialogue and long, wordless glances.
</P>
<P>
   Opulent, romantic and gracefully acted by a superb cast,
director Martin Brest's meditation on the Big Goodbye is that
rarest of all beasts, a movie on a stroll. It's not in a rush; if
you are, you'll hate every minute of it. But anyone with a yen for
luxuriant schmaltz should find plenty of cause to sigh.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, ``Meet Joe Black'' bears more than a passing
resemblance to ``City of Angels,'' the sweetly earnest remake of
``Wings of Desire'' that had a lapsed angel (played by Nicolas
Cage) making love to a very earthy Meg Ryan. And there are
similarities: this time, it's Death (played by Brad Pitt) who
assumes mortal form, goes by the name Joe Black and falls in love
with a very earthy Claire Forlani. But there the two films part
company.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Meet Joe Black'' has more on its mind than just
supernatural whoopee; it's less concerned with Death's anguished
sex appeal (though that's certainly a part of it) than the lessons
to be learned from the living. The living, in this case, is Bill
Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), a moneybags media mogul who wakes one
night with a pain in his chest. Bent with discomfort, he hears a
deep, disembodied voice uttering one word: ``Yes.'' Then he hears
it again: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The following day the voice returns, mocking him, mimicking him,
driving him to distraction and worried introspection. His daughters
_ the favored Susan (Forlani), the wound-up Allison (Marcia Gay
Harden) _ fret over his behavior and marvel at his indifference to
a looming 65th birthday bash.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt enters the picture as the live human being who flirts with
Susan in a coffee shop. We get an early glimpse of Susan's beau
(Jake Weber), and we can tell from the start he's a weasel _ we're
happy to see her going mushy over the bottle-yellow Brad (only his
hairdresser knows for sure). When the coffee-shop flirt meets an
early demise, Death commandeers the body and moseys over to Bill's
manse for a little chitchat about life and looming mortality. The
Pale Horse, he reveals, has two goals in mind. One is to carry Bill
off to Elysium. The other is to kick back and enjoy a bit of
earthbound R&AMP;R.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call it boredom,'' he confesses. ``I want to have a look
around before I take you ... Show me around. Be my guide. And in
return you get _ time.''
</P>
<P>
   Their meeting, shot in the subdued Gothic of a book-lined
library, is shadowy and spare _ lots of minute facial nuances and
lengths of near-total silence. Scenes like this are the reason
``Joe Black'' is three hours long: we're talking pauses so pregnant
they're on the verge of giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   The result is grade-A love-it-or-hate-it filmmaking, not the
sort of movie that's engineered to arouse moderate reactions. Fans
of classic cinema might be annoyed by the film's debt to ``Death
Takes a Holiday,'' the 1934 film that starred Frederic March as a
thoroughly grim Reaper who dallies with love at a posh Italian
villa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Black'' is not quite a remake. It's both more ambitious
and less spooky, noodling around Parrish's business dealings and
pondering Death's newfound addiction to peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   But like it or loathe it, the film boasts a smart, oblique
screenplay (by a foursome of writers, including ``One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest's'' Bo Goldman) and indisputably fine acting, from
Marcia Gay Harden as the brittle Allison to Jeffrey Tambor (``The
Larry Sanders Show'') as her decent but fallible husband. Forlani
is luminous in a star-making role, while Hopkins is hypnotic, as
usual: He delivers yet another performance of effortless oomph and
grace.
</P>
<P>
   And believe it or not, Pitt makes an ideal Death. There's a
weariness around the eyes that says he's started to age; the
pretty-boy twinkle hasn't evaporated, but he seems to be carrying a
heavier load these days. In one of the movie's most enchanting
sequences, Death-as-Joe encounters an old woman in the hospital and
gabs with her in Caribbean patois. ``Woe be a man I goin' die!''
she yells, seeing young Joe for what he is. With humor, restraint
and something close to gravity, he tells her not to worry _ she's
got a bit more time on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, mon,'' he says, the twinkle returning. ``I on 'oliday!''
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice picture: Brad Pitt, as gloom incarnate, chatting
with an old Island lady about death, life and the need for a little
QT. Morbidity suits him fine.

GARTH BROOKS IS INTENT ON CREATING A RECORD-SELLING EARTHQUAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not election day.
</P>
<P>
   It's record company talk for Tuesday's boom of superstar
releases from Garth Brooks, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Seal,
and Jewel. All come with promotional blitzes, but far in front is
Brooks, whose unprecedented campaign for his two-CD set, ``Garth
Brooks: Double Live,'' makes even Michael Jackson and Madonna seem
like warm-up acts in the world of hype.
</P>
<P>
   Garth may be a country hick to some people, but he's taking
advantage of every high-tech marketing plan to push his release _
from a closed-circuit concert beamed to 2,400 Wal-Mart stores that
night to an NBC-TV special the following night in which he'll talk
to fans via satellite. All that is in hopes of a stated goal of
selling 1 million copies the first week, which would break the
record of 970,000 set by Pearl Jam's album, ``vs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be quite interesting,'' Brooks says from his
home near Nashville. ``The more store traffic we get, the better
for all of us. The better for Whitney, the better for Garth, the
better for Mariah.''
</P>
<P>
   And the better for Brooks's goal of reaching 100-plus million
albums sold for his career. He's already the top solo act of all
time _ at 85 million _ and second overall to the Beatles, who are
at 103 million. With time, luck, and more music and marketing,
Brooks will pass the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a marketing nut,'' says Pat Quigley, president/CEO of
Capitol Records in Nashville, which is shipping a record 7 million
copies of Brooks's live set. ``With so many artists, it's a fight
because they want to tell you what to do in terms of marketing. But
with Garth, as long as you tell him it's good for his fans, he's
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The double-live CD should be very good for fans. The music
captures the electricity of Brooks's country-cum-rock concerts
(recorded at several sites from Central Park to Texas Stadium)
including dynamic versions of such tunes as ``The Thunder Rolls,''
``Rodeo,'' ``We Shall Be Free'' (with a gospel choir later added in
the studio), and new single ``It's Your Song,'' dedicated to his
mom.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the price tag is being kept to a stunning $13.99 in
most stores _ even less than the cost of most single CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not a fan of the bigger-priced stuff,'' says Brooks,
who is likewise known for keeping his concert tickets to under $20.
``I think you get more people at a lower price, which means the
music gets a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   In another marketing wrinkle, the new double-CD will have seven
different artwork packages, with a million planned for each. ``The
idea is to be innovative,'' says Quigley, ``because I believe that
music will be as collectible as baseball cards someday. And the
most collectible records will be by Garth Brooks and the Beatles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The music will be the same in each one,'' Brooks says. ``That
way, people don't have to buy more than one to get all the music.
But the people who are into collecting things can get different
covers.''
</P>
<P>
   The marketing doesn't end there. Brooks will go on ``The Tonight
Show with Jay Leno'' Monday to promote the new set. And to lure
consumers into the stores, he's agreed to do a ``backyard concert''
next year for a winner chosen from entry forms at retail outlets.
It could be the only concert he does next year, because he's
planning to take a year off from the road to write songs, short
stories, poems, possibly screenplays ``and anything else to empty
out this nugget on top of my head. I just need to. I haven't
written in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you happen to be flying United Airlines these days, you
may have already heard some of the double-CD because United is
providing an exclusive preview on its in-flight programming from
Nov. 1-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garth came up with about half (the marketing ideas) and I came
up with the other half,'' says Quigley, who lacks a major music
industry background, but has held jobs selling Rolling Rock beer,
Swatch watches, and various ski and snowboard products. ``If you're
into snowboarding, you might know me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But what gives this a human dimension is the deep bond that has
developed between Quigley and Brooks. When Quigley's father died
two years ago, Brooks surprised Quigley by showing up at the
funeral and even held Quigley's crying child in his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you repay a guy like that?'' asks Quigley. ``You work
hard for him.''
</P>
<P>
   And Brooks's sales stature, of course, makes that a productive
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garth's No.1 market is New York, his second is Chicago, and
his third is Los Angeles,'' says Quigley, stating a fact that isn't
always true of Southern-based singers. ``Garth is the one country
artist who can cross over without going pop. It's culturally
acceptable to have a Garth Brooks CD in your collection, even if
you live in a big city.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is still marketing to country folks, however. Witness his
closed-circuit show for Wal-Mart, which will emanate from a sound
stage in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the third exclusive concert we've done,'' says
Alex Clark, a Wal-Mart spokesperson at their Bentonville, Ark.
headquarters. ``The first was in June with Reba McEntire, Brooks &AMP;
Dunn, and Hanson. That was to 1,200 stores and we saw customers as
young as 8 and 9, on up to their 50s and 60s. And the second was in
September with Trisha Yearwood, featuring an appearance by Garth.
That went to all 2,400 stores.'' (A fourth Wal-Mart special will
star the Bee Gees from South Africa on Nov. 28.)
</P>
<P>
   The Wal-Mart spokesperson won't comment on how many albums were
sold because of the in-store broadcasts. But word leaked to some
trade magazines that Wal-Mart hopes to sell 1 million copies of
Brooks's album on Super Tuesday alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how that's possible,'' says Brooks. ``But hey, if
somebody says they can do it, then put them out there on the field
and let them have their run.''
</P>
<P>
   The marketing blitz will continue with the NBC special, ``Garth
Brooks: Double Live,'' on Wednesday at 8 p.m. It will be his sixth
NBC special _ more than any other contemporary artist, according to
Rick Ludwin, sernior vice president of special projects.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be the first time a musician will participate in
three separate feeds on the same night, Ludwin says. Brooks will be
in NBC's Burbank studio, but will first do a show for the Eastern
and Central time zones, then follow it with an hour for the
Mountain time zone, then another hour for the Pacific time zone.
The only other multiple NBC feeds on the same night were for past
shows of ``Bloopers'' and ``ER,'' says Ludwin.
</P>
<P>
   In each time slot, Brooks will speak to different fans, who will
appear via video remotes to ask him questions. There will be
concert footage from the venues represented on the live record, as
well as two new songs recorded recently in Las Vegas. And he'll
have an acoustic guitar handy for live performance in the studio.
</P>
<P>
   All of this marketing obsession about first-week sales may help
set a record, but doesn't sit too well with some observers, among
them Billboard editor Timothy White.
</P>
<P>
   ``A million units the first week?'' says White. ``Everything
Garth does in one form or another is remarkable, but that's a tall
order. Worrying too much about first-week sales is not healthy.
Everything isn't over the first week. When you set yourself up like
that, you invite cynicism. I'll bet the record does incredibly
well, but why aim so high the first week?''
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, Brooks understands that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just playing music. I'm having a great time and the
music is still getting to me,'' he says. ``So that's what I want.
As far as the numbers thing, that stuff's got to take care of
itself. I don't want to be remembered as a scorekeeper.''

MARTIN BREST: A DIRECTOR IN LOVE WITH HIS WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martin Brest hasn't slept much over the last 24
hours. In fact, he hasn't slept at all. After days spent
doublechecking soundtracks, the director of ``Meet Joe Black'' is
jittery and distracted, his penetrating brown eyes pink with
sleeplessness.
</P>
<P>
   He sits down. He jumps up, scanning a refreshment table in a
tony Manhattan hotel suite. He sits down. After half a minute he's
up again, this time chasing down the ghostly strains of a stereo on
low volume. He finds the stereo, turns it off, sits down. He sits
down. Then up the door's ajar, and someone's murmuring outside the
room. He can't stand these little sounds, he explains: too many
hours wearing headphones. He sits down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little slow today,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But when Brest finally settles into an armchair when he finally
sits still long enough to answer a handful of questions the words
come fluidly, the ideas fully formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' is a big movie (three hours long; a rumored
$90 million budget) with big stars (Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins)
that tackles big subjects (death, life, love). Inspired by the 1934
Frederic March film ``Death Takes a Holiday,'' it posits Pitt as a
heartthrob Reaper who hangs out with Hopkins' character, a wealthy
media tycoon a la Rupert Murdoch, and falls in love with the man's
daughter (Claire Forlani).
</P>
<P>
   Grim subjects for a holiday romance. Yet Brest, whose previous
films include ``Scent of a Woman'' and ``Beverly Hills Cop,'' says
he welcomed the chance to tackle the world's weightiest issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a movie is such an effort, and it just seems that you
might as well deal with something that has some meaning to you, and
has some potential for stirring people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find I do think a lot about the nature of life, and the
finiteness of life. It always seemed like a fascinating issue to me
the ultimate issue,'' he says. ``It's the most important issue that
puts every day in perspective, really. So it seemed like it would
be worth exploring.''
</P>
<P>
   Explore it he did _ at length. Thanks to its budget, generous
running time and extended location shooting (it was shot in Rhode
Island and New York), the film has caused considerable buzz, not
all of it positive. But Brest made the movie his way: slowly,
fastidiously, taking shot after shot in his search for the perfect
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really a tremendous force,'' Forlani says. ``He's the
most focused man I ever met and the most meticulous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of obsessed, you know,'' says Hopkins, who prefers a
brisk pace. Brest ``likes to do a lot of takes. ... I'd say, `No,
four takes, that's all, Marty.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes actors love it, and sometimes it drives them nuts,''
admits the director of his penchant for multiple takes. ``Most of
the time they love it because it's all about them. It's all about
getting all the magical moments, so you can string them together in
the right combinations and right juxtapositions to enhance what
they've already done.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes pride in the final product. ``Everybody did wonderful
work _ it's a wonderful sort of subtle-delicious, every complicated
work,'' Brest says. ``As a director, I find that I tend to be sort
of minimal in style apparently minimal in cinematic technique but
the thing that I really strive for is stuff that is excruciatingly
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Directing Hopkins and Pitt was ``great. The big joy for me is
working with actors and creating ... really uniquely defined
three-dimensional characters. That, for me, is where I put all my
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he's working, he has a one-track mind. ``I don't see
anything. I don't even know where I am when I'm shooting. I don't
have any sense of being in the place I am. I have zero sense. It's
like being in solitary.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Meet Joe Black,'' for instance, ``we were in Rhode Island
for two months, (but) I have no sense of being there whatsoever ...
It could have been any place on the planet Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island shoot was focused on an elaborate party
sequence at the end of the film. One night, Brest says, it was 40
degrees outside, and the extras _ some of them in strapless gowns _
were methodically sucking down ersatz champagne (translation:
really ginger ale). It was 4 a.m. Everyone was exhausted. ``And all
I kept thinking was, `It looks like there's the greatest party
happening _ right on the other side of this veil of reality. ... I
wanted to be in that place with the band and the party and the
music and the champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment or two, the red-rimmed eyes flare with excitement.
He may be worn by overwork and frayed by sleeplessness, but Brest
is still roused by the power of illusion. He loves making films, he
says _ he loves the process, the collaborativeness, the chance to
work with photographers and designers and editors and writers and
musicians. He seems to take nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Including death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that I fear it,'' he says. ``But I'm very aware
of the finiteness of life. ... What seems to be reality in any
given moment is just a transient thing. And being aware of that,
somehow, I find, makes you appreciate and understand what each day
really is.''

BISHOP SHEEN: THE RIGHT CATHOLIC FDOR HIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>

 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SELLING CATHOLICISM 
Bishop Sheen and the Power of Television  
By Christopher Owen Lynch  
University Press of Kentucky, 200 pp., illustrated, $24.95 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The popular image of the Roman Catholic Church in the United
States is that of an institution in ferment, as liberal Catholics
clash with official Vatican teachings on a host of issues. Indeed
these are uneasy times for the church in America. There are fewer
priests and nuns to tend to a growing flock. Many urban parishes
and parochial schools are in poor financial health. And a
significant chunk of young Catholics seem little interested in
their faith.
</P>
<P>
   But against this pessimistic background is another trend: a
dynamic and growing orthodox movement among American Catholics
strongly supportive of Pope John Paul II's conservative ideology.
These Catholics look back fondly to the era just prior to the
Second Vatican Council, before the church tried to adjust to a more
modern world and in so doing ushered in a time of tumult.
</P>
<P>
   This is the period that forms the backdrop for Christopher Owen
Lynch's fascinating analysis in ``Selling Catholicism: Bishop Sheen
and the Power of Television,'' which probes the influence of the
enormously popular 1950s pastor, Bishop Fulton J. Sheen.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960s, American
Catholics were a much more united body of believers, with common
views on how to live out their faith. Sheen, as Lynch details quite
well, was as responsible as anyone for bringing Catholics together,
from an enormously influential television pulpit. From 1952 to 1957
Sheen's 30-minute show, ``Life is Worth Living,'' regularly drew 10
million viewers. He won an Emmy award over such stars as Lucille
Ball and Jimmy Durante.
</P>
<P>
   In an insightful, objective, if somewhat dry examination of
Sheen's themes and his rhetoric, Lynch, an assistant professor in
the communication and theater department at Kean University in New
Jersey, provides a clear window into the work of a man who became a
bigger hit than Milton Berle. Sheen's genius, as Lynch astutely
observes, was to help Catholics feel more secure in American
society at a time when some Christians still questioned whether
Catholic allegiance was to the United States or to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheen never compromises his Catholic theology, but through the
use of metaphors he converts notions of traditional American
ideology into Catholic ideas,'' Lynch writes. ``One root metaphor
gives America a Christic or salvific role. Sheen's jeremiad notes
that America is a chosen nation whose guiding principles are
inherently Catholic. These Catholic principles rest on a belief in
individual freedom, but always within the boundaries of moral or
natural law as interpreted by the church.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Rome couldn't have asked for a better promoter of the faith
at a moment when Catholics were coming of age politically,
economically, and socially. Essentially, Lynch's assessment of
Sheen's message can be reduced to this _ obedience to authority is
the hallmark of a faithful Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Though he obviously has invested a great deal of time
researching his subject, Lynch at times loses the reader with dense
writing. But his book is worth the effort. While generally
achieving a dispassionate tone, he does at times take issue with
some of Sheen's notions, particularly his belief that the
``solution to any problem for women is noble suffering and
submission.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His ideology blessed the status quo and provided a place for
the church in a secular society but at the same time compromised
the values his ideology promoted,'' Lynch argues. ``He never spoke
about racism or institutional sin or economic or militaristic
oppression in his telecasts because he was preoccupied with the
maintaining the order of his worldview.''
</P>
<P>
   By laying out Sheen's message for the reader to judge, Lynch
wisely avoids clouding his book with personal biases, but it is
apparent that he doesn't believe Sheen's brand of Catholicism could
have survived for long. The proliferation of better educated
Catholics taking to heart the Vatican Council's mandate that the
laity take a stronger voice are no longer willing to listen to a
Bishop Sheen or anyone else telling them how to be Catholics. As
Lynch notes, American Catholics are ``skeptical of church authority
and more willing to decide for themselves how they will express
their Catholicity.''

DICK ARMEY SAID TO HAVE ENOUGH VOTES TO MAINTAIN JOB AS MAJORITY
LEADER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving has
locked up the votes to keep his leadership job in the next
Congress, according to an Illinois congressman who had been urged
to run against him.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois declared Armey the winner in
declining to challenge the conservative Texan for the No. 2 House
post. A contingent of Armey's critics had turned to the popular
Hastert as their best hope for ousting the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moot point. Dick Armey has the votes,'' said Pete
Jeffries, Hastert's spokesman. ``Dick Armey has the support of
Denny Hastert and a majority of the conference and will be
re-elected next Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffries spoke on Hastert's behalf because the congressman was
attending his father's funeral in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Armey declined to declare victory, but even some of his harshest
critics acknowledged privately that he is the front-runner in a
three-way race with Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma and Rep.
Jennifer Dunn of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Armey strategists said their best chance for an upset is to
deny Armey a clear majority on the first ballot, a development that
could throw the race wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't view this election as a lock-up until it's a done
deal _ that's D-U-N-N,'' said Kara Kinderman, Dunn's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Largent could not be reached for comment, but he has repeatedly
suggested that Armey is exaggerating his support.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's assessment was a significant boost for Armey because
the Illinois lawmaker is widely respected as a skilled inside
player.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert currently serves as chief deputy whip, a job that
involves gauging the sentiment of rank-and-file Republicans. He is
a close ally of Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Sugar Land, who has
declined to endorse his fellow Texan in the race for majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to draft Hastert as a candidate continued even after he
endorsed Armey earlier this week. Jeffries said Armey told Hastert
that he has 120 votes for re-election _ eight more than a majority
of the 223 House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hastert was willing to consider a challenge, Jeffries
said the Illinois lawmaker had pledged to support Armey and did not
want to break the commitment unless it was a wide-open contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may well be that Dick has the votes,'' said Rep. Michael
Castle of Delaware, one of the leaders of the failed effort to
recruit Hastert. ``If so, more power to him. We'll need to rally
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Castle, a moderate who is undecided between Armey and Dunn,
said many lawmakers are unenthusiastic about their choices in the
majority leader's race. Armey and Largent are both staunch
conservatives. Dunn's views are harder to categorize. She supports
abortion rights but generally votes with the conservative wing of
the party.
</P>
<P>
   If no one wins a majority on the first ballot next week, the
candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated from the
contest. Largent and Dunn both hope to exploit the anti-Armey vote
if they survive the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Armey's votes are going to be first-ballot votes,''
Castle said. ``If he does not get it the first time or if it is not
close, it certainly is going to put some pressure on.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Davis, Armey's spokeswoman, expressed confidence that if
her boss doesn't win outright on the first ballot, he will be close
enough to wrap it up on the second vote. At the same time, she said
Armey has no intention of declaring victory until the ballots are
counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never declare victory. The members speak for themselves,''
she said. ``You keep working the phone and hope you can move some
of the people in the Armey-leaning category to the Armey-yes
category.''

NEW ADD-ONS GIVE YOUR PC MORE ZIP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editors: (B) denotes bullets. Also notice (at) reference for
e-mail address at end of column.) 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every now and then, the hardware shelf gets a bit overcrowded
here at the Computing World Headquarters. The goodies pile up, and
it becomes necessary to plow through them for certifiable gems.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else in the world, computer add-ons are getting
cheaper, better and easier to use. There are so many of them, and
so little time!
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the better toys that have crossed my cluttered
computer desk in the past couple of months:
</P>
<P>
   (B) Mii Zip 100 _ $250, Microtech International. The
introduction of Iomega's Zip drive was a major event for portable
computer owners. The Zip's 100-megabyte disk capacity and easy
connection to a PC's parallel port made it a snap to transfer big
files between desktop and notebook; store large graphics or data
files on the road; or hold seldom-used programs that could be run
directly from the Zip, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two big drawbacks to the original Zip drive.
First, the parallel model is (BEGIN ITAL) ssslloooowwwww, (END
ITAL) and very few, if any, Windows-based notebooks have the port
necessary to take advantage of Iomega's SCSI-based model.
</P>
<P>
   Second, toting the paperback-size external Zip drive wasn't too
bad, but you also had a thick cable and a bricklike power supply.
Add that to a 6- to 7-pound notebook computer and other traveling
accessories, and dashing through airports becomes an Olympic Iron
Man event.
</P>
<P>
   The Mii Zip 100 fixes those two problems elegantly.
</P>
<P>
   Designed specifically for portable computers, this external
drive connects via a standard PC-card slot. Data can move through
these slots much, much faster than through a parallel port. In
fact, it's as fast as the internal Zip drives now being sold in
many consumer desktop PCs.
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't use an external power supply, drawing its juice
from the computer. This has one obvious downside: the battery in
your portable won't last as long if you use the Zip drive much. But
given that transfers are so fast, the Zip won't be chugging for
long.
</P>
<P>
   The Mii Zip 100 is tiny _ just a little bit bigger than a Zip
disk. It weighs only 11 ounces, and it works with standard,
ATAPI-type drivers. That means later versions of Windows 95 and the
current version of Windows 98 should recognize it without having to
manually install new drivers for it. As a result, you can use it to
share data with most modern portables.
</P>
<P>
   (B) Diamond Viper V550 _ $200, Diamond Multimedia. One of the
hottest areas of competition in computing is in graphics cards.
They're getting faster, and prices are dropping. You now can get
excellent performance for very little cash.
</P>
<P>
   The Viper V550 is one of the more expensive cards out there, but
if speed at high resolutions is a priority for you, it's worth it.
Powered by nVidia's new Riva TNT, a graphics chip that moves
information through the card 128 bits at a time, it's great for
business applications and games.
</P>
<P>
   The Viper V550 comes in PCI and AGP versions _ I tried the PCI
model _ and has 16 megabytes of fast video memory. It can display
16.7 million colors (so-called ``true color'') at resolutions as
high as 1,920-by-1,200 pixels, and at refresh rates as high as 200
hertz.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been interested in adding a secondary graphics card
for fast 3-D gaming, such as a Voodoo- or Voodoo2-based card, but
you don't have enough open PCI slots in your computer, Viper V550
could be your answer. It provides beautiful 3-D graphics in the
Microsoft DirectX and OpenGL standards at impressive speeds.
</P>
<P>
   You can, for example, run Quake II in OpenGL mode at a
resolution of 1,024-by-768. Single Voodoo2-based cards can handle
this game in only 800-by-600 resolution _ you need a pair of
Voodoo2s for 1,024-by-768. You'll need a fast, Pentium II-based PC
to run at this resolution, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Viper V550's drivers still need some work, though. I had
some odd problems with screen freezes in America Online 4.0, as
well as ghost images left on the screen when some windows closed.
Diamond is good about updating its drivers frequently, so I suspect
these bugs will be history soon.
</P>
<P>
   (B) V900 monitor _ $649, Compaq Computer Corp. Compaq sells more
monitors than anyone else, which is not surprising, considering it
sells more desktop PCs than anyone. However, its monitors in the
past have been somewhat ordinary _ neither stellar performers nor
eyestrain machines.
</P>
<P>
   That changes with the new V900, an affordable 19-inch model with
a crisp, bright display that will impress even the most jaded
monitor junkie. In fact, the bright, high-contrast display rivals
that of my favorite monitor-maker, NEC Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   This monitor has a big 18-inch viewable area, crammed into a
cabinet that's about the size of a 17-inch monitor. Although this
is aimed at business users, that size advantage makes it the
perfect choice for home users who are cramped for space.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also has moved the cables so they emerge from the bottom
of the cabinet instead of the back. This makes it much easier to
back the monitor against a wall _ another benefit if you are using
a shallow computer desk. There's also a USB hub built into the
base, which makes it easier to connect USB devices to your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The V900 has a .22mm horizontal dot pitch and can handle refresh
rates up to 85 hertz and resolutions up to 1,600-by-1,200. The
screen image is wonderful _ text and graphics stay sharp, even at
the very edges of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   It is Macintosh-compatible, too.
</P>
<P>
   A 19-inch monitor is excellent for business applications,
because there is more screen for open windows, and for games, where
a bigger screen gives more of a feeling of immersion. This Compaq
monitor costs about what a quality 17-inch monitor would have cost
a year ago. It's an excellent bargain.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
LUBBOCK _ The college football world knows him as ``the other Ricky
Williams.'' Texas Tech teammates know the fleet tailback as a
practical joker who warrants keeping an eye on.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The subject of this attention is a constantly talking,
smooth-running, prank-playing, humble guy who couldn't care less
that for now, at least, he isn't considered ``The Man,'' piling up
yardage in record-breaking fashion out of the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Raiders' slashing sophomore sensation is also confident.
Listen to him explain Ricky Williams vs. Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always in the spotlight,'' Tech's leading rusher said of
his namesake at the University of Texas. ``He's a great running
back, and he's going to continue to be a great running back in the
pros, I think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just doing my job. I want to be the person they look at,
the Ricky Williams that's going to help out this Texas Tech team,
help them get as far as they can get. But otherwise, I don't look
at myself as `the other Ricky Williams,' anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, I always try to take everything and look at it in a
positive way. He (Texas' Williams) kind of helped me make a name
for myself also. My name's Ricky Williams; his name's Ricky
Williams. The only thing I had to do was produce on the field, try
to make a name for myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to compare us. It's just a situation I'm going to
have to deal with until he leaves. He'll be gone next year, and
hopefully I can just keep my name going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Ricky,'' as UT's star is called, will carry along a passel
of NCAA records when he completes his eligibility. Though ``Little
Ricky'' might not have Heisman-like numbers, he chews up a good bit
of acreage.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-7 and 182 pounds, Williams' boyish good looks give little
hint of his inner strength, drive and determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know that I'm just an ordinary guy,''
Williams said. ``I'm a person most people think would just go into
the locker room, get in there, handle my business, practice, then
go home and study.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm totally the opposite. I practice. I study. But I'm
always joking around with the big guys, pulling their pants down,
unbuckling their shoulder pads, messing with them in some way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real active, real interactive with the players on the
team. I'm talkative. I talk with them and joke with them. That's
just the way I am.''
</P>
<P>
   According to reserve running back Rickey Hunter, no one loves a
practical joke more than Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``His favorite thing is to rest a bucket of water against
someone's door,'' Hunter said. ``Then, he'll knock on the door. And
when they open it, water goes all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a 1997 graduate of Duncanville High School, where,
in addition to football, he played basketball and ran track. As a
senior, he gained 1,669 yards on 200 carries and was one of the
most recruited running backs in the state. Part of the reason he
chose Tech was to stay near his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very close family,'' Williams said. ``I have an older
brother and my father and mother (Richard and Diane Williams). They
come to all my games. My mother hasn't missed a game since I played
pee-wee ball. I've got a real good family; they're very
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   But that often stresses Diane Williams, watching her son take
his lumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look in the stands, you'll see her standing up, or
somewhere back up there with her hands to her head, worrying about
something,'' Williams said. ``I got hurt last week; she was real
concerned. She's kind of gotten used to it, because that's the name
of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has become Williams' family away from home. The two have
been inseparable since Williams was a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a younger brother who thinks he's the oldest,'' said
Hunter, a redshirt sophomore. ``He thinks he knows more than the
next guy. But he's a good fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Williams to adjust to college football.
He endeared himself to Raiders fans last year by surpassing Byron
Hanspard's school freshman single-season rushing record, carrying
201 times for 894 yards. His best day was against Kansas when he
ran for 179 yards on 33 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was the leading freshman ground-gainer in the Big 12
(sixth overall) and ranked seventh in all-purpose yardage for the
season. Through nine games this year, Williams has carried 249
times for 1,315 yards and 11 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago in a 28-26 loss to Missouri, he sprained his
ankle. Tech had an open date last week, so he has had time to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ankle's fine now,'' Williams said. ``I'm going to play
Saturday. I'll be there for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams wouldn't mind taking a shot at the NFL eventually but
won't be heartbroken if it doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take that step by step,'' Williams, 20, said. ``I leave that
in God's hands. If he lets me find it to that next level, lets me
do my best, then I'll go on with that and the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders (6-3, 3-3 in the Big 12 South) have high hopes for a
bowl berth. But Williams isn't looking beyond Saturday, the
next-to-last game of the season, and matching talents again with
UT's Williams. Last year in Austin, Tech's Williams ran for 133
yards _ 43 more than the fellow in burnt orange _ and the Raiders
won 24-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, they've been comparing us so much to where a
lot of people and my teammates want to see me outgain him,''
Williams said. ``I guess it is a little extra motivation. I do want
to outperform him, since it's turned into a game, a big
competition. I would like to come out on top. And I'd really like
for the team to get a win again.''

RUSH REACHES OUT WITH LIVE THREE-CD SET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rush, the Canadian power trio, believes in precision. Not only
does it play an airtight mix of progressive rock and metal, but the
group has a pattern for releasing live albums. After every four
studio discs comes a live record _ hence this week's release of
``Different Stages,'' arguably the finest of the three live discs
in Rush's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sit and think, well, geez, does the world really need
another live Rush album?'' Rush singer Geddy Lee says. ``And you
have to remind yourself that live music is where it's all born. I
also think that if we better the (studio) versions in some cases _
and I think we do on this one _ then that's enough reason to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also wanted to make a souvenir for our fans, who have
supported us all these years,'' Lee says of the three-CD set, which
includes two CDs taken mainly from last year's ``Test for Echo''
tour. The complete set sells at some stores for just $21.99 _ an
excellent price for a three-CD set in these overinflated times.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Different Stages'' reinforces the group's power-trio
core. Lee, who describes himself as the ``most finicky'' band
member in terms of sound, decided to mix the newer tracks to be
similar to how the band sounded on the Hammersmith Odeon tapes 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consciously mixed Hammersmith first to get into that
three-piece frame of mind,'' says Lee. ``And that kind of realigned
the sound of the band in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even set things up in the stereo perspective so that the
drums were in the middle and the bass was a little bit off from the
stage left, and the guitar was a little bit off from stage right.
So, again, it felt more like a three-piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee and fellow Rush members Neil Peart (drums) and Alex Lifeson
(guitars) also recorded the newer material differently this time.
In the past, they had a recording truck come out for part of the
tour, but on the ``Test for Echo'' and previous ``Counterparts''
tour of 1994 (three songs come from that), they taped each and
every show.
</P>
<P>
   The band ended up with more than 60 recorded shows, but quickly
pared the performances down to a few arenas that sounded best.
Chicago's World Amphitheater was used the most (for such tunes as
``Animate,'' ``Roll the Bones,'' and ``Nobody's Hero''), but Great
Woods was the second most popular venue with ``2112'' and ``Leave
This Thing Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partially to do with the sound of the building and the
intensity of the crowd,'' Lee says.
</P>
<P>
   Rush's quarter-century of existence can be attributed to the
``brotherly fondness we have for each other,'' says Lee.
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans for more records or tours, though, because of
tragedy within the ranks. Peart's wife and their only child died
recently _ his wife, Jackie, of cancer, and daughter Selena in a
car accident. The new live album is dedicated to them both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to even talk about it,'' Lee says. ``Neil
is doing as well as he can do. He's keeping to himself. We've been
in contact, but he needs time.''

   Q: I am sure I am not the only one with this question, now that
hard disks have become so inexpensive and a lot of us are replacing
the smaller drives in our computers. I have C: and D: drives on my
PC, and I want to replace one of these with a two-gigabyte disk.
Why can't I ``daisy-chain'' the two existing ones to the new drive
so I can use everything I have instead of throwing away one when I
upgrade? Also, what do I have to do if I want to replace the C:
drive with a large drive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unless you are using a SCSI-type drive _ which is not found
in most consumer computers _ you can't literally daisy-chain your
hard drives. However, you can put up to four hard drives in one
computer that uses Enhanced IDE drives, and more if you are willing
to add some extra cards.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other issues to consider.
</P>
<P>
   The EIDE controller found in most modern computers can support
four devices. There are two EIDE plugs on your motherboard, and
each will have a cable capable of connecting two devices.
</P>
<P>
   One of the drives on each cable will be a master drive, while
the other is a slave. You may need to fiddle with the hard jumpers
or switches on each drive to set up the proper slave/master
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a traditional multimedia PC with a CD-ROM and a hard
drive, chances are both of those are EIDE devices. You said you
have a second drive, and it's likely to be EIDE, too. That means
you have room for one more EIDE device. Of course, you'll need a
free drive bay to house the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to read the directions for installation carefully to see
if there are problems installing that drive on the same controller
with other drives, or with a CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the hard drive that you put on the same cable as the
CD-ROM drive will run slower than it otherwise would if it stood
alone.
</P>
<P>
   You always can buy another EIDE controller card, but even that's
not foolproof. You'll need a free slot and an available system
interrupt for the controller card. (An interrupt is how a device in
a computer talks to the main chip.)
</P>
<P>
   If you want to replace the C: drive with the new, big drive,
you'll need to back up C: to some kind of removable media _ such as
tape or disk _ then restore it onto the new disk once it's in
place. Or, you can temporarily install the new drive as a third
drive, copy the contents of C: onto the new drive, then remove the
old drive and replace it with the new one. Again, pay careful
attention to your master/slave settings when you do this.
</P>
<P>
   PowerQuest Corp. makes an excellent utility called DriveCopy
that simplifies this process. Find out more about it at
www.powerquest.com/product/dc/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been scanning family photos into my new scanner and
storing them on my hard drive. When I want to e-mail them to
friends, they take forever. Someone told me I have the resolution
on my scanner set too high, at 300 dots per inch.
</P>
<P>
   A: Unless you are going to publish those on glossy paper, you
don't need to be scanning them at that resolution.
</P>
<P>
   For most e-mail situations, 75 to 100 dpi is just fine. If you
get beyond that, both the size of the image and the overall size of
the file increases. You can use a program, such as Paint, which
comes with Windows, or Paint Shop Pro from Jasc (www.jasc.com) to
shrink the image size further.
</P>
<P>
   Also, be sure to save your files as JPGs. Some Windows-based
scanners want to save by default in BMP format, which creates much
bigger files than JPG.

BRAZIL'S DOWNWARD SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the dramatic rebound in the U.S. stock market has
allowed us to forget about the rest of the world for a while, the
fate of the global economy over the next year or so still hinges,
precariously, on what happens to Brazil. And recent news from there
has not been good.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has put together, as expected, a $30 billion package
intended to help Brazil meet its current debt payments, prop up its
currency, and improve its standing in foreign credit markets. In
order to get that package, Brazil's president promised to push
through an austerity budget designed to bring down the country's
deficit, which now totals 8 percent of GDP and which has been
financed in part by foreign creditors. The budget, which purported
to cut spending and raise taxes, is not exactly the ideal fiscal
solution to an economy that now appears to be entering recession,
but Brazil's already sky-high interest rates _ which have been in
the 40 percent range for months now _ have left the government with
few options if it wants to prevent capital flight, pay off its
debt, and prevent a sharp rise in inflation. And the budget that
Brazil has now offered does not really live up to promises.
Spending actually increases, and the tax increases are not as
rigorous as we might have hoped.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, as I've argued here before, Brazil has made
the bed in which it now finds itself sleeping. Its public sector
comes straight out of Ronald Reagan's nightmares, as an article in
the Nov. 12 New York Times makes clear. (Even now, as pensioners
and unemployed workers are preparing to feel the bite of budget
cuts, civil servants and government officials are buying Persian
rugs, enjoying salary bonuses, and supplementing their salaries
with exorbitant per diems.) Although President Cardoso did a great
job in rescuing the economy from hyper-inflation, he never shifted
the focus of public policy from interest-group squabbling over the
existing pie to the kinds of investment that would make the pie
grow bigger. And the Brazilian appetite for foreign goods _ fueled
by an overvalued currency _ helped create the current-account
deficit that now exists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the way global markets have punished Brazil is out of all
proportion to what the country did wrong. (If budget deficits and
current-account deficits were reason enough to be thrust into
recession, the U.S. economy wouldn't have grown an iota over the
last two decades.) The elimination of risk tolerance on the part of
foreign investors indiscriminately swept across the developing
world, and Brazil has felt the brunt of that. Brazil's problems,
whatever they are, are not new. It's the market's reaction to them
that is.
</P>
<P>
   What's scary about what's happening now is that although Brazil
really is, in some sense, too big for us to allow it to fail,
nothing that either the international political community or the
international financial community has done is substantive enough to
guarantee that Brazil's markets won't fall apart. Large U.S. banks,
in fact, now appear to be anticipating a Brazilian devaluation,
which will send emerging markets around the world into a tailspin.
They've cut back on their exposure to Brazil (although it remains
substantial), and they have not stepped up to the plate with
promises of further assistance in the wake of the IMF package. That
package, meanwhile, was an important symbolic gesture. But Brazil
has $150 billion in short-term debt coming due over the next eight
months. How much help is a $30 billion credit line really going to
be?
</P>
<P>
   In other words, we've decided that all we can do is sit and
hope. If currency speculators decide to make a run at the real, and
if capital flight begins again (the country's capital flows are
currently neutral), then it'll be pretty much up to chance whether
or not Brazil weathers the storm. It's comforting to believe that
markets are always efficient. But at this point, it's hard even to
figure out what ``efficiency'' actually means.

THE MESSAGE TRAP 
</HEADLINE>
  By JODIE T. ALLEN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone agrees: The Republicans were beaten by a lack of
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we probably underestimated the need to really
aggressively push a much stronger message about cutting taxes and
saving Social Security, winning the war on drugs, reforming
education and national defense,'' said Newt Gingrich the day before
he realized that that underestimate would cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first thing that we have to do is develop an
agenda that can unify our party, said Steve Largent, aspiring House
majority leader. ``We have to have Republican solutions in
education, HMO reform, Social Security, get back to limited
government, lower taxes and strong defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh really?
</P>
<P>
   Where, may I ask, is the evidence that the public is hot for a
party that promises activist solutions to problems that confront it
and its progeny? Surely not from Election Day exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, for example, queried voters about the one
issue that ``mattered most'' in deciding which House candidate to
vote for. ``Education,'' said an underwhelming 25 percent of
voters.
</P>
<P>
   And even at that, how many of those voters really had education
foremost in their frontal lobes? Remember that, in key elections,
``education'' was the trade name for a firm of less reputable
pursuit. Democratic candidates in the South who actively supported
legalized gambling measures (with the state's share of the take
earmarked for education) scored unexpected victories over
anti-gambling GOP opponents. Voters who opposed the lottery and
video poker interests told pollsters forthrightly that they were
``against gambling.'' Voters who favored legalizing gambling said
they were ``for education.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing behind education in the exit polls were issues such as
``morals and ethics'' (19 percent), ``the economy and jobs'' (14
percent), Social Security (11 percent), and taxes (8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   As for ``health care,'' the occasion of much bipartisan huffing
and puffing about the need to save citizens from the ravages of
HMOs, it commanded the top interest of a mere 7 percent of voters.
That was scarcely more than the 5 percent who dared the pollsters'
scorn by admitting outright that ``the Clinton-Lewinsky matter''
concerned them most.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you add the coded ``morals and ethics'' vote to the
Clinton-Lewinsky category, it virtually ties for first place among
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   What the GOP would do well to keep in mind is that, at least in
times of peace and prosperity, most times the American public
doesn't want the federal government to bother it. People expect the
government to keep the Social Security checks and highway money
coming and run the courts and stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   But sweeping reforms _ even when they really would be prudent
for the future _ make the electorate uncomfortable. Take ``saving
Medicare,'' for example, a goal that pols from both parties like to
pop into the same sentence with ``curbing HMOs.'' There's no way to
make Medicare solvent for the long term except by raising taxes to
pay for it or by letting HMOs and their ilk limit some people's
access to some kinds of care. Pick your poison or, more wisely,
shut your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Of course that doesn't mean that Republicans should go back to
talking about Monica or even about that ``social agenda'' that
makes so many voters uneasy. After all, American voters do like
their politicians to flatter them by pretending that they are truly
concerned about important things like making kids smarter and safer
and healthier.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP should take a page out of Bill Clinton's playbook and
promise the public 100,000 new teachers or cops or drug enforcement
agents or whatever. Never mind that the money will only pay for a
fraction of that (and that by the time it's spread by formula to
every school or precinct, it might not fully support a single
hire). Or call for another tax break to subsidize the cost of
schools or day-care centers or hiring the disadvantaged or
whatever. Sure, most of the subsidy will end up paying for things
that would happen anyway, but people like the idea of tax breaks
and nobody ever bothers to check on who got to pocket the lost
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, GOP, recruit some more attractive candidates who
don't scare the voters with their moralistic fervor. But meanwhile,
don't weigh yourself down with some heavy-breathing message that
ends up forcing a debate in which a lot of painful choices will
inevitably be laid bare. That was your strategy last January, when
you deliberately scheduled only 89 days for voting business this
year with precisely that sort of inaction in mind. And according to
the polls, Congress has never been more popular than it was just a
few months ago when what it was doing was nothing much.

<P>
   I have often used this column to defend economics and economists
against their critics. It sometimes seems as if no public
intellectual, be he Irving Kristol or George Soros, feels his
resume is complete until he has published an article or book
attacking economic theory _ a project that does not, of course,
require that its author make much effort to find out what that
theory really says.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, economists can stand a little informed criticism.
Right now, it seems to me, the discipline is in some trouble.
Specifically, the marriage between macroeconomics and
microeconomics _ an imperfect but workable union achieved half a
century ago, which has allowed economists to combine moderately
activist views about monetary policy with otherwise generally free
market beliefs _ is now being called into question by events.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an abstract problem. It is one with urgent
application to the current global economic crisis. Conventional
microeconomic analysis depends on the presumed ability of
governments to maintain more or less full employment. If they can't
_ and if economists can't find a way to resolve the world's newly
intractable macroeconomic problems _ all sorts of heresy become
entirely reasonable. And in the end that will be disastrous not
just for the economics profession but for the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, that you are an advocate of free trade,
but some Brazilian tells you that his country needs export
subsidies and tariffs to protect its industry and save jobs. Well,
if Brazil cannot devalue its currency for fear of speculators,
cannot use fiscal or monetary policy to reflate its economy because
to do so would cause capital flight, and the country must therefore
endure a prolonged period of recession and deflation, you cannot in
good conscience make the conventional arguments in favor of free
trade. That is, you cannot tell him that protectionism only
redistributes jobs, that it cannot create them, since the truth is
that, under these circumstances, his proposal would increase output
and employment.
</P>
<P>
   Now I am not advocating protectionism for Brazil or, for that
matter, for anywhere. Nor am I giving up on microeconomics in
general or on the general presumption in favor of free markets in
particular. I still believe that macroeconomic activism is
possible: that Japan can reflate itself out of its slump, that
countries such as Brazil can find ways to deal with the threat of
speculative attack. Many people disagree with my ideas; that's
fine, as long as they have an alternative to offer. But very few of
my colleagues, as far as I can tell, are even making a serious
effort to rise to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the nature of this challenge, you need to realize
that although the name of John Maynard Keynes is anathema to many
conservatives, it was in fact Keynesian economics that allowed
capitalism as a system _ as well as belief in the efficacy of free
markets _ to survive the Great Depression. After all, circa 1939 it
was very hard for an observant person to see much future in the
free market. I happen to own a copy of James Burnham's ``The
Managerial Revolution,'' a now-forgotten 1941 book that was for a
time hugely influential. It purported to see the rise of both
communism and fascism as part of the inevitable replacement of
capitalism by a more efficient ``managerial'' state. Burnham did
not attack free market economies; he simply regarded them as
doomed, and those who thought otherwise as naive:
</P>
<P>
   ``The first, and perhaps crucial evidence for the view that
capitalism is not going to continue much longer is the continuous
presence within the capitalist nations of mass unemployment. ...
Capitalism is no longer able to find uses for the available
investment funds, which waste in idleness in the account books of
the banks. ... (T)he capitalist organization of society has entered
its final years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloomy sentiments indeed, but at the time they seemed quite
reasonable. As far as most people who thought about it could see,
capitalist economies were indeed unable to make use of their
savings and thus of their resources. Given that massive failure,
the traditional case that free markets lead to microeconomic
efficiency _ to the proper allocation of resources among firms and
of goods among consumers _ seemed not so much wrong as irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   But Keynesian economics _ by which I mean not so much the
specifics of Keynes' ideas as the understanding that monetary and
fiscal policy could be used to fight economic slumps _ rescued both
capitalism and microeconomics from oblivion. Thanks in large part
to the new understanding of governments that increasing interest
rates, raising taxes and cutting spending in a recession is a bad
idea, the first postwar generation was one of near-full employment
in most Western countries. And with the assurance that savings
would be invested and that there would be enough demand to make use
of the economy's resources, economists could return in good
conscience to the microeconomic question of how those resources
would be used _ and to the broad presumption that free markets,
except in some specific cases, would get it right.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the debate about the effects of the North
American Free Trade Agreement. Although most of the public debate
over that agreement focused on alleged job losses or gains (Ross
Perot's ``great sucking sound'' vs. the administration's claim that
NAFTA would create hundreds of thousands of jobs), most economists
believed that the net effect on employment would be zero. This is
basically because the overall number of jobs in the United States
is determined by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who is always trying
to get the economy as close to full employment as he can without
creating inflation.
</P>
<P>
   So for serious economists the real questions about NAFTA
involved microeconomic issues such as efficiency and income
distribution _ and efficiency concerns, at any rate, offered a
strong case in favor of free trade. In short, the success of
macroeconomic activism, in both theory and practice, has made it
possible for free market microeconomics to survive _ again both in
theory and in practice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-KRUGMAN-SLATE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: and in practice.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   True, during the 1970s and early 1980s macroeconomics suffered a
crisis. The experience of stagflation _ the combination of
inflation and unemployment _ badly damaged the prestige of
economists in general and macroeconomics in particular, even though
it was not that much of a theoretical surprise. Equally important
was an internal crisis of self-confidence: ``Rational
expectations'' theorists, led by Chicago's future Nobelist Robert
Lucas, challenged the whole idea that governments could do anything
to mitigate macroeconomic instability.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, rational expectations failed to provide a
workable alternative to Keynesian macroeconomics. So-called ``new
Keynesian'' economists provided at least a theoretical fig leaf for
more or less Keynesian ideas, and in practical terms the
intellectual basis of modern U.S. monetary and fiscal policy is
pretty much what was already in the textbooks 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, economists are in trouble again _ trouble that is
a sort of muted version of what happened in the 1930s. The world is
not now in depression, nor is a full-scale replay of the 1930s
likely. But substantial parts of the world economy are depressed _
and for one reason or another apparently cannot or will not use
macroeconomic policy to restore full employment. ``Emerging
market'' nations, terrified of capital flight, dare not reflate
their economies; on the contrary, we find the front-line economy of
the moment, Brazil, compelled by fear of speculators to act in a
precisely anti-Keynesian fashion: increasing interest rates,
raising taxes, and cutting spending even as the economy slides into
a nasty recession.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Japan _ the world's second-largest economy and a
country that by normal criteria ought to have no trouble increasing
demand _ finds itself stuck in exactly the trap Burnham described:
``no longer able to find uses for the available investment funds,
which waste in idleness in the account books of the banks.''
</P>
<P>
   So economists must be rushing to solve these problems, right?
Well, not exactly. You see, the rational expectations challenge to
Keynesian economics was half-successful: It did not build a
workable new structure for macroeconomic theory and policy, but it
did seriously damage the old structure. And the effect of that
damage has been to discourage economists from even thinking about
the traditional Keynesian issues.
</P>
<P>
   Most younger economists have simply avoided macroeconomics
entirely, or _ if they do work on macroeconomic issues _ they
choose ``safe'' topics such as long-run growth, avoiding the
academic minefield of business cycle research. I can't blame them,
but it leaves us with a dangerous lack of fresh thinking about how
to handle recessions at a time when the usual remedies don't seem
to be working.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had more of a sense that other economists understand
what is at stake. The point is not that the world is going to
collapse; that could happen, but it is not the clear and present
danger. Rather, the point is that the theory and practice of more
or less free market economics depend crucially on the availability
of adequate solutions to the problem of macroeconomic instability _
and for the first time in half a century, the availability of those
solutions cannot be taken for granted.

WHY THE NEW FASHION COLOR IS GRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  By ELIZA TRUITT 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How did all the designers know that gray would be the color of
the season? They consulted with an international trade organization
based in Alexandria, Va., called the Color Marketing Group.
</P>
<P>
   CMG predicts what the fashionable colors of a particular season
will be. And while nothing requires designers to act on CMG's
suggestions, the clothes showing in stores indicate that they do.
</P>
<P>
   CMG, founded in 1962, is a non-profit group of 1,500 people from
different industries _ fashion, cosmetics, automobiles, greeting
cards, etc. _ that convenes twice a year to come up with both
long-term and short-term predictions. The long-term prediction is a
list of 16 colors, compiled two years in advance. The short-term
prediction is a palette of colors that are currently popular _
there are several shades of gray on this year's. Next year, CMG
says, the big color will be blue.
</P>
<P>
   How do the CMG members choose their colors? The official line
</P>
<P>
   is that they look at economic trends (pastels in bad times,
saturated colors in good times) and also examine social trends.
What this boils down to is six hundred people sitting around in
small groups, trying to figure out the next big thing. Gray, for
example, was chosen in part because of the craze for technology and
space-age stuff as the millennium approaches: ``People associate
gray with futuristic things like silvery metallics and anodized
aluminum,'' a CMG spokeswoman said. And why blue? ``Water is a big
social issue, what with the current emphasis on designer water and
water conservation.''

A CHARMING SIR ANTHONY REVELS IN HIS `LONELY' LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sir Anthony Hopkins looks like an old bull. His neck
is thick. His wrists are huge. His buzzed pate boasts less hair
than it used to, and his face is ridged with lines, but the cramped
Manhattan hotel room swells with his presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look in the mirror in the morning and think, `Well, this is
the way it is,''' he says, with a voice that rolls like distant
thunder. ``I just think, `My hair's falling out, I'm getting
older.' And I think, `Well, don't worry about it. Just get on with
it. That's life.' None of it's of any consequence at all _ it's all
an illusion, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is a publicity junket for ``Meet Joe Black,'' and
while Brad Pitt isn't here, Hopkins is. Hopkins always is. He's a
trouper when it comes to publicity _ gracious, unpretentious,
articulate _ and movie writers wind up seeing a lot of him.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the collective chagrin when Hopkins strolls in, sits
down and calmly spills out one earthquaking personal revelation
after another. Soft-spoken, self-effacing, brutally honest and
utterly charming, he single-handedly trashes everyone's best-laid
plans to Not Write About Him. How could we Not Write About Him. No
choice, really. Sir Tony talks.
</P>
<P>
   On being alone: ``That's my life: I live in hotels, and I travel
around the world. That's my passion, if you can call it a passion.
I love it. I love the alone quality of it all. I don't need
anything, I don't need anyone. I get in my car sometimes and drive
a thousand miles across America. That's really what it's about:
just being alive. ... I don't have any attachments to people. I
don't know, I think this came some time ago _ maybe I'm not very
trusting, I guess _ but I don't have friends, really.''
</P>
<P>
   (FYI: He's married. When he's traveling, he says, he phones his
wife about four times a week.)
</P>
<P>
   On his childhood in South Wales: ``I was a lonely kid. ... Maybe
I was dyslexic. I was just different, really. I was artistic and I
used to draw, played piano. My father used to worry about me _ he'd
say to my mother, `There's something wrong with this boy. He ought
to get out; he doesn't have any friends, he ought to go out and
play with other kids.' ... School was a complete anathema to me. I
didn't know what on earth anyone was talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   On why he became an actor: ``I hated authority, hated any
establishment, couldn't bear to be told what to do _ so I became an
actor. And I thought maybe that would be a way out for me. And I
had no idea why I was going to become an actor, except I wanted to
be rich and famous. I was a very good mimic, and I think that was
the bridge to a kind of normal living for me, because I could mimic
all the schoolteachers, authority figures: I could be cruel to them
at their expense.''
</P>
<P>
   On his fear of being found out: ``I don't think I've ever had
that sense that I'm an actor. ... I look over my shoulders and I'm
thinking, `What I'm doing, because it feels so easy to me. Maybe I
should send the check back. Maybe they shouldn't give me this part.
Maybe they're going to find out that I don't know what I'm doing.
Maybe they're going to pull the wool away from their eyes and see
that I'm a complete fake.'''
</P>
<P>
   On people who take acting way too seriously: ``Some guys live
and sleep and eat the work they do. I don't. ... It's the Robert
Mitchum school of acting: Show up, learn your lines, make sure the
check's on the way to the agent. I know it sounds cynical and
jaded, but it's not. It's the only way I can function. I mean, what
I do is not a cure for cancer, is it? It's not a cure for a
disease. It's not that important. ... People want to grab me and
say, `Don't you take your work seriously?' And I want to say,
`No!'''
</P>
<P>
   On death: ``We're all suffering from a terminal condition called
life, and we're all going to die one day. So I think about it
sometimes. I'm 60 now. I'm not preoccupied with it. I'm mellowed. I
have no illusions. That's the great thing _ having your illusions
stripped away. And I have no expectations. I have very few needs.
One day it'll all be over, and that'll be the end. So I may as well
enjoy it while it's here now.''
</P>
<P>
   On his drinking years: ``I used to walk around this city stoned,
bombed out of my brains for months on end, and alone _ and you
know, confused, bewildered, like all drunks. And here I am sitting
here in the same city, 23 years later, and everything seems to be
different. ... I can see everything through a new pair of glasses,
you know. Everything's clear. Life is good, life is tough, life is
all those things _ but you know, I don't have any power over it.
And it's a nice feeling to be free of all that nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   On his live-and-let-live philosophy: ``If I have any philosophy,
it's `Mind my own business.' It's nothing to do with me what anyone
else does. I learned that through the last 20-odd years. I was
drowning in booze, I was drinking myself slowly into the gutter.
And gradually I figured out over the years that I had a choice: to
live or die. And if any of my friends want to kill themselves ... I
can give them a couple of tips on why it's not a very good idea to
blow your brains out that way, and that life is much better on
life's terms. But if they choose to live their lives or want to be
miserable, that's up to them. I can't do anything: I have no power
at all. That's a great, great freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   And, last but not least: On his unexpected status as a sex
symbol: ``Sometimes a young woman comes up and asks for an
autograph and goes goo-goo to me, and I say'' _ at this point he
looks over first one shoulder, then the other _ ```It must be Brad
Pitt!'''
</P>
<P>
   Flustered, Hopkins grabs his head, leans on the table and
laughs. ``I've gone all pink now!'' he yells.
</P>
<P>
   He has. Ear to ear, from his chin to his bald spot, Hannibal
Lecter is blushing.

OLDIES STATION HAS REFRESHING IDEAS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'll never forget the time I visited the office of a blue chip
firm famous for its efficiency and productivity consulting. Two
receptionists, neither of whom were friendly, instructed me to sit
and wait until the consultant I was coming to visit was free.
</P>
<P>
   I sat in the lobby for about 20 minutes and watched as one
receptionist spent the time chatting on the phone with a friend,
while the other filed her nails. My vantage point gave me a
bird's-eye view to the entire office, and I watched as employees
loped by to complain about management policies. Everyone looked
tense, gray and very buttoned-down.
</P>
<P>
   I've visited enough work sites as an employment writer that in a
few seconds, I can get a pretty good handle on how an organization
is run. Instantly, I can detect if employees appear upbeat and
pleased to be at work, or whether they look stressed and annoyed.
Nine times out of 10, those expressions reflect how well they are
treated by their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a lot of the time, the first impression isn't
good, albeit not as bad as I experienced with the consulting firm.
So when my first encounter with a company includes a lot of bright,
cheerful, helpful faces, it really stands out.
</P>
<P>
   I had that experience recently when I was invited to Oldies 94.5
FM radio station in Houston for its monthly Friday stress-reduction
luncheon. The receptionist gave me a big smile, greeted me and
introduced me to the company. Everyone I saw seemed to be cheerful
_ it was as if there were something funny in the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   A stress-relieving lunch
</P>
<P>
   The monthly staff lunch is an attempt to make the workplace less
stressful, so the station caters the lunch, gives out some door
prizes and offers free massages and shoe shines to employees. None
of that is terribly unusual in an era when some employers allow
their employees to bring their pets to work, but what was unusual
was the camaraderie that seemed to permeate the room.
</P>
<P>
   Employees joked with each other and ribbed General Manager Chris
McMurray about her age and other foibles as she passed out the
prizes, which ranged from a gift certificate to the Olive Garden to
a free car wash. There was nothing uptight or corporate about this
crowd _ instead, it seemed to be more like a family that enjoyed
each other and lauded each others' accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   McMurray said she spends $500 a month on the lunch and prizes,
money she said is well worth the camaraderie that has developed in
the office.
</P>
<P>
   She said she began the lunches when she joined the station four
years ago to help create an esprit de corps. When she first started
working at the station, the employees didn't seem to like each
other and were stabbing each other in the back, she said. It was
depressing to walk into the office.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Nakanishi, a human resource consultant, suspects that the
lunches and door prizes, however nice, haven't done much to relieve
employee stress.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the lunches send a message to employees that McMurray
respects her employees and shows that she wants them to get to know
each other outside their defined business roles, said Nakanishi,
president of GN Resources of Kingwood, Texas, a Houston suburb.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask what has turned the company around, Nakanishi said,
employees probably wouldn't say it was the once-a-month lunches.
Instead, they probably would say the manager shows her employees a
lot of respect and brought a new way of working with people,
Nakanishi said. She probably encourages fun and communication.
</P>
<P>
   Making everyone feel special
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly how several employees at the radio station
described McMurray.
</P>
<P>
   She makes everyone feel so special, said Beth Lavine, national
sales manager, who sounds a bit like a McMurray groupie. She is so
approachable and open to new ideas and seems to get across the idea
that she's always available to help solve problems, Lavine said.
</P>
<P>
   McMurray also goes out of her way to find out what specifically
motivates her employees, said Lavine, who recently reached a
special sales goal. Lavine said that McMurray asked what could she
do that would show Lavine she did a great job. Lavine suggested
that a plane ticket to visit her family in Florida would be nice.
So that's what she got.
</P>
<P>
   It's a talent to make people come together and feel good, said
Lavine, who pointed out several people at lunch who don't typically
work on Fridays but who dropped by for the turkey dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Nakanishi said he has clients who read books and hire
consultants to create the kind of atmosphere found at the radio
station. His clients don't know how to do it because they don't
have it within them to give that kind of respect or dignity. If
they're not committed enough to change, they'll give up, he said.

<P>
   ``He is,'' says Urick, ``the best manager of a football
operation in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder says his plan for Kansas State's success included no
grandiose blueprint. ``There wasn't a vision that said, `We're
going to do this and this,''' he says. ``There wasn't any vision
for a national championship, conference championship, etc. That
wasn't the way it was structured in my mind. The reason I came to
Kansas State and what did I see that made me want to be here
primarily was people. I think it was just the opportunity to get to
know, to be around and listen to people I thought made a
difference, people who cared, people who were so genuine, and that
has all proven to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder says winning a national championship would be a
byproduct, not a goal. ``The driving force has been, `Let's get
better,''' he says. ``The goals have been, `Let's get better.' As
simple as it sounds and maybe as silly as it sounds, that really
has been it.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy. Kansas State, unlike Nebraska, which
considers itself the center of the college football universe, is
not in the hub of anything.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours west of Kansas City, Kansas State was best known as an
agricultural school and for winning a national championship in
debating, an acheivement proudly promoted with a sign on Interstate
70 just east of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get that sign off the highway,'' mutters Ballard
with a shake of his head and a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan is small-town rural America. A place where parents can
bring their children to a low-key Veterans Day parade that marches
up Poyntz Avenue in the center of town. A place where cows are part
of the campus scenery. A place that desperately wants to have a
national champion in football.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is slow at Pat's Blue Rib'n Barbecue in Aggieville, a
collection of bars, restaurants, and shops just off campus. It's
Wednesday night, still too early for the pre-Nebraska parties to
overflow along Moro Street, but not too early to talk about what
might happen if Kansas State wins _ or, perish the thought, loses _
against Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Fritchen, a 23-year-old senior, who works as a stringer on
Kansas State football games for the Associated Press and has
watched the slow rise of the program, is asked about the dark side
_ a possible K-State loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a deep, dark depression,'' he says. ``It would be
a whole week of mourning. I think it would be detrimental to the
whole community. This town goes into shock after the Nebraska
games.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why, Sam Felsenfeld, a senior who arrived here six
years ago from Southern California, gives the defining answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's all they have,'' he says, pointing out a quiet
street in the middle of town whose 15 minutes of fame is based on
the success of a its football team.
</P>
<P>
   But then the other option is mentioned. A Wildcat win. ``If we
win, don't park your cars in Aggieville on Saturday night,'' says
Felsenfeld. ``There would be parties to 6 or 7 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be almost a siege mentality here, especially
against the media who have been critical of Kansas State's soft
nonconference schedule and Snyder's micromanaging, ultrasecret
methods.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also a ``we don't give a hoot what you think''
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here, they don't even care,'' says Felsenfeld.
``Why don't they care? Because they get a `W' every week. They know
their reputation sucks and they don't like that. They think
everybody outside of Manhattan is whining about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be a stretch. But the general feeling outside Riley
County is that Kansas State has progressed to a level where it can
compete each year with Nebraska, Texas, Colorado, and the rest of
the upper-tier teams.
</P>
<P>
   Urick does not deny that. But he still remembers the day when
Kansas State football was such a poor commodity that Wildcat
officials had to ``sell'' their home games to Nebraska, switching
the site to Lincoln to guarantee a sellout crowd and a rewarding
payday.
</P>
<P>
   Most coaches and athletic directors will tell you they want
nonconference schedules that include games which are guaranteed
wins and challenges against high-profile competition. Not Kansas
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want games that are not in doubt,'' says Urick, who will
bring Temple, Utah, and UTEP to Manhattan next season and has UTEP,
Ball State, and Akron on the schedule in 2000. ``It might not be
appropriate (to schedule that way) for some schools. But it is for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Urick and everyone else realizes that beating Nebraska would
be a watershed event for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the game that validates us,'' says Ballard, who is
such a Kansas State fanatic that he posts the weekly BCS rankings
in his storefront window. ``The downside is just horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard also concedes that Kansas State, despite its success,
has yet to prove itself. It has won lots of games in the past five
years, but no league championships. ``We're not going to get any
respect until we are a champion,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Winning would be a giant step in that direction.

AFTER LOSS, THERE'S STILL NO FLUTIE FLAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ A customer walked into a grocery store
called Tops the other day, looking for a special product. Tops is
the place for special products: An entire section of the store is
reserved for international foods. But the woman did not want any
international foods. She was on a regional quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are your Flutie Flakes?'' she asked a clerk.
</P>
<P>
   She was told that the cereal named after Bills quarterback Doug
Flutie would be arriving in a couple of days. She nodded and walked
out of the store. Maybe she will return today or tomorrow, when
500,000 additional boxes of the flakes will be divided between here
and New England.
</P>
<P>
   So you wonder if Flutie's first loss as a starter _ last Sunday
against the Jets _ has affected his status as the Sports Prince of
western New York? You should not wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it first hit, it was like, `Boom!''' Bills receiver Kevin
Williams said of the Flutie fascination. ``It's a little more quiet
now, but I wouldn't say it's dying down. I don't think it's going
to die down. It's pretty steady.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams understands why thousands of people are drawn to
Flutie, the former Boston College star who will lead the 5-4 Bills
against the 5-4 Patriots Sunday. It starts with his size. Fans look
at a man who is just under 5 feet 10 inches, see him succeed
against men who are sometimes a half-foot taller, and can somehow
relate to that. It means that Flutie is an accessible pro. An
earthy athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you also have to like that resume,'' Williams said.
``Check out what the man has done. He wins. Hey, I'm a short guy
myself. As long as you win, that has nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Bills fans agree with that. No one here is calling
for backup QB Rob Johnson. Ask fans for the reason the Bills were
blown away by the Jets and you'll receive several non-Flutie
answers. One Bills supporter called in to a television talk show
which former Bill Steve Tasker was co-hosting. The question was
about Bruce Smith. You know, is he the same dominant defensive end
he was in the early 1990s? Is he slowing down? And then there were
questions about the running game. Shouldn't the Bills be running
the ball more to give Flutie a chance?
</P>
<P>
   Tasker assured the caller that Smith can still do a lot of
damage. And then he challenged the other linemen to step up and
give Smith some help. There was no blaming of Flutie. But early
Wednesday at the Bills' training complex, there was one questioner
who voiced what a few people had to be thinking. Are teams suddenly
figuring out Flutie's secret?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? Because we lost one game?'' Flutie answered. And that was
the end of that type of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Everything indicates that Flutie is still beloved. He usually
does not chat with the media on Thursdays, but a television
reporter wanted to ask him a question. About the wind. It was
blowing fiercely in practice and the reporter wanted to know if
that had an impact on Flutie's throws. Flutie told the man that he
had played football in Canada and that Buffalo's wind was no more
violent than Calgary's, Winnipeg's, or Hamilton's.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the story of a police department in Key West.
No, not Key West, N.Y. We're talking Key West, Fla. Someone from
the department called the Bills and requested an entire case of
Flutie Flakes. As Williams said, the requests are steady.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills can only hope that Flutie can do something drastic
about attendance. About 15,000 seats remain unsold for Sunday's
game, so there will be no local television. Fifteen thousand is a
lot of empties. But imagine how many there would be if Flutie were
not here.

LET THE COURTS DEAL WITH A POST-PRESIDENTIAL CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arlen Specter has a great idea: If there is reason to believe
that Bill Clinton is a criminal, then we ought to let the criminal
justice system deal with him.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, a Republican senator from Pennsylvania, is urging his
congressional colleagues to drop their impeachment inquiry into
allegations that the president committed perjury and related
crimes. Let Clinton serve out his term, Specter says, and then let
independent counsel Ken Starr prosecute the ex-president in the
same way that the government would prosecute any citizen accused of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's suggestion makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the American people have consistently told
pollsters that they believe Clinton should be held accountable for
his bad behavior but that they don't want him to be impeached and
removed from office. The Specter plan satisfies both concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Entrusting Clinton's fate to the courts would also address one
of the most often-heard rationales for impeaching Clinton:
Congress' determination to avoid creating the impression that the
president can get away with lawbreaking that regular Americans
would never get away with.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to face indictment and a criminal trial after
leaving office, there would be no question that he had been held
accountable _ no matter what the outcome of the trial. Guilty or
not guilty, he would have faced the music.
</P>
<P>
   OK, you're thinking, but can't Starr prosecute Clinton after he
leaves office anyway _ impeachment or no impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he can. But Specter believes that any chance of a
post-presidency criminal conviction would vanish if the Senate
failed to convict Clinton in an impeachment trial _ and most
experts are saying that Clinton would not be convicted in such a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Chances of a successful criminal prosecution also would be
compromised, Specter says, if the House Judiciary Committee were to
recommend impeachment and the full House failed to approve articles
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If the purpose of pursuing Starr's allegations against Clinton
is to hold him accountable for wrongdoing _ as opposed to simply
raking him over the coals politically _ then Specter's plan would
seem to serve the purpose far more effectively than an impeachment
proceeding that Clinton is likely to survive.
</P>
<P>
   So why haven't Specter's congressional colleagues embraced his
idea?
</P>
<P>
   That's easy: Bypassing impeachment and letting the courts deal
with Clinton would rob Congress of the opportunity for political
grandstanding that impeachment provides.
</P>
<P>
   Some House members _ including members of the Judiciary
Committee _ represent districts where many voters think of the name
``Clinton'' as an obscenity. Clinton-hating constituents might be
less than pleased to see their elected representatives walk away
from the chance to barbecue the First Philanderer via the
impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   If impeachment-hungry House members fully understood the results
of the Nov. 3 elections, however, they might not be trying to
impress the home folk by striving to deliver Clinton's head on a
platter. They might be trying to put as much distance between
themselves and impeachment as they could.
</P>
<P>
   The pols and pundits are still arguing about what, if any,
message the voters sent when they took five House seats away from
the Republican majority and handed them to Democrats. But one
message has won considerable acceptance: Don't impeach the
president.
</P>
<P>
   That possible message has fallen on deaf ears among the
pro-impeachment crowd, as has Specter's suggestion for extricating
Congress from the apparently doomed impeachment process while
ensuring that Clinton will answer for his sins.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe these folks prefer impeachment to criminal prosecution
because high crimes and misdemeanors are anything that Congress
says they are _ while allegations of criminal wrongdoing are
subject to stringent legal standards and demanding burdens of
proof.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe they're infatuated with the idea of televised
impeachment hearings.
</P>

MCGINEST'S RETURN MAY PUNCH UP LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Relief may be on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots may get defensive end Willie McGinest back for
Sunday's showdown in Buffalo, and fullback Tony Carter may not be
far behind. Throw that in with Vincent Brisby (probably) and Terry
Glenn (maybe), and some of the team's gaping holes will soon start
to get filled.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest, arguably the team's top pass rusher, has missed the
last three games with a groin injury. The Patriots have lost two of
those, sandwiched around a hold-your-nose-and-swallow victory over
the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Before McGinest's injury, the Patriots were averaging 3.5 sacks
a game. They've managed four in the last three, one in the last
two, and that singleton came when Atlanta quarterback Chris
Chandler was scrambling and happened to be tackled behind the line
of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks are enough rest, McGinest said. He missed five games
last year after not missing a game in his first four seasons.
(McGinest thus has missed eight games the last two years. The
supposedly injury-prone Glenn has missed 10.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try and give it a shot and see how it feels,''
McGinest said Thursday. ``I want to get out there. I'm not 100
percent. I don't know where it's at. But you get to the point where
you have to go out there and tolerate the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest had 3.5 sacks in the first six games, good for 23
yards. He was the best tackler on the defensive line. He can be a
havoc creator. Asked about the frustration of not being able to
help, he shrugged and said, ``Injuries happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on, ``We play a violent sport. This is not volleyball or
tennis or touch (football). This is 325-pound guys trying to slam
you to the ground. It's a violent sport, a brutal sport. Things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But he can't wait for the hitting to start again. Neither can
Carter, the free agent fullback brought in from Chicago to replace
Sam Gash. He tore a cartilage in his right knee during the Monday
night loss to the Jets and hasn't played since.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's spot has been filled by rookie Chris Floyd, but the
situation just hasn't been the same. In the three games Carter has
missed, the Patriots' rushing game has been downright horrific. In
their first six games, they averaged 115.2 yards a game, the
highlight being the 206-yard assault on the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three weeks, the Patriots have rushed for a total of
121 yards, including an anemic 26 against Miami and a pathetic 18
against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said if all the stars were aligned perfectly, he might be
able to go Sunday. More likely, he said, he'll return for the
following game, a Monday night rematch with the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, he said it has been very difficult to watch his team
try to run the ball without him leading the way. Carter had never
been hurt prior to this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the team is not doing well and you're not playing, that
makes it even harder,'' he said. ``It kind of compounds everything.
I'm ready to get back and help out.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe said the key to the Patriots' running game is
converting third downs. The quarterback's theory is that if you
have two so-so rushes and can get a first down on third down, it
enables you to stick with the running game. He also acknowledged
that Carter's absence has hurt, along with the injuries to
receivers Glenn, Brisby, and Troy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll is playing it coy as to who will be back
Sunday, saying most of the aforementioned will be game-time
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   While most of Patriot Nation anticipates watching Doug Flutie
Sunday, Carroll would also appreciate seeing some more familiar
faces on his side of the field. Judging by what was said Thursday,
he may have more than he had last week, if not everyone he wants
and needs.
</P>
<P>
   He'll take what he can get.

AT THIS POINT, BCS RANKINGS DON'T MEAN A THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gnashing of teeth over the Bowl Championship Series rankings
is starting to get irritating. First Ohio State, then No. 1 in the
polls, grumbles because it's No. 2 in the first BCS rankings. Then
it's UCLA's turn to moan. And now it's Kansas State, No. 1A in the
coaches' poll but No. 3 in this week's BCS rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Right now all of this is much ado about nothing. Chill out,
people. These things are going to change every week, and what's
wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   There's been more talk about rankings in midseason than ever
before. Is that so bad?
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like a good argument about who's No. 1. In the
old days, pollsters took all the heat. Now it's the computers that
are being attacked. Isn't it lovely?
</P>
<P>
   We've had three BCS rankings and three No. 1 teams. If Kansas
State beats Nebraska Saturday, it might change for the fourth time.
Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   But the point is, who cares? It's only mid-November. Games will
determine who's No. 1 and No. 2, which is the way it's supposed to
be.
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal situation, we'd have a playoff at the end of the
season. Pick the top 16 or top eight or top four teams and play it
down to one game. But that's not going to happen any time soon, so
we've got computer rankings and strength of schedule and lots of
griping from the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   So be it. Chances are we're going to have semi-clear No. 1 and
No. 2 teams and it will all work out. But if there's a controversy,
the computers will sort it out.
</P>
<P>
   We do see a few quirks that could be intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Like how about a team such as Florida winning the national
championship but not even finishing first in the Southeastern
Conference? Could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Or an even better one. How about the No. 1 team in the coaches'
poll not even making the national championship game, the Fiesta
Bowl, followed by the coaches giving the national championship
trophy to the winner of that game and ignoring their own No. 1
team?
</P>
<P>
   How could that happen? Simple. The coaches foolishly said the
Fiesta winner would be their No. 1 team, instead of taking the wise
course, which the writers followed, by saying that the No. 1 team
would be voted upon after the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A numbers game
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>

   Here's today's trick question: Which is higher, Tennessee's
third-down conversion rate or the graduation rate of its football
team? Here's a hint. The Vols graduated 11 percent of their
football players who entered the school in 1991 and left by 1997.
Answer: Tennessee's third-down conversion rate this season is 40.5
percent ... Big game in Knoxville Saturday _ top-ranked Tennessee
vs. 10th-ranked Arkansas. Both unbeaten, both in the Top 10, the
first time that has happened. And it's the first time two
undefeated SEC teams have met this late in the season since 1971,
when Alabama beat Auburn, 31-7. If you study recent history, the
Razorbacks' chances appear slim. Tennessee has won 36 straight
games in November ... Oklahoma is 3-6, and you have to figure that
coach  &UR; John Blake &LR;  has two games remaining in his Sooner coaching
career. The Board of Regents will meet shortly after the Nov. 21
season finale against Texas Tech, and the feeling here is that
Blake will be gone. Some people are mentioning  &UR; Lou Holtz  &LR; as a
possible successor. Now that would be interesting ... Poor  &UR; Chris
Weinke &LR; . Just when the Florida State quarterback was getting into a
groove, he suffers a season-ending neck injury. Weinke says he will
be back next season. But you have to wonder. He'll be a junior but
he'll also be 27 years old, which means that next year's freshmen
at FSU were entering second grade when Weinke was first recruited
by Seminoles coach  &UR; Bobby Bowden &LR; . ``It seemed like everything was
falling into place,'' said Weinke, who had thrown 19 touchdown
passes in leading the Seminoles back from their September disaster
against North Carolina State ... UCLA coach  &UR; Bob Toledo &LR;  is as
worried as Bruins fans about the team's narrow escapes. ``We're
playing on the edge,'' he said. ``We're our worst enemy.'' Next to
USC.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Not a perfect ending
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a shocker. Ohio State coach  &UR; John Cooper &LR;  is taking some
heat after the Buckeyes lost their first game of the season last
week, 28-24, to Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   The gloom around Columbus is so thick that not even the
possibility of going to the Rose Bowl seems to excite Buckeye fans,
who had been planning a trip to the Fiesta Bowl Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was asked what he would say to those fans who maintain a
successful season is now impossible, admittedly not the smartest
question to ask the coach this week.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, neither was Cooper's answer. ``I don't worry about
those idiots,'' he said. ``What is a successful season? Would you
take 11-1? Is anything other than perfect, is that not a successful
season?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if the one loss comes to Michigan State _ or even worse,
Michigan _ I guess not.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Ohio State will need two Wisconsin losses and a win
over Michigan to even get to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
ABC is feeling the pressure
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of nervous people at ABC, which has all four BCS
games over the holidays. Not so much over the Fiesta Bowl, which
will take care of itself, and the Rose Bowl, which will be a hit no
matter who plays, but the Sugar and Orange Bowl matchups are
worrisome. The best possible scenarios for the Orange Bowl would be
Miami vs. Notre Dame or Miami vs. Florida, both of which are long
shots. The Sugar Bowl obviously would love to get Tennessee but
would settle for Notre Dame and Florida State ... Here's the kind
of year it's been in the Big East. It's the middle of November and
Rutgers has as many wins as Syracuse (5) ... People at Virginia
Tech want to know why the best team in the conference the last few
years can't get one appearance on CBS all season. CBS folks say
it's just the quirks of the schedule and that Tech's time will come
... Here's the irony of Boston College's season. Running back  &UR; Mike
Cloud  &LR; can run for nearly 1,300 yards in nine games but can't gain
2 yards in the two games that meant the most _ vs. Virginia Tech
and Notre Dame ... To some extent, the Heisman race remains in
doubt. Although Texas's  &UR; Ricky Williams &LR;  is the front-runner, he
can slip if he has a bad game against Texas Tech or Texas A&AMP;M.
Kentucky's  &UR; Tim Couch  &LR; can get back into it with a spectacular game
against Tennessee next week, and UCLA's  &UR; Cade McNown &LR;  needs to put
up big numbers against Washington and USC ...Nebraska a
double-digit underdog to Kansas State? Amazing.

INVESTOR HAS TOO MANY EGGS IN ONE BASKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 15, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 63 years old and will retire at the end of February of
1999. At that time, I will have combined pension and Social
Security benefits of approximately $32,000 a year. I have a 401(k)
account of approximately $180,000, and a taxable portfolio of
Vanguard funds worth a combined $50,000. My main priority is to
maximize my income, even to the jeopardy of the value of principal.
I am considering rolling all of the 401(k) assets into an IRA
invested in Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Bond fund, adding the
dividends o my income and deferring reduction to principal until
the date at which I must begin mandatory withdrawals. I understand
that the value of the principal would be vulnerable. My questions
are these: I estimate a yearly income of $14,000 to $16,000 from
the IRA. Is this accurate? Considering my priority, is there
another high yield fund I might consider? What is the worst-case
scenario for such an account?
</P>
<P>
   P.B., Somerset, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, you're correct -- and even a bit low at the moment --
in presuming that such an investment should bring you a yield in
the $14,000 to $16,000 range, which would represent an 8.3 percent
yield. As this is written the yield on the Vanguard High-Yield Bond
fund is 8.95 percent, which would bring you an annual yield in
excess of $20,000 if you made such an investment right now.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that pleasant news, I'm agin' it. Within the world of
fixed-income investments this represents putting all of your eggs
in a high-risk basket.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, its not for nothing that common parlance for
``high-yield bonds'' is ``junk bonds.'' Corporate bond funds carry
extra elements of risk, when compared to other fixed-income funds.
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, they react just as other bond funds do when
interest rates change -- losing value when they rise (or when
speculators feel they are likely to rise) and gaining value when
they fall or are speculated to fall. So why has the net asset value
of this fund fallen from a 1998 high in the neighborhood of $8.13 a
share to a current $7.74, after falling as low as $7.53? That's
because there are two additional elements of risk. One is that to a
far greater extent than any other fixed-income investment, junk
bonds not only track the stock market, but they track the viewpoint
of the more conservative stock market investors.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, they head south in tandem with the stock market, but they
are slower to recover than equities. Another risk factor is that
they fare poorly in times of economic downturns. While cautious
investors turn from stocks to bonds when the economy sours, they
look for government-guaranteed bonds, or for highly-rated corporate
bonds that have very little likelihood of defaulting. But junk
bonds, of course, are the lower-rated issues, issues on which the
bond rating companies have issued warnings that the prospect of
default is far from unlikely. Since we're operating somewhere near
the end of a very long economic expansion, it seems to me that the
prospects for a downturn, and perhaps even a prolonged downturn,
are strong enough that it would be foolish to put all your eggs in
this basket.
</P>
<P>
   What I usually suggest for fixed-income investors who are
willing to accept a reasonable degree of risk is a portfolio
dominated by government-guaranteed intermediate-term bonds such as
Ginnie Maes, with the balance of the portfolio divided at the
opposite ends of the risk spectrum -- part in short-term corporate
bonds or money markets and the balance in junk bonds. From such a
portfolio, you might expect an average yield of about 6.5 percent,
or $11,700 a year in your case. If you cranked up the formula a
bit, holding more junk bonds and less at the conservative end, you
might realize a portfolio-average 7 percent yield, or $12,600 a
year. That's as far as I think it's prudent to go.
</P>
<P>
   What are the worst-case scenario for you? Well, think back to
the worst period the last decade for junk bonds. In 1989 the
average junk bond fund lost .92 percent, and the next year it lost
10.01 percent. But remember, those are total returns, and presume
that distributions are reinvested. If you had taken your dividends
in cash during those years, an account with a $180,000 principal
value would fall below $120,000 by the end of the period. (It's
only fair to note that the average junk bond fund rebounded to a
36.65 percent total return in 1991, which would have boosted your
principal to the area of $147,500.) Finally, if you're going to go
the junk bond fund route, either as a part of your IRA portfolio or
as its sole investment, I think the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate
fund, in which I am an investor, is a good choice. Its managers
take a plain vanilla approach to investing, winning the top
five-star rating from Morningstar Mutual Funds. There are indeed
junk bond funds which will provide you with higher yields, but the
price of those higher payouts is a greater chance of long-term
erosion of principal. So whatever percentage of your IRA you decide
to put into junk bonds, I approve of your choice of fund.

   Q. My father reads your column every week and asked me to write
to you about my investment program. I am a 40-year-old flight
attendant with a major airlines, and my only savings are in a
401(k) program, to which my employer makes to contributions. I
contribute $250 a month to the program, with 50 percent going into
Fidelity Growth Company fund and the rest evenly divided between
Fidelity U.S. Equity Index and Fidelity Equity Income. The total
value of the account is now $35,900, with $12,900 in Growth, $8,700
in the index fund, $7,600 in Equity Income, and the rest in a life
insurance fund with an 8 percent yield. At the present rate and
with the investments listed, will I be able to retire when I am 65?

   A. Yours is a pretty typical retirement portfolio, and it shows
a typical problem -- a lack of real diversification. Although your
three funds spread your investments out among the stocks of
hundreds of different companies, they are frequently the same
companies, and they are always the same kind of companies -- large,
well-established U.S. stocks. This approach has worked wonderfully
for the past couple of years, because these large-cap stocks have
not only led the market but dominated it. But this is atypical.
More commonly, the market lead is passed back and forth from one
sector to another -- to small- and mid- caps, to the international
markets, from value-oriented stocks to growth issues, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Within those moves, smaller sectors also operate in their own
cycles, and the cycles of utility, health care, technology, and
other groups frequently fail to coincide with the broader market
trends.
</P>
<P>
   Thus you should be positioned not only to take advantage of
moves in the less dominant market sectors, but to avoid the
inevitable portfolio sag if you simply stick with the big guys.
Most retirement investors should broaden their portfolios to
include one or two good large-cap funds to serve as the ``core'' of
their portfolio -- perhaps representing 40 percent to 60 percent of
the total value. Then they begin to add the minor keys -- smaller-
cap stock funds, a couple of sectors (of which health care and
technology have long been the well-deserved favorites in recent
years) and international stocks. I suggest you follow this lead.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that correcting the balance of your 401(k) is a
fairly easy process; the bad news is that no amount of balancing is
likely to counter the fact that you probably aren't putting enough
money into the account. In twenty years, the 401(k) would be worth
$697,547, which may sound like a lot of money at this point. But
after two decades of inflation, it's not likely to seem that way.
If inflation runs at 4 percent, that sum would have the buying
power of. a current $318,315. Even if inflation averages only 3
percent, the buying power would be equivalent only to $386,214 of
today's money.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, you have to presume that inflation will continue to
run after you retire, so even if you think you could live on
something like $425 a week -- plus whatever Social Security might
amount to in the year 2023 -- you would have no protection against
the effect of inflation after you retire. So from my point of view,
you're just plain not saving enough.

KANSAS STATE OUT OF THE WILDERNESS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ The patrons at Bob's 24-Hour Diner were
munching on their chicken-fried steaks and Wednesday Specials when
someone switched to the Weather Channel on the television set above
the counter.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. Long-suffering Wildcat football fans no doubt were
checking to see if hell had frozen over.
</P>
<P>
   What else could explain that Kansas State had been established
as nearly a two-touchdown favorite over defending national
cochampion Nebraska Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State a double-digit favorite over Nebraksa?
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State picked over a team it had not beaten since four
days after Richard Nixon was elected to his first term as president
in 1968?
</P>
<P>
   But for those college football fans whose memory span can be
measured in nanoseconds, it would seem perfectly logical why coach
Bill Snyder's team is a heavy favorite over the Huskers.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State is tied for first in the nation in the coaches'
poll, is second in the writers' poll, and is third in the Bowl
Championship Series rankings. The Wildcats are 9-0 and lead the
country in scoring offense and defense. Nebraska is 7-2, banged up,
and a seeming shell of the dynastic force that dominated college
football for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But for those fans who can remember back even as recently as
1988 and recall the time when scoring points, much less winning
games, was an accomplisment out here among the children of the
corn, Kansas State's status as a contender for its first national
championship is indeed akin to hell cooling off.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   _From 1960-66, Kansas State was 8-60-1, including three winless
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _In one season (1962), the Wildcats were shut out six times.
</P>
<P>
   _In a five-year span from 1985-89, they were 4-50-1.
</P>
<P>
   _Some of the losses were to such powerhouses as Austin Peay,
Wichita State, Northern Illinois, and Northern Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   _During the 1940s, the Wildcats went through six coaches, who
won a total of 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   _Until a few years ago, Kansas State had the dubious distinction
of owning the worst record in the history of Division 1-A football.
</P>
<P>
   _Even now, with an unbeaten record this season and five
consecutive seasons of nine or more victories, Kansas State would
need 12-0 records until 2012 to reach the .500 level overall.
</P>
<P>
   All of which explains why fans offered no apologies when the
Wildcats rolled to a 66-0 win over Indiana State and a 73-7 win
over Northern Illinois earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stop running up the score when we get to .500,'' says
Steve Ballard, owner of Ballard's Sporting Goods in the section of
town known as Aggieville and a 1986 Kansas State graduate, who
confidently predicts a 38-17 victory. ``None of our fans feels very
sympathetic toward the downtrodden.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Ballard if he remembers the dark days and he laughs. ``We've
only had nine good years,'' he says. ``And I'm older than 9 years
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard says he has vague memories of Kansas State's last
victory over Nebraska, in 1968. Otherwise, ``we were so bad, we
couldn't get a snap off,'' he says. ``We couldn't run on the field.
Austin Peay came up here and beat us. Austin Peay. We were an
embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to describe how bad Kansas State was and how far it
has come would be to project 10 years into the future and imagine a
team like Temple contending for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   This has served to increase the anticipation _ and the concern _
about what will happen at Kansas State Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably hasn't been a bigger game here in 100 years,''
says athletic director Max Urick, who came here five years ago and
has overseen an explosion of new facilities and restored pride in
Kansas State football. A $12.8 million expansion project will
increase capacity of 43,000-seat Kansas State Stadium to 50,000 by
next season. A master plan calls for eventual expansion to 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the football program has raised self- esteem
and pride on campus among the alumni and the faculty,'' says Urik.
``The pride they feel is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Project for Kansas State football began 10 years
ago when Snyder arrived, taking almost dictatorial control of a
program that few people knew about and even fewer seemed to care
about.
</P>
<P>
   That was fine with Snyder, who abhors the tiniest distractions;
whose vigilance is so intense that he reportedly has the daily
police call logs faxed to him so he can check on the misdeeds of
any of his athletes; who is such a control freak that he would make
George Steinbrenner look like an absentee owner as he oversees all
facets of the football program; who is so obsessed with winning and
building a program that hours after the Wildcats destroyed
Syracuse, 35-18, in last season's Fiesta Bowl, he was back in his
hotel room studying tapes; who is so detail-oriented that before
the team arrived for the Fiesta Bowl, he requested street maps of
Tempe, Ariz., so he could chart the most time-efficient route to
practice; who is so wary of media intrusions that he has made
quarterback Michael Bishop, a potential Heisman Trophy candidate,
off limits to them since three days before the Colorado game Oct.
10.

 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, November 15, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever I write about electric cars anymore, I trigger a batch
of letters from environazis who, regardless of what the piece may
actually say, offer the same tiresome shrieks usually beginning
with: ``As you are an advocate (or tool of) the oil lobby. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Next comes a recitation of alleged research findings, dire
environmental warnings, testimonials, and more accusations _ I am a
tool of (take your pick) Detroit, the oil companies, OPEC, big
business, Republicans, Democrats, the oligarchy, military
industrial complex, etc. What really generates hate mail is mention
of the term ``Green Gestapo.'' The fuzzy-brained extremists who
advocate battery-powered cars, suspension of logging, banning of
beef, and all jokes that may possibly offend someone, somewhere,
just hate to be identified with those Nazi thugs who interfered
with free speech, burned books, and murdered people. But what do
you call someone who hammers spikes into trees to kill loggers,
advocates gagging columnists who disagree with the politically
correct point of view, or who would condemn a whole class of people
to unemployment because they killed cute little seals? (Killing
flounder is OK, though; they're ugly.)
</P>
<P>
   By way of disclosure, I must admit that I do chat with the guys
at the gas station and I once did meet the guy who delivered my
heating oil _ but now I heat with gas and see nobody from that
utility. That's as close to the oil business as I ever got. I own
no oil stocks, no shares in auto companies, and am on no payrolls
other than the Globe Newspaper Co.
</P>
<P>
   I was mulling all of this last week as I was tooling around New
England in a high-tech hybrid four-passenger sedan with good
performance, a real heater, air conditioning, a smog-defeating
electric motor, and a clean-burning gas engine reportedly capable
of 66 miles per gallon plus. It is not a car of the future; it is a
Toyota Prius, a car of now _ today. It's on sale in Japan and
Toyota can't build them fast enough to keep up with demand. It's
slated to come here in 2000, probably selling for around
$16,000-$17,000.
</P>
<P>
   So why was the initial mention of this vehicle in this column in
September still another occasion of tool-of-the-oil-barons mail? Do
you suppose that some of these partisans of green are perhaps tools
of the power lobby? After all, the Prius will never need an outlet;
it recharges its own batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Prius is what is known as a parallel hybrid _ an internal
combustion engine and electric motor work together. In the Toyota
model, a unique transmission is the key, a transaxle that splits
power from the internal combustion engine between the drive wheels
and the charging system. The amount of power varies according to
demand.
</P>
<P>
   The power system consists of a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder gas engine,
electric motor, generator, inverter, and nickel metal hydride
battery. Driving it presents some differences, but no difficulties
_ if you forget for a moment that the test vehicle was a right-hand
drive model intended for the Japanese market, complete with
Japanese labels and radio designed for the home islands band
widths. But, there are dual radio controls, presumably for
passenger and driver. Toll booths did present some problems; I
could have used one of those long-handled baskets you sometimes see
in the hands of church ushers collecting donations.
</P>
<P>
   One turns the key and the dash lights up but the engine may or
may not start _ you don't care; it doesn't matter. From a dead stop
you'll be working off electric power anyway and as soon as you put
it in drive and press the pedal, the motor will purr to life. Under
light loads, it is an electric car _ read that as city driving,
level ground ,or downhill. On the highway at speed, all systems are
go; in hard acceleration, electric and gas power combine to afford
performance. At stop lights, the gas engine shuts down until called
upon _ no pollution idling.
</P>
<P>
   The digital speedometer offers the speed in kilometers; I'm
humming along a secondary road _ avoiding toll booths _ when a
police officer traveling the other way flashes his lights; a quick
recalculation of speed shows I am indeed indicating more Ks than
the zone warrants. Very civilized, flashing lights _ he must've
been the chief who set the ticket quotas rather than the patrol
officer who must fill them.
</P>
<P>
   On Interstate 95, the Prius accelerates well, moves with the
traffic. Climbing hills with that traffic, the car hums and groans,
but stays with the crowd. A VDT on the dash explains the operating
modes of the powertrain _ except that the explanation is in
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The gear shift offers park, reverse, neutral, and drive
positions _ plus a B position; that's to add engine braking on
downhill runs. The right hand drive setup still has the pedals in
the same relative position but the signal and wiper control stalks
are the reverse of usual providing occasions of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Headroom and legroom are good up front, fair in the rear; four
adults do fit and the car accelerates well with four hefty adults
on board. Handling is very good and the ride surprisingly good in
such a small vehicle _ the wheels are at extreme ends of the car
with virtually no overhang, thus lengthening the wheelbase to the
maximum to smooth the ride. Underway, Prius is quiet, civilized _
fun, even.
</P>
<P>
   The glove box is tiny and interior storage scant, but the trunk
is surprisingly roomy. The Prius is about the overall size of a
Beetle but with four doors and more room.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to extending fuel mileage, the Prius offers some
interesting advantages over a pure electric _ not the least of
which are an 850-mile range winter or summer, instant refueling,
real heat and AC, all the amenities, and real-car performance.
Prius does not need a formidable array of prohibitively expensive
batteries, nor does it require frequent deep discharge of its sole
battery, the factor that does the most to shorten battery life. The
battery, Toyota says, will likely last the useful life of the car.
</P>
<P>
   And, since it doesn't need external recharging facilities, no
new infrastructure need be built, a condition of electrics. Since
the power companies needn't provide the juice for Prius, it will
not be necessary to increase output and consequent pollution nor
will you ever be asked to park your Prius in a summer brown-out. Of
course, the utility profit potential will be lost, too, which may
be what really stirs up the campaign for useless golf carts
disguised as cars.
</P>
<P>
   When the oil does finally peter out, fuel will be found, albeit
more expensive than a buck a gallon. At 66 miles per gallon or
better in something like a Prius, we can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give the Prius a pair of thumbs up. A pox on the pure
electric car. OK, the letter opener's at the ready, folks. Let 'er
rip with the hate mail.

A POIGNANT RIDE BACK FOR VIETNAM VETERANS 
</HEADLINE>

 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Francis Love was in Vietnam 31 years ago, he was dodging
bullets as an infantry platoon leader stationed near Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned last winter, the Harvard, Mass., resident
brought his bike along.
</P>
<P>
   Love and a group of about 50 American veterans, as well as
world-class cyclist Greg LeMond, made a 16-day, 1,200-mile trek
from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. Sponsored by World T.E.A.M. Sports
and Sports Illustrated, the trip was documented by the filmmakers
who produced ``Hoop Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting film, ``Vietnam Long Time Coming,'' will be
screened in Boston Monday and televised nationally by NBC Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Love, 55, said he was not an avid cyclist but was intrigued when
he heard about the trip. After being accepted in September 1997, he
went on a training regimen of riding up to eight hours a day once a
week and for an hour and a half three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it turned out that I didn't need to have all that
conditioning,'' said Love. He said the group cycled about 75 miles
a day and had frequent stops for snacks and water _ the
temperatures ranged from 85 to 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was more impressed with the disabled people in
the group; some amputees rode hand cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could do as well or better than anyone,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   He was equally impressed with three-time Tour de France winner
LeMond, whom Love described as ``a down-to-earth guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure (the pace) must have been frustrating to him since
he's in great shape,'' said Love. But, he added, LeMond would offer
a push to a struggling rider going uphill and tried to appreciate
what it was like for the veterans to return to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, a Vietnam vet who rode with the group on the
last day, will be among those at a screening of ``Vietnam Long Time
Coming'' Monday at 6:30 p.m. at the theater in The New England
Financial building at 501 Boylston St. Ticket prices are $150, with
proceeds benefiting World T.E.A.M. Sports, a nonprofit organization
that specializes in sporting events for disabled people.

   &UR; Lance Armstrong &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who battled _ with amazing success _ on his
bike all summer, has not forgotten his battle against cancer. The
two-time Olympian and survivor of testicular cancer last month
awarded two research grants of $50,000 each at the Urologic
Oncology Symposium in Washington. Armstrong, who was stricken with
cancer in 1996, formed the Lance Armstrong Foundation to promote
research and education. One of its keystone events is the Ride for
the Roses weekend in Austin, Texas, which raised $300,000 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who had to sit out last year while he underwent
chemotherapy, got back on his bike with a vengeance this year. He
won the Tour of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz stage race in
Germany, and the Cascade Classic in Bend, Ore. He wrapped up the
season in October with a fourth-place finish in both the road race
and time trial at the world championships.

French Cofidis team last year and placed 17th in the Tour de
France. His outstanding finish was overshadowed by fellow American
and teammate  &UR; Bobby Julich's  &LR; third-place finish. The Postal
Service team also added  &UR; Julian Dean &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 23, the national US pro
criterium champion this season, who had ridden for the Mercury
team. Other newcomers are  &UR; Dylan Casey  &LR; of New Zealand,  &UR; Glenn
Magnusson  &LR; of Sweden, and  &UR; Frank Hoj  &LR; of Denmark.

CHRISTOPHER REEVE: MAN OF ACTION ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Christopher Reeve and
Daryl Hannah in ``Rear Window.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For the first time since the horseriding accident in l995 that
left him paralyzed and unable to walk, Christopher Reeve is back in
the starring spot in a movie- ABC's ``Rear Window,'' airing Nov.
22.
 &HT;    In this remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic l954 thriller,
Reeve plays architect Jason Kemp who has been left a quadriplegic
after a catastrophic car crash. He shares the spotlight with
gorgeous Daryl Hannah, (reprising the role made famous by Grace
Kelly) as a man who, though confined to his room, witnesses what he
believes is a brutal murder.
 &HT;    Last year Reeve went behind the camera to direct the HBO movie
``In the Gloaming,'' a gem that brought him an Emmy nomination for
best director.
 &HT;    In the l997 TV film, ``Snakes and Ladders,'' he played a small
role as a quadriplegic who becomes a mentor to young man paralyzed
in a diving accident.
 &HT;    But this time he's back as the star, above the title, the
position he occupied before a balking horse changed his life
forever. Reeve was Superman on and off screen. The man who could
leap tall buildings in a single bound was in real life a real man
of action, flying gliders as well as jets, sky diving, sailing and
skiing, until, in the cruelest of ironies, he fell during a
relatively simple horse show, breaking the top two vertebrae of his
spinal column.
 &HT;    His courage has been challenged as never before. And ``Rear
Window,'' he says, allowed him to incorporate into the character
many of the terrifying things he himself has experienced. ``I
wanted to do this film because many times disabled people are shown
in a somewhat pathetic light or they're bitter or angry,'' he
explains. ``But this character is really more positive _ a
resourceful man who has been through the ringer. This movie shows
how far someone can come in reclaiming his life.''
 &HT;    Speaking from his home amid the woods of Bedford, N.Y., Reeve
has made incredible progress since the accident. Many thought he
wouldn't live out the year let alone have a career.
 &HT;    Now as an actor he has a unique opportunity to show an audience
at least a small part of what being a quadriplegic really entails.
For him this is not just acting.
 &HT;    ``Jason's experiences are very close to mine,'' he says. ``For
example, he experiences a 'pop off.' This means that some part of
the hose he depends on for breathing becomes separated from the
vent, or a hole develops in the hose. That's happened to me a
number of times. I stopped getting air and had absolutely no
breath.
 &HT;    ``And when we did that scene in the movie we did it for real.
The poor actor playing the nurse was terrified, but I told her it
was perfectly safe. There were actually nurses around and others
who could reconnect the vent in a second. I can also breathe off
the vent for short periods of time, so there was no real danger.
But when you see the pop-off on the screen, it's real. I'm actually
not breathing.''
 &HT;    It certainly takes Hitchcock's concept of the thriller a step
beyond. ``I think audiences will see what it's really like to go
through some of these very anxious moments,'' says Reeve. ``They
will see how those moments can be lonely and frustrating when
someone is just learning to cope with the situation.''
 &HT;    In the original film James Stewart played a photographer who was
sidelined with a broken leg. ``Our movie updates the story. The
idea is to raise the stakes,'' says Reeve. ``To do the same story
but with a ... quadriplegic puts the lead character in so much more
jeopardy. We wanted to create something exciting that forges new
ground.''
 &HT;    Hannah says Reeve was a joy to work with. ``He has a sparkle in
his eye that is sort of hypnotic and it kind of shoots out across
the room and tantalizes and hypnotizes you. He's got so much energy
and life it's just intoxicating.''
 &HT;    In his own life of course, Reeve has become a hero to millions
around the world since his accident. Besides directing, he has
narrated the film ``Without Pity,'' a plea for the disabled to
enjoy more rights in society. He's also penned a best-selling
autobiography, ``Still Me,'' which has helped ease his huge medical
bills.
 &HT;    In between he crisscrosses the country campaigning for a
national spinal cord registry and other legislation to help further
rights for the handicapped. His 37 year old wife Dana, (``my
rock'') is now rehearsing for a Broadway show, ``More to Love,''
and their son Will, 6, is at school. He also sees a lot of his
children from a previous relationship, Matthew l8, and Alexandra
15.
 &HT;    Reeve says of his wife: ``We're very much in love. Whether I
have zero recovery or full recovery our relationship will
survive.''
 &HT;    Progress, he says, is slow but perceptible. When he turned 43,
just four months after the accident, he couldn't blow out his
candles. Now when they wheeled in a cake for his 46th birthday he
proudly blew out the lot.
 &HT;    Through practice, he can now breathe without the ventilator for
up to 30 minutes a day. He exercises for three hours daily and is
now able to sneeze _ something he couldn't do a couple of years
ago.
 &HT;    But he still loses his cool when people, some of them doctors,
describe his quest as futile. And he insists he doesn't worry about
his medical insurance running out. ``By that time,'' he says,
``I'll be up and walking.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will complete America's
generation-long reconciliation with Vietnam at a Pacific-wide
economic conference in Malaysia this week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is slated to work side-by-side for the first time with

leaders in four Asian countries and raised questions about American
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of U.S. foreign trade _ or $956 billion last year _
takes place with APEC partners, including Canada, Japan, Mexico and
China.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is joining the economic and trade cooperation
organization for the first time, in part as a result of Khai's
efforts to open his nation to the world after a generation of
isolation. A Russian-trained economist and career communist, Khai
has built a reputation as an efficient, non-ideological reformer
known for savvy dealings with the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   This will make the American president and the Vietnamese leader
equal partners in an international endeavor for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam war, which ended in 1975 when communist North
Vietnamese forces defeated U.S.-backed South Vietnam to unite the
divided nation, claimed the lives of more than 58,000 American
troops and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese soldiers and
civilians. Clinton's efforts to avoid military service during the
conflict became an issue in his election campaign in 1992 and his
re-election campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the APEC forum will be the first time that leaders from the
two nations have worked together since the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vietnam's admission into APEC marks the nation's passage into
a broader economic relationship with trading partners in the
Asia-Pacific region, and not just narrowly with the United
States,'' the State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Le Dzung, spokesman at Vietnam's embassy in Washington, D.C.,
said his nation sees the session as a breakthrough with the United
States. Dzung said the two nations' symbolic rapprochement could be
dramatized if APEC's Malaysian hosts seat Clinton and Khai
side-by-side at the conference table.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is formally known as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam _
a diplomatic moniker that would put Khai down the table from the
president of the United States, if they are seated in alphabetical
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we prefer the name, `Vietnam,''' Dzung explained. ``So we
think Vietnam will be seated in alphabetical order next to the
United States.''

</P>
<P>
   Clinton's participation at a meeting with Khai culminates a
carefully orchestrated diplomatic minuet that has led to resumption
of full diplomatic relations between Washington and Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam set the stage for
the Clinton-Khai meeting with a visit to Washington, D.C., in
September. Cam won a coveted meeting at the White House with
national security adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, as well as
meetings with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense
Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration lifted a Vietnam war-era trade
embargo on Vietnam last March a year after Hanoi agreed to repay
more than $145 million in South Vietnam's wartime debts to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese official's visit reciprocated earlier visits to
Vietnam in 1997 by Albright and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   After consultations with APEC partners, Clinton plans visits to
Japan and South Korea in part to cement economic and security ties
with two long-standing U.S. allies that have been alarmed by North
Korea's menacing, surprise launch of a long-range missile capable
of delivering nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Khai come to the APEC conference with sharply
different experiences during the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, 52, opposed U.S. participation in the Vietnam war and
helped organize anti-war demonstrations in London in the late 1960s
while studying at Oxford University in England as a Rhodes Scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won a disputed draft deferment with the help of Sen.
William J. Fulbright, D-Ark., for whom Clinton had worked as a
junior aide.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won the presidency in 1992 despite political critics'
accusations that he had been a ``draft dodger'' during the Vietnam
era. The first American president born since the end of World War
II, Clinton was the first of the last nine presidents to enter
office without active duty military service.
</P>
<P>
   Khai, 64, elected prime minister in 1997, fought French colonial
forces in South Vietnam after World War II, studied for five years
at the National Institute of Economics in the Soviet Union in the
1960s and returned to a series of government posts in Hanoi during
the final years of U.S. participation in the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   Khai moved to South Vietnam after U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
in 1972 to serve as a member of the communist's underground
provisional government and then returned to Hanoi in 1974 to help
coordinate communist plans to reunify the country.

WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT TV'S APPALLING QUALITY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 50 years after commercial television invaded American
life, an obvious question is why so much of it _ especially on the
networks _ is so arid, vacuous and bleak. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A less obvious question is whether the soulless sex- and
violence-laden dreck that fills prime time TV matters any more,
given the explosion of alternative information and entertainment
choices. (Yes, it does, but maybe not as much.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast industry, after all, has atomized. This means more
people can ignore the insipid debris on commercial TV by choosing
instead to plug into satellites, get specialized cable channels
(the History Channel is a wholesome example) and surf the Internet
(sometimes on a medium-blurring device called Web TV). Though, of
course, those sources also harbor sludge amid more uplifting
offerings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hopeful evidence, as ratings show, is that some formerly
heavy TV viewers may be making better choices, leaving behind the
network offal of murder and body fluids as entertainment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans,'' says Henry Labalme, executive director of a
nonprofit advocacy group, TV-Free America, ``are finally moving
beyond the old debates about whose show is better than whose and
recognizing that all TV-watching displaces interactions and
activities that are simply healthier, more productive and more
fun.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In short, some folks are discovering a liberating truth: Much of
commercial TV is cultural pollution. Indeed, says Labalme's group,
this past April a record five million people joined in National
TV-Turnoff Week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody,'' he says, ``ever lay on their death bed wishing they
had spent more time watching Geraldo Rivera or Rosie O'Donnell.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even if repugnant situation comedies and violent dramas are
a smaller percentage of what's on network TV, they're still there,
drawing millions of viewers. Why? No doubt for many reasons, but
one is compellingly clear: Much of our culture _ because it relies
on lowest-common-denominator commercial success _ is equally vapid
and disheartening. (How else to explain brand loyalty to products
that clog arteries or cause lung cancer?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sobering reality is that commercial TV offers a reasonably
accurate picture of who we are _ a people mired in a culture of
celebrity, afraid of life-affirming risk, leery of real creativity
and willing to do almost anything to avoid hard questions about
ultimate meaning. Cowering in living rooms, demanding to be
anesthetized by cheap, tawdry entertainment, people who watch the
drivel on commercial TV get what they deserve because they buy the
products for which the medium creates demand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And let's be clear: Commercial TV's main function has not
changed from the late 1940s, when Jack Benny and Milton Berle were
becoming its first stars. It exists to sell brand-name soap. Well,
soap, beer and cars, not to speak of aspirin, computers and soft
drinks. It is nothing less than a magnet advertisers use to attract
a critical mass of customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everything else is secondary. Everything. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This role explains much of the astonishingly puerile, stupefying
prime time shows I watched recently to reacquaint myself with the
sort of bilge I have refused to watch for decades. They all seem to
be about nothing but irresponsible, casual sex. Some highlights: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ On ``Suddenly Susan,'' an NBC show, a sidekick character
observes star Brooke Shields' unmarried character's
out-of-the-ordinary breakfast and concludes it means but one thing:
``You're having sex! Way to go!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shield's lying response: ``The closest thing I have to a sex
life is when my Thighmaster slips.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ On ABC's ``Home Improvement,'' the unmarried sister of star
Tim Allen's TV wife has sex in Allen's house with Allen's unmarried
TV brother. Allen dismisses it as inconsequential. Allen's wife
tells him, ``You'd be comfortable doing it with a relative in the
room.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ On ``Clueless,'' a UPN show on which actors without skill
recite lines without meaning to advance a story without plot, a
euphemism for sex is ``going downtown.'' When the female star (Who
cares what her name is?) gets interrupted while waiting for a kiss,
she says, ``Hello! Girl and tongue waiting!'' The to-be-continued
episode ends when fake human feces (soon eaten by an actor) in a
swimming pool breaks up a party. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Spin City,'' an ABC show, opens with star Michael J. Fox's
unmarried character telling a slim, unmarried model, ``Look, just
because we've been on a couple of dates doesn't mean there's any
pressure.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She responds by removing her blouse. We next see her lying on a
bed in just her bra and panties. The actual intercourse, bless ABC,
occurs off camera. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That was amazing,'' he says afterward. She yodels, explaining,
``I like to yodel after sex.'' He responds, ``I prefer the wave,''
and raises both his arms. Later she complains to him, ``You don't
know anything about me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But already I know too much: She has apparently unprotected sex
with anyone she wants, then wonders why her sex partners don't get
to know her. Such people once were called tramps and wolves; now
they're stars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notice I've said nothing about daytime TV's lurid soap operas or
the animated Comedy Central hit ``South Park,'' in one episode of
which the muffled, elementary-school character Kenny uses vulgar
anatomical language to describe female body parts he likes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a sad use of a potentially (and sometimes an actually)
marvelous medium. If, as one A.C. Nielsen study shows, children
watch nearly 4 hours of TV a day (other studies report the time has
fallen to 90 minutes), it's no wonder that 95 percent of Americans
between the ages of 13 and 17 can name the actor who played the
Fresh Prince of Bel Air on TV (Will Smith) but only 2 percent can
name the chief justice of the United States (William Rehnquist). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Television,'' Marshall McLuhan once said, ``is teaching all
the time.'' Indeed, one of its lessons should be this: Art doesn't
require a laugh track. But a recent ``New Yorker'' article quotes
Jamie Tarses, ABC Entertainment president, as essentially saying
viewers are idiots: ``People will wonder, Am I supposed to think
this is funny or serious? People need the comforting aural cue of
laughter.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The technology to deliver all this is improving rapidly. We're
moving toward wide availability of High Definition Television
(HDTV), Digital Video Discs (DVD) and ``Flat TV,'' which uses
plasma, or charged gas, to light color pixels that make up images. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what difference will that make if we burn time watching this
still-vast wasteland's rubbish? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 years ago, author E.B. White saw a demonstration of TV
and declared, ``We shall discover either a new and unbearable
disturbance of the general peace or a saving radiance in the
sky.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget the saving radiance. After all, commercial TV's
spiritually empty role is to collect zombies to buy the advertised
products, a job built on the lie that more stuff will make us
happy. But whether TV continues to be an unbearable disturbance is
up to us. Our job, after all, is to be discerning and responsible
in this new era of choices. &QL;

   US-IRAQ _ WASHINGTON _ As the U.S. continued its military
build-up in Peresian Gulf Friday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
said he was not trying to stop cooperation with the United Nations
and would accept ``positively any initiative'' that would lead to
the lifting of U.N. sanctions. In his first public statement in the
latest dispute over U.N. weapons inspections, the official Iraqi
News Agency quoted Saddam as saying his recent decisions to
restrict the activities of U.N. weapons inspectors ``were intended
to get responses to Iraq's legal demands.'' Without eleaborating,
Saddam apparently referred to Iraq's often-stated demand that
punishing U.N. trade sanctions imposed eight years ago be lifted.
In essence, the statement mirrored earlier Iraqi declarations since
the crisis began. But both President Clinton and U.S. Secretary
State Madeleine Albright today insisted that airstrikes can only be
averted if Iraq rescinds its decision to halt arms inspections.
Meanwhile, U.S. troops, ships and planes were converging on the
Gulf for a possible attack on Iraq after President Clinton said he
was ready to use force to compel Baghdad to submit to arms
inspectors. LEDE-ALL. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   RUSSIA-IRAQ _ MOSCOW _ Although Russia _ one of Iraq's
staunchest defenders _ maintains that it catagorically rejects the
use of military violence against Iraq, Russia's statements have
been a bit more tempered. That is likely due to the fact that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein broke the deal with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and there aren't many diplomatic channels left. Still,
Russia sought to mediate the crisis by sending letters to Hussein
encouraging diplomacy. Developing. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   MIDEAST-IRAQ _ JERUSALEM _ The Wye peace process appears to be
one reason why Arab countries have been less critical of the United
State's pressure on Iraq than they were nine months ago. The
difference in their tone was highlighted this week when the Gulf
countries, Syria and Egypt signed a statement saying that Iraq will
be at fault if there are air strikes. If the U.S. keeps pressure on
Israel to maintain the peace process, the theory goes, it will be
more accepted around the region for the U.S. to also pressure Iraq.
Israeli papers have reported that Clinton and Albright have both
told Netanyahu that they need him to implement Wye in order to keep
a tough line on Iraq. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

is a lot of ``unfinished business'' in the South. It may the cradle

principal region of poverty. And while Jim Crow is dead, there is

these fees are unfair. Bell South is refusing to pay, and SBC
Communciations is putting its money into an escrow account rather

that will remain 60 miles high for up to 100 days and circle the
Earth four or five times. The Ultra-Long Duration Balloon, ``ULDB''
in NASA acryonese, will be made of polyethylene fabric the
thickness of sandwich wrap and strong enough to withstand enormous
pressure variations that occur between day and night in the
stratosphere. It will cost only about $360,000 and carry one ton of
scientific gear and support equipment. It will be manufactured at a
Raven plant in Sulfur Springs. Proponents of ultra-long duration
balloons think that, in addition to cheap space research, the
balloons eventually could be right for many other uses, including
as relay stations for radio telephone networks. (Nesmith, Cox News

DEMISE OF CELLPRO IS A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOTHELL, Wash. _ CellPro's demise is a cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a microcosm for biotechnology in general,'' said Nicole
Provost, a former CellPro biochemist and bioengineer. ``It's a good
example of how a small technicality can bring a company down.''
</P>
<P>
   CellPro's bankruptcy shows what can happen when competing
interests fight over taxpayer-funded research. It also raises
questions about the best way to ensure federally funded research
benefits the public.
</P>
<P>
   The technology that launched CellPro originated at Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, with a grant from the federal
government. Technology transfer programs have been developed at all
major research institutions to find ways to move promising research
from lab to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We license this technology to companies, especially a startup,
but how it develops totally depends on their business strategy,''
said Catherine Hennings, director of technology transfer for Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.``The question is, when we
license to a startup, should we try to stay more involved, if not
better informed, regarding the decisions the company is making in
its business strategy?''
</P>
<P>
   In its last licensing deal, Fred Hutchinson did exactly that,
obtaining an observer seat on the board of directors of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The CellPro experience could have other repercussions for
technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government asks universities to give prference to
smaller startup companies when granting licenses, said Frederick
Savage, deputy general counsel for Johns Hopkins University. But
universities know that smaller companies don't have the same
ability to fight a patent issue in court, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter and Becton Dickinson _ both multi-billion dollar
companies _ were able to finance the patent battle against CellPro,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others fear the CellPro case sets a precedent that could inhibit
innovation in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If a company can license a discovery from a university, then
turn around and raise the price when they sublicense to another
party, eventually it could make it too costly for small companies
to get licenses, said Tom Kiley, patent attorney and former member
of CellPro's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The CellPro case also illustrates how unpredictable the outcome
can be when the law and the laboratory mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all could be faced with a patent disaster,'' said George
Rathmann, chairman of Bothell-based ICOS, and one of the founders
of Amgen, the Thousand Oaks, Calif., based biotech giant.
</P>
<P>
   If a case goes to court, ``you had your chance, so in one sense,
the system is a just system,'' he said. ``But it doesn't mean every
decision is hands-down fair and wonderful in all respects.''

CELLPRO _ A BIOTECH DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOTHELL, Wash. _ Rick Murdock's voice echoes as he walks through
the abandoned labs at the former CellPro headquarters in Bothell,
northeast of Seattle. Wearing his trademark dark suit, white shirt
and tie, he looks like the consummate chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Except he has no business left to run.
</P>
<P>
   He steps over stray styrofoam packing peanuts that weave a trail
in and out of empty cubicles, past white lab coats tossed limply
over chairs, and rows of barren lab benches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be a busy place,'' he says, waving at the shelves
of half-used solvents and reagents waiting to be inventoried.
``It's not a pretty sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the lake in Seattle, Dr. William Bensinger fumes, hemmed
in by stacks of scientific journals in his office at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, Bensinger and his colleagues made a discovery
that became the basis for CellPro's product. Today, he is eager to
use CellPro's device in an experimental treatment that may offer
hope to patients with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone
marrow, or other fatal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Except he can't begin his experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Because CellPro lost a bitter five-year lawsuit over a specific
antibody used in the device, Bensinger will not be able to
undertake certain experimental treatment programs he had hoped to
start. Eventually, the technology he helped launch will be taken
off the market completely, ending what some consider to be one of
the most promising new avenues for treating cancer and other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few months, CellPro expects to finalize its
Chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal court in Seattle. When it does, it
will close the books on what was once one of Seattle's largest and
most prosperous biotechnology companies.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro's route to bankruptcy was tortuous and complex. It
involved greed, ego, bull-headed business decisions and
questionable legal advice, depending on who points the finger.
</P>
<P>
   The company's demise raises questions about everything from how
well the patent system handles the nuances of molecular biology to
the best way to ensure that taxpayer-funded research furthers
public health. It also offers a glimpse of a medical marketplace
driven by equal parts science and swagger.
</P>
<P>
   People in the biotechnology industry don't like to talk about
what happened at CellPro in the same way doctors don't like to talk
about the patient who didn't recover.
</P>
<P>
   It's the dark side of technology transfer - what happens when
the interests of commerce and research collide. It could have
happened to any one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning
</P>
<P>
   At first, the discovery that launched the patent war between
CellPro and Baxter Healthcare Corp. held nothing but promise. It
was a finding that scientists who worked with blood diseases,
especially leukemia, had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Dr. Curt Civin, a young Johns Hopkins
University researcher, discovered a monoclonal antibody that binds
to stem cells, a type of immature blood cell made in the bone
marrow. (Monoclonal antibodies are specialized molecules that can
hone in on certain targets.)
</P>
<P>
   Researchers were intrigued with the rare and fleeting stem cell.
They believed it might be the master cell that gives rise to all
the other cells in the blood and the body's immune system. But
until Civin's discovery, they had no clue how to capture them for
study.
</P>
<P>
   Civin's antibody suddenly offered a way to flag stem cells.
Essentially, the antibody could serve as a hook to fish the
transient stem cells from the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Johns Hopkins, recognizing the significance of what Civin had
found, patented the antibody in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Fred Hutchinson, Bensinger and colleague Dr. Ron
Berenson discovered a different but related stem cell antibody.
Like Civin's, the Hutch's antibody could bind to human stem cells,
but it had one critical difference: It also could bind to the stem
cells of baboons.
</P>
<P>
   This seemingly minor difference would become the heart of the
patent battle. It also would have profound implications for cancer
patients, and those suffering from immune system disorders such as
lupus or multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutch researchers had a theory about stem cells. They
believed that if the stem cells gave rise to all the other cells of
the blood and immune system, they might be the mysterious agents
that made bone marrow transplants work.
</P>
<P>
   For years, scientists had treated cancer patients with
transplants of donor marrow. The donor marrow replaced the marrow
destroyed by high-dose chemotherapy and radiation. But the donor
marrow contained a crude mix of different types of cells.
Scientists weren't sure which of them actually helped the patient
regenerate healthy new bone marrow, and which caused the side
effects and sometimes potentially fatal complications associated
with the transplants.
</P>
<P>
   They reasoned that if they could give cancer patients infusions
of purified stem cells - either their own or from a donor - they
could get the body to grow a new healthy immune system without side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   But they couldn't test that theory unless they could do safety
studies in animals first. An antibody that could bind to baboon
stem cells gave them the perfect tool they needed to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Using their antibody as the bait, Bensinger, Berenson and their
team invented a device to capture and concentrate stem cells.
Eventually, they gave the pure preparations of stem cells to cancer
patients with immune systems destroyed by chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. The stem cells could generate a new immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a breakthrough series of experiments,'' Bensinger said.
Within a few years, clinicians worldwide were using stem cell
transplants to treat certain kinds of leukemia, multiple myeloma,
breast cancer and other diseases. Studies were under way looking at
the use of stem cell transplants to treat multiple sclerosis,
lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma.
</P>
<P>
   Using pure stem cells for transplants opened up a new realm of
treatment possibilities, said Dr. Richard Burt, director of
transplantation at Northwestern University Medical School in
Chicago. ``It was much cheaper, less toxic and very helpful for
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   A market opportunity
</P>
<P>
   Pure research institutions are not immune to the beckoning of
commerce. With federal research dollars dwindling, many have looked
internally for sources of new cash to drive research. One of the
most promising sources is known as ``technology transfer,'' or the
licensing of discoveries for use by the corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hutchinson was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing an explosion in applications for its research and the
prospect of a huge market, Berenson and a group of venture
capitalists from San Francisco and Seattle licensed the stem cell
separating device from Fred Hutchinson and launched CellPro in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   There were two pieces to the license. The device that separated
the cells was patented. The stem cell antibody used along with it
was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, our focus was on science and not on business,''
said Dr. Irwin Bernstein, head of pediatric oncology for Fred
Hutchinson and the University of Washington Medical Center.
``Someone else (Johns Hopkins) spent the time patenting it, but
never did the work to show that transplants could work.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most research institutions, Fred Hutchinson didn't warranty
its technology. It was up to the licensee to make sure the
technology didn't infringe on anyone else's patents, said Catherine
Hennings, director of technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro, however, appeared to be a good bet to take the
technology to market. CellPro's management team wasn't worried
about Johns Hopkins' patent, partly because the Fred Hutch antibody
was so clinically different than Johns Hopkins'. In spring 1989,
CellPro also got a legal opinion bolstering its view that Johns
Hopkins' patent was invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The company believed it was covered in two respects: There are
hundreds of places an antibody can bind to a stem cell, and in
CellPro's view, Johns Hopkins' patent covered only one of them. The
Fred Hutchinson antibody, by contrast, attached to a different
site. The company also believed that scientific publication of
Civin's work had rendered the patent invalid.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro took off. Focused and intense, the management team
raised nearly $200 million in public and private stock offerings.
The money fueled development of a commercial version of the
cell-separating machine using the Fred Hutchinson technology.
</P>
<P>
   The shares, which sold for $11 at their initial public offering,
soared to nearly $35 as the company managed to do what only a
handful of biotech companies had ever done: It actually launched a
product, and it did it in record time.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, the group had submitted its device, called the Ceprate
SC System, to the Food and Drug Administration. It was approved in
1996. The company had spent more than $100 million to get the
device to market.
</P>
<P>
   That feat earned the company the respect of many in
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a product to market, which is uncommon in our
business,'' said Ed Fritzky, chairman of Immunex Corp., Seattle's
largest biotechnology company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the perhaps 2,500 biotech companies started in the 1980s,
only a handful are around today,'' he said. ``When you think about
(biotech) companies going out of business, or merging or having
difficulty getting money, it's not all that uncommon. What's
uncommon about this is they had a technology and a product that
made it to market.''
</P>
<P>
   By early 1998, CellPro had its devices in more than 100
transplant and research centers in the United States and 150 sites
overseas. There were more than 60 clinical trials under way using
the device to investigate treatments for everything from HIV to
childhood leukemia, and more than 7,000 patients had been treated
with the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``What CellPro did right was keep its eyes on the prize and go
for it,'' said Nicole Provost, a former engineering project leader
for the company. ``Keep it small, turn on a dime, get things done
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   CellPro's success was a potential windfall for Fred Hutchinson.
It was the kind of mega-hit licensing deal institutions much larger
than the Hutch only dream about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible they had a big one,'' said Dr. Bob Miller,
director of the Office of Technology Transfer and associate vice
provost for research at the University of Washington. Institutions
with many times the research budget of Fred Hutchinson are lucky to
have one big license a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now the license that might have been the ``big one'' for Fred
Hutchinson is in limbo. CellPro is going out of business after
losing its patent fight with Baxter Healthcare Corp., Becton
Dickinson &AMP; Co. and Johns Hopkins University. Baxter had
sublicensed Johns Hopkins antibody from Becton Dickinson, which had
obtained the original exclusive license from Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Bensinger said. ``Because of greed and
legal proceedings, the technology won't be available.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to do with CellPro's greed,'' he added. ``They weren't
content to license an agreement with Baxter when they were in a
position to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   CellPro executives said it was Baxter that wanted too much.
</P>
<P>
   With CellPro in ruins, Fred Hutchinson has lost more than half
its royalty revenue stream, potentially tens of millions of
dollars. CellPro stockholders have lost hundreds of millions of
dollars. At the same time, taxpayers will never see the potential
life-saving benefits of research that was funded with government
money.
</P>
<P>
   And some patients will never know whether using cells treated
with the CellPro device would have improved their outcomes, or even
saved their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some (clinical) trials have just stopped,'' Bensinger said.
The testing could resume using a device supplied by another
company.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't help patients who had hoped to enroll in clinical
trials today, Bensinger said. ``The diseases we deal with do not
wait.''

CELLPRO FOUGHT UNTIL THE BITTER END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOTHELL, Wash. _ Other companies might have been intimidated
after being whipped in a patent battle by two multibillion dollar
firms and a world-class university.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies might have kept a low profile after being
excoriated by a federal judge for being greedy and duplicitous.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro had other plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had patients who were counting on us,'' said CellPro's
then-Chief Executive Rick Murdock.
</P>
<P>
   The company had just lost a bitter, five-year lawsuit over
rights to an antibody used in a bone marrow transplant device.
Because of the federal court ruling, the company was hemorrhaging
money and looked like it might bleed to death.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a $7 million damage award, the judge had issued
an injunction forcing CellPro to withdraw from the European market
and turn over most of its profits from U.S. sales to Baxter
Healthcare Corp., its chief rival in the patent suit.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro appealed to the court of public opinion. If the company
couldn't get a license from Baxter, it would try to get one from
the government.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, the company petitioned the National Institutes
of Health to ``march in'' under the Bayh-Dole Act and award it a
license on the grounds that the Johns Hopkins University antibody
was discovered with federal research dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 had given universities the right to
own patents on discoveries made with federal money, an act largely
credited with spawning the biotech industry. But in exchange,
universities had an obligation to see that those patents were put
to good use.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, universities were supposed to give preference to
smaller companies when licensing their technology. Universities
also were supposed to require companies that licensed their
discoveries to develop them in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro argued that since the Johns Hopkins' antibody had been
discovered using taxpayers' money, the government had a
responsibility to make sure the public benefited from it. After
seven years in development, Baxter's device was still not approved
by the Food and Drug Administration. CellPro, by contrast, already
had a proven track record with patients. CellPro asked the
government to grant it a license to keep its device alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a text-book case for a march-in,'' Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro counted on universities and research institutions to
back the march-in petition. Such institutions had a vested interest
in seeing companies such as CellPro succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Or that's what the company thought.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter and the other plaintiffs lobbied the U.S. Congress
against the march-in petition and universities sided with Baxter,
to CellPro's surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Research institutions rushed to condemn CellPro, fearing no
companies would license discoveries from them if the companies
thought the government could repossess the technology and give it
to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have a very profound effect on the future of basic
university licenses,'' said Frederick Savage, deputy general
counsel for Johns Hopkins. ``It would have profound implications
for the entire industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The licensing industry is big business for universities and
research institutions, worth hundreds of millions of dollars a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center was one of the few to
support CellPro, which had licensed part of its technology from the
center. Fred Hutchinson stood to reap tens of millions in royalties
if CellPro's device was successful.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intense publicity, the lobbying and the personal
appeal of Murdock's own battle against cancer using the
experimental device developed by his company, the NIH refused to
step in.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro had no recourse left but the U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The company had a strong case on appeal, said Cal Crary, a
litigation analyst with Auerbach, Pollak and Richardson in
Stamford, Conn., who is not associated with either side of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   After a complete vindication of its position at a first trial,
the company's win had been overturned by a judge and turned into a
complete defeat. The company was confident an appeals court would
at least allow the issues to be heard again.
</P>
<P>
   The gray zone
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors were getting restless.
</P>
<P>
   At an investment conference showcasing biotech companies held in
August 1997 in Seattle, CellPro was on the lineup to make a
presentation before stock analysts and investors. The monied crowd
packed a large auditorium for the morning's sessions, eager to see
the next hot biotech prospect.
</P>
<P>
   When CellPro's turn came to pitch its business plan, the room
emptied out.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro's former Executive Vice President Larry Culver laughed
nervously at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's what happens when you lose a patent suit,'' he
said. But no one else laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Class-action lawsuits alleging that CellPro's management had
misled shareholders followed.
</P>
<P>
   A suit filed by the law firm Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &AMP; Toll in
Seattle said the company's actions had ``resulted in a massive
fraud perpetrated upon the company's unsuspecting investors.''
</P>
<P>
   CellPro held its breath and waited for the appeals court to
rule.
</P>
<P>
   The blow came two months ago. Although CellPro won a partial
victory that lifted the injunction against foreign sales, it came
too late. The company had lost the key decision about willfully
infringing on Baxter's U.S. patent, which effectively put it out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock and his employees were devastated. Amy Ross, former
director of the diagnostics division, remembers getting the news:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's our CEO and our friend. If it had not been for the
technology, he wouldn't be standing there telling us it was over,''
she said. ``It was almost too hard to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Many employees cried.
</P>
<P>
   The dark end of the tunnel
</P>
<P>
   In the end, CellPro simply ran out of time and money. Its stock,
once worth nearly $35 a share, flat-lined at a few pennies.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro had spent $12 million to $13 million on the legal fight.
Baxter and its partners had spent about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the likelihood of instant insolvency if the court
ordered it to pay the plaintiffs' legal fees on top of the $7
million damage award, CellPro tried to find a last-minute buyer to
rescue the company and its technology.
</P>
<P>
   Only one company made a bid, and it was the last buyer CellPro
wished for.
</P>
<P>
   The company that stepped forward was Nexell, which offered $3
million for CellPro's technology, a technology once worth an
estimated $300 million to $1 billion in sales a year. Nexell is a
joint venture of Baxter and VIMRX Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Nexell had been set up to market Baxter's competing Isolex
device. Nexell said it would keep CellPro's device on the market
only until the FDA approves Isolex. Then it would eliminate
CellPro's device.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's outrageous,'' said litigation analyst Crary, who
believed CellPro still had legal fight left in it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe CellPro's board of directors was just tired, he said.
``The shareholders aren't tired; all they are is battered. It's
ludicrous (the company) did this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some shareholders are unhappy as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``CellPro's management just folded over after the (appeals
ruling),'' said Jonathan Rothschild, an investor with about
$900,000 at stake. ``They just let everything fall to Baxter.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdock says CellPro didn't have any choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at every conceivable way to get more for the
shareholders,'' he said. ``But Baxter had us in a stranglehold. We
had no other choice but to sell to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild and another CellPro shareholder have asked the
Federal Trade Commission to investigate the events that led to
CellPro's bankruptcy, arguing that it has effectively given
Baxter's Isolex product a monopoly in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Employees weren't surprised ``We knew we were looking at the
dark end of the tunnel,'' Ross said. The company, which once had
160 employees, now operates with a skeleton crew of fewer than 25
to manage the transition to its new owner.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Handfelt, CellPro's in-house counsel, is presiding over the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like digging the grave and pushing CellPro into it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A death in the family
</P>
<P>
   ``The losers are the patients, the investors and the people who
sweat razor blades to make that product happen,'' said Tom Kiley, a
patent attorney and former member of CellPro's board. ``It's a
little harder to find the winners, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Johns Hopkins said patients will not suffer, because CellPro's
product will be available until Baxter's product is approved.
However, the changeover has created obstacles for some clinical
trials, which have stopped for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means patients can't be enrolled,'' said Dr. William
Bensinger, director of autologous transplantation at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Whether the treatment might have
saved or prolonged their lives is a question that can't be
answered.
</P>
<P>
   Several researchers said they would prefer to have both machines
remain on the market, especially since both grew out of federally
funded research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Healthy competition in the private sector is good for
patients,'' said Dr. Richard Burt, director of transplantation at
Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago. Burt has used
CellPro's device to treat patients with leukemia, multiple
sclerosis, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Using stem cells purified with CellPro's device has halted, or
in some cases reversed, disease, he said. ``A lot of people are
very excited about what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He anticipates eventually having to switch to the Isolex system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the results will be the same, but we don't know,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the lawsuit say CellPro can blame itself for
the fate of its employees and its device.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many different opportunities for CellPro to reach
some accommodation many years before this got this far,'' said
Savage of Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   The last word
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts believe CellPro may have the last say. Two
weeks ago, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The $3
million sale of the company's ``intangible assets'' (all its
intellectual property, patents and licenses) to Nexell is
contingent on approval of its filing. Some in the financial
community are betting thata group will surface to outbid Baxter's
venture and buy CellPro's assets for pennies on the dollar. The
deadline for such ``overbidders'' is December 3.
</P>
<P>
   If a group did, ``it would be the cheapest acquisition of an
extraordinarily valuable technology in history,'' analyst Crary
said.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock still hopes some buyer ultimately will keep CellPro's
technology out of Baxter's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would consider that a moral victory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, questions continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole process was an absolute travesty of justice,'' said
CellPro board member Chad Waite. ``How it got so wrong and twisted
is something we'll all probably be asking ourselves for many years
to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real travesty is that all this research was done with
federal money,'' he said. ``And no one will benefit.''

 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOTHELL, Wash. _ In the rarefied world of biotechnology, CellPro
was an unusual hybrid: a commercial and scientific success.
</P>
<P>
   At least on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the euphoria over the company's development of a device
to improve bone marrow transplants, and promising sales in Europe,
there were hints of trouble on the business side almost from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The technology CellPro had licensed from Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center had two components. One piece - a cell separating
device - was patented. The other piece - a stem cell antibody used
with the device - was not.
</P>
<P>
   It was a technicality that would throw CellPro and Baxter
Healthcare Corp. into mortal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells, which are made in the bone marrow, are immature
blood cells that give rise to all the other blood and immune system
cells in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Early work at Fred Hutchinson demonstrated that stem cells could
be used to regenerate immune systems in cancer patients whose
defenses had been destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation. Doctors
wanted a device that used antibodies to purify stem cells for
research and treating patients.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike CellPro, Baxter had a license for a stem cell antibody.
The antibody had been patented by Johns Hopkins University and
later licensed to Becton Dickinson, which in turn sublicensed it to
Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   A year after CellPro was formed, Baxter moved into the stem cell
separation market and started developing a device of its own,
called the Isolex system.
</P>
<P>
   In the biotechnology industry, patents are like poker chips. The
more a company has, the better its betting position. At stake are
markets for new medical technology potentially worth hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter knew CellPro had a head start. CellPro, using its own
antibody and a proprietary separating technique, was already well
along in development.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter also knew there was a large, lucrative market at stake.
CellPro's investor literature predicted $600 million in sales
within five years.
</P>
<P>
   And Baxter's executives knew something else: Rick Murdock, the
charismatic marketing man who headed up CellPro, had once worked
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that (Murdock) left and was going to compete in an
area of interest didn't bode well'' for Baxter, said Bill Miller,
who co-founded a company with Murdock that Baxter later bought.
``There may have been some jealousy over that.''
</P>
<P>
   The first ominous sign for CellPro came when Murdock met with
former colleagues at Baxter in November 1991 to explore possible
collaboration in stem cell separation.
</P>
<P>
   Several months earlier, CellPro had initiated discussions with
Baxter in its efforts to find an overseas marketing partner. By
November, however, it had become increasingly clear to CellPro that
the two sides had different agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides wanted a deal, it was clear that marketing
rights to CellPro's product, particularly in the United States,
were going to be an issue. Both sides wanted them. And each side
felt it had the advantage. CellPro had a product that Baxter
wanted. Baxter had a patent it believed CellPro needed. CellPro,
however, believed the patent was invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides appeared headed for a standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Jan. 13, 1992, Baxter surprised CellPro by offering
CellPro a license to use the disputed antibody in exchange for an
upfront fee and royalty. There was no mention of marketing rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd died and gone to heaven,'' Murdock said. At that
point, he was willing to pay a royalty on the antibody to avoid a
patent showdown, but he wanted to avoid partnering with Baxter to
sell CellPro's product in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock and his board of directors thought the terms were
unreasonably high.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days later, Murdock countered the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They countered in terms that were completely unreasonable,''
said Baxter spokeswoman Deborah Spak. ``They were going to pay
Baxter less than what (Baxter) was already paying Becton Dickinson
and Johns Hopkins.''
</P>
<P>
   When Baxter countered, it included new terms. In a letter dated
April 15, 1992, Baxter asked for exclusive distribution rights in
Europe and Japan, as well as non-exclusive rights in the United
States, Canada and Mexico, in exchange for giving CellPro a license
to use the antibody.
</P>
<P>
   From CellPro's standpoint, that would have turned the company
into little more than a small manufacturing firm.
</P>
<P>
   Crown jewels
</P>
<P>
   ``The crown jewel of a biotech company is the U.S. distribution
rights,'' Murdock said. ``Europe and the rest of the world is the
second jewel, but the U.S. rights are sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   He rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter ``was using the U.S. patent to blackmail us into giving
them the European and U.S. distribution rights,'' said Chad Waite,
a venture capitalist and CellPro board member from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro turned to Tom Kiley, a founding board member and patent
attorney, for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Kiley, an expert in biotech patents, was convinced that Baxter's
patents wouldn't hold up in court. Anticipating that Baxter would
sue CellPro, he advised CellPro to sue Baxter and Becton Dickinson
in a pre-emptive strike. It was a gutsy move in what one
participant would later call the battle of ``David and Three
Goliaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloves off
</P>
<P>
   In April 1992, CellPro fired the first salvo. It sued Baxter and
Becton Dickinson in U.S. District Court in Seattle, claiming that
Baxter's patents were invalid. It also charged Baxter and Becton
Dickinson with antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using a license to get control of technology has clear
antitrust ramifications,'' Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter disagreed, saying CellPro had come to it looking for an
overseas marketing partner, and it was only trying to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some CellPro employees were nervous. Principles were one thing.
But would the company's posturing be any match for Baxter's
billions?
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of struttin' going on,'' said Nicole Provost,
a former engineering project leader for CellPro. ``But that's part
of the biotech, rah-rah, entrepreneur mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire to show up the big guys was endemic in young biotech
companies, especially in the emerging transplant field, she said.
``The doctors are cowboys, too. . . . You couldn't fault them for
it. It was part of being in that market, the market for blood
products. It was new, with lots of competition and gee-whiz
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   CellPro board member Waite remembers the filing of the lawsuit
as a turning point for the company. ``When we sued, all bets were
off, the gloves were off,'' Waite said.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro's case was dismissed, however, partly because it didn't
name Johns Hopkins in the suit. ``Johns Hopkins was one of our
biggest customers,'' Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   With the lawsuit dismissed, the parties tried again to negotiate
a settlement. But in November 1993, Baxter, Becton Dickinson and
Johns Hopkins sued CellPro in U.S. District Court in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I knew there was no turning back,'' Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   Victory, defeat
</P>
<P>
   In August 1995, an elated CellPro won the first patent trial,
prevailing on all 103 counts. Not only did the jury find the Baxter
patents invalid, it also said CellPro had not infringed on them,
even if they had been valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won everything,'' said CellPro board member Waite.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report that year, a jubilant CellPro said the
company ``will vigorously pursue antitrust claims after post-trial
motions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the celebration was short-lived. In an unusual move, U.S.
District Judge Roderick McKelvie rejected the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   McKelvie, a judge known for excellent patent decisions, also has
a low tolerance for courtroom antics that displease him, especially
attorneys he considers arrogant. He can be tough on those who anger
him. In 1997, McKelvie told the National Law Journal: ``If lawyers
lie to me, I will tell them they can no longer practice in our
court. . . . And I have imposed sanctions of upward of $1 million,
plus attorney fees.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, after nearly a year of petitioning of post-trial
motions by Baxter and its co-plaintiffs, McKelvie said he had made
an error in his jury instructions. He ordered a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   A case of greed
</P>
<P>
   Tensions mounted between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame both sides for escalating it,'' Waite said.
</P>
<P>
   More negotiations failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business logic progressively took a further back seat, and it
became emotional,'' said Larry Culver, former president of CellPro.
``At some point in time, I think (Baxter's) `win' scenario became
eliminating us as a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Baxter and Johns Hopkins saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question CellPro took the most hard-nosed position
imaginable,'' said Frederick Savage, deputy general counsel for
Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gamble CellPro lost.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the matter got to a second trial, the judge had
reconsidered the scope of the patents. He ruled that Baxter's
patents were valid and CellPro had infringed on them.
</P>
<P>
   At the new trial, the judge told jurors that ``no reasonable
jury'' could find that CellPro had not infringed on Baxter's
patents, and that the jury's job was to determine whether the
company had done so ``willfully,'' and if so, what the damages
should be.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, the second jury awarded damages of $2.3 million
to Baxter and the other plaintiffs, an award that the judge trebled
to $7 million for ``willful infringement.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time, McKelvie could barely contain his scorn for the
company. In his ruling, the judge wrote: ``One element of the
strategy CellPro has adopted in this battle has been to hold itself
out as a warrior in a 20th-century holy crusade. It claims it is
out to advance science, to save lives, to fight cancer and improve
the human condition. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``This image is a facade constructed by the venture capitalists
who started this business. Behind the science, the medicine and the
potential for treating cancer patients are investors who have
demonstrated that their primary motivation is not humanitarianism,
nor even responsible capitalism . . . (but) greed.''
</P>
<P>
   To the plaintiffs, CellPro wasn't just aggressive, it was
reckless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me the strategy, if you want to call it that - of
going for a home run when the only alternative was basically
striking out - was not a good one,'' said Savage of Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that CellPro had earmarked money for a patent fight
early in its history meant the company knew its position was risky,
said Baxter spokeswoman Spak. ``They took a risk in the beginning.
They knew they were infringing, and they lost,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that CellPro knew it had infringed on the
patents but had obtained a legal opinion it knew was weak to avoid
liability and help ensure that investors would keep pouring money
into the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not how it happened,'' Waite said. ``We never put
a dime into the company until we were satisfied about those
patents.''
</P>
<P>
   Motives didn't matter at that point, however. According to the
ruling, CellPro had violated the patents. In July 1997, the court
ordered CellPro to stop selling its product once Baxter obtains
Food and Drug Administration approval for Isolex, its competing
device. In the interim, it ordered CellPro to pay 60 percent of its
profits on any sales to Baxter. Isolex awaits FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter wanted CellPro gone, Murdock said. ``They thought they
were going to be able to shoot us quietly in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   CellPro's stem cell separation system
</P>
<P>
   Step 1. Blood containing stem cells is drawn from a donor. The
donor can be either the patient, himself, or a person with a
matching bone marrow type.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2. The blood sample is mixed with a special antibody that
attaches only to stem cells. This antibody has also been treated
with biotin, a Vitamin-D derivative that acts like a kind of
molecular Velcro when exposed to avidin, a protein derived from
eggs. Only the stem cells attach to the antibodies, other types of
cells in the blood mixture do not.
</P>
<P>
   Step 3. The sample passes through a column filled with
microscopic beads that have been coated with avidin. The antibodies
with their stem cells attached stick to the avidin beads. The rest
of the blood cells are washed away.
</P>
<P>
   Step 4. Gentle agitation dislodges the stem cells from the
beads. The stem cells are collected and given to the patient. The
new stem cells regenerate the patient's immune system.
</P>

WORKPLACE ROMANCES CAN PRESENT A BUSINESS DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies may not like it, but offices are fertile flirting
grounds. Office romance can create managerial headaches, cost
people jobs, and result in messy lawsuits, but ignoring it won't
make it go away.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, President Clinton's problems notwithstanding, office
romances are flourishing, said Dennis Powers, associate professor
of business law at Southern Oregon University and author of ``The
Office Romance; Playing With Fire Without Getting Burned,''
(Amacom, 1999, $22.95.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 80 percent of 485 managers surveyed in 1994 by the
American Management Association said they either had been aware of
or had been involved in an office romance. According to a 1988
Bureau of National Affairs report, about one-third of all
relationship start at work, Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Management Association survey also found that 49
percent of workplace romances resulted in marriage or long-term
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a fling, go to a bar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a survey this year by the Society for Human Resource
Management reported that 55 percent of human resource professionals
believed marriage was the most likely outcome of office romances at
their organizations over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   People are spending more time at work, and less time
socializing, which means the likelihood of meeting someone in the
office is increasing, Powers said. But carrying on relationships in
the workplace is tricky for everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   Although sexual harassment cases draw attention, and sometimes
headlines, very few stem from bad workplace breakups, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Society for Human Resource Management, failed
romances led to 4 percent of sexual harassment claims that ended up
in court.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, other pitfalls associated with office love
affairs. There may be friction with co-workers who perceive
favoritism at work, or fear the office mates are inappropriately
sharing information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The people involved in the relationship also risk getting
reassigned, or transferred, sometimes derailing their careers.
</P>
<P>
   In the American Management Association study, about 25 percent
of those who had a work relationship said it adversely affected
them.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping it secret didn't help. About 62 percent said their
co-workers knew despite their best efforts to keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to handle office romance is to keep it above-board
and keep the lines of communication open, Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, more companies had restrictive policies that said,
``If you date, you're terminated.'' Today, only about 5 percent of
companies still take that stance.
</P>
<P>
   Such no-fraternization policies tend to backfire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People date anyway,'' he said. ``But because they can't say
anything about it, they eventually just find another job and
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies were losing some of their best-trained people that
way, he said. ``Now they're trying to change because that made no
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of no-fraternization policies, companies are trying to
come up with workable rules that don't interfere in private
behavior or dictate morality, but also keep the work environment
from being disrupted by relationship matters.
</P>
<P>
   The most important position for a company in affairs of the
heart is neutrality, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean having no policy at all.
</P>
<P>
   Companies should devise a policy that addresses the issue of
consensual relationships at work by specifying who employees can
contact for confidential advice, and what employees should do in
conflict-of-interest situations.
</P>
<P>
   Such policies should also set out procedures for resolving
romance-related workplace problems.
</P>
<P>
   If a couple breaks up and the acrimony is spilling over at work,
for example, the company should offer mediation to resolve the
dispute before arbitrarily firing or transferring one (or both) of
the parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest relationships _ at least from a corporate standpoint
_ are those involving single co-workers, he said. The most
problematic, from a management standpoint, are those that involve
boss and subordinate. In those cases, it's crucial for the
subordinate to be evaluated by someone higher up than the boss, to
avoid conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is to open up communication,'' he said. ``If
people feel they can explore and talk about the issues, not in a
penalizing way, there's usually a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the same things that make relationships work at home,
also make them work at the office.

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOTHELL, Wash. _ In the rarefied world of biotechnology, CellPro
was an unusual hybrid: a commercial and scientific success.
</P>
<P>
   At least on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the euphoria over the company's development of a device
to improve bone marrow transplants, and promising sales in Europe,
there were hints of trouble on the business side almost from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The technology CellPro had licensed from Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center had two components. One piece - a cell separating
device - was patented. The other piece - a stem cell antibody used
with the device - was not.
</P>
<P>
   It was a technicality that would throw CellPro and Baxter
Healthcare Corp. into mortal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells, which are made in the bone marrow, are immature
blood cells that give rise to all the other blood and immune system
cells in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Early work at Fred Hutchinson demonstrated that stem cells could
be used to regenerate immune systems in cancer patients whose
defenses had been destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation. Doctors
wanted a device that used antibodies to purify stem cells for
research and treating patients.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike CellPro, Baxter had a license for a stem cell antibody.
The antibody had been patented by Johns Hopkins University and
later licensed to Becton Dickinson, which in turn sublicensed it to
Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   A year after CellPro was formed, Baxter moved into the stem cell
separation market and started developing a device of its own,
called the Isolex system.
</P>
<P>
   In the biotechnology industry, patents are like poker chips. The
more a company has, the better its betting position. At stake are
markets for new medical technology potentially worth hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter knew CellPro had a head start. CellPro, using its own
antibody and a proprietary separating technique, was already well
along in development.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter also knew there was a large, lucrative market at stake.
CellPro's investor literature predicted $600 million in sales
within five years.
</P>
<P>
   And Baxter's executives knew something else: Rick Murdock, the
charismatic marketing man who headed up CellPro, had once worked
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that (Murdock) left and was going to compete in an
area of interest didn't bode well'' for Baxter, said Bill Miller,
who co-founded a company with Murdock that Baxter later bought.
``There may have been some jealousy over that.''
</P>
<P>
   The first ominous sign for CellPro came when Murdock met with
former colleagues at Baxter in November 1991 to explore possible
collaboration in stem cell separation.
</P>
<P>
   Several months earlier, CellPro had initiated discussions with
Baxter in its efforts to find an overseas marketing partner. By
November, however, it had become increasingly clear to CellPro that
the two sides had different agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides wanted a deal, it was clear that marketing
rights to CellPro's product, particularly in the United States,
were going to be an issue. Both sides wanted them. And each side
felt it had the advantage. CellPro had a product that Baxter
wanted. Baxter had a patent it believed CellPro needed. CellPro,
however, believed the patent was invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides appeared headed for a standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Jan. 13, 1992, Baxter surprised CellPro by offering
CellPro a license to use the disputed antibody in exchange for an
upfront fee and royalty. There was no mention of marketing rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd died and gone to heaven,'' Murdock said. At that
point, he was willing to pay a royalty on the antibody to avoid a
patent showdown, but he wanted to avoid partnering with Baxter to
sell CellPro's product in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock and his board of directors thought the terms were
unreasonably high.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days later, Murdock countered the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They countered in terms that were completely unreasonable,''
said Baxter spokeswoman Deborah Spak. ``They were going to pay
Baxter less than what (Baxter) was already paying Becton Dickinson
and Johns Hopkins.''
</P>
<P>
   When Baxter countered, it included new terms. In a letter dated
April 15, 1992, Baxter asked for exclusive distribution rights in
Europe and Japan, as well as non-exclusive rights in the United
States, Canada and Mexico, in exchange for giving CellPro a license
to use the antibody.
</P>
<P>
   From CellPro's standpoint, that would have turned the company
into little more than a small manufacturing firm.
</P>
<P>
   Crown jewels
</P>
<P>
   ``The crown jewel of a biotech company is the U.S. distribution
rights,'' Murdock said. ``Europe and the rest of the world is the
second jewel, but the U.S. rights are sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   He rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter ``was using the U.S. patent to blackmail us into giving
them the European and U.S. distribution rights,'' said Chad Waite,
a venture capitalist and CellPro board member from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro turned to Tom Kiley, a founding board member and patent
attorney, for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Kiley, an expert in biotech patents, was convinced that Baxter's
patents wouldn't hold up in court. Anticipating that Baxter would
sue CellPro, he advised CellPro to sue Baxter and Becton Dickinson
in a pre-emptive strike. It was a gutsy move in what one
participant would later call the battle of ``David and Three
Goliaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloves off
</P>
<P>
   In April 1992, CellPro fired the first salvo. It sued Baxter and
Becton Dickinson in U.S. District Court in Seattle, claiming that
Baxter's patents were invalid. It also charged Baxter and Becton
Dickinson with antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using a license to get control of technology has clear
antitrust ramifications,'' Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter disagreed, saying CellPro had come to it looking for an
overseas marketing partner, and it was only trying to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some CellPro employees were nervous. Principles were one thing.
But would the company's posturing be any match for Baxter's
billions?
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of struttin' going on,'' said Nicole Provost,
a former engineering project leader for CellPro. ``But that's part
of the biotech, rah-rah, entrepreneur mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire to show up the big guys was endemic in young biotech
companies, especially in the emerging transplant field, she said.
``The doctors are cowboys, too. . . . You couldn't fault them for
it. It was part of being in that market, the market for blood
products. It was new, with lots of competition and gee-whiz
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   CellPro board member Waite remembers the filing of the lawsuit
as a turning point for the company. ``When we sued, all bets were
off, the gloves were off,'' Waite said.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro's case was dismissed, however, partly because it didn't
name Johns Hopkins in the suit. ``Johns Hopkins was one of our
biggest customers,'' Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   With the lawsuit dismissed, the parties tried again to negotiate
a settlement. But in November 1993, Baxter, Becton Dickinson and
Johns Hopkins sued CellPro in U.S. District Court in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I knew there was no turning back,'' Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   Victory, defeat
</P>
<P>
   In August 1995, an elated CellPro won the first patent trial,
prevailing on all 103 counts. Not only did the jury find the Baxter
patents invalid, it also said CellPro had not infringed on them,
even if they had been valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won everything,'' said CellPro board member Waite.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report that year, a jubilant CellPro said the
company ``will vigorously pursue antitrust claims after post-trial
motions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the celebration was short-lived. In an unusual move, U.S.
District Judge Roderick McKelvie rejected the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   McKelvie, a judge known for excellent patent decisions, also has
a low tolerance for courtroom antics that displease him, especially
attorneys he considers arrogant. He can be tough on those who anger
him. In 1997, McKelvie told the National Law Journal: ``If lawyers
lie to me, I will tell them they can no longer practice in our
court. . . . And I have imposed sanctions of upward of $1 million,
plus attorney fees.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, after nearly a year of petitioning of post-trial
motions by Baxter and its co-plaintiffs, McKelvie said he had made
an error in his jury instructions. He ordered a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   A case of greed
</P>
<P>
   Tensions mounted between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame both sides for escalating it,'' Waite said.
</P>
<P>
   More negotiations failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business logic progressively took a further back seat, and it
became emotional,'' said Larry Culver, former president of CellPro.
``At some point in time, I think (Baxter's) `win' scenario became
eliminating us as a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Baxter and Johns Hopkins saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question CellPro took the most hard-nosed position
imaginable,'' said Frederick Savage, deputy general counsel for
Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gamble CellPro lost.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the matter got to a second trial, the judge had
reconsidered the scope of the patents. He ruled that Baxter's
patents were valid and CellPro had infringed on them.
</P>
<P>
   At the new trial, the judge told jurors that ``no reasonable
jury'' could find that CellPro had not infringed on Baxter's
patents, and that the jury's job was to determine whether the
company had done so ``willfully,'' and if so, what the damages
should be.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, the second jury awarded damages of $2.3 million
to Baxter and the other plaintiffs, an award that the judge trebled
to $7 million for ``willful infringement.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time, McKelvie could barely contain his scorn for the
company. In his ruling, the judge wrote: ``One element of the
strategy CellPro has adopted in this battle has been to hold itself
out as a warrior in a 20th-century holy crusade. It claims it is
out to advance science, to save lives, to fight cancer and improve
the human condition. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``This image is a facade constructed by the venture capitalists
who started this business. Behind the science, the medicine and the
potential for treating cancer patients are investors who have
demonstrated that their primary motivation is not humanitarianism,
nor even responsible capitalism . . . (but) greed.''
</P>
<P>
   To the plaintiffs, CellPro wasn't just aggressive, it was
reckless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me the strategy, if you want to call it that - of
going for a home run when the only alternative was basically
striking out - was not a good one,'' said Savage of Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that CellPro had earmarked money for a patent fight
early in its history meant the company knew its position was risky,
said Baxter spokeswoman Spak. ``They took a risk in the beginning.
They knew they were infringing, and they lost,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that CellPro knew it had infringed on the
patents but had obtained a legal opinion it knew was weak to avoid
liability and help ensure that investors would keep pouring money
into the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not how it happened,'' Waite said. ``We never put
a dime into the company until we were satisfied about those
patents.''
</P>
<P>
   Motives didn't matter at that point, however. According to the
ruling, CellPro had violated the patents. In July 1997, the court
ordered CellPro to stop selling its product once Baxter obtains
Food and Drug Administration approval for Isolex, its competing
device. In the interim, it ordered CellPro to pay 60 percent of its
profits on any sales to Baxter. Isolex awaits FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter wanted CellPro gone, Murdock said. ``They thought they
were going to be able to shoot us quietly in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   CellPro's stem cell separation system
</P>
<P>
   Step 1. Blood containing stem cells is drawn from a donor. The
donor can be either the patient, himself, or a person with a
matching bone marrow type.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2. The blood sample is mixed with a special antibody that
attaches only to stem cells. This antibody has also been treated
with biotin, a Vitamin-D derivative that acts like a kind of
molecular Velcro when exposed to avidin, a protein derived from
eggs. Only the stem cells attach to the antibodies, other types of
cells in the blood mixture do not.
</P>
<P>
   Step 3. The sample passes through a column filled with
microscopic beads that have been coated with avidin. The antibodies
with their stem cells attached stick to the avidin beads. The rest
of the blood cells are washed away.
</P>
<P>
   Step 4. Gentle agitation dislodges the stem cells from the
beads. The stem cells are collected and given to the patient. The
new stem cells regenerate the patient's immune system.

CELLPRO FOUGHT UNTIL THE BITTER END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOTHELL, Wash. _ Other companies might have been intimidated
after being whipped in a patent battle by two multibillion dollar
firms and a world-class university.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies might have kept a low profile after being
excoriated by a federal judge for being greedy and duplicitous.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro had other plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had patients who were counting on us,'' said CellPro's
then-Chief Executive Rick Murdock.
</P>
<P>
   The company had just lost a bitter, five-year lawsuit over
rights to an antibody used in a bone marrow transplant device.
Because of the federal court ruling, the company was hemorrhaging
money and looked like it might bleed to death.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a $7 million damage award, the judge had issued
an injunction forcing CellPro to withdraw from the European market
and turn over most of its profits from U.S. sales to Baxter
Healthcare Corp., its chief rival in the patent suit.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro appealed to the court of public opinion. If the company
couldn't get a license from Baxter, it would try to get one from
the government.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, the company petitioned the National Institutes
of Health to ``march in'' under the Bayh-Dole Act and award it a
license on the grounds that the Johns Hopkins University antibody
was discovered with federal research dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 had given universities the right to
own patents on discoveries made with federal money, an act largely
credited with spawning the biotech industry. But in exchange,
universities had an obligation to see that those patents were put
to good use.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, universities were supposed to give preference to
smaller companies when licensing their technology. Universities
also were supposed to require companies that licensed their
discoveries to develop them in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro argued that since the Johns Hopkins' antibody had been
discovered using taxpayers' money, the government had a
responsibility to make sure the public benefited from it. After
seven years in development, Baxter's device was still not approved
by the Food and Drug Administration. CellPro, by contrast, already
had a proven track record with patients. CellPro asked the
government to grant it a license to keep its device alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a text-book case for a march-in,'' Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro counted on universities and research institutions to
back the march-in petition. Such institutions had a vested interest
in seeing companies such as CellPro succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Or that's what the company thought.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter and the other plaintiffs lobbied the U.S. Congress
against the march-in petition and universities sided with Baxter,
to CellPro's surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Research institutions rushed to condemn CellPro, fearing no
companies would license discoveries from them if the companies
thought the government could repossess the technology and give it
to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have a very profound effect on the future of basic
university licenses,'' said Frederick Savage, deputy general
counsel for Johns Hopkins. ``It would have profound implications
for the entire industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The licensing industry is big business for universities and
research institutions, worth hundreds of millions of dollars a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center was one of the few to
support CellPro, which had licensed part of its technology from the
center. Fred Hutchinson stood to reap tens of millions in royalties
if CellPro's device was successful.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intense publicity, the lobbying and the personal
appeal of Murdock's own battle against cancer using the
experimental device developed by his company, the NIH refused to
step in.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro had no recourse left but the U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The company had a strong case on appeal, said Cal Crary, a
litigation analyst with Auerbach, Pollak and Richardson in
Stamford, Conn., who is not associated with either side of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   After a complete vindication of its position at a first trial,
the company's win had been overturned by a judge and turned into a
complete defeat. The company was confident an appeals court would
at least allow the issues to be heard again.
</P>
<P>
   The gray zone
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors were getting restless.
</P>
<P>
   At an investment conference showcasing biotech companies held in
August 1997 in Seattle, CellPro was on the lineup to make a
presentation before stock analysts and investors. The monied crowd
packed a large auditorium for the morning's sessions, eager to see
the next hot biotech prospect.
</P>
<P>
   When CellPro's turn came to pitch its business plan, the room
emptied out.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro's former Executive Vice President Larry Culver laughed
nervously at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's what happens when you lose a patent suit,'' he
said. But no one else laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Class-action lawsuits alleging that CellPro's management had
misled shareholders followed.
</P>
<P>
   A suit filed by the law firm Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &AMP; Toll in
Seattle said the company's actions had ``resulted in a massive
fraud perpetrated upon the company's unsuspecting investors.''
</P>
<P>
   CellPro held its breath and waited for the appeals court to
rule.
</P>
<P>
   The blow came two months ago. Although CellPro won a partial
victory that lifted the injunction against foreign sales, it came
too late. The company had lost the key decision about willfully
infringing on Baxter's U.S. patent, which effectively put it out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock and his employees were devastated. Amy Ross, former
director of the diagnostics division, remembers getting the news:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's our CEO and our friend. If it had not been for the
technology, he wouldn't be standing there telling us it was over,''
she said. ``It was almost too hard to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Many employees cried.
</P>
<P>
   The dark end of the tunnel
</P>
<P>
   In the end, CellPro simply ran out of time and money. Its stock,
once worth nearly $35 a share, flat-lined at a few pennies.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro had spent $12 million to $13 million on the legal fight.
Baxter and its partners had spent about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the likelihood of instant insolvency if the court
ordered it to pay the plaintiffs' legal fees on top of the $7
million damage award, CellPro tried to find a last-minute buyer to
rescue the company and its technology.
</P>
<P>
   Only one company made a bid, and it was the last buyer CellPro
wished for.
</P>
<P>
   The company that stepped forward was Nexell, which offered $3
million for CellPro's technology, a technology once worth an
estimated $300 million to $1 billion in sales a year. Nexell is a
joint venture of Baxter and VIMRX Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Nexell had been set up to market Baxter's competing Isolex
device. Nexell said it would keep CellPro's device on the market
only until the FDA approves Isolex. Then it would eliminate
CellPro's device.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's outrageous,'' said litigation analyst Crary, who
believed CellPro still had legal fight left in it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe CellPro's board of directors was just tired, he said.
``The shareholders aren't tired; all they are is battered. It's
ludicrous (the company) did this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some shareholders are unhappy as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``CellPro's management just folded over after the (appeals
ruling),'' said Jonathan Rothschild, an investor with about
$900,000 at stake. ``They just let everything fall to Baxter.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdock says CellPro didn't have any choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at every conceivable way to get more for the
shareholders,'' he said. ``But Baxter had us in a stranglehold. We
had no other choice but to sell to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild and another CellPro shareholder have asked the
Federal Trade Commission to investigate the events that led to
CellPro's bankruptcy, arguing that it has effectively given
Baxter's Isolex product a monopoly in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Employees weren't surprised ``We knew we were looking at the
dark end of the tunnel,'' Ross said. The company, which once had
160 employees, now operates with a skeleton crew of fewer than 25
to manage the transition to its new owner.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Handfelt, CellPro's in-house counsel, is presiding over the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like digging the grave and pushing CellPro into it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A death in the family
</P>
<P>
   ``The losers are the patients, the investors and the people who
sweat razor blades to make that product happen,'' said Tom Kiley, a
patent attorney and former member of CellPro's board. ``It's a
little harder to find the winners, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Johns Hopkins said patients will not suffer, because CellPro's
product will be available until Baxter's product is approved.
However, the changeover has created obstacles for some clinical
trials, which have stopped for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means patients can't be enrolled,'' said Dr. William
Bensinger, director of autologous transplantation at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Whether the treatment might have
saved or prolonged their lives is a question that can't be
answered.
</P>
<P>
   Several researchers said they would prefer to have both machines
remain on the market, especially since both grew out of federally
funded research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Healthy competition in the private sector is good for
patients,'' said Dr. Richard Burt, director of transplantation at
Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago. Burt has used
CellPro's device to treat patients with leukemia, multiple
sclerosis, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Using stem cells purified with CellPro's device has halted, or
in some cases reversed, disease, he said. ``A lot of people are
very excited about what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He anticipates eventually having to switch to the Isolex system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the results will be the same, but we don't know,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the lawsuit say CellPro can blame itself for
the fate of its employees and its device.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many different opportunities for CellPro to reach
some accommodation many years before this got this far,'' said
Savage of Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   The last word
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts believe CellPro may have the last say. Two
weeks ago, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The $3
million sale of the company's ``intangible assets'' (all its
intellectual property, patents and licenses) to Nexell is
contingent on approval of its filing. Some in the financial
community are betting thata group will surface to outbid Baxter's
venture and buy CellPro's assets for pennies on the dollar. The
deadline for such ``overbidders'' is December 3.
</P>
<P>
   If a group did, ``it would be the cheapest acquisition of an
extraordinarily valuable technology in history,'' analyst Crary
said.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock still hopes some buyer ultimately will keep CellPro's
technology out of Baxter's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would consider that a moral victory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, questions continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole process was an absolute travesty of justice,'' said
CellPro board member Chad Waite. ``How it got so wrong and twisted
is something we'll all probably be asking ourselves for many years
to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real travesty is that all this research was done with
federal money,'' he said. ``And no one will benefit.''

CELLPRO _ A BIOTECH DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOTHELL, Wash. _ Rick Murdock's voice echoes as he walks through
the abandoned labs at the former CellPro headquarters in Bothell,
northeast of Seattle. Wearing his trademark dark suit, white shirt
and tie, he looks like the consummate chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Except he has no business left to run.
</P>
<P>
   He steps over stray styrofoam packing peanuts that weave a trail
in and out of empty cubicles, past white lab coats tossed limply
over chairs, and rows of barren lab benches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be a busy place,'' he says, waving at the shelves
of half-used solvents and reagents waiting to be inventoried.
``It's not a pretty sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the lake in Seattle, Dr. William Bensinger fumes, hemmed
in by stacks of scientific journals in his office at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, Bensinger and his colleagues made a discovery
that became the basis for CellPro's product. Today, he is eager to
use CellPro's device in an experimental treatment that may offer
hope to patients with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone
marrow, or other fatal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Except he can't begin his experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Because CellPro lost a bitter five-year lawsuit over a specific
antibody used in the device, Bensinger will not be able to
undertake certain experimental treatment programs he had hoped to
start. Eventually, the technology he helped launch will be taken
off the market completely, ending what some consider to be one of
the most promising new avenues for treating cancer and other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few months, CellPro expects to finalize its
Chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal court in Seattle. When it does, it
will close the books on what was once one of Seattle's largest and
most prosperous biotechnology companies.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro's route to bankruptcy was tortuous and complex. It
involved greed, ego, bull-headed business decisions and
questionable legal advice, depending on who points the finger.
</P>
<P>
   The company's demise raises questions about everything from how
well the patent system handles the nuances of molecular biology to
the best way to ensure that taxpayer-funded research furthers
public health. It also offers a glimpse of a medical marketplace
driven by equal parts science and swagger.
</P>
<P>
   People in the biotechnology industry don't like to talk about
what happened at CellPro in the same way doctors don't like to talk
about the patient who didn't recover.
</P>
<P>
   It's the dark side of technology transfer - what happens when
the interests of commerce and research collide. It could have
happened to any one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning
</P>
<P>
   At first, the discovery that launched the patent war between
CellPro and Baxter Healthcare Corp. held nothing but promise. It
was a finding that scientists who worked with blood diseases,
especially leukemia, had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Dr. Curt Civin, a young Johns Hopkins
University researcher, discovered a monoclonal antibody that binds
to stem cells, a type of immature blood cell made in the bone
marrow. (Monoclonal antibodies are specialized molecules that can
hone in on certain targets.)
</P>
<P>
   Researchers were intrigued with the rare and fleeting stem cell.
They believed it might be the master cell that gives rise to all
the other cells in the blood and the body's immune system. But
until Civin's discovery, they had no clue how to capture them for
study.
</P>
<P>
   Civin's antibody suddenly offered a way to flag stem cells.
Essentially, the antibody could serve as a hook to fish the
transient stem cells from the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Johns Hopkins, recognizing the significance of what Civin had
found, patented the antibody in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Fred Hutchinson, Bensinger and colleague Dr. Ron
Berenson discovered a different but related stem cell antibody.
Like Civin's, the Hutch's antibody could bind to human stem cells,
but it had one critical difference: It also could bind to the stem
cells of baboons.
</P>
<P>
   This seemingly minor difference would become the heart of the
patent battle. It also would have profound implications for cancer
patients, and those suffering from immune system disorders such as
lupus or multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutch researchers had a theory about stem cells. They
believed that if the stem cells gave rise to all the other cells of
the blood and immune system, they might be the mysterious agents
that made bone marrow transplants work.
</P>
<P>
   For years, scientists had treated cancer patients with
transplants of donor marrow. The donor marrow replaced the marrow
destroyed by high-dose chemotherapy and radiation. But the donor
marrow contained a crude mix of different types of cells.
Scientists weren't sure which of them actually helped the patient
regenerate healthy new bone marrow, and which caused the side
effects and sometimes potentially fatal complications associated
with the transplants.
</P>
<P>
   They reasoned that if they could give cancer patients infusions
of purified stem cells - either their own or from a donor - they
could get the body to grow a new healthy immune system without side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   But they couldn't test that theory unless they could do safety
studies in animals first. An antibody that could bind to baboon
stem cells gave them the perfect tool they needed to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Using their antibody as the bait, Bensinger, Berenson and their
team invented a device to capture and concentrate stem cells.
Eventually, they gave the pure preparations of stem cells to cancer
patients with immune systems destroyed by chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. The stem cells could generate a new immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a breakthrough series of experiments,'' Bensinger said.
Within a few years, clinicians worldwide were using stem cell
transplants to treat certain kinds of leukemia, multiple myeloma,
breast cancer and other diseases. Studies were under way looking at
the use of stem cell transplants to treat multiple sclerosis,
lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma.
</P>
<P>
   Using pure stem cells for transplants opened up a new realm of
treatment possibilities, said Dr. Richard Burt, director of
transplantation at Northwestern University Medical School in
Chicago. ``It was much cheaper, less toxic and very helpful for
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   A market opportunity
</P>
<P>
   Pure research institutions are not immune to the beckoning of
commerce. With federal research dollars dwindling, many have looked
internally for sources of new cash to drive research. One of the
most promising sources is known as ``technology transfer,'' or the
licensing of discoveries for use by the corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hutchinson was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing an explosion in applications for its research and the
prospect of a huge market, Berenson and a group of venture
capitalists from San Francisco and Seattle licensed the stem cell
separating device from Fred Hutchinson and launched CellPro in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   There were two pieces to the license. The device that separated
the cells was patented. The stem cell antibody used along with it
was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, our focus was on science and not on business,''
said Dr. Irwin Bernstein, head of pediatric oncology for Fred
Hutchinson and the University of Washington Medical Center.
``Someone else (Johns Hopkins) spent the time patenting it, but
never did the work to show that transplants could work.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most research institutions, Fred Hutchinson didn't warranty
its technology. It was up to the licensee to make sure the
technology didn't infringe on anyone else's patents, said Catherine
Hennings, director of technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro, however, appeared to be a good bet to take the
technology to market. CellPro's management team wasn't worried
about Johns Hopkins' patent, partly because the Fred Hutch antibody
was so clinically different than Johns Hopkins'. In spring 1989,
CellPro also got a legal opinion bolstering its view that Johns
Hopkins' patent was invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The company believed it was covered in two respects: There are
hundreds of places an antibody can bind to a stem cell, and in
CellPro's view, Johns Hopkins' patent covered only one of them. The
Fred Hutchinson antibody, by contrast, attached to a different
site. The company also believed that scientific publication of
Civin's work had rendered the patent invalid.
</P>
<P>
   CellPro took off. Focused and intense, the management team
raised nearly $200 million in public and private stock offerings.
The money fueled development of a commercial version of the
cell-separating machine using the Fred Hutchinson technology.
</P>
<P>
   The shares, which sold for $11 at their initial public offering,
soared to nearly $35 as the company managed to do what only a
handful of biotech companies had ever done: It actually launched a
product, and it did it in record time.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, the group had submitted its device, called the Ceprate
SC System, to the Food and Drug Administration. It was approved in
1996. The company had spent more than $100 million to get the
device to market.
</P>
<P>
   That feat earned the company the respect of many in
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a product to market, which is uncommon in our
business,'' said Ed Fritzky, chairman of Immunex Corp., Seattle's
largest biotechnology company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the perhaps 2,500 biotech companies started in the 1980s,
only a handful are around today,'' he said. ``When you think about
(biotech) companies going out of business, or merging or having
difficulty getting money, it's not all that uncommon. What's
uncommon about this is they had a technology and a product that
made it to market.''
</P>
<P>
   By early 1998, CellPro had its devices in more than 100
transplant and research centers in the United States and 150 sites
overseas. There were more than 60 clinical trials under way using
the device to investigate treatments for everything from HIV to
childhood leukemia, and more than 7,000 patients had been treated
with the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``What CellPro did right was keep its eyes on the prize and go
for it,'' said Nicole Provost, a former engineering project leader
for the company. ``Keep it small, turn on a dime, get things done
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   CellPro's success was a potential windfall for Fred Hutchinson.
It was the kind of mega-hit licensing deal institutions much larger
than the Hutch only dream about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible they had a big one,'' said Dr. Bob Miller,
director of the Office of Technology Transfer and associate vice
provost for research at the University of Washington. Institutions
with many times the research budget of Fred Hutchinson are lucky to
have one big license a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now the license that might have been the ``big one'' for Fred
Hutchinson is in limbo. CellPro is going out of business after
losing its patent fight with Baxter Healthcare Corp., Becton
Dickinson &AMP; Co. and Johns Hopkins University. Baxter had
sublicensed Johns Hopkins antibody from Becton Dickinson, which had
obtained the original exclusive license from Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Bensinger said. ``Because of greed and
legal proceedings, the technology won't be available.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to do with CellPro's greed,'' he added. ``They weren't
content to license an agreement with Baxter when they were in a
position to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   CellPro executives said it was Baxter that wanted too much.
</P>
<P>
   With CellPro in ruins, Fred Hutchinson has lost more than half
its royalty revenue stream, potentially tens of millions of
dollars. CellPro stockholders have lost hundreds of millions of
dollars. At the same time, taxpayers will never see the potential
life-saving benefits of research that was funded with government
money.
</P>
<P>
   And some patients will never know whether using cells treated
with the CellPro device would have improved their outcomes, or even
saved their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some (clinical) trials have just stopped,'' Bensinger said.
The testing could resume using a device supplied by another
company.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't help patients who had hoped to enroll in clinical
trials today, Bensinger said. ``The diseases we deal with do not
wait.''

DEMISE OF CELLPRO IS A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOTHELL, Wash. _ CellPro's demise is a cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a microcosm for biotechnology in general,'' said Nicole
Provost, a former CellPro biochemist and bioengineer. ``It's a good
example of how a small technicality can bring a company down.''
</P>
<P>
   CellPro's bankruptcy shows what can happen when competing
interests fight over taxpayer-funded research. It also raises
questions about the best way to ensure federally funded research
benefits the public.
</P>
<P>
   The technology that launched CellPro originated at Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, with a grant from the federal
government. Technology transfer programs have been developed at all
major research institutions to find ways to move promising research
from lab to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We license this technology to companies, especially a startup,
but how it develops totally depends on their business strategy,''
said Catherine Hennings, director of technology transfer for Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.``The question is, when we
license to a startup, should we try to stay more involved, if not
better informed, regarding the decisions the company is making in
its business strategy?''
</P>
<P>
   In its last licensing deal, Fred Hutchinson did exactly that,
obtaining an observer seat on the board of directors of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The CellPro experience could have other repercussions for
technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government asks universities to give prference to
smaller startup companies when granting licenses, said Frederick
Savage, deputy general counsel for Johns Hopkins University. But
universities know that smaller companies don't have the same
ability to fight a patent issue in court, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter and Becton Dickinson _ both multi-billion dollar
companies _ were able to finance the patent battle against CellPro,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others fear the CellPro case sets a precedent that could inhibit
innovation in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If a company can license a discovery from a university, then
turn around and raise the price when they sublicense to another
party, eventually it could make it too costly for small companies
to get licenses, said Tom Kiley, patent attorney and former member
of CellPro's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The CellPro case also illustrates how unpredictable the outcome
can be when the law and the laboratory mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all could be faced with a patent disaster,'' said George
Rathmann, chairman of Bothell-based ICOS, and one of the founders
of Amgen, the Thousand Oaks, Calif., based biotech giant.
</P>
<P>
   If a case goes to court, ``you had your chance, so in one sense,
the system is a just system,'' he said. ``But it doesn't mean every
decision is hands-down fair and wonderful in all respects.''

   The following is a special package of stories on Bothell,
Wash.-based CellPro. Within a month, CellPro expects to finalize
its Chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal court in Seattle. When it
does, it will close the books on one of Seattle's largest and once
most prosperous biotechnology companies, a firm that promised new
treatments for cancer and other diseases.

   BIOTECH-CELLPRO (Bothell, Wash.) Rick Murdock's voice echoes
slightly as he walks through the abandoned labs at the former
CellPro headquarters in Bothell. Wearing the trademark dark suit,
white shirt and tie, he looks the consummate chief executive.
Except he has no business left to run. He steps over the stray
styrofoam peanuts that weave a trail in and out of empty cubicles,
past white lab coats tossed limply over chairs, and rows of barren
lab benches. ``This used to be a busy place,'' he said, waving at
the shelves of half-used solvents and reagents waiting to be
inventoried. ``It's not a pretty sight.'' Within a month, CellPro
expects to finalize its Chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal court in
Seattle. When it does, it will close the books on one of Seattle's
largest and once most prosperous biotechnology companies, a firm
that promised new treatments for cancer and other diseases.

   BIOTECH-CELLPRO-STEMCELL (Bothell, Wash.) In the rarified world
of biotechnology, CellPro was an unusual hybrid: It was both a
commercial and scientific success. But despite the euphoria of the

were hints of trouble on the business side almost from the
beginning. A look at how one of the nation's most promising
bio-tech companies went down the tubes.

<P>
   BIOTECH-CELLPRO-FALL (Bothell, Wash.) Defeated in court, CellPro
took its battle to the court of public opinion. The company
petitioned the government to step in and grant it a license. The
company also continued to court investors, hoping for enough money
to appeal and overturn the legal opinion that prevented them from
selling their product. They were fighting a losing battle. At this
point, other universities and research institutions turned their
backs on CellPro to protect their own future financial interests.
Shareholders sued, charging them with fraud.

 &HT;    ARAB WORLD VIEW OF IRAQ AFFECTED BY MIDEAST PEACE PROCESS
 &HT;    With US-IRAQ-1114.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A recent lessening of Arab world opposition to air
strikes against Iraq appears to be linked, in part, to the progress
in peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   When a similar U.S. military build-up was underway in February,
Arab leaders strongly stated that they opposed air strikes against
their brother country. Arab masses burned American and Israeli
flags in the streets, claiming the pressure on Iraq was nothing
more than a Zionist conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   There is still overall opposition to military action, but it was
tempered by a statement Thursday from several Arab nations that put
the blame on Iraq for the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqi government will be solely responsible for all
repercussions resulting from its decision to block (U.N. weapons
inspections),'' said a statement from Egypt, Syria, and six Persian
Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
   All the countries still oppose military strikes and most will
not allow the United States to use their countries in launching the
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But, the signers of the statement appeared to wash their hands
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and part of the reason might lie
in the peace talks held last month at the Wye River Plantation in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statement is mainly geared to the ears of (President Bill)
Clinton,'' said Walid Kazziha, political scientist at the American
University in Cairo. ``When they see that the United States is
serious about Wye Plantation, they are going to reciprocate on
Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just Wednesday that the Israeli cabinet, delayed by about
two weeks, ratified the Wye Memorandum. The Arab states issued
their statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Israeli officials have been in close daily contact
about preparations for air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Netanyahu angered Palestinians by resuming the
process for construction of Jewish housing on land Palestinians say
belongs to them. Israeli press reported that U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright called Netanyahu and sternly told him that
the move would make it harder for the U.S. to deal with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The link between the peace process and the requirements on Iraq
to allow United Nations weapons inspections is important to most
ordinary Arabs. Most feel a kinship to Iraqis, even though they
might dislike Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   During the build-up in February, many on the streets of Arab
capitals asked why the United States insists on Iraq's compliance
with United Nations orders but lets Israel evade others.
</P>
<P>
   They referred to U.N. resolutions that have urged Israel to
return land it captured in wars with Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kazziha said, it appears that the United States is starting
to pressure Israel into giving up land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He said the eight nations' statement was also meant to urge
Hussein to change his mind about barring weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   All the Arab leaders are publicly urging a diplomatic solution.
Any air strikes now, he said, would confront Arabs in those eight
countries with televised pictures of dead Iraqis and lead them to
ask their respective leaders if they condoned this action --
something that could cause strife in a volatile region.
</P>
<P>
   And, sentiment in the Arab world still continues to focus on
Israel as the regional villain. One of Egypt's main,
government-backed, newspapers carried only a short article about
the Iraq statement, buried inside the paper. The front page was
dedicated to criticism of Netanyahu.

311 ACTS AS CITY GOVERNMENT MAZE BUSTER 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It doesn't happen every day, but a horse could wander
into your back yard and die. Who to call. Police? Sanitation
Department? Animal Control?
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, residents of Dallas haven't had to worry
about it, thanks to a new system of one-stop shopping for municipal
services.
</P>
<P>
   Forget having to memorize whether mosquito control comes under
Health or Environment. Forget the agate type in the phone directory
blue pages and the bewildering roster of bureaucracy. What exactly
does the Board of Adjustment adjust?
</P>
<P>
   Just by dialing 311 _ a number that has done for weed abatement
what 911 did for robberies in progress _ you can report a broken
water line, a barking dog or sloppy trash collection. You can
arrange for time payment of high summer water bills, find out who
your representative is on the city council, complain about traffic
violators, check bus schedules or inquire about personal property
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is one of three cities in the United States to experiment
with a three-digit, nonemergency number and the city council was
told last week that based on the first 10 months of trial, it is
doing pretty much what it was intended to do.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose, said Raymond Sweeney, the fire department
captain who runs the city's communications center, was to shrink
the maze that often traps taxpayers with a municipal problem. In
frustration, large numbers of them resorted to calling 911 with
nonemergency requests or complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one number replaces 28 separate department numbers and
seven dispatch centers,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to 911 have been reduced by 15 percent compared to fiscal
year 1996 and the wait time has been cut in half; operators now
answer, on average, in five seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has improved the level of access for citizens,'' Sweeney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Operators ask callers a series of ``scripted questions'' and key
the answers into a computer, which routes the call to the
appropriate city department.
</P>
<P>
   The 311 system was installed late last year, when the city was
replacing its aging 911 switch. Of the $4.5 million cost of the new
switch, about $500,000 was spent on the 311 function.
</P>
<P>
   Both 911 and 311 calls are received by the same communications
center, where they are automatically sorted by priority, with those
on the emergency line answered first.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore and San Jose, Calif., also have installed 311
switches, but they are for nonemergency police and fire calls only.
Sweeney said officials from Baltimore have visited Dallas'
communications center and apparently are considering adapting their
own 311 system to enhance public access to city government.
</P>
<P>
   Several other cities _ Austin, Los Angeles and San Diego among
them _ have also inspected the Dallas system.
</P>
<P>
   Houston has not. Even without an alternative number to relieve
traffic on emergency lines, Houston has not had a problem with
delays in answering 911 calls, said Barbara Evans, who manages the
city's 911 system.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 20 percent of our calls are nonemergency,'' she said.
``But the wait time is three seconds. We answer 99.9 percent of the
calls in 1 { rings.'' &QL;

DEPARTING NAVAL SECRETARY TO NAME SUB FOR TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ John Dalton said one of his final acts as
secretary of the Navy will be to name the second Virginia-class
submarine for his home state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans have always been innovators, patriots and leaders, and
the crew of USS Texas will showcase those traits, as well as our
core values of honor, courage and commitment well into the 21st
century,'' Dalton said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton, 56, of San Antonio is a Naval Academy graduate and was
sworn into office in 1993. He is the last of President Clinton's
original national security team and officially steps down Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wonderful honor for our state and very appropriate
that the new Virginia-class submarine will be named for the state
of Texas,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. ``Like Texas,
itself, the Virginia-class sub will always be on the front line in
the defense of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth ship to bear the name Texas, it will join the Navy
fleet in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear-powered Virginia-class sub surpasses the performance
of any current or projected submarine. Virginia-class submarines
will be able to attack targets ashore with highly accurate Tomahawk
cruise missiles and conduct long-term, covert surveillance of land,
water and other naval forces.
</P>
<P>
   Other missions include anti-submarine and anti-ship warfare,
special forces delivery and support, mine delivery and minefield
mapping.
</P>
<P>
   With enhanced communications abilities, these submarines also
will provide important battle group and joint force support,
according to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Texas will be built at Newport News Shipbuilding &AMP;
Drydock Co. in Newport News, Va. Each Virginia-class sub will cost
about $1 billion.

SAN FRANCISCO ZOO'S GORILLA BABY GETS A NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The name of San Francisco's only baby gorilla
will not be Magilla Gorilla or Hairy Spice but Nneka, an Ibo word
meaning ``mother is supreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Nneka (pronounced Ni-nee-ka) defeated those punnier proposals in
a name-the-tiny-ape contest held by the San Francisco Zoo, where
the furry little baby was born 7 weeks ago to Bawang, an
18-year-old lowland gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   Nneka might have been named earlier, except zoo workers couldn't
determine if the popeyed anthropoid should be wearing pink or blue.
Bawang clutched her child too tightly for details to be discerned.
</P>
<P>
   Nneka was officially named Thursday morning at a ceremony along
the edge of Gorilla World, the zoo's seven-resident lowland gorilla
exhibit. Bawang strolled contentedly in the background, popping
Nneka onto her back _ well, the back of her butt _ for a ride
through the glistening grass.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo publicist Nancy Chan said 250 names were submitted in the
contest. Zoo workers narrowed the field to 10, then handed the list
to Penny and Jim Coulter, zoo donors and volunteers, and their
young daughters for the final selection.
</P>
<P>
   The Coulter girls _ Saer, 7, and Audrey, 6 _ peeked over the top
of a podium Thursday to read the winning selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lots of good names, I have to say _ all fun
names,'' Penny Coulter said. ``The African names are really fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner was submitted by Susanne Johnson, a 44-year-old
retail marketing employee from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a bookstore and got a book on baby names from all
over the world,'' she said. She chose Nneka, from the Ibo people of
Nigeria, because ``I liked the way it looked, the way it sounded.
It was a West-African name, and the gorillas are from West
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the meaning _ ``mother is supreme.'' Gorilla
bands are led by a dominant male and she wanted the mama apes to
get some press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea that there's still that important female part
of the group,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nneka is the first gorilla born at the zoo in five years, Chan
said. The last was her brother, Barney, whose interest in Nneka has
been discouraged by their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lets him touch the baby but when he grabs for its midriff
she pushes him back,'' said Carol Martinez, the gorilla keeper.
``It's wonderful to work around them and wait on them hand and
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   She said lowland gorillas in the wild begin to crawl at about 3
or 4 months, but Nneka's mother is already placing her on the
ground for teeny tastes of independence. ``If one of the other
gorillas approaches, she'll hold her,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Nneka's father is Mkubwa, the regal male in charge. He and
Bawang have a third offspring, Shango, who celebrates his 10th
birthday in March.

PLANNERS BRINGG NEW LIFE TO DEAD MALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- In the 40 years since Robert C. Wood
popularized the phrase in his book, ``Suburbia,'' cul de sacs and
offramps have multipled because people seek the grail of a picket
fence and grass of one's own. Like other dreams, the vision of
suburbia is frayed by reality. Land is no longer cheap in suburbia,
a factor more important than traffic.
</P>
<P>
   On all-news radio, traffic reporting is not really news, because
the story is so often the same. Traffic reporters have become
therapists, assuring their creep-and-crawl constituents at every
cloverleaf that misery loves company.
</P>
<P>
   Congestion can mean opportunity. Peter Calthrope, as a ``new
urbanist'' planner, has tackled that distinctively suburban totem,
the shopping mall. Neither he nor anyone else will be bulldozing
petunia patches soon, but many malls are dead or dying and their
owners are willing to listen to new ideas.``Densifying the suburb''
is Cal-thorpe's answer to ``the maturation of the American
suburb.''
</P>
<P>
   The new idea is old: a village, with street-scapes and
mixed-income housing above retail stores. When Calthorpe spoke to
the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association, he
showed slides of such a transformed parking lot in Florida. ``These
apartments are tremendously successful,'' he said. ``Typically in
Florida, the upper floors always rent first because of the big
views. There, the second floor rented first because people like
watching other people go by.''
</P>
<P>
   Calthorpe's redesign efforts have transformed malls in San Diego
and near Portland, Ore., where multi-family housing replaced
``chaos and suburban strip malls.'' Small parking garages,
including a car-stacking German invention, are more efficient than
surface parking, more appealing, and therefore more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urbanism is transferable to suburbs, and, quite frankly,
people are starting to make money on it. That's the good news,''
Calthorpe says. Some of the bad news is ``never-ending.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think cities can be healthy as isolated phenomena,''
he says. ``More and more we're becoming regional cultures, not
cities or towns or villages. Even though all of our jurisdictions
and governance mitigates against it, our most serious issues,
whether it's concentrations of poverty or environmental impact, are
regional in scope.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of ``metropolitan planning'' as a panacea never
succeeded when suburbia was young. Such top-down notions rarely
fly, except in places like Oregon. ``We need affordable housing
infill and we need more rail transit. Both of these things need
regional governance,'' Calthorpe notes. ``We continue to address
everything on a piecemeal basis.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a truism of American life that major civic problems
persist until the pain spreads, however unevenly. Suburbs will stop
competing with each other only when they band together against a
common foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch individual jurisdictions chasing high-tax-base land
uses,'' Calthorpe says, citing his experience in Fremont, a city on
the edge of Silicon Valley, which has a housing crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do a mixed-use development, with well-located,
affordable, mixed-income housing, but the city saw this endless
stream of tax dollars from a commercial development,'' he recalls.
``It's the same thing with Wal-Mart. A town says: `We want Wal-Mart
because it's a lot of tax dollars and it'll go to go to the next
town if we turn it down.' Wal-Mart can manipulate towns into
destroying their own main streets because of this odd logic.
Regional tax-base sharing would cure this.''
</P>
<P>
   Calthorpe may be a visionary but he believes in incrementalism
or, as he calls it, ``ad hoc regionalism.'' Bringing new life to
dead malls happens only five or 10 acres at a time, but it does
prove that no matter how bleak or chaotic a suburban landscape,
``You can airlift urbanism, drop it down, and watch it take root
and grow.''

PETS CAN GET LYME DISEASE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marilyn Gates, a breeder of champion German shorthair pointers,
noticed that her dog Bruno was lying down a little slowly. And when
he got up, there was an ever-so-slight hesitation. He was a little
more quiet than usual, just not himself.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who lives in a wooded area in Garrison, N.Y., caught the
problem very early. It often begins as a limp, first in one leg and
then perhaps moving to another. There can be other symptoms too: a
fever, swollen lymph nodes, lethargy, and kidney inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   What all that may lead up to is Lyme disease, a tick-borne
illness that appears to be on a slight but steady increase in dogs
nationwide. The word ``may'' is important here, because Lyme
disease is not all that easy to diagnose. The reason it ``seems''
to be on the increase is that no one has solid figures. Anecodotal
evidence substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change, says Dr. Terry Purbaugh of the Wayland
(Mass.) Animal Clinic, is that just a few years ago, he found Lyme
only in dogs who vacationed with their owners on Cape Cod and the
islands. Now he is seeing the disease in some dogs that haven't
left his area, though not many.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McGuill, a veterinarian for the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health, says the disease is difficult to track, though it
appears to be on a slight rise. Still, in this area, the highest
incidence is on the coast, on the Cape, islands and, to a certain
extent, the North Shore.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Douglas Brum, a clinician at Angell Memorial Animal Hospital
in Boston, says the disease is increasing slightly, but he believes
the diagnosis of it is increasing at a much faster clip. He thinks
that Lyme disease in pets, which is not generally as debilitating
as it can be in humans, is being overdiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit in Lyme disease is a strain of bacteria carried in
the saliva of hard ticks. (Around here, that is the tiny deer
tick.) As many as half of the dogs in an infested area may test
positive for the Lyme spirochete, or spiral-shaped bacteria, and
show no symptoms. That means that many dogs who have been exposed
to the bacteria never get sick from it.
</P>
<P>
   Say that your dog picks up a deer tick at some point, but never
develops an illness. A year later, a simple sprain is diagnosed,
through a blood test, as Lyme disease. And because Lyme is most
often easy to treat in dogs _ with antibiotics such as doxycycline
or tetracycline, by the time the sprain heals, it may appear that
the dog who actually had never been sick with Lyme disease has been
cured of it.
</P>
<P>
   But Brum says the blood test is not always definitive and that
clinical symptoms _ lameness in more than one leg (usually, he
says, the dog appears to be ``walking on eggshells'') and a fever
(a dog's normal temperature is 102.5) _ are just as important. He
worries that Lyme may become a catch-all diagnosis for other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying there isn't Lyme disease out there,'' Brum
says. ``There is.'' But he adds that even at his busy practice in
the city's biggest animal hospital, he only sees six to eight cases
of Lyme in dogs a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease, which started showing up in humans in the 1970s
around Old Lyme, Conn., was identified in dogs in New York in 1983.
It is actually found throughout the world, but in the United States
it is most commonly reported in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
states.
</P>
<P>
   Livestock, including horses, also can suffer from it. The
disease is not the same in all species. Cats rarely get it. It is
not known if that is because they typically remove the ticks
themselves during the first 24 hours (which can be critical in
preventing disease), or if they simply don't get sick from the
bacteria. While dogs can get sick from Lyme disease, they tend not
to develop the chronic problems with it that people often do.
</P>
<P>
   That should all be taken into consideration when deciding
whether to opt for a Lyme disease vaccine that is now available. In
general, vets are beginning to feel that perhaps we over-vaccinate
our pets, so many do not recommend the vaccine for dogs living
outside the most problematic tick areas. Brum and Purbaugh, for
instance, do not recommend the vaccine for dogs who are not in New
England's trouble zones. While use of the vaccine is still being
debated, we know the efficacy of the treatment is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Marilyn Gates. She lives in one of those trouble spots,
and more than one of her dogs has been treated for Lyme. She has
battled the disease herself, but has witnessed her dogs spring back
to vigor within four days of starting an antibiotic. One of her
Lyme survivors, a German shorthair named Bayern, in fact, became a
tracking champ.

WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT TV'S APPALLING QUALITY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 50 years after commercial television invaded American
life, an obvious question is why so much of it _ especially on the
networks _ is so arid, vacuous and bleak. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A less obvious question is whether the soulless sex- and
violence-laden dreck that fills prime time TV matters any more,
given the explosion of alternative information and entertainment
choices. (Yes, it does, but maybe not as much.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast industry, after all, has atomized. This means more
people can ignore the insipid debris on commercial TV by choosing
instead to plug into satellites, get specialized cable channels
(the History Channel is a wholesome example) and surf the Internet
(sometimes on a medium-blurring device called Web TV). Though, of
course, those sources also harbor sludge amid more uplifting
offerings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hopeful evidence, as ratings show, is that some formerly
heavy TV viewers may be making better choices, leaving behind the
network offal of murder and body fluids as entertainment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans,'' says Henry Labalme, executive director of a
nonprofit advocacy group, TV-Free America, ``are finally moving
beyond the old debates about whose show is better than whose and
recognizing that all TV-watching displaces interactions and
activities that are simply healthier, more productive and more
fun.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In short, some folks are discovering a liberating truth: Much of
commercial TV is cultural pollution. Indeed, says Labalme's group,
this past April a record five million people joined in National
TV-Turnoff Week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody,'' he says, ``ever lay on their death bed wishing they
had spent more time watching Geraldo Rivera or Rosie O'Donnell.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even if repugnant situation comedies and violent dramas are
a smaller percentage of what's on network TV, they're still there,
drawing millions of viewers. Why? No doubt for many reasons, but
one is compellingly clear: Much of our culture _ because it relies
on lowest-common-denominator commercial success _ is equally vapid
and disheartening. (How else to explain brand loyalty to products
that clog arteries or cause lung cancer?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sobering reality is that commercial TV offers a reasonably
accurate picture of who we are _ a people mired in a culture of
celebrity, afraid of life-affirming risk, leery of real creativity
and willing to do almost anything to avoid hard questions about
ultimate meaning. Cowering in living rooms, demanding to be
anesthetized by cheap, tawdry entertainment, people who watch the
drivel on commercial TV get what they deserve because they buy the
products for which the medium creates demand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And let's be clear: Commercial TV's main function has not
changed from the late 1940s, when Jack Benny and Milton Berle were
becoming its first stars. It exists to sell brand-name soap. Well,
soap, beer and cars, not to speak of aspirin, computers and soft
drinks. It is nothing less than a magnet advertisers use to attract
a critical mass of customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everything else is secondary. Everything. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This role explains much of the astonishingly puerile, stupefying
prime time shows I watched recently to reacquaint myself with the
sort of bilge I have refused to watch for decades. They all seem to
be about nothing but irresponsible, casual sex. Some highlights: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ On ``Suddenly Susan,'' an NBC show, a sidekick character
observes star Brooke Shields' unmarried character's
out-of-the-ordinary breakfast and concludes it means but one thing:
``You're having sex! Way to go!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shield's lying response: ``The closest thing I have to a sex
life is when my Thighmaster slips.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ On ABC's ``Home Improvement,'' the unmarried sister of star
Tim Allen's TV wife has sex in Allen's house with Allen's unmarried
TV brother. Allen dismisses it as inconsequential. Allen's wife
tells him, ``You'd be comfortable doing it with a relative in the
room.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ On ``Clueless,'' a UPN show on which actors without skill
recite lines without meaning to advance a story without plot, a
euphemism for sex is ``going downtown.'' When the female star (Who
cares what her name is?) gets interrupted while waiting for a kiss,
she says, ``Hello! Girl and tongue waiting!'' The to-be-continued
episode ends when fake human feces (soon eaten by an actor) in a
swimming pool breaks up a party. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Spin City,'' an ABC show, opens with star Michael J. Fox's
unmarried character telling a slim, unmarried model, ``Look, just
because we've been on a couple of dates doesn't mean there's any
pressure.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She responds by removing her blouse. We next see her lying on a
bed in just her bra and panties. The actual intercourse, bless ABC,
occurs off camera. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That was amazing,'' he says afterward. She yodels, explaining,
``I like to yodel after sex.'' He responds, ``I prefer the wave,''
and raises both his arms. Later she complains to him, ``You don't
know anything about me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But already I know too much: She has apparently unprotected sex
with anyone she wants, then wonders why her sex partners don't get
to know her. Such people once were called tramps and wolves; now
they're stars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notice I've said nothing about daytime TV's lurid soap operas or
the animated Comedy Central hit ``South Park,'' in one episode of
which the muffled, elementary-school character Kenny uses vulgar
anatomical language to describe female body parts he likes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a sad use of a potentially (and sometimes an actually)
marvelous medium. If, as one A.C. Nielsen study shows, children
watch nearly 4 hours of TV a day (other studies report the time has
fallen to 90 minutes), it's no wonder that 95 percent of Americans
between the ages of 13 and 17 can name the actor who played the
Fresh Prince of Bel Air on TV (Will Smith) but only 2 percent can
name the chief justice of the United States (William Rehnquist). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Television,'' Marshall McLuhan once said, ``is teaching all
the time.'' Indeed, one of its lessons should be this: Art doesn't
require a laugh track. But a recent ``New Yorker'' article quotes
Jamie Tarses, ABC Entertainment president, as essentially saying
viewers are idiots: ``People will wonder, Am I supposed to think
this is funny or serious? People need the comforting aural cue of
laughter.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The technology to deliver all this is improving rapidly. We're
moving toward wide availability of High Definition Television
(HDTV), Digital Video Discs (DVD) and ``Flat TV,'' which uses
plasma, or charged gas, to light color pixels that make up images. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what difference will that make if we burn time watching this
still-vast wasteland's rubbish? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 years ago, author E.B. White saw a demonstration of TV
and declared, ``We shall discover either a new and unbearable
disturbance of the general peace or a saving radiance in the
sky.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget the saving radiance. After all, commercial TV's
spiritually empty role is to collect zombies to buy the advertised
products, a job built on the lie that more stuff will make us
happy. But whether TV continues to be an unbearable disturbance is
up to us. Our job, after all, is to be discerning and responsible
in this new era of choices. &QL;

IS IMF A CARING HEALER OR GRAVEDIGGER? 
 
By"CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ A key dispute stemming from the Asian
economic crisis is vhether the International Monetary Fund has been
a caring healer or sinister gravedigger.
</P>
<P>
   Thnse disparate points of view are expected to be argued, at
least in private sessions, during the annual meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group here this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a long debate about whether the IMF made
it worse or better,'' said Daniel Yergin, a leading U.S.-based
economic analyst.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are stiff fiscal reform requirements that are part of
bailout packages constructed by the IMF for several of the most
damaged natinns. Driving the IMF, a leading interjational financial
institution bankrolled by wealthier nations, were demands for hotly
debated ``conditionalities'' by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   The measures attack ``crony capitilism,'' requiring an end to
the cozy link between government, banks and giant corporations that
have been a hallmark the commercial dealings in the(region.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the changes contend they stem from a classic
Wa3hington misunderstanding of Asian culture. Proponents, however,
say the crony system has allowed wildly unbusinesslike dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the IMF requirements are the detailed reporting of
reserves, allowing overseas investors a clearer(national financial
profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It"hasn't gone down well at all,'' said Patrick Smith, q
longtime Asian economic and political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of the IMF has grown loud enough that fund
officials have been forced into public defense of their
institution, which prefers to remains quietly above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech earlier this year, Stanley Fischer, IMF's chief
deputy managinf director, spoke out against ``a number of critical
misconceptions'' about his organization and its role in the Asian
crisis, which began in July 1997 with a run on Thai currency, the
baht.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said IMF loan conditions are often unpopular because
``the fund is typically called in only in a crisis, generally a
result of the government's having been unwilling to take action
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Asian leaders$ like Joun Yung Sun, the Korean vice minister
of Foreign Affairs and Trade, concede that ``the trouble started
from our own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But the critics can be vocal. Last week, an estimated 30,000
protesters _ primarily fasmers and students _ rallied in Seoul
against the government's approach to the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said reluctance to take needed steps _ leading to IMF
insistence on the measures _ was understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the medicine to bure the crisis had been tasty, the country
would have taken it long ago,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal economists, such as Mark Weisbrot of the Preamble Center
in Vashington, said that in Asia, at deast, the IMF has been guilty
of overmedication. The IMF requirements deepened the problems,
Weisbrot said, because they ``created the huge foreign-exchange
risk, which (the countries) never had before.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, conservative economists also
have faulted the IIF, which more traditionally has rerponded to
government debt crises, but rallied to action in Asia over what was
initially a private exchange-rate standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Former Republican Cabinet officers Feorge Shultz and William
Simon and former Citibank clairman Walter Wriston spoke out earlier
this year against the IMF as ``ineffective, unnecessary and
obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   But former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker has called for
restraint: ``One need not agree with every policy and decision gf
the IMF to realize that it is the only vehicle we have ... to bring
consensus and legitimacy to reform the financial system.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisbrot contends, hkwever, that in Asia IMF intervention
``turned it into a crisis of the reah economy instead of a
liquidity crisis. Tjey took advantage of the situation to force
further opening up and deregulation on their ekonomies, which will
create further problems in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   This contention is ``still popular in the hardest hit Asian
countries,'' Harvard economist Dwight Perkins notes in a recent
report for Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ``It is often
argued that the IMF should have solved the liqqidity problems and
worried about the structural reforms later.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics have put forward varied, less stringent a`Asian
solutions'' and at the seme time contended |hat four of the nations
that experienced the most fifficulties _ Thailand, Indonesia, the
Philippines and South Korea _ were countries that followed the U.S.
economic model most closely.
</P>
<P>
   And Weisbrot recently argued that China, which does not have a
convertible currency at all, has weathered the crisis better than
many neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``So clearly there are many alternatives that countries will
find work better than submitting to a highly irrational and
deregulated system of global commerce,'' Weisbrot said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is unimpressed with such claims.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in his address last month to the annual joint
meeting of the IMF and World Bank, warned against ``false cures
that will backfire and lead in the end to less liquidity ...''
</P>
<P>
   He called for the world financial leaders to pull off what would
be a neat trick: ``We must fashion arrangements that serve the
global economy as our domestic economies are served _ enabling
capital to flow freely without the crushing burdens the boom-bust
cycle brings.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF restructuring requirements have broad support from the
international financial establishment, as mirrored in the view of
the Financial Times that ``Korea and Thailand, having accepted
their IMF medicine, are furthest along the road to recovery.'' &QL;

U.S. ACCUSES JAPAN OF BRIBING ASIAN NATIONS, SOFTENING OPEN-TRADE
INITIATIVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ The Clinton administration Friday
accused Japan of bribing other Asian nations in an attempt to
soften support for a key open-trade initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation came from U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky on the eve of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation talks
here. The United States had hoped the meeting would produce an
agreement on seeking accelerated tariff elimination in nine product
groups with annual global trade worth of $1.5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has gone around the region offering assistance in the
form of money to countries willing to back away from the
initiative,'' Barshefsky said. ``That is to say Japan is actively
discouraging countries from liberalizing (trade) who are fully
involved in this initiative. This is terribly disturbing and
destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Barshefsky referred to $30 billion in economic
assistance Japan has unilaterally offered to nations in the region
hit hard by the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is opposed to the tariff-elimination project because the
nine economic sectors include fish and forest products, two small
but critical industries to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
which is under domestic political attack because of the nation's
continuing economic slide.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more importantly, for Japan to agree to open trade
in those products could mean that agriculture, an even bigger
political headache for the LDP, could be in the next round of
sectors to face liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   The other seven sectors considered with fish and forest products
are environmental goods and services, medical equipment and
instruments, chemicals, gems and jewelry, energy goods and
services, telecommunications equipment and toys.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's payment ploy appears to be working, because Tokyo has
reportedly gained support from China, Indonesia, Thailand and host
Malaysia _ enough to block what the United States has called the
``critical mass'' of nations needed to move the preliminary,
voluntary trade deal to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky refused to concede that Japan had derailed the trade
proposal and expressed a lack of interest in piecemeal action on
freeing trade in some, but not all the sectors.
</P>
<P>
   She said the United States would ``have to consider all
possibilities'' for shaping a trade deal at the APEC session, but
focusing her ire on Japan added: ``Token participation ... by the
world's second largest economy doesn't cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had hoped to make the trade liberalization
agreement a bright spot in what otherwise will be a meeting weighed
down by the continuing effects of the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis, which began 16 months ago as a currency exchange
debacle, has sapped eastern Asia's once vigorous economies and sent
most of them toward negative growth for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Government ministers from the 18 current and three incoming APEC
member nations will meet Saturday and Sunday in the Malaysian
capital, and the countries' leaders will assemble Tuesday and
Wednesday for their annual session.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton warned in Washington earlier this week that his
administration would not tolerate U.S. markets being ``flooded'' by
cheap imports, Barshefsky said the president, due here Monday,
would not be seeking export limits from the struggling economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not. Absolutely not. Absolutely not,'' Barshefsky
said, adding, ``Underscored, all caps, bold.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, however, Clinton is expected to be critical of
stepped-up steel exports from Japan to the United States, ``and
that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the economic turmoil in Asia, Barshefsky said: ``We should
expect imports to increase. We should expects exports to decrease.
It will be with us for some period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, she said, ``must act as an engine of
growth.'' But so should Japan, she said, citing statistics to
question Tokyo's commitment to helping its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, she said, Asian exports to the United States
were up 10 percent, but exports from other Asian nations to Japan
were down 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky brushed aside suggestions that Japan's economic
assistance package could be a good-faith effort to restore growth
to the region.
</P>
<P>
   For Japan to help restore growth to the region, Barshefsky said,
it needs sustained and massive fiscal stimulus of its own economy,
a clean-up of its banking system, recapitalization of financial
institutions, and additional opening of its own markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suggesting to countries that they not open their markets
because Japan may have an internal political problem is hardly the
way in which growth is going to be restored to Asia,'' Barshefsky
said. &QL;

ECONOMIC VIEW: EVEN THE RICH CAN SUFFER FROM INCOME INEQUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 15) 
(bl) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trend is painfully evident in the statistics. Over the last
quarter century, the incomes of millions of Americans have grown
farther apart, so much so that a phrase, income inequality, has
been coined to describe what has happened. Income inequality has
persisted, undented so far, through the economic expansion of the
1990s. Now social scientists are beginning to assess the damage
that it inflicts on Americans _ the rich as well as the much less
rich _ in their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   The initial findings are sometimes startling, if still
inconclusive. Life expectancy, for example, appears to be adversely
linked to income inequality. Americans live longer than they used
to _ someone born today can expect to reach 76 _ but still not as
long as people in Japan, Germany and Switzerland, where incomes are
similarly high but are more equally distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors besides income play a role in life expectancy:
differing rates of highway deaths, for instance, and the prevalence
of AIDS. But in any attempt to understand American social problems,
enduring income inequality must now be considered as well, said
Christopher Jencks, a professor of sociology at the Kennedy School
of government at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had asked me a year ago if there was evidence that
income inequality had some social consequence, I would have said,
`Gee, I don't know,''' said Jencks, who recently began a study of
the subject with two other academics. ``But the data seem to say
that if you are of average income, living among people of average
income, you are less likely to have a heart attack than if you live
more stressfully in a community where there is you in the middle,
and a bunch of rich people and a bunch of poor people. That seems
hard to believe, but it is the direction in which the evidence
seems to point.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, economists have been expecting egalitarian America to
revert to the pattern of the early postwar years, when spreads in
income were much smaller between people like office workers,
teachers, mechanics, bus drivers and factory workers on the one
hand, and doctors, lawyers, investment bankers, engineers and
executives on the other. The assumption was that families would
soon migrate back to middle income, earning between $30,000 and
$80,000 a year in today's dollars _ a category that represented 63
percent of all families in 1973 but only 50 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   If income inequality did persist, then many economists hoped for
relief from a re-emergence of a second egalitarian characteristic
of American life that has all but disappeared. Before 1973,
salaries and wages rose faster than the inflation rate for most
workers; janitors and chief executives, office workers and their
bosses, shared in this progress.
</P>
<P>
   But wages for most Americans earning less than $75,000 a year
have either stagnated since 1973 or lost ground to inflation _ even
after taking into account an across-the-board increase in wages
since 1996, a trend now threatened by the slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Wage stagnation changes perceptions. When the boss, to take a
fanciful example, gets a big enough raise to buy a digital
television set to replace his old color TV and his subordinates get
enough of a raise to afford color TV's in place of black-and-white
sets, that is progress in America. But when the boss' raise buys a
digital TV but a meager increase for subordinates leaves them stuck
with black and white, a social problem is born _ resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Income inequality and wage stagnation exacerbate each other;
the inequality would not be such a problem if incomes were going up
for everyone,'' said Frank Levy, a labor economist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who deals with this issue in
an updated version of his 1988 book, ``Dollars and Dreams''
(Russell Sage).
</P>
<P>
   Inequality isn't all bad. The pursuit of better jobs with higher
pay and regular raises has induced men and women to get more
education. They are postponing marriage while they prepare, and,
once they do marry, the men spend much more time on household
chores than in the past, some new studies show. And they seek as
spouses women who are likely to be good earners rather than simply
good homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   But men and women also marry with the expectation that both
parties will work hard indefinitely, and that is turning out to be
untenable. Women in particular spend much more time at work, in
part because their status in the workplace is growing closer to
that of men, but also because it means extra family income in times
of wage stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that when children come, the women, and
increasingly the men, want to reduce the time they spend at work _
and they find that they cannot. More and more studies make this
point.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because families need the money. And it is partly
because so many jobs that pay well require long hours. ``Most of
the people caught in this stressful situation,'' said Rosalind
Barnett, a psychologist at Brandeis University, ``are managers and
professionals who fear the negative career repercussions, the
strain in their marriages and the loss of too much income if they
cut back and follow their hearts.''

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Among the many computer books out there,
``Windows for Dummies'' has been recommended. I am keeping in mind
that this comes from my ex-boyfriend.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   DEAR SEEKER: Well, he was wrong about everything else, wasn't
he? No, wait! That's what my ex says about me. Your situation is
probably very different from the shrill, shrieking horror of my
life.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, those ``Dummies'' books are a great place to start if
you're totally in the dark. Just make sure they're not too
fundamental for you. Go to the bookstore, plop down with a latte
and a laptop and do some ``browsing.'' Or go to www.dummies.com and
read sample chapters before you shell out 20 bucks for something
you may not even need.
</P>
<P>
   You know, those people have a book for just about everything.
There's even ``Sex for Dummies.'' Hmmmm. I should have bought that
one for that shrew of a ... Sorry! Didn't mean to let my personal
life intrude. It won't happen again.

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have some questions about your collum first
are you a hacker and if you are not how do you know so much about

</P>
<P>
   DEAR WORD: In case some brain-dead salesclerk can't give you a
straight answer, just about any scanner you buy can do both. The
scanner simply takes a picture of the page. Character-recognition
software, which ought to come with the scanner, does its best to
recognize letters in that picture and turn them into text in a new
file. A blurry or smudged original means lots of typos, so try to
keep from spilling your tropical drink all over the page before
scanning.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Almost every week you tell us some new ``stupid
software trick'' the Microsoft engineers have put in their
products. Is this why their programs are so ridiculously large?
</P>
<P>
   _ Size Matters
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SIZE: Those little Easter eggs only take up a fraction of
the space in the programs. Microsoft applications are so
ridiculously large because they do about 700 times the number of
things most casual users need. For instance, Microsoft has been
adding on to Word since Bill Gates' acne cleared up, making it
bigger and bigger.
</P>
<P>
   In almost all Microsoft setup programs, there is an option for
``custom'' installation. Use that, and you can pick and choose
exactly how much stuff to install.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of software tricks, you guys aren't playing fair.
You're supposed to be sending me stuff. I'm tired of just giving
and giving and giving. But it was always about you, wasn't it? I
should have seen how selfish you were, but, no, I let you walk all
over me. Well, not anymore. You're not the boss of ... Whoops! Did
it again, didn't I?

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just before 9 on Tuesday morning, if tradition
holds, Alan Greenspan will stride through a doorway behind the desk
in his private office and into the Federal Reserve's ornate board
room. He will take his seat at the head of the 27-foot-long
mahogany and granite table and then, for the 91st time in his 11
years as chairman of the central bank, call to order a meeting of
the Federal Open Market Committee, the group that sets interest
rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   The process is almost ritualistic. But with much of the world
reeling from the financial shocks set off last year in Asia, and
with the markets and the economy at home in flux, the situation now
confronting Greenspan and his colleagues is anything but
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan ascended to icon status through his success at the
monumental, but well-defined, task of extinguishing inflation. The
question now is whether he can guide policy as successfully through
a period in which both the economy and the threats to it are
changing with blinding speed.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a business expansion in the United States that in
December will become, at seven years and nine months, the longest
in the nation's history, aside from the 1960s boom fueled by
spending on the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   For Greenspan, there is also a legacy at stake. He is 72. And
though he has not indicated whether he wants to be reappointed when
his current term, his third, expires in the summer of 2000, today's
economic crosscurrents have created a challenge whose outcome will
shape how he is remembered in the history books.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is Greenspan thinking amid the swirl? He rarely
answers questions directly, as anyone who tries to parse his public
comments soon discovers. So his is a mind that economists,
investors and politicians have been trying to read since he was
appointed to replace Paul Volcker as the Fed chairman in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   They have learned to pick up any major shifts in policy _ and,
often, to guess the next interest rate move. The guessing now is
that he intends to trim rates Tuesday by another quarter-point, to
make sure that the gradual economic slowdown does not become a
recession next year.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speeches, congressional appearances and private
conversations with economists and government officials in the past
few years, Greenspan has also been laying out a broader and still
evolving framework for his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart are the financial markets. Where Greenspan once
obsessed over small-bore indicators for clues to emerging
inflationary bottlenecks, he now cites the spread between
ultra-safe Treasury bonds and corporate debt to illustrate his
concern that investor psychology could derail the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Long viewed as a single-minded, perhaps narrow-minded, inflation
fighter, Greenspan has been careful not to suggest any diminution
of his commitment to price stability, which he calls the
``essential precondition'' for a healthy economy. But with
inflation having receded for now, he has also become more
fascinated with how advances in technology are affecting the
economy _ and how the combination of technology and more powerful
markets can instantly bring prosperity or wreak havoc around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity growth, a key to better living standards, appears
to be improving, in Greenspan's view, reflecting a delayed payoff
from the huge investments by business over the years in computers
and other new technology. Elements of the economy that are most
prone to recession-inducing imbalances _ like industrial capacity
and inventories _ can now be managed much more efficiently, he
believes, helping to dampen the business cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But while the finances of both businesses and individuals are
tied more closely to the markets than ever, even the most powerful
policy-makers can do little to control the markets, Greenspan
contends.
</P>
<P>
   His bottom line is this: Global forces are making monetary
policy trickier, but they are advancing a sometimes painful, yet
ultimately beneficial, shift toward market capitalism _ a cause he
has promoted since his days as a saxophone-playing disciple of Ayn
Rand in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``For good or ill, an unforgiving capitalist process is driving
wealth creation,'' Greenspan said in a speech earlier this year.
``It has become increasingly difficult for policy makers who wish
to practice, as they put it, a more `caring' capitalism to realize
the full potential of their economies. As a consequence,
increasingly, nations appear to be opting to open themselves to
competition, however harsh, and become producers that can compete
in world markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has as many critics as ever. Some think that he
continues to focus unduly on inflation at the expense of jobs and
higher wages, and that his failure to cut U.S. interest rates
sooner has exacerbated the global crisis. Others think that in his
fixation on the markets, he is paying too little attention to
warning signals of inflation, like rapid growth in the money
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Another group thinks he is drawing sweeping conclusions from
what is no more than a temporary period of good economic luck. And
the rise of left-leaning governments in Western Europe, along with
the resistance to free-market capitalism in capitals from Kuala
Lumpur to Moscow, challenge his conclusions about economic history.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, of course, does not set policy by himself, and his
colleagues at the Fed have their own ideas about what is happening.
But his evolving thinking helps explain why the Fed stayed largely
on the sidelines in the last few years as the U.S. economy exceeded
the ``speed limit'' imposed by traditional forecasting models and
rules. It serves as the foundation for the concerns he has
expressed recently about the risks to the economy from the
near-panic in the bond markets _ and suggests that he remains
extremely concerned about the financial market problems even as the
panic begins to subside.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps to shape an impression _ by no means universal _
that Greenspan is more willing to rethink his approach than he gets
credit for, and that he is not as preoccupied with economic
minutiae as many have long believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's impressive about Greenspan is that he's open-minded to
the fact that each business cycle is different and the economy is
changing and we don't know as much as we think we know,'' said
William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs.

TEXAS BAPTIST CONSERVATIVES DECLARE INDEPENDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A few miles north of the San Jacinto Battlefield where
Texans won their independence from Mexico in 1836, another small
band of Texans declared their independence this week.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 Texas Baptist conservatives met at a church in east
Houston and officially formed a breakaway state convention as an
alternative to the moderate-controlled Baptist General Convention
of Texas. The new group will be called the Southern Baptists of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the group of Texas conservatives was small, it was just
as enthusiastic as the Texans led by Sam Houston _ a Baptist, by
the way _ who defeated Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's larger
army and won the decisive Battle of San Jacinto 162 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives broke away from the much larger Baptist General
Convention of Texas because the state group refused to go along
with the conservatives' rise to power in the national Southern
Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Texas conservatives who agree with the strict
conservatism of the national convention had tried to take over the
state convention. When they failed, they decided to form their own,
alternative convention.
</P>
<P>
   Moderates in charge of the Baptist General Convention of Texas
have slowly distanced themselves from the national convention,
voting to send less money to the national body, establishing
theology training schools with a moderate base, creating some of
their own mission programs and printing a small amount of church
literature.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas moderates still send money to the national convention.
But they appalled national conservatives by also backing the
Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, a moderate organization formed as
an alternative to the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other religious groups, Southern Baptist state and
national bodies are not bound together by church law. They
cooperate voluntarily. Baptists refer to the arrangement as a
``rope of sand.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Baptist moderates _ in Texas, Virginia and other states
_ believe they've had that sand kicked in their faces since the
conservatives' rise to power in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For example, no moderates who disagree with the conservative
leaders are appointed as trustees of the national convention's
missionary organizations, seminaries, publishing houses or other
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Some moderate leaders, such as Russell Dilday, have been fired
or forced out because of their stands. Dilday was fired as
president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort
Worth four years ago by conservative trustees who disagreed with
his moderate beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dilday is a professor at moderate-led Truett Theological
Seminary, part of Baylor University in Waco. He was re-elected this
week as president of the Baptist General Convention of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   All six Southern Baptist seminaries, once run by moderates, now
are headed by presidents who go along with the conservatives'
literal interpretation of biblical teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Baptist moderates rebelled against that.
</P>
<P>
   And now Texas Baptist conservatives are rebelling against the
moderates. They say they have no choice, that the Texas moderates
are slowly seceding from the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Their claims were given more credence this week when Baylor
University Chancellor Herbert Reynolds, one of the most aggressive
moderates, said Texas Baptists should consider withdrawing all
support from the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds told 1,100 people at a breakfast on the final day of
the annual meeting that their group, with almost 3 million members,
is already equivalent to the ninth-largest denomination in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed joining with other moderates in the United States,
and perhaps in Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, in
forming a Baptist Convention of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Miles Seaborn of Fort Worth, who led efforts to start
the new conservative group, said he was not surprised. He said
Reynolds' proposals give more reason for his group to secede.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Southern Baptists of Texas will draw many churches
and financial support away from the giant Baptist General
Convention of Texas won't be known for several years. Most of the
better-known conservative pastors of larger churches in Texas were
conspicuously absent from the conservative group's constitutional
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist conservatives are starting small. But smaller groups
have started major movements. Just ask Sam Houston.

SERIOUS DRAMA CAN BE TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slightly more than 5 million homes tune in weekly to
``Felicity,'' the coed-in-angst drama on The WB. Tracy Burrough's
isn't one of them. She spends her Tuesdays elsewhere, having tried
the series on three occasions and finding it ``a bit too serious
for my tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious as in real. Tastes as in fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   To Tracy, who is 18 and using this post-high-school year to
search out life's whats and whys, television has always been a
reliable companion and entertainer. She is able to distinguish
between what she calls ``A-movie dramas'' like ``ER'' and ``The
Practice'' and ``B-movie dramas'' like ``Early Edition'' and ``that
show with Don Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of reality and fantasy, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy knows ``ER'' is based on medical reality, so that the
series can legitimately handle medical and personal issues. One
without the other blows credibility for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on something like `Early Edition,''' she theorizes,
``where this cat brings this guy the next day's newspaper so he can
save lives, I mean, c'mon, you go into that expecting everything
else to be just as silly and unrealistic. So you enjoy it for what
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is her beef with ``Felicity.'' It's hardly silly or
unrealistic. Not like her other faves: ``Melrose Place,'' with its
outrageous characters and outlandish situations, or ``Dawson's
Creek,'' which was conceived as a fantasy take on what creator
Kevin Williamson wanted his high school years to be, a playground
of adolescents articulating highbrow ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity,'' Tracy says, transcends the barrier of
entertainment by stepping boldly into her real life. Which makes
her uncomfortable. Which makes watching the series a little like
looking in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it utterly undesirable.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when relatability was considered crucial in
programming. Tracy says ``ER'' ventures far from her reality _ she
has never been seriously ill or had a loved one medically
incapacitated. But ``Felicity'' fails to send her into that
alternative world where characters and their environments are
tucked away at a nice, safe distance from her own.
</P>
<P>
   So, she says, ``no emotional tie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Melrose Place'' requires a suspension of disbelief;
``Felicity'' demands not only ongoing belief but a daily commitment
she found virtually impossible to make.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls how painful it was to see Felicity (Keri Russell)
come to such realizations about herself, her parents, her friends
and an unaccommodating world. In just three episodes, she felt
herself sliding into the same addicted state she experienced with
another teen-angst drama, ``My So-Called Life,'' which she refers
to as merely a string of stories dealing with calamity and
unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd finish watching and think about it the next day,'' she
says of ``My So-Called Life,'' an even darker look at adolescence
that aired for one season but found a second life on MTV. ``Usually
I watch and it's out of my life. You know? Felicity reminded me so
much of myself when I graduated. I wasn't obsessed by some guy. But
I had no idea what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``She freaks around her parents. I'm still like that. Watching
it only reminds me of where I am in life. And it drew me in with
this soap opera and then hit me over the head with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for all its hype as an innovative series, ``Felicity''
at its core is pure soap serial. But Tracy has a point. Even though
the lead character chucked a pre-med career at Stanford to dash
after a boy, and the drama's story lines appear mired in the
interlocking love lives of the four main characters, ``Felicity''
doesn't ask viewers to surrender to the imaginative universe of a
``Melrose Place'' or even ``Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, Tracy dismisses the one area in which TV is
superior to film: a continuation of character. On a weekly basis,
she can see characters live, love and die, and experience happiness
and hardships.
</P>
<P>
   But then, I suppose that's exactly what she's trying to escape.
</P>
<P>
   _

 WASHINGTON: Goldman, Sachs.

<P>
   Translating the Arcane
</P>
<P>
   Early one morning last January, Greenspan took a three-block
stroll along Vermont Avenue in South Central Los Angeles, ground
zero in the 1992 riots. Along with members of Congress and other
federal regulators, he passed empty lots, boarded-up stores and
other evidence that the boom that had brought prosperity to much of
the nation had done little to help restore that ravaged community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regulators are swamped with all sorts of data, which we
pore through day after day,'' Greenspan told reporters later. ``I
think it is terribly important to look at what is under the data.
It's important to put a face on the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that brief excursion into a pocket of poverty was
uncharacteristic for Greenspan, whose approach to his job is
fiercely intellectual and dispassionate.
</P>
<P>
   He is the ultimate economic wonk, immersing himself in official
statistics, raw data, Wall Street numbers and anecdotal information
passed along to him directly or indirectly by business executives.
His briefcase is often full of trade publications like Aviation
Week.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely gets out to factory floors or fast-food kitchens, and,
other than occasional visits with labor leaders, rarely seems to
interact much with anyone but the elites in government, economics,
business and finance.
</P>
<P>
   But he can draw on the 30 years he spent as a consultant
advising a wide range of industries for a sense of what all those
arcane facts and statistics mean in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   In a book, ``Economic Puppetmasters: Lessons from the Halls of
Power'' (AEI Press), due out in February, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a
Fed governor from 1991 to 1997 who is now a resident scholar at the
American Enterprise Institute, cites a board meeting at the Fed a
few years ago in which the discussion turned to flooding that had
rendered all but one of the bridges across the Mississippi River
impassable, creating a logjam for freight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan not only knew the location of the bridge, but also
the various reroutings that could be used to get merchandise
there,'' Lindsey writes.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer breadth of Greenspan's data-gathering has always
dissuaded him from relying on a particular forecasting model or
rule-driven approach to monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   He is skeptical about the existence of a ``natural'' rate of
unemployment, a level below which inflation will inevitably take
root if the economy is growing at a healthy pace. He does not put
any particular stock in the Phillips curve, which purports to
establish a link between inflation and unemployment. And he views
growth in the money supply, which monetarists see as the main
determinant of inflation, as just one indicator, and not a terribly
reliable one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Greenspan shies away from reading immutable patterns
in past performance, he is a keen student of history. ``There's a
scholarly dimension to him,'' said David Hale, an economist at the
Zurich Group. ``A lot of people in our business are consumed by
money-market gibberish. He can see the sweep of history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Technology Twists
</P>
<P>
   It is to history that Greenspan has looked to explain why the
computer revolution and all the other technological advances of the
last few decades were accompanied not by a spurt in productivity,
as would be expected, but by a decline that began around 1970 and
is only now showing signs of reversing.
</P>
<P>
   He frequently cites work by two economists at Stanford
University, Paul David and Nathan Rosenberg, who have shown that it
often takes decades before new technology is fully absorbed and
exploited by businesses. Factories built to use steam power, for
example, could not capture the advantages offered by the
development of electricity; it was only when new plants were built
with electricity-driven machinery in mind that their productivity
improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we may be observing in the current environment is a
number of key technologies, some even mature, finally interacting
to create significant new opportunities for value creation,''
Greenspan said in a speech last year, citing as an example the use
of decades-old laser technology in fiber optic cable to carry
traffic on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If technology has begun to improve productivity, that would help
explain a big mystery of the last several years: why, with low
unemployment and steady growth, there has not been inflation. The
likelihood that productivity is increasing more than official
statistics show seems to be a key reason Greenspan held off on
raising interest rates over the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan thinks that technology is also altering the business
cycle. He contends that by allowing businesses to adjust their
inventories more rapidly and reducing the time it takes to put
newly ordered equipment into service, technology is dampening the
major imbalances usually associated with a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is also behind the growing size and power of the
financial markets, which in turn are having an ever more direct and
powerful impact on the economy, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers spent somewhat more freely as the stock market climbed
relentlessly the last few years; in his view, it is only common
sense to believe they will retrench somewhat if the market goes
into a sustained fall. Businesses have increasingly turned to the
stock and bond markets to raise money; just as the easy
availability of capital has fueled business expansion, a credit
squeeze in the market could halt that growth.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with technology allowing investors to send money
screaming from one place to another, no country can wall itself off
from financial shocks. ``New technology has radically reduced the
costs of borrowing and lending across traditional national
borders,'' Greenspan said in a speech last spring, as Asia's
financial problems threatened to spill over to the rest of the
world. While the globalization of finance has helped raise living
standards, it also ``exposes and punishes underlying economic
weakness swiftly and decisively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in being forced to heed market fluctuations, policy-makers
immediately confront the complexities of investor psychology, a
variable that not even Greenspan can fully grasp, much less
control.
</P>
<P>
   He has been ruminating in public about how to deal with the
markets since his famous reference to ``irrational exuberance'' in
a speech nearly two years ago. He has tried talking the market
down, with only temporary success, but in the end seems to have
concluded that there is no way to deflate an asset bubble in an
orderly way.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Lindsey quotes from an interview with Greenspan in
April, before both the stock market's summer tumble and its fall
rebound, after the Fed started cutting rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fundamental problem with market intervention to
prick a bubble,'' Greenspan said. ``It presumes that you know more
than the market.''

 WASHINGTON: the market.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Alter Ego
</P>
<P>
   A guest at a party a few months ago on the South Lawn of the
White House remembers seeing Greenspan and his wife, Andrea
Mitchell, the NBC News correspondent, standing not far from
President Clinton. Clinton happily posed for pictures; Ms. Mitchell
chatted with friends. Greenspan stood awkwardly, as if dreading the
possibility that someone would approach to ask if it was a good
time to refinance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Greenspan's dour public face is to some degree a mask. Born
in New York in 1926, he was a baseball fan and a talented musician;
after attending the Juilliard School, he signed on with a swing
band and toured the country playing saxophone before receiving an
economics degree at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous difference between the public image that
he so carefully creates and the personal guy, who is kind of fun to
have dinner with,'' said Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass. ``He tells
great stories and has lived a life _ he was blowing a horn in New
York City _ that bears very little resemblance to what he does
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of Greenspan's membership during the 1950s in
Ayn Rand's inner circle. Rand's novels, especially ``Atlas
Shrugged,'' presented a vision of individualism and laissez-faire
capitalism that became a guiding light for many libertarians.
Greenspan has always minimized her influence on his current
thinking, and while there are few economic conservatives more pure
than he in Washington, he also has a strong pragmatic streak.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his close working relationship with the Clinton
administration, where he has far more influence than he ever did
with the president who first appointed him, Ronald Reagan, or with
George Bush, whose 1992 defeat is often attributed by Republicans
to Greenspan's slow response to the short recession of 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's place in history will owe much to Greenspan's
stewardship of the economy over the last six years and how well the
economy holds up over the next two. Some would argue, in fact, that
Clinton's political survival this year was due in large part to the
contentment that the prosperous Greenspan era has induced in the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Greenspan can almost certainly count on Clinton to
nominate him to a fourth term in 2000 if the Fed chairman decides
he want to stay on. Will Greenspan have had enough of the pressures
and the criticism? Will he find it too hard to pull his head out of
the national income accounts and let go of the economy's levers?
</P>
<P>
   Today's indispensable man is not saying. But while Wall Street
and Washington have a hard time imagining a post-Greenspan world,
it is worth remembering that they could not imagine a world without
Paul Volcker running the Fed, either.

CHAPLAIN'S MINISTRY FOR MENTALLY DISABLED IS INSPIRING IN ITS
SIMPLICITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ It is a crisp, cool Sunday morning at the Denton
State School.
</P>
<P>
   The grass and trees on the parklike campus shimmer beneath a
clear October sky. Against that backdrop, a ragged line of
wheelchairs slowly wends up the hill to a small, A-frame chapel.
</P>
<P>
   As the line draws closer, the details of the convoy emerge, and
one can see that each wheelchair is as unique as its owner.
</P>
<P>
   One lies flat like a portable bed. Another is customized to make
allowances for a twisted spine and a feeding tube discreetly tucked
beneath a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   In the rear, pushing the last wheelchair, is the Rev. Dennis
Schurter, a thin, angular man of 56.
</P>
<P>
   Schurter's Sunday morning routine has changed little in more
than two decades as chaplain at the school, one of 11 state-run
schools for the severely mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   To the casual observer, Schurter's task may seem hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   Higher-functioning residents long ago moved to group homes in
the city. Of the 600 who remain, about 60 attend chapel. Few of
them will understand much of the Gospel beyond ``Jesus loves me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schurter is undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the kind of place where you grow in numbers,'' he
said. ``Yet I see growth in caring and relating with love to one
another. The people here have a simple faith, a faith that is
expressed in their love and acceptance of one another _ many times
without questioning, `Why did this happen to me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Schurter's chapel messages are short and simple. He walks up and
down the aisle as he preaches, making eye contact with each person,
touching them on the shoulder, calling them by name, asking them
simple questions.
</P>
<P>
   The personal contact communicates more than any message.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't use ideas and words,'' he said. ``You have to use
your own presence, your own person.''
</P>
<P>
   During the week, he leads Bible studies and coordinates services
for Catholic and non-Christian residents.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy and Jerry Ward of Fort Worth are convinced that Schurter's
ministry makes a difference in the life of their daughter, Dianne.
</P>
<P>
   She is 37, the youngest of three children.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne's brain was damaged while she was still in the womb, the
victim of a time when doctors prescribed medicine to pregnant women
with little knowledge of the consequences to the babies.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dianne's body has matured, her mind has not.
</P>
<P>
   She has an IQ of eight and the functioning abilities of a
16-month-old infant.
</P>
<P>
   But she can hum along with the church music, and bow her head
for prayer. And she likes getting dressed up for the service and
having ribbons put in her hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether she understands about God, I'm not sure,'' Nancy Ward
said. ``But I feel like the chapel really does provide for all the
residents something that is normal, and I am thankful they have the
opportunity to worship.''
</P>
<P>
   Schurter said that God's power in the lives of his people is
apparent to anyone who takes the time to look.
</P>
<P>
   He sees God's love in people such as Robert, a resident who
cannot sit up or use his hands. But he can use a reclining
wheelchair and propel himself with his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't say words, but he hails me and he gives me a hug by
coming up to me and putting his legs around my leg,'' Schurter
said. ``The outsider looking at this person says, `Oh, isn't this
terrible that this person is so disabled.' But as you get to know
the person, then that person draws you out of yourself to relate to
him or her in a personal way. It is not an `Oh, you poor thing'
kind of mercy. It is a compassion that draws us out into the life
of the other person.''

<P>
   So you have this 73-foot Norway spruce that has to get from
Cleveland to New York. Hauling it 500 miles in a tractor-trailer or
a boxcar isn't an option: It would arrive in no shape to wow crowds
as Rockefeller Center's Christmas tree. And a ship would be too
slow.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves air freight. But who has a plane big enough to
handle a seven-ton conifer?
</P>
<P>
   Heavylift Volga-Dnepr does. It's the Antonov An-124 Ruslan, the
biggest cargo plane in civilian service _ bigger than a 747 or even
a C-5. The company, a little-known Russian-British joint venture,
has seven of the 20 or so An-124s available for charter worldwide,
and they have helped it carve out a niche at the exotic end of the
air cargo business, carrying things too big or too awkward for
other airlines to manage. Last week, the company carried this
season's Rockefeller Center tree.
</P>
<P>
   The Heavylift half of the partnership, owned by Kvaerner, a
British-Norwegian conglomerate, and based at London's Stansted
Airport, handles marketing, sales and logistics. Volga-Dnepr, a
Russian cargo line, owns, staffs and services the planes; its
largest shareholder is the aircraft's builder, Aviastar.
</P>
<P>
   The An-124s were designed to transport supplies and equipment
for the Soviet military. Lately, Russia has been working to develop
commercial uses for them.
</P>
<P>
   Heavylift's An-124s usually carry cargo like satellites,
electric generators and aircraft engines. But they have also
transported paper-mill machinery from Finland to Kentucky, a whole
Coca-Cola bottling line from Atlanta to Russia and the equipment
for an entire oilfield from one side of Colombia to the other,
recalled Vince Jones, the London-based Heavylift load-planning
manager who traveled with the tree this week. And then there were
race cars, yachts and even the stage for a Michael Jackson concert
tour.
</P>
<P>
   On the An-124, a giant Christmas tree is carry-on baggage. The
jet's tail and nose cone flip open, and its front end kneels down,
allowing up to 120 tons of cargo to be driven directly in and out
of a hold measuring 20 feet across, 16 feet high and 120 feet long.
David Murbach, the Rockefeller Center executive responsible for
finding this year's tree, described the An-124 as ``a flying
section of the Lincoln Tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Heavylift operates around the world _ with offices in
Singapore, Britain and Russia as well as in Kansas City, Mo., and
maintenance bases in Ireland and Abu Dhabi _ nearly a third of its
business comes from American clients. Charter rates are quoted case
by case, and the company would not discuss prices for specific
cargo like the tree. But its managing director, Michael Hayles,
said a typical charter runs at least $250,000. ``Essentially,
you're offering someone a whole airplane,'' he said. ``And
airplanes cost about $12,000 or $13,000 an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Heavylift doesn't spend much time on mass
marketing. The company advertises in trade journals and relies
heavily on referrals from existing customers and from carriers
unable to accommodate particular cargoes. Repeat clients include
General Electric, British Petroleum and Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Hayles said the An-124 charter business is booming. ``We've
taken it from nothing in 1991 to $85 million a year,'' he said,
adding that each plane now logs about 6,000 flight hours a year.
The only other company offering An-124 charters in the United
States is Air Foyle of Britain, which also has a Russian
joint-venture partner.
</P>
<P>
   The planes usually must be booked months in advance. But in a
pinch they can be called up in less than 24 hours, said Heavylift's
commercial manager, Vince Seeger. They delivered electric turbines
and repair equipment to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Georges and
food and supplies to Nicaragua and Honduras after Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Besides carrying the tree, Heavylift spreads other holiday
cheer. Every December since 1992, the company has flown toys
donated by English children to areas like Bosnia and Romania. The
children wrap the toys and mark them with suggested ages for
recipients. Last year, they filled five An-124s with 350,000 boxes.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUBDIVISION, CEMETERY IS SIDE-BY-SIDE, BUT
HARDLY EYE-TO-EYE

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUGAR LAND, Texas _ Hard by U.S. 59 near Texas 6, where the
master-planned community reigns and everything looks new, the
seminal Sugar Creek subdivision seems an improbable place for a
140-year-old ethnic burial ground.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Cementerio San Isidro,'' active circa the Civil War and
deeded by the owners of Imperial Sugar to the Latino families who
picked their cane and refined their crop, is there.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the five marble columns and bubbling fountains at the
Sugar Creek Boulevard entrance. Past the tastefully appointed guard
house that, before a 1984 lawsuit, required IDs for entry. On the
same serene street that weaves past the prepossessing country club,
verdant golf greens and half-million-dollar mansions. San Isidro
Cemetery, five acres of graves walled off by developers in the late
1960s by an eight-foot fence that mixes wooden expanses with brick
columns _ tastefully _ is there.
</P>
<P>
   Eight to 12 times a year, as inevitably as death and to the
chagrin of some homeowners, a Latino funeral procession wends its
way through this forerunner of the meticulously planned First
Colony and New Territory communities. Headlights on, police escort
on hand, several dozen vehicles slide into the cemetery, unload,
mourn and bury their dead. Then they leave, not always without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the homeowners who live out here have no respect for
us. Some of them almost run over us. Some even speed up faster and
honk. They're decent grown-ups with Mercedes and they'll still
stick their heads out the window and yell, `Get the hell out of the
way,' '' says Johnny de la Cruz, president of the San Isidro
Cemetery Association, of the often tense relationship with the
subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   With one lawsuit behind it to gain access to the cemetery and
with room for 221 more graves, the 550-odd member association is
seeking protective designation for San Isidro as a Texas Historic
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's money and power out there and I understand that they
don't want a cemetery in their back yard but the fact of the matter
is that it's there,'' says state Sen. Mario Gallegos, whose office
is assisting the process. ``Just the fact that the cemetery folks
hold land and title, and they still have to jump through all these
hoops.''
</P>
<P>
   While the designation cannot guarantee preservation of a
cemetery, the official nod seeks to promote respect and reverence
from neighboring land owners, sometimes no mean feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wanted their subdivision so tight that even other
white people couldn't get in, then you can imagine how they felt
about having `Mexicanos' come through,'' says Rice University
anthropologist Marie Theresa Hernandez, who is writing a book on
San Isidro and its surrounding community. ``But they always will
tell me, it's not a racial thing; it's a social class thing and
it's about a cemetery. It's a cemetery thing.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Cruz, whose father worked for the company now known as
Imperial Holly Corp. for nearly 45 years, says he understands the
homeowners' concerns. Some of them were told the cemetery was
inactive; some were not told it was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then all of a sudden they start seeing people there,'' he
says. ``They start seeing burials. I can sympathize with them in a
way, but in a way I can't because the cemetery was there way before
the half-million-dollar homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how long San Isidro has been active is uncertain. An
accidental fire in in 1939 destroyed no one knows how many wooden
crosses, how much history. But since the advent of headstones, this
much is clear: Five generations of some families are buried in San
Isidro, their lives so entwined that the last two funerals a few
weeks ago were for two cousins who died within days of each other
and, were buried just hours apart: Estella Zamora at 10 a.m. and
Marcus Morales at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama had a long train, let me tell you, she had maybe 70 cars,
a lot for being a Monday,'' says daughter Dora Zamora. ``She would
have been happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Zamora, whose father and grandfather worked in the cotton and
sugar cane fields that once grew south of Houston, has already told
her children that someday she wants to rest alongside her mother,
among San Isidro's oddly gay profusion of flowers, framed pictures,
family mementos and religious artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are buried there are the real history of Sugar
Land. They're the ones who worked and labored through the 1900s to
make Sugar Land what it is today,'' says de la Cruz. ``People
should be honored by the cemetery, not feel embarrassed and
disgraced by it; not drive by there and act crazy and not want us
to bury our dead in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about heritage. This is about history.''
</P>
<P>
   When developers carved Sugar Creek from 1,000 acres of open
ranchland in the late 1960s and triggered a Fort Bend County boom
of bedroom communities, they hemmed in the tiny cemetery on the
banks of Oyster Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Walled out and without recourse, San Isidro mourners turned to a
rotting, wooden bridge connecting the five acres to a public street
in what is now the Sugarwood subdivision. So dicey was the
contraption that, for the last few years before the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers finally condemned it in 1993, funeral processions
would park on the Sugarwood side of the bridge, unload the casket
and carry it over the creek as the mourners followed on foot.
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of the 21st century and against the backdrop of the
suburban good life, it made for a surreal sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to carry my uncle across after we couldn't drive it
anymore,'' remembers San Isidro member Rudy Cruz. ``It was raining.
We had to go through all this mud and his son is walking beside me
saying, `Don't drop my daddy, Rudy, don't drop my daddy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the bridge's use, the rails on each side
simply dropped off. ``We had to go right on the middle tracks,''
says Zamora. ``If you'd go off of them, it was scary, it would
move.''
</P>
<P>
   San Isidro families tried to raise the $125,000 needed to build
a new bridge but, despite the aid of the Fort Bend Interfaith
Council, a group of 14 socially oriented congregations, and the
offer of $25,000 from the Sugar Creek Homes Association, they fell
far short. Frantic that access would be lost, San Isidro in 1993
sued Sugar Creek for permanent entry from the boulevard right of
way. Under a temporary restraining order signed by a state district
judge, the homeowners association turned over a key to a locked
gate in the eight-foot fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most logical thing right from the beginning was to enter
the cemetery from the land side, which would have been along Sugar
Creek boulevard, but that was opposed very strenuously by the homes
association,'' recalls homeowner Robert Mannix, who, like others on
both sides, tried to mediate a compromise. ``That's why they were
willing to contribute $25,000 in hopes the problem would just go
away. But it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the associations co-exist in a tenuous peace. Theirs was
a spat between neighbors, says Gary Sanford, Sugar Creek's paid
general manager who oversees 24-hour security, maintenance and
other daily operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you bought your house, if somebody made you a promise
that something would never occur, and then it did, you'd be
upset,'' he says. ``That was one of the things. It wasn't an
Hispanic-white issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good people in their association. There are
a lot of good people in my subdivision,'' says Sanford, the chief
link between the two groups. ``We're going to work it out. If we
have problems, we're going to sit down and resolve them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before San Isidro sought legal redress, maintains Sanford,
Sugar Creek directors had decided to grant access of their own
volition, ``not because they thought they would lose the lawsuit
but because they thought it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Sanford gets high marks from San Isidro members, they
still are wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the middle of a rock and a real hard place; harder
than what you can ever imagine because he has to deal with the
homeowners. I'm the same way. I have 550 people who demand this and
want that,'' says de la Cruz. ``He can't do very much without their
cooperation and I can't do very much without our cooperation so we
can beat heads together all day.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the stalemate over a wrought iron sign the
cemetery association wants to erect on the eight-foot fence.
Despite the lawsuit, San Isidro has remained so unmarked and
near-invisible from the boulevard that the only way to catch more
than a glimpse is to walk up to the small iron gate, and press
nose; it is perfectly possible to drive by without knowing the
cemetery is there.
</P>
<P>
   Some San Isidro members believe that is just what Sugar Creek
wants and talk darkly about erecting a sign on poles high enough
behind the fence to be seen from the boulevard. Sugar Creek vice
president and former President Leonard Huxtable says the homes
association, after all, owns the fence and the majority of people
who buy into a subdivision like Sugar Creek would object to the
large ``advertisement'' of a cemetery or any similar facility.
</P>
<P>
   Another, more open tussle erupted last year when San Isidro got
a city permit to build an on-site restroom after a funeral service
was stopped so a handicapped mourner could be driven to the nearest
freeway gas station. As the contractor was hooking onto a sewer
line in the city easement behind one of the closest houses, an
angry homeowner drove up, threatened the worker and demanded that
the construction stop.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, his attorney and another nearby homeowner called
de la Cruz. After considerable and costly delays, a small unisex
restroom patterned after those in Fort Bend County parks was built
with a compatible, if more expensive than originally planned,
roof. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other signs of unease exist _ in the defensive response of two
Sugar Creek directors; in the homeowners who regularly honk their
horns, speed through processions and otherwise register what San
Isidro members interpret as disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody liked losing that lawsuit and there were some people,
too, who felt that there was a racial problem; that it was not just
funerals, it was Mexican funerals,'' admits Mannix. ``It's kind of
hard to say, but there may have been a little of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Current officers of the homeowners association take vehement
exception. San Isidro came out of the conflict better than before,
says Huxtable; the dangerous bridge was removed at county expense
and the cemetery association got access from the boulevard, a new
entrance through the fence, a place to park within and regular
patrols by Sugar Creek's uniformed, private security officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't undo any of the history, but I think the relationship
since 1995 has been extremely good,'' says Huxtable. While the
homeowners association has opposed the identifying sign on the
fence, it would provide space on the Sugar Creek right of way for a
historic plaque should the designation occur, he says. ``That's
definitely part of our community; it's on our border and something
that we always want to make sure is safe and protected.''
</P>
<P>
   That has not always happened. Despite what Sugar Creek says are
rigorous patrols, San Isidro two Halloweens ago was hit hard by
vandals. Venerable headstones were overturned, broken and defaced;
one still bears the spray-painted word, ``faggot.'' A 15-foot
statue of Jesus Christ at the old Oyster Creek entrance with the
legend ``donated by the Zapata family and the local farmworkers''
was painted black.
</P>
<P>
   Irreparable damage was done that is roundly condemned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say strongly enough how mad that makes me because when
you knock down a 50-year-old headstone, you're knocking down
something that can't be replaced. You're knocking down a piece of
history,'' says Sanford. ``But I honestly don't think that anybody
had any malice or ill intention toward that cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody did it because it was San Isidro
Cemetery. It was just a cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   San Isidro members privately wonder. Before the lawsuit,
teen-agers routinely used the cemetery for drinking, drugs and sex,
some say, and perhaps the troubled history has left a residue of
ill will. But they have a uniquely cultural reticence toward
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing that we want to make into a hate crime. We don't
want to stir up any trouble with the neighborhood. We just want to
be left in peace,'' says de la Cruz. ``Pretend we're dead. Let us
bury our families and carry on with our traditions, our Catholic
ceremonies, our way of doing things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want Sugar Land, you can have it. Claim Sugar Land as
your own. But don't claim those five acres where our ancestors who
built this city with their sweat and tears are buried. That belongs
to them and to us.''
</P>
<P>
   So much is Sugar Land today a town without a readily discernible
soul that city fathers are neck-deep in plans to build a downtown
from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed 32.8-acre Sugar Land Town Square project at the
intersection of U.S. 59 and Texas 6 is the fitting design of
Sugarland Properties, which began developing the 9,700-acre First
Colony in 1977. It will include high-end apartments, office
buildings, shops, restaurants, a luxury hotel, a pedestrian plaza
and a picturesque $8.4 million City Hall with a big clock.
Everything, of course, will look new. When people see the site,
proponents have effused, they will see community, a core, the
future.
</P>
<P>
   What they may not see, despite plans by developers to erect a
monument to the area's Texas heritage, is the past or at least the
racially tinted part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Land, quite simply, is the land that sugar began to build
in 1843, when colonist Samuel Williams started the original mill on
what is now the flip side of U.S. 59 from Sugar Creek. Slaves and
later convicts and Mexicans were pressed into labor, toiling in the
sugar cane fields and working in the refinery. In 1907, Galveston's
Kempner family purchased control of what is now Imperial Holly.
Today, it is Texas' oldest business, the largest single supplier of
refined sugar in the United States and still guided by Kempner
descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Their early hand was benevolent, says Rice's Hernandez, whose
father has operated Hernandez Funeral Home in Rosenberg since the
1950s. Refinery workers lived in what was called ``the quarters'';
most of the field hands, in rural encampments. Latinos were put
with Latinos; blacks with blacks.
</P>
<P>
   They also were buried separately. Where Sugarwood now hugs
Oyster Creek, the Mexican-American village of Gran Centro once held
sway. Over the bridge was San Isidro and, next to it, the
now-fenced, overgrown and long-inactive African-American cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was partly Jim Crow segregation and partly the natural
thing to do, partly racism and partly comfort,'' says Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Land was the quintessential company town; as late as the
1950s, workers were paid in coupons for use at the company store
and those who shopped in Houston reportedly ran the risk of getting
fired. If someone wanted a car, the company bought it, delivered it
to the employee and got paid back in labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, people didn't hardly get killed or get lynched. It was
a subjugated environment; people were dominated, but people weren't
scared for their life,'' says Hernandez. ``They were safe and, as
long as they followed the rules, bad things didn't happen to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   When the vast expanses of local sugar cane gave way to more
distant sources, the Kempners, ever-mindful of social duty, deeded
the Latino and black cemeteries to the farmworkers for their use
and that of their descendants.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, the San Isidro association does not sell lots but
keeps a membership list of eligible clients who contribute $5 per
month per household for cemetery maintenance. When someone dies,
the association provides the plot in exchange for a minimum $200
donation that is waived if the family cannot afford it.
</P>
<P>
   Since galvanizing in 1993 against what was perceived as a common
enemy, or a common goal, depending on the mindset, San Isidro
members have poured their hearts into their five acres. An annual
fund-raiser includes a golf tournament, dinner, dance, door prizes,
raffle and a bake sale; periodic cleanups attract dozens of members
and friends to rake and tend the graves. Each ``Dia de los
Muertos'' weekend, the Nov. 2 Day of the Dead holiday that blends
Indian rituals with Roman Catholicism, is celebrated with a Mass
and blessing of the graves.
</P>
<P>
   Rained out this year but held Nov. 8, the reunion drew more than
200, resolutely middle-class Mexican-Americans of all ages from as
close as Houston, Bellaire, Rosenberg, Stafford and Missouri City
to as distant as Hawaii. They prayed, gossiped, cried, laughed and
ate hot dogs seared on the implausibly permanent barbecue grill.
Invariably, San Isidro is not a place where the terrible part of
death dominates; just the enduring part.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about all this prejudice and segregation that went on
back in those times and so you think that they found a burial place
for what they called the Mexican workers out on a creekbed as far
away from the city as they could, never realizing that someday the
city would build out that way,'' says Mary Carmen de la Cruz, who
has five generations of family buried in San Isidro. ``It's almost
as if they wanted to push them out and get them out of the way, but
somehow we survived. It's ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for designation by the Texas Historical Commission, a
cemetery must be at least 50 years old and deemed worthy of
preservation for its links to early settlements whose events,
religion, lifestyles and genealogy otherwise would be lost. In this
Fort Bend city that has no Hispanic council members, school board
members or county commissioners, San Isidro's towering pecan trees,
wind chimes and outdoor benches cradle 258 known graves and a
century and a half of stories.
</P>
<P>
   Apolonio Balderas, 1888-1929, lies beneath an ancient headstone
so scarred by time and weather that the words are barely legible.
His family is unknown; his friends, as long gone as he. But his
heart remains etched upon his stone: ``Puro Mexicano.''
</P>
<P>
   World War II veteran Leno Flores signed up with Macario Garcia,
the Medal of Honor winner who returned to his Fort Bend County home
only to be refused service at a Richmond restaurant. Reporting the
incident, commentator and columnist Walter Winchell called the town
``the sorriest place in the United States.'' Flores lies in San
Isidro; Garcia, respected finally in death, in Houston Memorial
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam veterans Antonio Porres and Frankie Infante also
enlisted together, fought the length of that deadly war and
miraculously returned intact. Infante went on to a full life but
barely a week after arriving home, Porres was killed in a car
wreck. Today, the comrades-in-arms are joined again in death.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Lynn de la Cruz, 1976-1992, Mary and Johnny's daughter,
took her life at the age of 15 in an inexplicable rash of suicides
by Kempner High School students. On a childhood visit to San
Isidro, Laura had told her mother that, someday, she wanted to be
buried by one of the trees that perpetually shade the cemetery. She
now rests at the feet of her grandmother, her great-grandmother and
her great- great-grandmother, Juana del Rio, 1884-1924. All are by
a tree.
</P>
<P>
   A few, crumbling wooden crosses that survived the fire of
decades ago are off to one side, anonymous but adorned by kindly
hands. There's a cluster of baby graves; a cluster of children;
family clusters. Garcia, Jimenez, Salazar, Talemantez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left here in 1965 for Vietnam, moved to California and
eventually wound up in Hawaii,'' says Tome Ramirez, whose father,
Domingo H. Ramirez, was one of the original sharecroppers deeded
the cemetery by the Kempners in the early 1900s. Some 20 to 30
descendants who took their turns in the former fields are now
interred in San Isidro.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our destiny, I guess,'' says Ramirez. ``I know I
belong here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite San Isidro's stubborn reminders of the racially divided
past, the master-planned 1,750 homes and 5,000-odd people that now
make up Sugar Creek also belong there.
</P>
<P>
   Many current residents had no part in the early fight and even
Slayden Clarkson, the current homes association president, moved in
five years ago, unaware of San Isidro's existence, let alone the
open conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of history puts a lot of people on eggshells,'' says
Clarkson, who admits homeowners still have mixed responses. ``But
the homes association point of view is that a good-neighbor policy
is the best way to coexist. I think it's interesting that there's
this little enclave of history nestled in our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwina Rodey, whose corner home's back fence is one of five
bordering the cemetery, says the subdivision has changed of late;
more people have moved in, some younger and more diverse that the
original settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a closed gate, they had a closed life and they all
belonged to the country club,'' says Rodey, who has lived in Sugar
Creek for 13 years and made enemies when she supported San Isidro's
access. ``There's more a real-world attitude out here now where
it's kind of live-and-let-live.''
</P>
<P>
   While master-planned communities are mainly about blotting out
history and starting afresh, Rice's Hernandez believes the cemetery
can provide receptive homeowners with the same vital impediment to
forgetting that it does for San Isidro's families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cemetery,'' she says, ``is the past for everybody.'' &QL;

<P>
   Kate Moss wasn't feeling particularly gorgeous a week ago. In
London, The Daily Mirror reported that the 105-pound supermodel,
her hair recently dyed shocking pink for the Donatella Versace
fashion show in Milan, had booked herself into a (PS)300-a-day
rehab clinic. Ms. Moss, 24, was quoted as saying she was exhausted
from working and partying too much, and wanted to reassess her
life.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive use of hair dye and other substances may well be the
reality of supermodeldom, but fashion doesn't want to hear it.
Particularly not this season.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-lettered sign backstage at the Michael Kors show in
Bryant Park on Nov. 4 made that clear. ``Be very fresh and very
upbeat,'' it instructed the models, many of them clad in taffeta,
just before they hit the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy and sunny as always,'' it said. ``Strong and energetic.
Casual yet sexy. You're gorgeous. We love you! Have a great show!''
</P>
<P>
   Such cheerfulness is what fashion is all about now _ dolling up,
not drying out. For spring, clothes are as saucy as Bill Blass'
black lace cargo pants or Marc Jacobs' scallop-edged leather
skirts, the models as scrubbed as anyone in J. Crew's pages.
</P>
<P>
   The program notes for the Tuleh collection by Josh Patner and
Bryan Bradley said it best. ``Dream. Laugh. Conquer. Gamble. Be
pretty,'' they urged all who made the trek to the unglamorous
environs of 18th Street and 10th Avenue for the show on Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   With words like ``pretty'' and ``upbeat,'' fashion has completed
its about-face from the minimalism and moroseness of recent years,
eschewing heroin chic for heroine chic. Models even dared to smile
on the catwalks this season, if only for the finales of shows.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the relief of women everywhere, sequins are no longer
verboten. It's OK to look like you spent a million bucks to look
like a million bucks. An aspirational quality has returned to
clothes and to fashion advertising. You can wear pink and still be
a player. It's all posturing, of course, but at least it's perky.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there were some beautiful clothes on the New York
runways. But amid all the calculated levity, something was missing.
Among the majors, there was little fashion for fashion's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Isaac Mizrahi has closed his business and Todd Oldham
has shut down his wholesale operation, there wasn't much on the
runways to fuel the imagination. Badgley Mischka trucked in a
grassy lawn upon which to show its confectionary evening wear
(``You could smell the dirt,'' one editor said, favorably recapping
the show), but otherwise, there wasn't much in the way of
showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bob Mackie at his glitziest in the 1980s, Mizrahi and
Oldham could, for much of the '90s, be counted on to send their
audiences out on a cloud.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't necessarily make you want to buy their clothes _ not
every woman needs Hollywood glamour or thrift-store chic to shop at
Gristede's. But these men made you excited about fashion. To use a
word from Simon Doonan's new book, ``Confessions of a Window
Dresser'' they ``szhooshed'' up a week of shows.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, they served a vital function from which more
commercial designers undoubtedly benefited.
</P>
<P>
   The ne plus ultra of the current fashion season is generally
considered to be Yohji Yamamoto's show held last month in Paris.
For the finale, his brides peeled off layer after layer of clothes
to reveal ever more stunning creations underneath, glamorous
ecdysiasts shucking hoop skirts and polka dot petticoats until they
reached the slimmest of silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   Suzy Menkes, the longtime fashion critic of The International
Herald Tribune, called it ``the most elegant striptease at the
Moulin Rouge'' and ``one of those fashion moments that holds the
audience spellbound.''
</P>
<P>
   Those moments are few and far between, of course. Not every show
can be John Galliano's Russian princesses-escaping-the-palace
thriller, Alexander McQueen's Joan of Arc extravaganza or the time
Jean-Paul Gaultier's models didn't walk a runway but rose,
perfectly posed, from trap doors in the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But designers need to try for something more than nice frocks on
happy models. They need to make audiences scream with delight
sometimes, to make their customers want to spend the rent money on
clothes they don't need.
</P>
<P>
   With each runway show, they need to create a world in which
people want to live, a world so mesmerizing they forget about troop
mobilizations, abortion doctor assassinations and even, for a
moment, supermodels in rehab.

happy models. They need to make audiences scream with delight
sometimes, to make their customers want to spend the rent money on
clothes they don't need.
</P>
<P>
   With each runway show, they need to create a world in which
people want to live, a world so mesmerizing they forget about troop
mobilizations, abortion doctor assassinations and even, for a
moment, supermodels in rehab.

WELCOME TO THE NEW LOS ANGELES: IT'S ON THE HUDSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 15) 
(lh) 
 By DAVID COLMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Big, whitewashed art galleries in low industrial
buildings, their garage-style doors giving onto broad, sunny
streets that are dead quiet except for the fit-for-life types who
are in-line skating westward toward the water.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a description of the latest art district in Los Angeles?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is West Chelsea, which strikes many people as an
unlikely New York neighborhood. That may be because it is virtually
a replica of the art scene that took root 10 years ago on the
industrial fringes of Santa Monica, Calif., where big, white
galleries feature garage-door entries.
</P>
<P>
   Here it is. A little slice of Los Angeles on the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   And wait. There's more. What is that something in the air? The
healing bouquet of an aromatherapy candle? The scent of a
double-decaf espresso with a side of foamed skim milk? The sharp
tang of blondifying peroxide from a hair-color salon? The qcent of
new leather on a Range Rover's seats?
</P>
<P>
   There's a little whiff of Los Angeles on nearly every New York
street corner these days (especially the ones where you can get a
ticket for jaywalking). From the New Age spirituality embraced by
Donna Karan to the mania for yoga classes, from the movie-star
residents of Central Park West to the seaside sprawl of the
Hamptons, New York has morphed into its onetime cultural antipode,
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Apples and oranges? Fuhgeddaboutit. If Woody Allen were to
remake ``Annie Hall'' today, with all its sniping about Los
Angeles' inferiority to Manhattan, he'd have a hard time making it
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Allen's latest film, ``Celebrity,'' which opens this
week, is about a curious place where nearly everyone works in
entertainment, gossip is the coin of the realm and star culture has
produced a spoiled heartthrob played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Sounds
like Los Angeles. But the setting is Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of DiCaprio, what is Hollywood's latest iteration of
Troy Donahue doing night after night at Moomba and Verukka, instead
of trawling on Sunset Boulevard, like the many Hollywood It Boys
who preceded him?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe DiCaprio has simply accepted the fact that there is little
difference between the two cities today.
</P>
<P>
   Both have the same chic restaurants, like Indochine and Le
Colonial; similar chic hotels from Andre Balasz and Ian Schrager,
and branches of Barneys New York, selling interchangeable wardrobes
now that black is the bicoastal color of chic and ``seasonless
dressing'' is a fashion-industry mantra. (``Now we can wear
cashmere and wool in summer _ thank God!'' Ellen DeGeneres quipped
at the VH-1 Fashion Awards last month.)
</P>
<P>
   Irma Zandl, the president of the Zandl Group, a trend-spotting
company in Manhattan, said that her research showed an East-West
mind meld. ``You find people wearing black out there, and you have
the whole New Agey thing happening here,'' she said. ``And in terms
of restaurants, there are lots of places here that seem very L.A.,
and more things out there that have a more bistro feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ford, the designer for Gucci, who has homes in New York and
Los Angeles, said: ``When I moved to New York in the late 1970s,
there seemed to be this whole East Coast WASP-y thing that was the
top of the pyramid in terms of what you could achieve. Now, New
York is a lot flashier. Everyone's in entertainment. The media have
never been more powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The look of mid-century modernism, so in vogue in furniture and
decorative design, has many of its roots in Los Angeles, Ford
pointed out, citing the hillside houses designed by Richard Neutra,
one of which Ford has bought for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the Hamptons, Malibuization encroaches a little more each
summer. The Hamptons in the '90s have given Manhattanites their
first taste of a full-fledged car culture, typified by status
symbols like the Range Rover (the craze for which began in Los
Angeles). The Hamptons are also the locale for sightings of Steven
Spielberg and Barbra Streisand, a film festival, and unbearable Los
Angeles-style traffic jams on the way to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, every kid graduating from an Ivy League school wants to
go to work in Hollywood, as if it's the only place in the world to
work,'' said William Norwich, a society columnist for The New York
Observer, ticking off the ways in which the Left Coast has
conquered New York. ``No. 2, everyone here said they'd never eat
designer pizza and California cuisine, and now they eat designer
pizza and California cuisine. And 3, everyone in New York said they
would never use cell phones. Look around. It's the new earring.''

</P>
<P>
   Only last year, 42nd Street was magically whisked off to
Southern California (Anaheim, to be exact) via a special
performance by Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade. Walt
Disney Co. is the parent of such seemingly quintessential New York
institutions as a pair of Broadway musicals; Seventh Avenue's
beloved trade paper, Women's Wear Daily, and the latest magazine
from the former editor of The New Yorker Tina Brown.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Brown has described the new venture, which she is
creating under the aegis of Disney-owned Miramax Films, it will
seamlessly integrate the signature industries of New York and Los
Angeles _ publishing and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And there it is. The E-word. More and more, the capital of the
East Coast and the capital of the West Coast share the same
industry: entertainment. ``Wonderful Town: Big Apple Booms as Major
Movie Site,'' proclaimed The Daily Variety on Nov. 6. The article's
first paragraph said a lot: ``While location shooting has fallen
sharply in Los Angeles this fall, Gotham's booming film and TV
production business shows no signs of slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from location filming in New York City nearly doubled
between 1994 and last year, from $1.4 billion to $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In that same period, motion picture services provided the most
robust job-growth engine in New York, adding more jobs to the city
in three years than any other industry, according to the New York
City Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures speak only to actual production. But where
entertainment ends and tourism _ now at an all-time high in the
city _ begins has become an increasingly blurred line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just read somewhere that New York has become the No. 1
tourist destination in the country, which is not a good sign,''
writer Fran Lebowitz said. ``I moved to New York because it had all
the things that the rest of America hated. Now, it has become the
most densely populated suburban environment in the history of the
Western World, and I have repaired to the countryside.'' (She would
not say where.)
</P>
<P>
   There are others, too, who bemoan the submergence of New York's
identity in that of its onetime polar opposite. ``I miss the old
days, when it was like a sports rivalry, like the Lakers and the
Knicks,'' said Michael J. Caruso, the editor in chief of Details
magazine, who used to be the editor of Los Angeles magazine. ``New
York was tough as nails. You had to eat glass to live here, and
L.A. was lotus-land, soft and sweet and stupid. It was fun to hate
L.A. There's too much cross-pollination now.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal Gabler, the cultural critic whose latest book is ``Life,
the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality'' (Knopf, $25), said
New Yorkers and Angelenos not only create similar entertainment
products, but also share that industry's values.
</P>
<P>
   ``They prize the same things now, and I don't mean that only in
terms of the clothes they wear and the cars they drive, but in the
value of appearance,'' Gabler said. ``There's the great story of
the producer David Begelman, who had not a stick of food in his
fridge, but still had someone coming to polish the Rolls.
Everything was about how the Rolls looked, even if you starved, and
that's now just as true of New York as California _ the sense that
you're nothing if you don't look good. Both of them prize stardom,
that's what binds the two communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The old joke used to be that America was a vast plain tilted
leftward, so all the loose nuts rolled to California. But these
days New York is losing, and California is gaining, in many of the
areas in which New York has traditionally prided itself. According
to the latest Forbes magazine list of the 400 Richest Americans,
New York has fewer and California has more of the share of wealthy
individuals. This reversal of fortunes has taken place only in the
last 10 years. The fashion industry, once wholly New York-centric,
has gone ga-ga for Hollywood star power, competing to dress the
nominees on Oscar night.
</P>
<P>
   And the $1 billion Getty Center, opened last December with the
largest endowment of any museum in the country, has dealt a blow to
New York's hegemony as national art capital. On its 110-acre site,
the Getty complex of museums is ``the greatest billboard in the
world for culture,'' said Larry Gagosian, the Manhattan-based art
dealer, who recently opened a second gallery in Beverly Hills.
``You don't even have to go _ just seeing it from the 405 freeway,
taking up most of a hill in Brentwood, is enough. It's the second
Hollywood sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, perhaps, the two cities will completely flip-flop. Los
Angeles will be a cultural Shangri-La, isolated from the
vulgarities of mass culture, and New York will be remade as Gotham,
the city of superficial spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   And who's to say that would be such a bad thing? In Allen's new
film, Judy Davis plays one of his archetypal angst-ridden New
Yorkers, but one who is transformed into a bottle-blond television
personality in the peppy image of Mary Hart. ``I've become the kind
of woman I always hated,'' she reflects. ``And I feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Los Angeles ethos seems to be consolidating its
hold on New York and moving on, spreading to other cities. ``What's
really amazing to me is how London is getting so L.A.,'' Ford of
Gucci said. ``They've got the whole L.A. beauty thing, the blond
hair, the implants and collagen lips, decked out in the latest
fashion. If you ask me, L.A. is taking over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Now if only we could make a right turn on red.

ABORTION WEB SITE PUTS PHYSICIANS ON ALERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Web site banner drips blood. Tiny baby arms
and legs adorn page after electronic page listing doctors who
perform abortions, family-planning clinic workers and pro-choice
judges, politicians and celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   And the anti-abortion Internet site is offering a sort of trophy
list of health-care providers murdered and maimed by anti-abortion
zealots, putting the American Medical Association on alert and
drawing the scrutiny of the U.S. Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Lines cross out the names of those killed _ at least seven since
1993. The names of the wounded _ at least another 15 _ appear in
ghostly gray type. The healthy remain in bold black type.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, which started with the sniper assassination of an
upstate New York obstetrician and gynecologist on Oct. 23, sent an
instant shiver through the women's health-care network, a target of
escalating violence since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was a list of doctors became a clear directory of
violence,'' said Brenda Cummings, executive director of the Womens'
Health Rights Coalition in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer serving the purpose of `gathering
information,''' Cummings said. ``It's documenting current
happenings to those people and treading very close to the line of
asking for more.''
</P>
<P>
   The lists appear on a large Web site called the Nuremberg Files,
one of an estimated 150 anti-abortion Web sites, many of which list
doctors' names, addresses and sometimes information about their
children. Advocates of abortion rights have an estimated 100 Web
sites of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuremberg Files site is the handiwork of Neal Horsley of
Carrollton, Ga., a computer programmer and anti-abortion
proselytizer who said he worked San Francisco's streets as an
evangelist for 10 years after his 1972 conversion from hippie to
born-again Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley, who said he, too, receives death threats, said the
purpose of the site was to collect evidence for the day abortion is
no longer legal, and when abortion providers face trial for crimes
against humanity, akin to the post-World War II Nazi trials at
Nuremberg.
</P>
<P>
   While the site doesn't overtly exhort followers to kill, it
justifies violence against abortion providers as the natural
outcome of ``the violence of legalized abortion.'' And it provides
space for such anti-abortion extremists as Donald Spitz, head of
Pro-Life Virginia, who dubbed ``a hero'' the sniper who shot Dr.
Barnett Slepian in his suburban Buffalo home six weeks ago. The
killer has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   Therese Wilson, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of San
Francisco, said, ``They're not telling people at the Web site in
direct words to kill doctors. But I can't say I don't think they
encourage that or that they don't believe it's justified.''
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to alarm the AMA, which formed a crisis team to
alert all 225 doctors on the list and disabled a link between the
Web site and the medical association's on-line directory of
doctors' addresses and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA and five other medical groups also pushed for a meeting
with the Justice Department. As a result, the Justice Department
announced Monday it was creating a new task force to coordinate
investigations of clinic violence.
</P>
<P>
   A previous Justice Department investigation failed to prove what
advocates of abortion rights have long believed _ that the tight
links between anti-abortion leaders and those who attack doctors
and clinics amount to a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings called the Web site evil and a tool of terrorism. But
she said, ``What I want the Justice Department to put a stop to is
the violence and not the Web site, so much. The Web site is a
symptom.''

   The New York Times News Service plans the following articles
from the Style section for use Sunday, Nov. 15, and thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   NY-LA-MERGE (New York) _ There's a little whiff of Los Angeles
on nearly every New York street corner these days (especially the
ones where you can get a ticket for jaywalking). From the New Age
spirituality embraced by Donna Karan to the mania for yoga classes,
from the movie-star residents of Central Park West to the seaside
sprawl of the Hamptons, New York has morphed into its onetime
cultural antipode, Los Angeles. By David Colman. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   FASHION-SHOW-CHIC (New York) _ Excessive use of hair dye and
other substances may well be the reality of supermodeldom, but
fashion doesn't want to hear it. Particularly not this season. The
hand-lettered sign backstage at the Michael Kors show in Bryant
Park on Nov. 4 made that clear. ``Be very fresh and very upbeat,''
it instructed the models, many of them clad in taffeta, just before
they hit the runway. By Frank Decaro. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   TV-MEN'S-STYLE (Undated) _ The ratings are bad. The reviews are
worse. There is, however, a bright side to the otherwise dim lineup
of network shows that made debuts this fall: television has finally
discovered a sense of men's style. By Robert Moritz.
</P>
<P>
   HAIR-BLOWOUTS (New York) _ The demand for the talents of
blow-dry specialists, who charge from $20 (Astor Place Hair
Stylists) to $275 (John Sahag salon on Madison Avenue), seems to be
at an all-time high. That is because the long curl-free look, as
flaunted by women from Jennifer Aniston on ``Friends'' to Hillary
Rodham Clinton on the cover of the coming December Vogue, bespeaks
power and unassailable style at this moment, especially in New
York. By Monique P. Yazigi.
</P>
<P>
   VELVET-MAFIA-SINGER (New York) _ Dean Johnson, lead singer of
the Velvet Mafia, sauntered into Bowery Bar on Tuesday night,
brushed past Isaac Mizrahi and ran a gauntlet of kisses from
doormen, friends and people he said he did not know at all. Despite
the outpouring of affection, Johnson looked chagrined. ``Being
recognized makes me feel panicked,'' he said. The musician, 37,
should be used to the attention. While he has yet to achieve the
commercial appeal of, say, Marilyn Manson, he has been a downtown
fixture since the early '80s. By Andrew Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ It is in the nature of gardeners to
wish for attributes that their plants do not have, like a longer
season of bloom, and it is in the nature of plant breeders to
provide as many of those attributes as their art can manage. But so
far no horticultural wizardry has been developed that will turn an
annual _ the best choice for a steady supply of blooms _ into a
perennial. By Cass Peterson.

 &HT;    THE TWO FACES OF BILL GATES
 &HT;    670&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial queues for
release Sunday, Nov. 15.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On three occasions in the month-old Microsoft
antitrust trial, Justice Department prosecutors have shown
videotapes of Bill Gates as the software company's chairman evaded
their tough questions.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday night, the world will see quite a different Bill
Gates when the Microsoft Corp. chairman delivers an hour-long
keynote speech at Comdex in Las Vegas, an annual gathering of some
220,000 technology mavens.
</P>
<P>
   According to the program, Gates plans to share his thoughts on
``what does the future hold as we look forward to the next
century?'' The Gates blurb in the program reads in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``Years of listening to our customers have dictated our focus on
research and development, and dictated creating innovative
technologies that strive for simplicity, lower cost and more
manageable systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, the government contends that Microsoft's
focus is on stifling innovation, keeping prices high and retarding
consumer choice.
</P>
<P>
   However the legal battle ends, the first 16 sessions of the
landmark trial have already provided unparalleled insights into how
Microsoft, its business partners and its rivals joust with one
another, often cutting deals before or after stowing their lances.
</P>
<P>
   The government's legal discovery process has brought to light
millions of pages of documents that, at various times, portray
Gates as a cutthroat operator, an exacting taskmaster and a
high-tech snob with no patience for his perceived intellectual
inferiors.
</P>
<P>
   In much of what the trust-busters have put into evidence, but
have chosen not to highlight in court, Gates comes across less
proud and patronizing and more bothered and bewildered over how to
steer his high-tech juggernaut through the digital desert.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as his battles with Intel Corp., the big chip
maker, heated up in 1995, Gates sent two key staff members an
e-mail message that read: ``We need (a) decent compromise here and
it's not clear to me what it is. Should we agree to work with this
(Intel software) group on specific things to get them redirected?''
</P>
<P>
   This Gates message served as a digital wrapper for his e-mail to
Andrew Grove, Intel's chief executive officer, who also holds a
reputation for arrogance. In the message, Gates approaches Grove as
an open-minded supplicant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we have,'' he wrote Grove, ``is that we have to
sort of choose in software-related issues which company will lead
and which will follow. In chips, its (sic) very clear. In software,
you have a group (the 700-person Intel Architectural Labs) that
won't allow us to lead and has all the prestide (sic) and profits
of Intel to drive them forward. ... We should talk on the phone
more about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gates assured an annual shareholders meeting held
near the company's campus in Redmond, Wash., that Microsoft would
prevail in the high-stakes legal clash.
</P>
<P>
   Gates allowed that he has ``an incredible respect for the legal
system.'' But he branded the trial as an effort ``to advance the
interest of a handful of competitors,'' pointing to secret meetings
between government antitrust lawyers and his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day, with the courthouse here shut down for
Veterans' Day, Gates took a bold swipe at the government in a taped
interview with ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They take every piece of e-mail I've sent, (and) pick the ones
that they think can confuse people,'' Gates said. ``They take a
little snippet of that, then they edit the videotape and don't show
my whole deposition, they show these tiny little pieces. The
government could have called me as a witness. Why didn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   But Gates himself told only one side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say that his Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell lawyers had fought
furiously behind the scenes to keep Gates from being deposed.
</P>
<P>
   And he did not say that, having lost that fight, they petitioned
in vain to block release of the entire 20 hours of videotape to the
networks, as the government had sought.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As matters turned out, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson spent most of a morning closeted in his chambers with both
sets of attorneys as they hammered out a bargain on precisely what
would and wouldn't be shown of the Gates tapes, and in the sequence
of those that would be.
</P>
<P>
   At Comdex, Gates is likely to receive a more respectful hearing
than the one he has gotten in his virtual appearances in court. But
no amount of applause in Las Vegas can mask the anger that many of
Gates's customers feel over Microsoft's recent license price hikes
for its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   With Intel facing stiff competition and with the price of
central processing units falling, Windows licenses have become by
far the single most costly component of the personal computers
being built by Compaq, Dell and other hardware vendors.
</P>
<P>
   While that point has yet to be raised at the trial here,
government lawyers are certain that it will be before they finally
rest their case.

 &HT;      BOEHNER'S LEADERSHIP RACE TOO CLOSE TO CALL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ronald F. Eckstein  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 -- John Boehner, who rose to power in the
Republican Congress as a hard-nosed reformer challenging the old
bulls, is now trying to fight off a challenge from a younger
upstart.
</P>
<P>
   The West Chester Republican came to the U.S. House of
Representatives in 1990 and joined the ``Gang of Seven'' -- a group
of freshmen who assailed veteran congressmen for their overdrafts
at the House Bank and abuse of the House Post Office. The Gang
pushed for reforms including legislation making members of Congress
subject to the same laws it writes for ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Boehner was one of the principle architects of the
Contract With America, the GOP agenda that helped launch
Republicans to their first House majority in 40 years. That year he
challenged an established Republican leader for a spot in the party
hierarchy and won.
</P>
<P>
   But now Boehner is fighting to maintain his political clout he
spent years building. He is being challenged for the leadership
position which defines him on Capitol Hill: chairman of the House
Republican Conference. Oklahoma Republican J.C. Watts is running
against Boehner for the fourth slot in the GOP House hierarchy -- a
post which makes Boehner a power broker within the party and a key
contact for members of the business community looking to make
Republican inroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate irony is that John Boehner, one of the original
rebel turks, may be ousted by a new wave of rebel turks,'' one
Republican aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed by the results of an Election Day which didn't meet
expectations, many Republicans blamed their leadership for an
ineffective game plan. Many GOP leaders, including Boehner, had
predicted the party would add as many as 20 seats to its House
majority on Nov. 3. But Democrats picked up five seats, despite
President Clinton's troubles and a strong slate of Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While conservatives and moderates disagreed on the specifics,
most Republicans agree the party failed to convey a consistent
vision which would motivate voters to go to the polls on Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was really no clear agenda for the year. And when
there's no agenda and there's no real direction, what happens is
you really can't have a message,'' Boehner explained on ABC's
``This Week'' last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That lack of message -- and subsequent lack of Election Day
success -- brought out calls for a shakeup of the Republican
hierarchy. House Speaker Newt Gingrich was the first to go,
resigning last Friday after House Appropriations Committee Chairman
Robert L. Livingston, R-La., announced he would run against
Gingrich for speaker. But other leaders, including Boehner, also
came under fire.
</P>
<P>
   At least half-a-dozen Republicans were rumored to be eyeing
Boehner's job amid the post-election mayhem. Ultimately the field
was cleared to allow Watts to take his best shot.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, a former star quarterback at the University of Oklahoma,
played professionally in the Canadian Football League. He was a
businessman and Baptist minister before being elected to Congress
in 1994. Watts will turn 42-years old the day the Republican
Conference meets to hold its leadership elections, Wednesday, Nov.
18. Boehner will turn 49 one day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As the lone African-American Republican in Congress, Watts has
gotten plenty of media attention. As a featured speaker at the 1996
Republican National Convention in San Diego, Watts gave an
inspirational speech which electrified the GOP faithful.
``Character is simply doing right when nobody is looking,'' he
said, and his star has been rising on the national scene ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Ideology will not be a factor, as both men have solid
conservative credentials. Each is confident he will win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a contest between allies,'' said Boehner spokesman
Dave Schnittger.
</P>
<P>
   The conference chairman's main responsibility is to help
Republican congressmen communicate their positions and agenda to
the public. In order to reach that goal the chairman holds weekly
meetings for members, issues comprehensive briefs and fact sheets
to explain matters before the House, and holds issue-specific
briefings for Republican congressional staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner has also been responsible for working with activist
organizations or business coalitions sympathetic to Republican
positions on issues before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After the party failed to convey its vision during the election
campaign, many congressmen pointed their fingers at Boehner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Republicans would say our message was communicated
badly, and that falls at the feet of Mr. Boehner,'' said a top
Republican aide whose boss is backing Watts. ``There are a lot of
people who are dissatisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehner supporters say the conference chairman was undercut by
other leaders on message development, as Gingrich, House Majority
Leader Richard K. Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay ultimately
managed communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that job was taken over by the speaker and the
majority leader,'' said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at
the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute for Public
Policy Research.
</P>
<P>
   Watts has not directly criticized Boehner, but feels he can
upgrade the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's time for some new blood,'' said Tobi Edwards,
Watts' spokeswoman. ``We obviously think we could do a better job
getting our message out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehner attempted to distance himself from the Republicans'
Election Day communication breakdown. He tried to shift the focus
to Gingrich and Republican Congressional Committee Chairman John
Linder of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most members of the House believe that with Newt's
decision to leave, that's enough change. That the problems in terms
of managing the message were mainly in the speaker's office,''
Boehner said on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on CNN, Boehner said Gingrich and Linder made a mistake
by pushing a campaign ad focussing on Clinton and Monica Lewinsky,
which distracted the public from the Republican agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who eventually made the decisions, whether the
speaker or John Linder (did) or together, but (the ad) should not
have been run,'' Boehner said. ``The election was not about Bill
Clinton or Monica Lewinsky and what (the ad) did was it raised a
pall over the election that didn't need to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some felt Boehner was simply looking for a scapegoat and his
disloyalty to Gingrich would play poorly among other Republican
congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner's camp disputed that assessment and said there has been
no backlash to those comments. Other congressmen agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that John has been a team player over the last
four years, unlike some other members of leadership,'' said Rep.
Ray LaHood, R-Ill., pointing to the attempt by some Republican
leaders to oust Gingrich in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue being weighed by Republicans as they decide
between Boehner and Watts is the importance of creating a more
diverse leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   According to exit polling data, 55 percent of white voters chose
Republican candidates, while 42 percent chose Democrats. Among
black voters, however, Republicans won only 11 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbolically, John is in a very tough position,'' said Eddie
Mahe, a veteran Republican strategist. ``We have done an abysmal
job selling Republican candidates to minorities. To fix that we
have to take a close look at the issues we talk about and a close
look at who we have doing the talking.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the top Republican leadership positions are now filled by
white men.
</P>
<P>
   ``All white men is not what the universe is made of out there,''
Mahe said. ``We have to attract a wider group of voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts has downplayed the role of his race.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleagues are going to pay less attention to my skin color
and they're going to pay a lot more attention to what I have worked
on the last four years, what I've accomplished,'' Watts said on
television last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Mahe and Ornstein both argued that Boehner may be in a better
position to be re-elected if Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., defeats
Armey in the race for majority leader. Adding a woman to the
leadership team, they argue, may satisfy voters looking to add
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner has said he welcomes the prospect of Watts and Dunn
taking more visible positions within the party, just not his
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.C. Watts is a terrific spokesperson for Republican values
and ideas. We need to find an appropriate role for him in our
conference that makes the most of his talents,'' Schnittger said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Boehner's race may come down to his colleagues'
assessments of ``What have you done for me lately?''.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have contributed to the campaigns of other Republicans
through their own campaign committees and through separate
political action committees they operate. Boehner's contributions,
however, dwarf those of Watts.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-98 political cycle Watts' American Renewal PAC gave
$13,250 to 13 Republican candidates for Congress, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner's Freedom Project gave $333,526 to 71 Republican
candidates for the House, according to CRP. Boehner's individual
campaign fund, Friends of John Boehner, raised an additional $1.1
million for Republicans, according to Roll Call, a Capitol Hill
newspaper. And Boehner's camp said he has made personal appearances
for Republican candidates in 89 districts around the country --
ultimately raising $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Boehner does these things for one purpose and one purpose
only, and that is to expand the Republican majority,'' Schnittger
said. ``Is there gratitude? I'm sure, in some cases, there is.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there is the matter of Boehner's handling of
day-to-day responsibilities of the conference chairman. Over all,
there are few complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner issued a letter to his colleagues last weekend touting
the services his staff has provided during the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Those services have been particularly important to new members
of Congress. An aide to freshman Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., said
the decision to vote for Boehner was the easiest his boss has had
to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only have John Boehner and his staff have done everything
we have ever asked for, but they have helped us with things we
didn't know to ask,'' said Craig Roberts, Shimkus' top aide.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job of chairman is not only to run the meetings but to put
out good information. He has hired a good staff which puts out
informative issue papers that are very timely,'' LaHood said. ``I
think it would be unfair to displace someone who has done a good
job with someone new just to put a new face on the party.''
</P>
<P>
   But the quality of Boehner's day-to-day management of the
Republican Conference may not be enough for him to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think he's done a very decent job in that
position,'' Mahe said. ``That being said, it's not like someone
else couldn't also do that job. It's not heart surgery.''

my whole deposition, they show these tiny little pieces. The
government could have called me as a witness. Why didn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   But Gates himself told only one side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say that his Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell lawyers had fought
furiously behind the scenes to keep Gates from being deposed.
</P>
<P>
   And he did not say that, having lost that fight, they petitioned
in vain to block release of the entire 20 hours of videotape to the
networks, as the government had sought.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As matters turned out, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson spent most of a morning closeted in his chambers with both
sets of attorneys as they hammered out a bargain on precisely what
would and wouldn't be shown of the Gates tapes, and in the sequence
of those that would be.
</P>
<P>
   At Comdex, Gates is likely to receive a more respectful hearing
than the one he has gotten in his virtual appearances in court. But
no amount of applause in Las Vegas can mask the anger that many of
Gates's customers feel over Microsoft's recent license price hikes
for its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   With Intel facing stiff competition and with the price of
central processing units falling, Windows licenses have become by
far the single most costly component of the personal computers
being built by Compaq, Dell and other hardware vendors.
</P>
<P>
   While that point has yet to be raised at the trial here,
government lawyers are certain that it will be before they finally
rest their case.

HOLIDAY FILM OFFERINGS FOR THE KIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pigs, bugs, rugrats _ what's not to love about the kids' holiday
movie lineup? Here's a guide to November and December openings:
</P>
<P>
   NOVEMBER
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wizard of Oz'' (in theaters now)
</P>
<P>
   Easily the pick of the season, which is saying something when
the competition includes ``A Bug's Life'' and a ``Babe'' sequel.
It's the story of a girl (and her little dog, too!) ... well, you
know the rest. Even if you've seen this on TV a dozen times, you
haven't really seen it until you get a look at this dazzlingly
colorful big-screen print. Rated G.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' (in theaters now)
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Improvement's'' Jonathan Taylor Thomas stars as a
self-absorbed smoothie who winds up stranded in the desert wearing
a Santa suit, which only adds to the challenge of traveling
cross-country in time to pick up his Christmas gift from Dad: a
vintage Porsche. The PG-rated movie is a mix of forced
sentimentality and seasonal opportunism at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig in the City'' (Nov. 25)
</P>
<P>
   In this sequel to one of the decade's best family movies, the
lovable and adventurous talking pig goes to town, where he meets a
whole new slew of chatty animal friends. George Miller, the
visually imaginative director who produced the first ``Babe,''
directs this time around. You can count on him to retain the
original's charms, although reports are that the effects are so
complicated, the movie's still in production. Rated PG.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' (Nov. 25)
</P>
<P>
   Director John Lasseter and the ``Toy Story'' gang from Pixar
animation take their turn with the bug set, in this hilarious movie
about a misfit ant (voice of Dave Foley) determined to save his
colony from the tyranny of a voracious group of greedy
grasshoppers. Other voices include Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Phyllis
Diller, Kevin Spacey, David Hyde Pierce, Denis Leary, Madeline
Kahn, Roddy McDowall and Jason Alexander. Rated G.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie'' (Friday, Nov. 20)
</P>
<P>
   Those animated scamps from cable's Nickelodeon network make
their big-screen breakthrough in this adventure, in which a
brand-spankin'-new Rugrat strains friendships among the rest of the
gang. Stretched out to feature some gratuitous songs, the feature
film diminishes the charm of the TV series. Rated G.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   DECEMBER
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' (Dec. 11)
</P>
<P>
   Boldly going where millions of movie fans have gone many times
before, this ninth installment in the big-screen Trek series finds
Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) helping a magic colony fight off a
race of bizarre aliens (sounds kinda like ``A Bug's Life,'' doesn't
it?). Veteran villains F. Murray Abraham and Anthony Zerbe co-star,
as does most of the ``Star Trek: The Next Generation crew.'' Rated
PG.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' (Dec. 11)
</P>
<P>
   Teens, especially those with an interest in Irish culture, will
probably enjoy this fun bit o' blarney about two blokes who try to
find out which person in their tiny village possesses a winning
lottery ticket. The PG-rated movie is based on a true story.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Frost'' (Dec. 11)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keaton is a musician who dies on Christmas Eve, only to
come back a year later in the form of a snowman and do a better job
of being a father than he did when he was alive. Joseph Cross, who
played Keaton's son in ``Desperate Measures,'' plays him again
here; music fans might get a kick out of seeing punk poet Henry
Rollins and former MTV veejay Dweezil Zappa in supporting roles.
Rated PG.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince of Egypt'' (Dec. 18)
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' first traditional animated film tells the story of
Moses in beautifully drawn, unusually faithful detail. The upstart
studio _ headed in part by Jeffrey Katzenberg, who helped revive
animated features at Disney _ isn't taking the easy route with this
movie, which steers clear of easy humor in favor of a colorful
reverence. Voices include Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Val
Kilmer, Sandra Bullock, Steve Martin and Patrick Stewart. Rated PG.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Mighty Joe Young'' (Dec. 25)
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth native Bill Paxton stars in this update of a 1949
film, which was itself a takeoff on 1933's ``King Kong.'' Paxton is
a zoologist who discovers a 15-foot gorilla named Joe who can be
tamed only by Jill (Charlize Theron), the woman who raised him.
Like Kong, Joe comes to America _ and creates all sorts of havoc.
Let's hope he creates more interesting havoc than Godzilla did.
Rated PG.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   VIDEO: ``A Charlie Brown Everything''
</P>
<P>
   In celebration of the Jewish holiday Hanukkah, which begins Dec.
14, Shari Lewis and her Lamb Chop sock puppet star in ``Lamb Chop's
Special Chanukah'' ($14.95). The video shows a family celebrating
the holiday in many of the same ways the people of other religions
celebrate: with favorite traditions and blessings, storytelling and
games. Lewis, a singer, dancer, puppeteer and ventriloquist, died
in August.
</P>
<P>
   It just ain't the holidays without Charlie Brown and the gang,
and five Peanuts videos are available for home viewing. The best
``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' ($12.95), which was the first Peanuts
special; it features an enduringly vibrant jazz score by the Vince
Guaraldi Trio and a sweet anti-commercialism message. Also
available: ``A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving''; ``Happy New Year,
Charlie Brown''; and ``It Was My Best Birthday Ever, Charlie
Brown'' ($12.95 each); and ``It's Christmas Time Again, Charlie
Brown'' ($9.95).
</P>
<P>
   The Rugrats, those rambunctious babies that are also making
their big-screen debut, continue their quest for world domination
as Paramount Home Video and Nickelodeon release Rugrats gift sets
for the holidays. Each set contains two videos and costs $22.90.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ebenezer'': Jack Palance (City Slickers) plays Scrooge in this
version of the Charles Dickens classic, available from Plaza
Entertainment for $14.95. In the spirit (get it?) of the story,
each tape sold will benefit ``HolidayFeast 98,'' an organization
that provides meals to needy families over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richie Rich's Christmas Wish'': The golden-haired kid
billionaire stars in a new holiday adventure. When Richie's nasty
cousin Reggie Van Dough causes Richie's sleigh filled with
Christmas gifts for orphans to attack neighborhood homes, Richie
steps in and saves the holiday. Richie is played by David
Gallagher, of TV's ``7th Heaven.''

DODGE PROWLER IS A WAY COOL MACHINE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's almost unbelievable, this street-legal hot rod called the
Prowler.
</P>
<P>
   First, it's hard to believe that someone could build such a car
under today's strict safety and emissions-control regulations, and
make it street legal and still so cool.
</P>
<P>
   And cool is the word that best describes what is possibly the
most outrageous production vehicle ever built.
</P>
<P>
   For a baby boomer such as myself, this car is a throwback to the
cool '50s and early '60s when I was growing up, an age that still
lives in the music that we hear daily on the most popular radio
stations, golden-oldie outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Driving down the road in my bright yellow Prowler test car, with
the top down, I kept the radio blasting _ mostly tuned to a AM
station that plays the oldies ``in mono like you remember them.''
</P>
<P>
   The music seemed to fit the Prowler like a glove. Of course, the
sound system in the Prowler _ with 320 watts of power _ is designed
to share the music with everybody else as you cruise down the road
and sit waiting for traffic lights to change.
</P>
<P>
   But you really don't need the loud radio blasting out the Beach
Boys' ``Fun, Fun, Fun'' to get attention in the Prowler. The only
other car I've driven in 15 years of auto reviewing that has come
close to drawing this much attention is the new VW Beetle, but
people were just curious about it; they were passionate about the
Prowler.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever I stopped _ even at traffic lights _ people would roll
down their windows or walk up to the car, look it over, and start
asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   The first one, usually, was ``What is it?'' Even with all the
media attention, most people had never heard of the Prowler and
didn't know it was made by Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Second, of course, was, ``How much does it cost?'' I would show
them the sticker, which lists the price as an even $40,000
(including $700 transportation), but then I had to tell them: ``If
you really want to buy one, get on a waiting list and plan to pay
at least double that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I explained that Plymouth has built only about 2,000
Prowlers, and that until production at the Detroit Conner Avenue
plant cranks up to the promised 5,000 a year, these babies are
going to be in short supply. Each dealer that qualifies to get
Prowlers will be lucky to get two this year.
</P>
<P>
   The next most popular question, which came from the few who had
heard of the Prowler, was, ``How did you get a yellow one? I
thought they only came in purple.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a bit of Prowler history and trivia for you: The first
ones, the 1997 model, came only in purple. There was no 1998 model;
and now, the 1999 models are on the market and they come in purple
and yellow. Later in the '99 model year, they also will come in
black and red. (I haven't seen either of those yet.)
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, the Prowler also gets more power. The 3.5-liter V-6
engine has been retuned and beefed up from the original 214
horsepower to a whopping 253, and torque has increased 15 percent
to 255 foot-pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It drives like a dream, although I have to admit it is a bit
rough on the bumps. People are surprised that the car has only a
six-cylinder engine, but believe me, there is plenty of power.
Road-handling is crisp and sure, thanks in part to the
Indy-car-style suspension and bicyclelike front wheels, and the
huge rear tires (20-inch wheels).
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise is that the Prowler comes only with an
automatic transmission. The four-speed gear box does have an
automatic stick-shift mode, however, so you can manually run it
through the gears if you choose. But you don't have to worry about
a clutch.
</P>
<P>
   Practical, the Prowler is not. The trunk holds 1.8 cubic feet of
stuff, but that's big enough for a briefcase and a jacket or two _
no suitcases or golf clubs. For cross-country cruising, you can buy
a matching trailer that looks like the huge rear end of the car. It
costs about $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   There are just two seats, of course, but the 1999 model has a
passenger-side air-bag cut-off switch, which allowed me to take my
11-month-old granddaughter for a ride in her rear-facing child
seat. (I mean, you really should have a babe beside you in this
car!)
</P>
<P>
   The top is operated manually, and can't be lowered until the
trunk lid is opened (it's actually the whole rear of the body, and
it releases and tilts up toward the back).
</P>
<P>
   Since this is technically a luxury car, there are standard
amenities you would expect in one: power windows and door locks
(with remote), leather seats, air-conditioning, leather-wrapped
steering wheel, cruise control, dual power mirrors, full
instrumentation, four-wheel disc brakes, security system, power
rack-and-pinion steering and more.
</P>
<P>
   The frame is made of aluminum, and the body is a composite
plastic. It looks like a new body could be bolted on in minutes in
case you should break the old one.
</P>
<P>
   The exhaust system is tuned to make the car sound like a hot rod
without breaking local noise ordinances, so it really does sound
cool.
</P>
<P>
   The audio system includes an AM/FM stereo/cassette in-dash unit
with a separate six-disc CD changer mounted behind the passenger
seat. There are seven speakers.
</P>
<P>
   No factory options are offered for the Prowler except the little
trainer; everything else is included.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising range is quite limited: The gas tank holds only 10
gallons, and the car gets just 17 miles per gallon in the city and
23 mpg on the highway. I was having to refuel every 160 miles,
which would be a real hassle on a cross-country jaunt.
</P>
<P>
   So who would buy a Prowler? Bored middle-aged dentists, mostly?
Chrysler says the target buyers are men ages 35-49 with annual
household incomes of $125,000-plus. Only 25 percent of buyers are
expected to be female, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, I think most of us would buy one if we had the dough.

</P>
<P>
   The Package: Two-door, two-passenger, six-cylinder, rear-drive
convertible-top hot rod.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights: The coolest car on the road; it catches almost
everyone's eyes, it's fun to drive, has lots of power and even
sounds like a hot rod.
</P>
<P>
   Negatives: Not the most practical car around: there is virtually
no trunk, it jolts your kidneys on bumps, and the gas tank is too
small. The sticker price is decent, but dealers are getting double
that and more.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia on Friday urged Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to
cooperate with the United Nations on weapons inspections and
encouraged another trip to Baghdad by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to avert possible air strikes by the United States and its
allies.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to generate momentum for a last-ditch diplomatic
settlement to the stand-off, Russia called for a ``political
solution'' and cautioned Iraq that the alternative is a threat of
force that ``can become real.''
</P>
<P>
   In reply, Saddam said that ``Iraq will accept positively any
initiative that meets our just and balanced demands,'' according to
the state-run Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has played the role of broker in the past to blunt U.S.
efforts to build a consensus for punitive strikes against Iraq.
Russia is a traditional ally of Iraq and is eager to renew trading
and recover billions of dollars in back payments from Baghdad
should the U.N. embargo be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin said it was categorically opposed to the use of
force in the current crisis. But while offering some diplomatic
daylight this time, Russia's role comes with a firm rebuke to Iraq
for creating the stand-off on Oct. 31 when it ended cooperation
with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Russia pushed hard for Annan's mission in February that
successfully ended tensions then and resumed weapons inspections.
Officials in Moscow believe there is little diplomatic maneuvering
room left for Saddam now.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Russia's ambassador to Iraq met with Saddam and
delivered letters from President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov. The contents of the letters were not revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam told Russian ambassador Nikolai Kartuzov that Iraq is
ready to respond favorably to any diplomatic overture which
satisfies its demands. According to INA, Saddam also told the envoy
that Iraq's decision to halt cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors was not intended to provoke a confrontation with the
U.N. Security Council, but to have its concerns heeded.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Iraq has sought an easing of
U.N. sanctions designed to prevent Saddam from rebuilding his army.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Russian officials stressed that the Kremlin would not
endorse military strikes, but they also seemed to suggest that Iraq
had set itself up for the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the process is developing in a way that if a political
solution is not urgently found, the threat of use of force can
become real,'' presidential spokesman Dmitri Yakushkin said.
``Russia is categorically against the option of force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, Russia's special Middle East envoy Viktor
Posuvalyuk encouraged another trip by Annan to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in favor of him (Annan) going to Baghdad,'' Posuvalyuk
told Ekho Moskvy radio station, but added that Iraq must give
``clear guarantees that such a trip would be successful.''

RUSSIANS DROP REQUEST THAT SPACE STATION BE LOCATED NEAR MIR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With eventual agreement from the Russian Space Agency, NASA
rejected an 11th-hour request by the Russians to change the orbital
assembly site of the international space station so that it would
be closer to the aging Mir outpost, U.S. officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both concluded it added technical complexity and risk to
the mission that was not justified,'' said Randy Brinkley, NASA's
space station program manager. ``It came very late in the planning
and operational phases, and it had significant impacts in terms of
changes to the mission profile.''
</P>
<P>
   The request from the Russian aerospace company that operates Mir
was forwarded to NASA late last week. The assembly phase of the new
station is scheduled to begin Friday, Nov. 20, at 1:40 a.m. EST,
with the launching of the first component from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian request was made so that future Progress cargo
capsules could ferry several thousand pounds of research equipment
from the 13-year-old Mir outpost to the new station. But the new
location would have prompted a considerable number of changes in
the launches of other components that will be added through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley said U.S. and Russian station planners engaged in what
he termed ``frank and candid'' discussions over the request until
early this week. The Russians suggested earlier this week that they
had withdrawn the request on their own. The issue was formally put
to rest early Friday in discussions between the top Russian and
U.S. space agency officials.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley said the Americans would consider future proposals from
the Russians to move equipment between the two stations as long as
they did not jeopardize efforts to assemble the new orbital
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The aborted request was just the latest in a series of
distractions for the project, most of them linked to Russian
financial difficulties and its own internal politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have agreed to plunge Mir into the ocean after the
middle of 1999 in preparation for occupancy of the new station by
U.S. astronauts and Russian cosmonauts. But some forces within the
country oppose the station's demise because it is a symbol of
national pride and a source of funds from foreign astronauts. &QL;

AS TURMOIL ROILS HOUSE GOP, TRANQUILLITY RULES SENATE REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As House Republicans brawl over leadership posts in
the aftermath of their party's poor election showing, relative calm
has settled over Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., is expected to be
re-elected as Republican Senate leader when the party holds its
caucus on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's fellow Republican from Mississippi, Sen. Thad Cochran,
said there's simply no opposition to Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Senate, there's just not the sharp difference of
opinion about what could have been done to improve the election one
way or another,'' Cochran said. ``I don't know that anybody lost
because of what Sen. Lott did or didn't do. (House) Speaker
Gingrich was always pushing the envelop _ he was a revolutionary _
and in many cases someone that hot ends up flaming out.''
</P>
<P>
   Any grousing among Republicans would come from their failure to
win any new Senate seats in the Nov. 3 elections, defying
historical trends that the political party not in the White House
usually improves its margin of congressional seats in off-year
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Lott's spokesman John Czwartacki said no one is
talking about fresh leadership for Senate Republicans, though some
Republican senators are talking about the need for a fresh agenda
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change doesn't always have to manifest itself with changes in
name plates,'' Czwartacki said. ``Sometimes it's more effective to
change policy direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The steady habits of the Senate stand in counterpoint to the
tumult in the House where a Republican mutiny broke out after House
Republicans saw their majority shrink by five seats, from 228-217
to 223-212.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, is expected to win his party's support to
replace Gingrich, R-Ga., when House Republicans meet Wednesday to
select their new leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the only detectable restlessness is coming from
Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., a first-term member, who is expected to
decide soon whether to challenge Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., for
the chairmanship of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
That job involves raising money to boost GOP Senate candidates, as
well as recruiting candidates and channeling the money to their
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell has said he wants to serve two more years.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Lott's staying power stems from his relatively low
profile and congenial temperament that have made him less
controversial than Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, 57, a former cheerleader at the University of Mississippi,
has a reputation as a man who knows when to button his lip and make
a deal.
</P>
<P>
   William F. Connelly, a political scientist at Washington and Lee
University in Lexington, Va., summed up the contrasting styles of
the two Republican leaders: ``Newt lived by the sword and died by
the sword. Trent Lott is not radioactive. He is a somewhat more
congenial face. He is not as haughty and he is not a
revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of
California at San Diego, said Lott, unlike Gingrich, ``hasn't
positioned himself as the spiritual leader of his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not being the leader of the (political) campaigns, he doesn't
suffer the consequences of the failure of Republicans to gain seats
in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott has been criticized by some conservative Senate Republicans
about the last-minute appropriations package that forced the GOP to
make major concessions before Congress adjourned for the year. He
also came under fire when a Republican-backed tax cut died in the
Senate without coming to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   But no one wants to topple him.
</P>
<P>
   David Rohde, a political scientist at Michigan State University,
said Lott's opposition among Republicans ``is just not as intense
and it's recognized that Lott wasn't as consequential because he
doesn't dominate the institution the way Gingrich did'' the House.
</P>
<P>
   In the heady days of the first year of the Republican revolution
after the GOP grabbed control of the House in the 1994 mid-term
election, Gingrich referred to himself as ``a transformational
figure,'' and many of his followers credited him with the
successful Republican insurgency that year.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, on the other hand, knows when to keep his head low.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls indicate that Lott is both less well known
than Gingrich _ and is more popular.
</P>
<P>
   An October Poll by Princeton Survey Research Associates and
sponsored by the Pew Research Center found that 30 percent of
respondents viewed Lott favorably, 27 percent viewed him
unfavorably _ and 43 percent either had no idea who he was or said
they couldn't rate him.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the same firm that month showed 41 percent viewed
House Speaker Newt Gingrich favorably, 49 percent viewed him
unfavorably and only 10 percent said they never heard of him or
couldn't rate him. A poll by ABC News just before the election
looked even worse for the speaker, with 34 percent viewing Gingrich
favorably, 58 percent unfavorably, and 9 percent with no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for Lott's relative job security is that he has
been less identified with the controversial Republican-led House
investigation into the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has criticized Clinton's behavior but doesn't talk about it
often, taking the view that he shouldn't comment because he may be
a juror if the House votes to impeach Clinton and the case goes to
the Senate for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gingrich was criticized for approving a last-minute
TV advertising blitz before the election to remind voters of
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the upcoming
impeachment proceedings.

<P>
   The Senate is also designed to be less prone to political
upheaval, compared to the House. Only one-third of the 100 senators
face re-election every two years, as opposed to the House where all
of its members are up for election every two years. And while House
rules enable the majority, and therefore the speaker, to steer the
agenda with an iron fist, Senate rules are such that the majority
leader has significantly less power than the House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Senate rules allow a single senator to block action
with tactics such as the filibuster. That forces the majority
leader to compromise, acting as a kind of pressure valve, diffusing
anger and frustration before it might build into a revolt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House is more mercurial, more emotional, it responds to
instant opinions and everyone is on a short string,'' Cochran said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House just self destructs every two years and starts anew.
But here in the Senate we have a more continuing operation going
on. We are more traditional, more conservative and have less energy
to fight over everything.''

MYSTERIOUS PROCESS BREAKS DOWN WATER MOLECULES  
 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., NOV. 16, 1998)

   The words ``mysterious'' and ``bizarre'' don't often come up in
conversations among chemists. But that's how they are describing a
way to split water into hydrogen and oxygen at room temperature
using a simple catalyst. Japanese researchers now say that the
energy needed to break the bonds that hold water molecules together
seems to come from stirring the liquid.
</P>
<P>
   When Kazunari Domen and his colleagues at Tokyo Institute of
Technology first reported last February that a powdered cuprous
oxide catalyst could split water at room temperature, chemists sat
up and took notice This reaction usually takes place at 3000
degrees C and is driven by light. If its efficiency could be
improved, hydrogen would become much more attractive as a cheap,
clean fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Domen initially thought that the energy driving the
low-temperature reaction came from light_a mechanism chemists could
just about live with. But now he reports that the reaction
continues in the dark for hundreds of hours. The quicker the
container is stirred, says Domen, the more hydrogen and oxygen are
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Domen believes that the mechanical energy is converted to
chemical energy without first being converted to thermal energy.
``This is the first example of mechanical energy being converted
into chemical energy by catalysis,'' he says. But Domen cannot
explain how this works.
</P>
<P>
   To most chemists, the idea is heresy. And the prospect of
producing a source of fuel by a mechanism no one understands evokes
memories of the ``cold fusion'' saga of 1989. But Domen's results
were carefully reviewed before they were published. He has also
avoided making any bold claims about practical applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of colleagues were incredulous, but I think Domen is a
very serious scientist,'' says Michael Gratzel of the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   Gratzel suspects that something more mundane is occurring,
however, such as friction between the catalyst and the glass
container causing a buildup of electrical charge. The resulting
tiny sparks could break down small amounts of water. ``There's an
easy way to rule that out,'' he says. Dissolving a salt in the
water would change its conductivity and the amount of gases
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Nozik, a chemist at the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, doubts if the effect is really
caused by catalysis. ``I wouldn't be surprised if they are actually
using up some of the metal oxide,'' he says. Nozik suspects that
the cuprous oxide might react with water, liberating hydrogen. The
oxygen could come from small quantities of the gas dissolved in the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Domen says that less than 5 percent of the energy from stirring
appears to end up splitting water, producing a small amount of
hydrogen and oxygen gas. But he thinks he can improve the yield by
learning more about how the reaction works. ``If we can increase
the efficiency by an order of magnitude, then it may be possible to
think about practical applications,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds odd, but maybe it only sounds odd because it's
new,'' says Sean McGrady of King's College, London. He likens the
situation to the discovery in the 1980s that sound can drive
chemical reactions, which has led to the burgeoning field of
sonochemistry. ``When these things show up they always challenge
people's conceptions of how energy can get into a chemical
reaction,'' says McGrady. ``These reports take time to confirm or
shoot down.''  &QL;

   Cockroaches have given away a secret that could be their
undoing. Entomologists in Florida have discovered that the insects
follow filthy trails laid down by other roaches_and that the
chemicals they follow could be used to lead them to traps.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers used to think that roaches wandered around randomly
as they scavenged for morsels. But Dini Miller and Philip Koehler
at the University of Florida in Gainesville discovered that German
cockroaches follow trails of their own fecal material, using their
antennae to sense chemicals it contains.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pooping as they're walking along, and their bodies
also have attractant chemicals on them,'' Miller says. ``Over time,
a trail accumulates by accident.'' The trail is very long lasting.
``If you go to a house that has a bad infestation, you can see a
brown line along the sink counter or cabinets where the cockroaches
pass.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the researchers thought they could use the fecal
material to attract the roaches to a trap or bait. ``But it's brown
and it smells terrible,'' Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   By dissolving the feces in methylene chloride, and then mixing
the solution with water, she was able to transfer the cockroach
attractants into the water, leaving the offensive color and odor in
the methylene chloride. ``We can make a line with this water, let
it dry, and the cockroach will follow that line even though it
can't see it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says people should place their cockroach bait or traps
along these newly discovered roach trails. She questions whether
anyone would breed ``zillions of cockroaches'' to harvest the fecal
material, but suggests that the chemical could be synthesized when
it's finally identified. &QL;

GLOBAL WARMING WILL COME FAST

   Global warming probably will not be a gentle turning up of the
thermostat, as climatologists used to think, but rather a sudden
switch to a new climate system. That's the stark warning from many
of the world's leading climate researchers to representatives of
governments meeting this week in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Climate doesn't change smoothly. It happens in jumps and
jolts,'' says Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate
Impacts Research in Germany. In Buenos Aires, he revealed details
of a study that builds on his prediction that northwest Europe
could cool by several degrees as global warming shuts down the Gulf
Stream.
</P>
<P>
   The current has already been weakened by increased flows of
fresh water into the North Atlantic, says Rahmstorf. ``There is a
threshold in the North Atlantic ocean circulation beyond which the
circulation may abruptly collapse. We may reach that threshold
early in the 22nd century, but it could be much sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   While Europe faces a sudden chill, most of the planet could face
equally rapid heating. Abrupt climate change was the historical
norm, says Jeff Severinghaus of the Scripps Institute of
Oceanography in La Jolla, California. For instance, Greenland ice
cores have revealed a sudden rise in average temperatures 14,600
years ago of more than 5 degrees C in less than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to think climate changed gradually, like slowly
turning up a dial on an oven,'' says Severinghaus. ``But it's more
like a light switch.''
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt changes may be intrinsic to the atmospheric system,
or triggered by feedback from vegetation. Researchers at the Hadley
Center in Bracknell, part of Britain's Meteorological Office,
forecast that global warming will cause forests to grow faster in
the next 50 years, absorbing more than 100 billion tons of carbon,
a third of current industrial emissions. This should moderate
warming. But from about 2050, the warming will kill many tropical
forests, returning the carbon to the atmosphere and causing
``runaway'' warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to discuss these scenarios privately. Now we are being
more open,'' says Stephen Schneider of Stanford University in Palo
Alto,Calif. If the climatologists are correct, waiting for cheaper
cleanup technologies before tackling the problem of global warming
would be a serious error.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider warns that the rate at which greenhouse gases are
added to the atmosphere in the next few decades could be as
dangerous to climate systems as the ultimate volume of the gases.
Worryingly, the latest data on carbon dioxide, revealed to New
Scientist by David Keeling of the University of California, San
Diego, show that in the past year, the gas accumulated in the
atmosphere at a record rate.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Watson, chairman of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, says that the new work on sudden, chaotic climate
change will form a central feature of the panel's third report, due
in before 2001. Its last report in 1995 contained just two
paragraphs on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto Protocol, drawn up at last year's climate summit to
limit emissions of greenhouse gases, will not be implemented for up
to two years because governments have put off some vital decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates in Buenos Aires were supposed to set the rules on how
industrialized countries can meet part of their Kyoto targets by
funding clean energy projects and carbon ``sinks'', such as
forests, in other countries. But the urgency has evaporated. The
debate on carbon sinks has been put on hold while governments await
scientific advice from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, due in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided to focus on areas of convergence not
disagreement,'' says Melinda Kimble, leader of the U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
   This delay also applies to demands made by European countries
before the conference that industrial nations should concentrate on
cutting emissions at home and set a ceiling on actions abroad. The
European Union now promises ``concrete proposals'' for the next
meeting, probably in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Flavin of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, D.C.,
blamed the United States. ``It may be time to break the deadlock,
with a group of nations, such as the more progressive European
countries, acting independently without the U.S.,'' he suggested at
a fringe meeting. &QL;

   Bruce Bryant is creating quite a buzz in his laboratory. He is
studying a chemical that, when placed on the tongue, causes a
buzzing sensation that feels as if it must be caused by an electric
current.
</P>
<P>
   The compound, hydroxy-a-sanshool, is found in the spice Sichuan
pepper, which is made from the berries of Zanthoxylum or prickly
ash. Bryant, who works at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in
Philadelphia, says it excites an unusually wide range of sensory
cells. ``When you have this thing in your mouth it turns the
sensations upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hydroxy-a-sanshool stimulates pain receptors_although not enough
to cause discomfort_and cells that respond to cold. ``When you
breathe in, it feels a lot cooler than normal,'' says Bryant. The
tingling occurs because the compound stimulates touch receptors on
the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of mouthwash, who are always looking for ways to
give their products added ``zing'', may be interested in the
chemical. And it has already been studied by researchers developing
creams to enhance men's sexual enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is interested in the compound for other reasons. He
thinks it could act as a model for paresthesias_sensory distortions
similar to pins and needles that are symptoms of many neurological
diseases. Bryant hopes researchers will be able to find drugs that
reverse the effects of hydroxy-a-sanshool, as they may also combat
paresthesias. &QL;

sentimental journey to the steel-manufacturing city of Hamilton,
Ontario, to be honored as a local boy made good. No one in the
crowd knew it. But the situation back home was grave. Within a week
the giant investment fund in which he was a partner, Long-Term
Capital Management, would be taken over by the Federal Reserve Bank
to prevent the fund's outright failure and a rout in the world's
financial markets. By Gretchen Morgenson.

   Global warming probably will not be a gentle turning up of the
thermostat, as climatologists used to think, but rather a sudden
switch to a new climate system. That's the stark warning from many
of the world's leading climate researchers to representatives of
governments meeting this week in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Climate doesn't change smoothly. It happens in jumps and
jolts,'' says Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate
Impacts Research in Germany. In Buenos Aires, he revealed details
of a study that builds on his prediction that northwest Europe
could cool by several degrees as global warming shuts down the Gulf
Stream.
</P>
<P>
   The current has already been weakened by increased flows of
fresh water into the North Atlantic, says Rahmstorf. ``There is a
threshold in the North Atlantic ocean circulation beyond which the
circulation may abruptly collapse. We may reach that threshold
early in the 22nd century, but it could be much sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   While Europe faces a sudden chill, most of the planet could face
equally rapid heating. Abrupt climate change was the historical
norm, says Jeff Severinghaus of the Scripps Institute of
Oceanography in La Jolla, California. For instance, Greenland ice
cores have revealed a sudden rise in average temperatures 14,600
years ago of more than 5 degrees C in less than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to think climate changed gradually, like slowly
turning up a dial on an oven,'' says Severinghaus. ``But it's more
like a light switch.''
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt changes may be intrinsic to the atmospheric system,
or triggered by feedback from vegetation. Researchers at the Hadley
Center in Bracknell, part of Britain's Meteorological Office,
forecast that global warming will cause forests to grow faster in
the next 50 years, absorbing more than 100 billion tons of carbon,
a third of current industrial emissions. This should moderate
warming. But from about 2050, the warming will kill many tropical
forests, returning the carbon to the atmosphere and causing
``runaway'' warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to discuss these scenarios privately. Now we are being
more open,'' says Stephen Schneider of Stanford University in Palo
Alto,Calif. If the climatologists are correct, waiting for cheaper
cleanup technologies before tackling the problem of global warming
would be a serious error.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider warns that the rate at which greenhouse gases are
added to the atmosphere in the next few decades could be as
dangerous to climate systems as the ultimate volume of the gases.
Worryingly, the latest data on carbon dioxide, revealed to New
Scientist by David Keeling of the University of California, San
Diego, show that in the past year, the gas accumulated in the
atmosphere at a record rate.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Watson, chairman of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, says that the new work on sudden, chaotic climate
change will form a central feature of the panel's third report, due
in before 2001. Its last report in 1995 contained just two
paragraphs on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto Protocol, drawn up at last year's climate summit to
limit emissions of greenhouse gases, will not be implemented for up
to two years because governments have put off some vital decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates in Buenos Aires were supposed to set the rules on how
industrialized countries can meet part of their Kyoto targets by
funding clean energy projects and carbon ``sinks'', such as
forests, in other countries. But the urgency has evaporated. The
debate on carbon sinks has been put on hold while governments await
scientific advice from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, due in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided to focus on areas of convergence not
disagreement,'' says Melinda Kimble, leader of the U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
   This delay also applies to demands made by European countries
before the conference that industrial nations should concentrate on
cutting emissions at home and set a ceiling on actions abroad. The
European Union now promises ``concrete proposals'' for the next
meeting, probably in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Flavin of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, D.C.,
blamed the United States. ``It may be time to break the deadlock,
with a group of nations, such as the more progressive European
countries, acting independently without the U.S.,'' he suggested at
a fringe meeting. &QL;

   Bruce Bryant is creating quite a buzz in his laboratory. He is
studying a chemical that, when placed on the tongue, causes a
buzzing sensation that feels as if it must be caused by an electric
current.
</P>
<P>
   The compound, hydroxy-a-sanshool, is found in the spice Sichuan
pepper, which is made from the berries of Zanthoxylum or prickly
ash. Bryant, who works at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in
Philadelphia, says it excites an unusually wide range of sensory
cells. ``When you have this thing in your mouth it turns the
sensations upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hydroxy-a-sanshool stimulates pain receptors_although not enough
to cause discomfort_and cells that respond to cold. ``When you
breathe in, it feels a lot cooler than normal,'' says Bryant. The
tingling occurs because the compound stimulates touch receptors on
the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of mouthwash, who are always looking for ways to
give their products added ``zing'', may be interested in the
chemical. And it has already been studied by researchers developing
creams to enhance men's sexual enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is interested in the compound for other reasons. He
thinks it could act as a model for paresthesias_sensory distortions
similar to pins and needles that are symptoms of many neurological
diseases. Bryant hopes researchers will be able to find drugs that
reverse the effects of hydroxy-a-sanshool, as they may also combat
paresthesias. &QL;

A YEAR AFTER ISAIAH BERLIN'S DEATH, THE RE-EVALUATIONS BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The British philosopher Isaiah Berlin was knighted during his
lifetime, but since his death a year ago he has achieved a peculiar
kind of intellectual sainthood. The tributes are still reverential,
but there are signs of debate and disagreement over the nature of
his intellectual legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his weighty essays can be sampled in a new epic-length
collection, ``The Proper Study of Mankind'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux). In addition, a much-awaited biography by Michael
Ignatieff, ``Isaiah Berlin: A Life'' (Metropolitan Books) has just
been published, based on a decade of intimate conversations with
Berlin: The portrait is affectionate, admiring and sometimes
inspiring, but it also raises questions about the limits of
Berlin's achievement. And recently, the New York Institute for the
Humanities at New York University sponsored a two-day symposium
devoted to his ideas that was as full of criticism as praise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this reassessment is still shot through with the
recollected touch of the Master, invocations of what Ignatieff
calls his ``deep, mumbling, tumbling whisper'' that poured forth
anecdotes and insights, virtuosically juggling philosophical
references while charming colleagues, rivals, high society in
London and the High Table in Oxford. The philosopher Michael
Oakeshott, with a bit of an edge, spoke of the fluent lecturer as a
``Paganini of the platform.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the midst of discussions of Berlin's main ideas about
liberalism and liberty, nationalism and pluralism, there are always
plenty of anecdotes. Some, in Ignatieff's book, are fairly fresh:
the meeting with Freud (``I see you are not a snob,'' said the
psychoanalyst) or the postcard from Virginia Woolf (``If you knock
on my little gray door, I shall open it''). Others are more
familiar: Winston Churchill inviting the wrong I. Berlin to dinner
and hearing about the writing of ``White Christmas,'' or Berlin
spending a night in Leningrad with the poet Anna Akhmatova in 1945
_ a meeting, she piously believed, that unwittingly unleashed
Stalin's fury and began the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   During Berlin's lifetime there were many who believed that his
great genius for friendship inflated his scholarly reputation; he
wrote no magnum opus and made no systematic attempt to tie together
the arguments made in various lectures and essays. Berlin felt so
himself: ``I live much more on the surface than people suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   But the re-evaluation of Berlin's work by his closest colleagues
stresses how many different strains in Berlin's thought were held
together by force of his presence. The kinds of qualifications now
being raised by his advocates also show how unresolved the issues
were in his lifelong project.
</P>
<P>
   That project was an attempt to redefine political liberalism in
the wake of this century's tyrannies. How, Berlin asked, again and
again, could the great utopian hopes of the 18th and 19th centuries
_ the hopes that helped define liberalism _ have given way to the
20th-century horrors of Nazism and Soviet Communism? (Members of
Berlin's family were sacrificed to both.) These tyrannies, he
argued, were not freak accidents; they rose out of ideas _ quite
distinguished ones, once thought to be innocent.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of simplification (a caution Berlin made again and
again): Berlin argued that modern tyrannies did not develop despite
the triumphs of reason and science; they developed, in large part,
because of them. The ideas that a perfectly just society could be
created and that reason could be its unshakable foundation were the
very ideas that led to communist tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin argued that any unified ideology that promises to
reconcile all contradictions ends up imposing that presumably
enlightened vision on its citizens as an oppressive form of what he
called ``positive'' liberty. A liberal government should recognize
that all values conflict, and all conflicts require negotiation.
The best hope is that there might be liberty without undue
imposition, a form of ``negative'' liberty. Berlin's favorite maxim
was from Immanuel Kant: ``Out of timber so crooked as that from
which man is made, nothing entirely straight can be built.''
</P>
<P>
   These arguments, with their measured vision of tragic
liberalism, have inspired scores of other arguments over the last
half century, some of which pointedly came to the fore at the
recent New York University conference. Mark Lilla, for example, a
professor of political science there, suggested that Berlin went
too far in denigrating the Enlightenment thinkers of the 18th
century. Their emphasis on reason and objective judgment actually
made modern liberalism possible by recognizing humanity's shared
rights and liberties. Instead, he said, Berlin celebrated the
Counter-Enlightenment, thinkers who were ``hostile to the
liberalism Berlin represented.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argued about whether Berlin's pessimism was overblown.
The legal scholar Ronald Dworkin disagreed with Berlin's idea that
all political values _ like notions of equality and liberty _ must
end up in conflict. Yes, Dworkin argued, a man might think that
high taxes, levied for the sake of social equality, were a serious
constraint on his liberty. But that man's notion of liberty should
then be argued with, showing him that there really is no conflict.
Dworkin suggested that there might be a way to create a liberal
society in which all values ``hang together in the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   But these two scholars' criticisms of Berlin _ coming from
vastly different perspectives _ are united in suggesting that in
his opposition to the evils of an imperial rational system, Berlin
went too far. After all, doesn't liberal democracy rely on notions
of reason and consistency to guarantee liberty? The problem, such
criticisms suggest, is that Berlin too sharply outlined a
``negative'' liberalism, a characterization of what liberalism
should not be.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What Berlin also thought liberalism should not do is attempt to
eradicate nationalism: a ``basic human need'' that he was aware of
because of his own commitment to Israel. (David Ben-Gurion asked
him to become director of the foreign office of the fledgling
state.) At New York University, the political scientist Michael
Walzer agreed with Berlin that a ``liberal nationalism'' was
possible, but a number of speakers said that the two were at odds.
</P>
<P>
   The philosopher Richard Wollheim, a friend of Berlin's, went
furthest, arguing that the only rationale justifying Zionism in
particular was anti-Semitism, and the primary reason for
anti-Semitism was the persistent way Jews identified themselves as
Jews. (He was taught, he said, by his German Jewish father ``that
thinking of oneself as a Jew was one way to insure
anti-Semitism.'') This argument suggests that a pluralistic society
demands certain compromises, including the elimination of
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, though, welcomed such differences, treating them as
necessary signs of liberty. His notion of a liberal society was
almost defined by difference and contradiction. He wanted a
pluralistic society that took into account both the invariant
qualities of human nature and varied cultural preferences, that
negotiated conflicting values while causing minimal human
suffering. But the problem is in the details: How can such
pluralism be attained? When should liberty give way to obligation?
When should diversity give way to unity? What is the acceptable
minimum for human welfare and what sacrifices should be demanded to
attain it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The need to choose,'' Berlin wrote, ``to sacrifice some
ultimate values to others, turns out to be a permanent
characteristic of the human predicament.'' But Berlin's arguments
provide no easy guide to deciding which sacrifices should be made
and why and in the name of what authority. In Berlin's portrait,
modern liberalism is inherently ambiguous and potentially
dangerous; alternatives are even less savory.
</P>
<P>
   The ambiguities of liberalism, Ignatieff's biography shows, may
have even haunted Berlin's political life. Berlin first supported
British intervention in the 1956 Suez crisis, then opposed it. He
believed in the domino theory of communist expansion in Southeast
Asia but opposed U.S. entrance into Vietnam and then opposed its
quick exit. He supported New Deal liberalism but worried about
governmental paternalism. In 1970, he compared himself to Turgenev:
``Constantly attacked by both sides, constantly anxious to please
the young and yet, when the crisis comes, unable to commit himself
totally.''
</P>
<P>
   In his famous essay, ``The Hedgehog and the Fox,'' Berlin argued
that Tolstoy was torn between the desire to find a coherent system
in which to believe (the hedgehog's unified vision) and his
stunning awareness of the contradictory ``texture of human life''
(the fox's multiplicity of vision). The conflict, Berlin suggested,
was painful and tragic. A version of it belonged to Berlin as well
_ and perhaps even to the nature of liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin saw very clearly the trauma of liberalism after
totalitarianism's triumphs. He saw less clearly how a liberal
society could negotiate such a world without embracing absolutes,
so the debates over his legacy may continue to grow. His final
offering, after all, was no more hopeful than this: a limit to
human suffering, then struggle and negotiation, uncertain futures
and occasional inconsistencies, much crooked timber and nothing
entirely straight.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 15, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL-GENERAL &LR;  (Will move in the `a' category.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REVIEW (Washington) _ A Capitol existentialist drama:
the public wants the drive to impeach President Clinton to end, as
do most House Democrats and many Republicans. Yet the Republicans
and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have such a strange
synergy that they just cannot seem to stop egging each other on and
on and on. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-SUCCESS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Should the Democrats be
rejoicing in their unexpectedly strong showing in the midterm
elections? If there is one recurring lesson in U.S. politics over
the past decade, it is that success can be dangerous. Politicians
are forever ignoring history and reading meaning into election
results that really aren't that significant, claiming mandates
voters never intended, and than paying a price for it. By Adam
Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-ADVERTISING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Today's ads seem larded with
unbridled cynicism. Liquor ads promote ``responsible drinking.''
Cigarette makers offer not only the surgeon general's warning on
every pack, but also, on company-run web sites, advice on quitting.
Health clubs run ads warning customers not to let a prudent
diet-and-exercise regime give way to anorexia or bulimia. Are these
ads meant to drive away potential customers? Of course not:
advertising agencies just want to talk the jaded, skeptical talk of
the '90s. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   FBI-TERROR-REVIEW (Washington) _ Many senior FBI agents have
misgivings about Attorney General Janet Reno's latest task force,
which is the second time she has ordered a broad investigation into
a conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence. They fear it could
drive the FBI closer to the ill-defined boundary separating
legitimate criminal inquiries from those into political causes and
unpopular ideas. By David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC-HOUSING-REVIEW (Undated) _ The new federal law to revive
the nation's troubled public housing contains a provision that
local officials warn could paralyze that effort: it requires cities
to mix working families with poorer families from project to
project. By Randy Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ALTERNATIVE-MEDICINE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is alternative medicine
getting a free ride? Studies that support the value of
alternative-medicine remedies are seen as less rigorous than those
conducted on conventional drugs and other medical treatments. By
Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  _ (Will move in the `i' category.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-U.S.-REVIEW (Moscow) _ U.S. to Russia: drop dead. Whether
it's tough love, Russia fatigue or a simple capitulation to
domestic political pressure, the United States seems willing for
the first time during the Yeltsin years to let the Russian
government fall flat on its face. By Michael Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-GAYS-REVIEW (London) _ The issue of homosexuality in
British political life has been forced into the open as never
before. In recent weeks, Britain has been informed that three,
possibly four, of the Cabinet ministers it thought were
heterosexual were in fact homosexual (a fifth has been openly gay
for years). By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   DALAILAMA-CHINA-REVIEW (Lhasa) _ Despite years of Chinese
efforts to discredit Tibet's religious leader and years of
persecution of Tibetans who support him, Tibetans still express
such fanatical devotion to the Dalai Lama that China cannot ignore
him. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-POPCULTURE (Beijing) _ A first-hand observation of
the growth of American popular culture and consumerism in China. By
Elisabeth Rosenthal.

 &HT;    TEXAS BALLOON TO TEST NEW APPROACH TO NEAR SPACE TRAVEL
 &HT;    490 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Using a new kind of durable high-altitude balloon,
space scientists plan to send scientific gear into the upper
atmosphere sometime in 2000 and keep it there for three months and
maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   Raven Industries of Sulphur Springs, Texas, will build the first
``Ultra-Long Duration Balloon,'' the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration announced this week. Before launch of the
600-foot-diameter balloon, the company will build and test several
smaller prototypes, NASA said.
</P>
<P>
   The helium-filled, nearly spherical balloon will carry a 1-ton
payload of scientific instruments and support equipment to an
altitude of 120,000 feet (nearly 23 miles) and circle the Earth
four or five times.
</P>
<P>
   After the demonstration flight, such balloons may be built and
launched for as little as $360,000 each, opening new opportunities
for low-cost ``near-space'' ventures, NASA said.
</P>
<P>
   Raven officials said the balloons will be stitched together from
panels of material composed of layered sheets of polyester fabric,
polyester film and polyethylene. The material can bear up under
pressure fluctuations that occur between day and night in the
stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Helium in conventional high-altitude balloons must be released
during daytime flight to avoid bursting the balloons, said NASA
scientist Jack Tueller. That night, the remaining helium shrinks.
</P>
<P>
   To keep from descending, the balloons must carry ballast, which
is ejected at night. The next day, more helium is released, and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   These balloons can remain aloft for a short time, sometimes as
little as three days, before so much helium is vented that they
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Because it can accommodate the pressure changes, the new
material will not require helium venting during daylight flight,
said Mike Smith, an aerospace engineer at the Sulphur Springs
factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This material is lighter and much stronger,'' Smith said. ``It
opens up the equations for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the balloon is to be launched sometime in 2000 from
Alice Springs, Australia. Stratospheric winds will carry it around
the Earth four or five times during a 100-day flight, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it will sink because helium will diffuse between
molecules of the containment material and from around metal
fittings and escape, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helium is an extremely difficult material to contain,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas plant is a division of Raven Industries Inc. of Sioux
Falls, S.D. The company manufactures polyethylene-based films for
food packaging, landfill liners, high-altitude and hot-air balloons
and other products. It also has a plant in Springfield, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Tueller said the new balloons represent a low-cost means
of launching high-resolution optical and infrared telescopes to
search for planets around nearby stars, X-ray and gamma-ray
telescopes to study black holes and cosmic microwave background
surveys to study cosmology and the early universe.

A POIGNANT RIDE BACK FOR VIETNAM VETERANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Francis Love was in Vietnam 31 years ago, he was dodging
bullets as an infantry platoon leader stationed near Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned last winter, the Harvard, Mass., resident
brought his bike along.
</P>
<P>
   Love and a group of about 50 American veterans, as well as
world-class cyclist Greg LeMond, made a 16-day, 1,200-mile trek
from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. Sponsored by World T.E.A.M. Sports
and Sports Illustrated, the trip was documented by the filmmakers
who produced ``Hoop Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting film, ``Vietnam Long Time Coming,'' will be
screened in Boston Monday and televised nationally by NBC Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Love, 55, said he was not an avid cyclist but was intrigued when
he heard about the trip. After being accepted in September 1997, he
went on a training regimen of riding up to eight hours a day once a
week and for an hour and a half three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it turned out that I didn't need to have all that
conditioning,'' said Love. He said the group cycled about 75 miles
a day and had frequent stops for snacks and water _ the
temperatures ranged from 85 to 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was more impressed with the disabled people in
the group; some amputees rode hand cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could do as well or better than anyone,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   He was equally impressed with three-time Tour de France winner
LeMond, whom Love described as ``a down-to-earth guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure (the pace) must have been frustrating to him since
he's in great shape,'' said Love. But, he added, LeMond would offer
a push to a struggling rider going uphill and tried to appreciate
what it was like for the veterans to return to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, a Vietnam vet who rode with the group on the
last day, will be among those at a screening of ``Vietnam Long Time
Coming'' Monday at 6:30 p.m. at the theater in The New England
Financial building at 501 Boylston St. Ticket prices are $150, with
proceeds benefiting World T.E.A.M. Sports, a nonprofit organization
that specializes in sporting events for disabled people.

   &UR; Lance Armstrong &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who battled _ with amazing success _ on his
bike all summer, has not forgotten his battle against cancer. The
two-time Olympian and survivor of testicular cancer last month
awarded two research grants of $50,000 each at the Urologic
Oncology Symposium in Washington. Armstrong, who was stricken with
cancer in 1996, formed the Lance Armstrong Foundation to promote
research and education. One of its keystone events is the Ride for
the Roses weekend in Austin, Texas, which raised $300,000 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who had to sit out last year while he underwent
chemotherapy, got back on his bike with a vengeance this year. He
won the Tour of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz stage race in
Germany, and the Cascade Classic in Bend, Ore. He wrapped up the
season in October with a fourth-place finish in both the road race
and time trial at the world championships.

French Cofidis team last year and placed 17th in the Tour de
France. His outstanding finish was overshadowed by fellow American
and teammate  &UR; Bobby Julich's  &LR; third-place finish. The Postal
Service team also added  &UR; Julian Dean &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 23, the national US pro
criterium champion this season, who had ridden for the Mercury
team. Other newcomers are  &UR; Dylan Casey  &LR; of New Zealand,  &UR; Glenn
Magnusson  &LR; of Sweden, and  &UR; Frank Hoj  &LR; of Denmark.

MAN'S LOVE OF DRIVING RACKS UP $29,000 IN TRAFFIC CITATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle

<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Driven to drive, Dieneso Alvarez bought his first
car when he was 10.
</P>
<P>
   He got his first ticket when he was 12.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several years, there would be more cars and more
tickets until, at age 16, Alvarez had racked up a staggering
$29,000 in unpaid traffic citations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some guys whose cases take up several file folders
down at municipal court,'' said Fort Worth police Officer Larry
Hatten. ``Dieneso's took up an entire shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after working 4,700 hours in community service _ almost 600
working days spent painting over graffiti on Fort Worth's south
side _ Alvarez has cleared those fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be some kind of record,'' said Hatten, who heads the
police department's graffiti abatement program.
</P>
<P>
   And, at age 20, Alvarez has finally obtained the one thing he
has needed most for the past decade, a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   It's a license that is currently suspended, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started when I was a little kid,'' said Alvarez. ``From
the first time I can remember getting in a car I wanted to drive
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Determined to own one, he watched his older relatives closely as
they drove, memorizing the procedure. Then, he hoarded his small
change for years until one day in 1988 when he saw a 1965 Chevrolet
station wagon with a ``For Sale'' sign pull into a convenience
store parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez coaxed an older cousin into haggling with the owner and,
in a few minutes, he had bought his first vehicle for $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy just handed over the title and I never even signed
it,'' said Alvarez. ``I got in and drove it home and parked it down
the street from my house so my mother wouldn't see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove it around for the next two years and I never hit
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He drove so often without being stopped that he became
complacent. Then, at age 12, he was pulled over by police while
driving with an older cousin in his mother's car. He received
citations for driving with no license and no seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They towed the car home and told my mother and, man, did I get
in trouble,'' said Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   The experience taught Alvarez a valuable lesson: He might be
punished by his mother, but the city wasn't doing anything about
those tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts don't issue warrants for under-aged drivers,''
explained Hatten. ``It didn't matter how many tickets he got, he
wouldn't be picked up until he was an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Alvarez was a competent mechanic, working part
time for an uncle who owned a paint and body shop. He used his
skills to refurbish the station wagon and sell it for a profit.
</P>
<P>
   He did the same with a series of other cars until, at age 15, he
obtained his ultimate vehicle, a 1978 Buick Regal that he
transformed into a convertible by slicing off the top with a
cutting torch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great car,'' said Alvarez. ``I had it painted bright
red-orange metal flake. I had one of those illegal, chrome-plated
welded-chain steering wheels and hydraulic shocks so it would
bounce up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It roared, man, and I had orange neon lights hooked up under
the chassis so the whole thing glowed in the dark. Then I installed
speakers that would make the whole car shake when I turned the
volume up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I got arrested in it I was driving down the
street with a couple of girls standing up, dancing in the back
seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatten said, ``The car might as well have had a sign on it that
said, `Stop Me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez was stopped repeatedly and ticketed as often. He knew he
was accumulating a string of violations and, at 16, he decided to
go to court on his own and face the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I had about $10,000 worth,'' he said. ``When I got
there and they told me it was more than $20,000, I almost croaked.
Then they told me I couldn't do anything about them until I was
17.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez thought about those tickets as he drove home from court,
drove to work, drove to school and continued driving and
accumulating tickets for another year.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 17 he returned to court, pleaded guilty and was
placed in the community service program where he met Hatten.
</P>
<P>
   ``He acted like a street kid at first,'' said Hatten. ``The more
I worked with him, though, the more I could tell he was really a
good kid and the better he acted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent practically every day together, painting out
graffiti. Dieneso has spent his last two birthdays with me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, said Hatten, Alvarez has become so experienced
with traffic court that he now acts as a mentor for other youths
from his neighborhood who have multiple traffic violations, walking
them through the process of turning themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   He also has become a fixture in the south side police station
where Hatten works. He often helps the officer clean up graffiti
even when it does not apply to his community service. He joins
Hatten on his patrols and recently helped him chase a group of
juveniles they caught painting gang insignia on a building.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in a beating for Alvarez when gang members spotted
him at a convenience store one night. Alvarez came away with a sore
jaw and a knot on his forehead, but no less resolved to keep
helping Hatten.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a determined guy,'' said the policeman. ``He had trouble
with the written part of his test for his driver's license, but he
kept studying for it until he got it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he finally got his license last August, all the municipal
judges wanted copies to hang on their walls.''
</P>
<P>
   That license was immediately suspended, however, because Alvarez
still owed a few unpaid fines. Not allowing that to stand in his
way, Alvarez drove just as he always has and was involved in a
minor accident on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that they got him for driving with a suspended
license and put him in jail,'' said Hatten. ``If he hadn't had a
license at all, in all likelihood they would have just ticketed him
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez admitted that the two nights he spent in jail were
unpleasant, but they haven't deterred him. Most days he drives one
of his four vehicles from his girlfriend's apartment to his
mother's home, parks it and walks the few blocks to the south side
station to work with Hatten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police over here all know me and they don't stop me,''
said Alvarez. ``Still, I don't just park in the police station
parking lot and force them.''
</P>
<P>
   With his fines all but erased, Alvarez hopes to secure a
full-time job soon, get his driver's license reinstated and buy the
liability insurance to go with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I plan on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, maybe I won't get any more tickets.'' &QL;

for the Kansas State players, the game is important for two
reasons. The Wildcats have played a weak schedule this season and
have been hurt by the soft schedule in the BCS standings. A victory
over Nebraska would help in their run for a possible national
championship. Also, they have a chance to end a frustrating 29-game

<P>
   RICKY WILLIAMS ADVISORY
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas running back Ricky Williams needs 204 yards
to break the NCAA rushing record. His next chance to set a new mark
will come Saturday against Texas Tech in Lubbock (6 p.m. CST
kickoff). If he breaks the record in that game, the Austin
American-Statesman will move the following stories for use in
papers of Sunday, Nov. 15. If he does not break the record, the
stories will be held and rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   .RICKYBEST _ A story that puts into perspective just what Ricky
Williams has achieved in passing the previous NCAA rushing record
of 6,082 yards previously held by former Pittsburgh running back
Tony Dorsett of Pitt, who played professionally for the Dallas
Cowboys. How many other great running backs didn't reach that
number and how durable he had to be. Story will invclude comments
from Mack Brown, Darrell Royal and others. (Wangrin, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   HEISMAN _ Setting the NCAA rushing record almost assures
Williams of winning the Heisman Trophy. How could voters not give
it to the all-time rusher? Well, it
</P>
<P>
   used to happen. Lists of winners. Some of the noteable rushing
leaders who do not win the Heisman. (Maher, Austin
American-Statesman). WITH LIST
</P>
<P>
   SENIOR _ Why did Williams decide to come back for his senior
year? He could have gone in the NFL draft last year and would have
been a first-round pick. He gambled that he wouldn't get hurt and
blow it all (except the Lloyd's of London policy) or have a
disappointing year and drop in the draft (which might have left him
playing for the Philadelphia Phillies). But Ricky guessed right and
this has worked out for him. He came back because he wanted the
Dorsett record and the Heisman. And he has checks coming in from
the Phillies now. Was it all about yardage? Or did he want to get
closer to a degree? (Halliburton, Austin American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   DRAFT _ Cleveland TV stations are doing interviews with Ricky.
The Cleveland Browns are running the character checks. Looks like
they want to use their No. 1 pick in the draft on Ricky. How much
money would that mean? Do the Browns need his kind of running back?
When Tony Dorsett set the rushing record, the Cowboys didn't have
the No. 1 pick. But they traded to get him. Are there other teams
out there wanting Ricky badly enough to do some last-minute
war-room trading? We'll ask the experts. (Cantu, Austin
American-Statesman). WITH GRAPHIC (of all his records set, pending,
tied and yet to come).

   RECRUITING SPECIAL
</P>
<P>
   RECRUITING-PHENOM _ NITRO, W. VA. _ J.R. House is the most
prolific passer in high school history, breaking records once held
by Tim Couch. But yards and completions are not the only
mind-boggling numbers posted by the senior quarterback. He also may
have the record for transfers between two schools. House plays
football each fall in West Virginia, where his father owns an auto
dealership. He plays baseball each spring in Florida, where his
father owns a bar/restaurant. The yearly moves have caused
controversy in both states, but not lessened House's
accomplishments. He will likely sign to play college football at
West Virginia or Georgia, and is expected to be an early-round
baseball draft pick. House and his father has been close to Georgia
coach Jim Donnan since his days at Marshall. (Curtright, Atlanta

Journal-Constitution). 13.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-NFL-MINDSET _ It can be one of the most unsettling mindsets
in sports: How do you get over the hump when an another team has

49ers have dominated Atlanta forever, and the Falcons know it.

   UTOPIA, Texas _ A morning breeze drifts down the blue hills, and
a lone duck waddles along a dirt road. Somewhere near, a dog barks.
</P>
<P>
   Another barks back and then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, 38
dogs come to life _ yipping, yapping, yelping _ and the duck
plunges into the weeds.
</P>
<P>
   The commotion can only mean one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Kinky's here!
</P>
<P>
   Kinky is Kinky Friedman, the cowboy smart-aleck who used to be a
hippie songwriter and is now a hippie mystery writer with a side
business of rescuing ugly dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Kinky saved his first animal in 1979 when he rescued a cat from
a shoe box in Chinatown, but he didn't get nonprofit status until
spring. That came after he smooth-talked his buddy Willie Nelson
and his pal former Gov. Ann Richards into helping him form a board
of directors for the Utopia Animal Rescue Ranch. Richards told
Kinky, ``I hope this isn't something I'm going to regret for the
rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at the ranch, 90 miles west of San Antonio, the dogs behind
the chain-link fence step on each other to get attention. Here,
they bark and howl and whine when company comes. Here in the Texas
Hill Country, the motto is simple:
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the dogs nobody wants. If they have a problem, that's
not a problem for us.''
</P>
<P>
   For a stray, it's not a bad place to be. There are blue hills
and dirt roads and goats grazing. Here, a stray gets one square
meal a day, all the fresh water he can lick from a silver pipe, and
plenty of canine companionship. The ranch is awash in country music
piped in from a nearby shed. It's the only radio station you get in
Utopia.
</P>
<P>
   Patsy Cline seems to like it here. She's a cattle mutt who was
brought back because her owner said she didn't bark. (She does.)
She's here with Cat _ he's part Catahoula _ who was dropped off at
the pound because he ate his owner's Social Security check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' Kinky said. ``There are a lot more animals
worth liking than people.''
</P>
<P>
   The fence went up in August; the dogs arrived in September. The
first rescue wasn't dramatic. Kinky, ``Cousin Nancy'' Parker, and
Kinky's sister piled into Cousin Nancy's pickup, ``Trigger,'' drove
to the Hondo, Texas, shelter and said, ``We'll take 'em. All of
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the day was over, they filled up Dr. Hoegemeyer's
veterinary clinic with 41 dogs, every one of them only hours away
from a fatal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the ranch, Nancy and Tony Simons, friends of Kinky who
got talked into running the ranch stared at the dogs. This is how
they named them:
</P>
<P>
   Red dog, we'll call you Red.
</P>
<P>
   Other red dog, you'll be Fred.
</P>
<P>
   Third red dog, we'll name you Lucille Ball.
</P>
<P>
   And on it went: There is Loretta (for Lynn); Carmella (she's
caramel-colored); Yoda (he's short and fat); and Little Bear (who
has lots of hair).
</P>
<P>
   Tony and Nancy separated the dogs by size _ small, medium and
large. The small and medium share the central pen with the picnic
table. Large dogs get the big run that stretches back behind the
single-wide trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Troublemakers get their own quarters, in the far pens under the
cedar trees, where each cage is named in honor of Kinky's friends.
</P>
<P>
   There's Fred the dog, who was separated because of heartworms,
in the Lamar Smith pen. There's Hearty, an Australian cattle dog
mix whose name is short for heartworms. He's in solitary
confinement in the Ann Richards pen because he's bad about jumping
up on people. In the Willie Nelson pen, there's Molly the ring-eyed
dog, who growls at people.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are Spanky and Jack, the escape artists who got their
own pen (with special wire netting around the top), and down at the
end are Max the fighter, and Prissy, his mongrel moll.
</P>
<P>
   Cousin Nancy is trying to explain how everything works, but
she's having to yell because Mr. Magoo, Kinky's Labrador retriever
mutt, is taunting the other dogs. It seems he has a tennis ball,
and they do not.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Nancy and Tony do the feeding. It takes 40 minutes and 55 pounds
of Pedigree. They do the daily walks, and every afternoon, Nancy
sets up ``Cousin Nancy's Beauty Parlor,'' a grooming session atop
the picnic table.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy and Tony live in the trailer that sits beside the dog pens
and overlooks the pond where the duck has resurfaced. Of course,
Nancy is not really Kinky's cousin. She's a friend from the 1970s,
when he was a singer-songwriter and she embroidered hats and
jackets for Austin bands.
</P>
<P>
   She knows that beneath the cigar-breathing, dirty-talking
demeanor is a man with a weak spot for the downtrodden. She and
Kinky did their first rescue together a few years back:
</P>
<P>
   Kinky found a kitten on the side of the road. A hunter had shot
it in the leg. It hissed when Kinky leaned in for a closer look.
Well, Kinky picked it up anyway and brought it to the vet, who gave
the kitten two blood transfusions and amputated the leg. Then
Cousin Nancy took over, at Kinky's request, because he had to leave
on a book-signing tour. She named the three-legged cat Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   That, Cousin Nancy says, tells you where Kinky is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   If Kinky cared about being part of a trend, which he doesn't,
he'd have this to say, too:
</P>
<P>
   Compassionate people put down so many dogs and cats last year _
5 million nationwide _ that a bumper crop of alternative
organizations is springing up to rescue animals from the rescue
shelters. And his is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of dogs and cats ``put down,'' ``put to
sleep,'' whatever you call it, has dropped in recent years, the
numbers are still sickening. There were 750,000 in Texas in 1997
(39,000 in Fort Worth alone).
</P>
<P>
   True, Americans are waiting until they are older and more
settled to get a pet, and true, 56 percent get their pets from
shelters, and true, trends are encouraging in other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But in the South and Southwest, little has changed. In the Hill
Country, dogs are still dumped on two-lane roads, and litters of
mewing kittens are still abandoned in ditches, and pounds can only
keep them so long.
</P>
<P>
   Kinky and his celebrity friends didn't need statistics to tell
them that.
</P>
<P>
   Kinky cajoled a rich friend, beauty supplier John McCall, into
paying for 1,000 feet of chain-link fence. He shamed some other
rich friends into giving him more money, and he persuaded friend
Adri Brown to start a cat shelter four miles down the road. She
named the first rescued cat after him. The Kinkster is a 13-pounder
who never shuts up.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's his friend Copper Love. He talked her into helping
make the dogs adoptable. She's an animal trainer who worked in
Europe but retired in Kerrville. Copper is working in the Ann
Richards pen, soothing Hearty by rubbing his teeth. She's calming
him so they can work out his issues with jumping.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Kinky is schmoozing friend and country musician
Dwight Yoakam, aiming to get a benefit concert out of him before
long.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to find homes for every misfit here. Cousin Nancy
and Tony interview adoptive parents. They have a clause in the
contract that says they can repossess the dog if they get wind of
abuse or neglect. The contract also requires the new owner to
return the dog before setting it free or taking it to a pound.
</P>
<P>
   When one leaves, and Nancy always cries when one does, there's a
vacancy for another to be spared. So far, Kinky has talked 15 of
his friends into adopting. He's as rabid as a used-car salesman,
ready to talk you into adopting a dog.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a shell game of plugging holes without fixing the
leak, but what matters here is that the mutt with the black spots
didn't die.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz the runt is still alive. So is Alice the golden retriever
and Rosco, the boxer puppy whose mother got hit by a car. All that
matters here is that a dog named Red and another named Fred and
another named Lucille Ball got a second chance. This is Utopia,
after all.
</P>

Animal Rescue Ranch at (830) 966-2495.

PARIS: comfortably on board. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This cautionary tale doesn't extend to the older, seedier but
infinitely more charming nonexpress trains. If you have a rail
pass, simply hop on board, grab a seat and go.
</P>
<P>
   And in Switzerland and Germany, there were few problems, as the
trains rarely were full.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, we were more frenzied than most travelers. We
touched seven Western European countries _ Belgium, France,
Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands _ in a
two-week period. That's more rules and more confusion than most
rail travelers will encounter.
</P>
<P>
   But the pluses of rail passes are supposed to be not only cost
but ease. They're intended to keep you out of those lines with the
rude Parisian rail clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Seat reservations can be made in the United States _ although it
costs money and you lose the ability to jump on a train at a
moment's notice. It is something worth considering if long lines
hack you off.
</P>
<P>
   They can also be made in Europe. Our first ones were a piece of
cake in Brussels. You may still have to pay supplements for the
high-speed trains.
</P>
<P>
   If I had it to do again, I would make advance seat reservations
for TGV trains within France and would consider it for
top-of-the-line trains in other countries during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The passes are still a good deal for train travelers covering a
lot of ground, and the new trains are a wonderful way to travel.
Just don't allow yourself to be at the mercy of a Parisian ticket
clerk as the last train pulls out of the station.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   HOW WE DID IT: A Europass is basically a scaled-down,
more-focused version of the Eurail pass. Where a Eurail pass covers
all of Western Europe, the basic Europass grants five days of
first-class train travel in five of Europe's most popular countries
(France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Spain) for $326 per
person. If two people are traveling together, the second person
gets 40 percent off. You can add as many as five more travel days
at $67 per day for two travelers or $42 for a solo traveler. You
can also add so-called associate countries for an additional $60
per person. Add two countries and it costs $90, three $110 and four
$120. (We added Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, which
under the pass counted as one country.) If you are traveling within
one country or planning to trek in a relatively small area,
individual train tickets or a one-country rail pass may be a better
idea. However, if your trip will cover a number of rail miles, the
Europass will easily pay for itself. For example, a one-way
second-class train ticket from Brussels, where we started our trip,
to Rome, the southern-most point in our travels, would cost $254
per person. Since we went from Brussels to Rome and back to
Amsterdam, the Europass easily paid for itself and gave us
first-class travel to boot. It gave us many of the same extras as
the Eurail pass, such as free travel on ferry crossings and river
cruise lines. We were able to float down a castle-strewn stretch of
the Rhine River north of Frankfurt for free. To determine whether a
rail pass is a good idea, check Rail Europe's Web site
(www.raileurope.com). The Web site allows customers to plug in rail
destinations and see what an individual ticket would cost vs. a
rail pass. It also includes information about other passes and
rail//drive combinations. Don't forget, a Europass covers most seat
reservations and supplements but not all. High-speed trains such as
the French-run TGV, Thayls (that runs between Amsterdam and Paris),
the Italian-run Cisalpino and Pendolino and various Intercity
trains throughout Europe have extra charges.

TRAIN TYRANTS PUT A MEAN FRENCH TWIST ON PARIS STAY
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Here I was, making mental notes to tell everyone back
home about the nice folks in Paris, and suddenly, the stereotypical
rude Parisian reared his ugly head.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the ticket window in the Gare de Lyon train station, a
ticket clerk was ruining what had been a wonderful stay in the City
of Light. Our problem: seat reservations.
</P>
<P>
   We had a Europass for two, the five-country pass that gives the
illusion of carefree travel and usually delivers. But not in
France, where all the high-speed TGV trains required a seat
reservation and conductors warned us against boarding without one.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, it sounds minor _ until you're stuck with rude clerks
gleefully mocking you behind the ticket counter minutes before the
last trains depart for the evening. Or at least that's how it
seemed to this frustrated, suddenly paranoid non-French-speaking
American tourist.
</P>
<P>
   Images of Monty Python skits with a Frenchman played by John
Cleese hurling insults at King Arthur's men twirled through my head
as we tried to ascertain which intricate steps were required to
obtain a seat reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Our French-English phrase book didn't help. The clerks knew what
we wanted but insisted we were in the wrong line. After 20 or so
minutes in the next line, that clerk would direct us in a
Keystone-Coplike-fashion back to the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   This procedure went on for close to three hours as other
English-speaking tourists _ from both the States and Great Britain
_ were also met with alternating doses of rudeness and
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as the final trains were leaving for the night, that
last clerk left at the ticket counter grudgingly granted us seat
reservations to Grenoble in the French Alps. It wasn't our original
destination of the French Riviera, but, hey, who's complaining. At
this point, we would have settled for anything.
</P>
<P>
   After several months of reflection, I realize we could have
handled this situation with a little preparation. My downfall was
thinking that rail travel had stayed the same in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In college, I had used the Eurail pass _ the king of all rail
passes, which gives unlimited train travel across Western Europe _
and become accustomed to hopping on a train at a moment's notice. A
year before this most recent trip, my wife, Laura, and I had done
the same thing with an Italian rail pass and had no trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. European rail travel is still a marvel to a
car-mad American. Hop from one European capital to another while
the countryside rolls by. View the Swiss Alps, a Tuscan hill town
or the Mediterranean Sea while chatting with a retired grandfather
about his life in the hills above Naples. It sure beats antiseptic
air travel.
</P>
<P>
   And some of these new high-speed train rides come complete with
free drinks, exotic candy and headphones with music ranging from
Sinatra to Italian polkas (that was, naturally, on an Italian
train.)
</P>
<P>
   But rail passes do come with a hitch: Just as languages and
currencies multiply as you cross borders in Western Europe, so do
the dos and don'ts of train travel.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, it was one story. In Venice, another.
</P>
<P>
   And the rules weren't always logical. They seemed to follow the
mores of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Switzerland and Germany, rules were rules. In Italy,
well, everything seemed negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   With the scars of Paris only few days old, we dutifully lined up
in the Venice train station for seat reservations on the high-speed
Eurostar _ the Italian one, not the more well-known Chunnel train
that goes between London and Paris. After we waited in line several
minutes, the ticket clerk shrugged and told us there were no more
seats available.
</P>
<P>
   Out of luck? No way.
</P>
<P>
   We were told to arrive at our train a half-hour ahead of time
and the conductor would find us seats _ maybe.
</P>
<P>
   So there we were, with about 30 other confused tourists
thrusting our passes and tickets at the conductor in a frantic game
of reservations roulette. Ten minutes before departure, we were all
comfortably on board.

   In college, I had used the Eurail pass _ the king of all rail
passes, which gives unlimited train travel across Western Europe _
and become accustomed to hopping on a train at a moment's notice. A
year before this most recent trip, my wife, Laura, and I had done
the same thing with an Italian rail pass and had no trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. European rail travel is still a marvel to a
car-mad American. Hop from one European capital to another while
the countryside rolls by. View the Swiss Alps, a Tuscan hill town
or the Mediterranean Sea while chatting with a retired grandfather
about his life in the hills above Naples. It sure beats antiseptic
air travel.
</P>
<P>
   And some of these new high-speed train rides come complete with
free drinks, exotic candy and headphones with music ranging from
Sinatra to Italian polkas (that was, naturally, on an Italian
train.)
</P>
<P>
   But rail passes do come with a hitch: Just as languages and
currencies multiply as you cross borders in Western Europe, so do
the dos and don'ts of train travel.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, it was one story. In Venice, another.
</P>
<P>
   And the rules weren't always logical. They seemed to follow the
mores of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Switzerland and Germany, rules were rules. In Italy,
well, everything seemed negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   With the scars of Paris only few days old, we dutifully lined up
in the Venice train station for seat reservations on the high-speed
Eurostar _ the Italian one, not the more well-known Chunnel train
that goes between London and Paris. After we waited in line several
minutes, the ticket clerk shrugged and told us there were no more
seats available.
</P>
<P>
   Out of luck? No way.
</P>
<P>
   We were told to arrive at our train a half-hour ahead of time
and the conductor would find us seats _ maybe.
</P>
<P>
   So there we were, with about 30 other confused tourists
thrusting our passes and tickets at the conductor in a frantic game
of reservations roulette. Ten minutes before departure, we were all
comfortably on board.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   This cautionary tale doesn't extend to the older, seedier but
infinitely more charming nonexpress trains. If you have a rail
pass, simply hop on board, grab a seat and go.
</P>
<P>
   And in Switzerland and Germany, there were few problems, as the
trains rarely were full.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, we were more frenzied than most travelers. We
touched seven Western European countries _ Belgium, France,
Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands _ in a
two-week period. That's more rules and more confusion than most
rail travelers will encounter.
</P>
<P>
   But the pluses of rail passes are supposed to be not only cost
but ease. They're intended to keep you out of those lines with the
rude Parisian rail clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Seat reservations can be made in the United States _ although it
costs money and you lose the ability to jump on a train at a
moment's notice. It is something worth considering if long lines
hack you off.
</P>
<P>
   They can also be made in Europe. Our first ones were a piece of
cake in Brussels. You may still have to pay supplements for the
high-speed trains.
</P>
<P>
   If I had it to do again, I would make advance seat reservations
for TGV trains within France and would consider it for
top-of-the-line trains in other countries during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The passes are still a good deal for train travelers covering a
lot of ground, and the new trains are a wonderful way to travel.
Just don't allow yourself to be at the mercy of a Parisian ticket
clerk as the last train pulls out of the station.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   HOW WE DID IT: A Europass is basically a scaled-down,
more-focused version of the Eurail pass. Where a Eurail pass covers
all of Western Europe, the basic Europass grants five days of
first-class train travel in five of Europe's most popular countries
(France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Spain) for $326 per
person. If two people are traveling together, the second person
gets 40 percent off. You can add as many as five more travel days
at $67 per day for two travelers or $42 for a solo traveler. You
can also add so-called associate countries for an additional $60
per person. Add two countries and it costs $90, three $110 and four
$120. (We added Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, which
under the pass counted as one country.) If you are traveling within
one country or planning to trek in a relatively small area,
individual train tickets or a one-country rail pass may be a better
idea. However, if your trip will cover a number of rail miles, the
Europass will easily pay for itself. For example, a one-way
second-class train ticket from Brussels, where we started our trip,
to Rome, the southern-most point in our travels, would cost $254
per person. Since we went from Brussels to Rome and back to
Amsterdam, the Europass easily paid for itself and gave us
first-class travel to boot. It gave us many of the same extras as
the Eurail pass, such as free travel on ferry crossings and river
cruise lines. We were able to float down a castle-strewn stretch of
the Rhine River north of Frankfurt for free. To determine whether a
rail pass is a good idea, check Rail Europe's Web site
(www.raileurope.com). The Web site allows customers to plug in rail
destinations and see what an individual ticket would cost vs. a
rail pass. It also includes information about other passes and
rail//drive combinations. Don't forget, a Europass covers most seat
reservations and supplements but not all. High-speed trains such as
the French-run TGV, Thayls (that runs between Amsterdam and Paris),
the Italian-run Cisalpino and Pendolino and various Intercity
trains throughout Europe have extra charges.

DEAN JOHNSON: LIFE ON THE MARGINS OF SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 15) 
(mk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dean Johnson, lead singer of the Velvet Mafia,
sauntered into Bowery Bar on Tuesday night, brushed past Isaac
Mizrahi and ran a gauntlet of kisses from doormen, friends and
people he said he did not know at all. Despite the outpouring of
affection, Johnson looked chagrined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being recognized makes me feel panicked,'' he said. The
musician, 37, should be used to the attention. While he has yet to
achieve the commercial appeal of, say, Marilyn Manson, he has been
a downtown fixture since the early '80s. Below 14th Street, the
bald, 6-foot-6 cross-dressing neo-glam rocker is pretty much
impossible not to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Still, surrounded by the conventionally handsome, well-chiseled
partiers at Beige, Bowery Bar's weekly party for gay men, Johnson
confessed to feeling out of his element. He elbowed his way through
the muscled throng and sought refuge in a semicircular booth that
afforded an unobstructed view of the go-go boys dancing on raised
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too old for this,'' he groaned, tossing back a shot of
Cuervo, chased by a swig of Heineken. His friends, most of them
from the old days when Johnson used to step out in high heels to
clubs like Area, agreed. These days, when Johnson goes out, he's
more likely to wear sweat pants, a black T-shirt and combat boots.
``I don't do drag unless I'm getting paid,'' he said, his baritone
cutting through the din. ``Most of the time, I dress like a
shlub.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then a man squeezed by his chair and shouted, ``I used to
know you 15 years ago.'' Johnson rolled his eyes and said, ``You're
dating yourself.'' He doesn't need reminders of how long he has
been toiling on the margins of success. ``At this point in my life,
I should have a house or something, not some tiny studio with three
cats,'' said Johnson, who gets by with gigs at CBGB and sales of
his latest CD, ``We Know Where You Live.''
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, Johnson had had enough and fled the club. But
instead of seeking solace at home with his kitties, he headed
westward to Jackie 60, the gender-bending dance club on Washington
Street. ``These are my people,'' he said, walking through the door.
The evening's theme was ``Dental Domination,'' and on stage were a
pair of dancers dressed as sadistic hygienists. Johnson, who
occasionally performs at Jackie 60, seemed to know just about
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Fortified by free drinks, Johnson settled in with his friends
and began to relax. Tina Paul, a photographer, talked about the
first time she glimpsed Johnson, in the cult film ``Mondo New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible how little he's aged,'' she said, snapping a
few pictures of him. Johnson said he thought clubbing kept him
looking young. ``I guess it helps you avoid the sunlight,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Deirdre Keaveney, an artist, and her fiance, Ron Bloodsucker,
lead singer of ``Bloodsuckers From Outer Space,'' reminisced about
their club-hopping nights which often ended at dawn. Bloodsucker,
who wore a stetson and Ziggy Stardust makeup, shook his head. ``I
just don't have the energy anymore,'' he said. Johnson agreed, even
as he looked at his watch, noticed that it was nearly 2 and ordered
another drink.

WHY DO CHIP MAKERS LOOK SO CHIPPER?  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (af) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After three tough years, it seems that things are looking up in
Chip Land.
</P>
<P>
   The first bit of good news came from the industry bellwether
Intel, which said late Tuesday that fourth-quarter sales and gross
profit margins would be better than it had expected.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the Semiconductor Industry Association predicted
that sales next year would increase by more than 9 percent from
1998 levels.
</P>
<P>
   Since the current year will likely see industry sales decline by
nearly 11 percent from 1997, the worst year-to-year performance in
more than a decade, it is hard to characterize the association's
forecast as wildly bullish.
</P>
<P>
   Still, chip stocks, like Advanced Micro Devices, Micron
Technology and Altera, went on a tear last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Bohn, director of semiconductor research at Dataquest in San
Jose, Calif., talked about the issues facing investors, and the
industry, in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. This year was a tough one for the business. How have
companies addressed the problems that confronted them?
</P>
<P>
   A. We think the industry made two major adjustments this year.
</P>
<P>
   First, personal-computer manufacturers have adopted better
inventory management, moving them toward just-in-time inventory
techniques. Going forward, the industry now knows that inventories
at PC manufacturers will be lean.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the industry has adjusted pretty well to the
sub-$1,000-priced personal computer, and won't have to make that
adjustment again.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Presumably, some companies have fared better at facing these
challenges than others. In your view, which companies look the
strongest coming out of this?
</P>
<P>
   A. We don't talk about individual companies, but the big names
have been through the worst, and are pretty sound.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should limit themselves to one company in each of the
various groups within the industry. But there are going to be lots
of ups and downs, and there are no sure things.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Expectations of a good holiday selling season seem to be the
launching pad for optimism about next year. Are there good reasons
to expect the positive momentum to continue in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   A. Right now, unit shipments look good, D-RAM (dynamic random
access memory) chip pricing has improved and microprocessors look
good. In terms of personal-computer consumption and cell phone
production, Europe looks good. And the United States looks OK in
terms of PC consumption and digital electronics.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the consumer market, other regions of the world do
not look so good. We still have concerns about Japan and the rest
of Asia, which collectively were responsible for about 45 percent
of the $138 billion in worldwide revenues generated by the industry
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of Asia, like Indonesia, are not that important as
semiconductor consumers. But countries like Korea, Taiwan and
Singapore, which are important, still have problems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the outlook for Japan is not really positive. The
banking crisis there will probably limit consumption.
</P>
<P>
   The one potential bright spot is China, which looks like it will
remain a strong buyer of personal computers and communications
equipment. If that forecast holds, it will be good news.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Aside from worries about regional weakness, what are the
other issues confronting the industry in 1999 and beyond?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Internet is a big top-level issue, one that is positive
for manufacturers, especially communication semiconductor makers,
and companies building systems or servers that will facilitate the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the other unanswered question revolves around the
Year 2000 problem. We are not sure what the impact of Y2K will be,
if it will slow down purchases. I think we will know the answer to
that by the middle of next year. By then, we will see if companies
are confident enough about it to be buying new personal computers
and communication systems, or if they will postpone those
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Despite your cautious optimism about the business, the last
few years must have done some damage to the industry. Do you see
consolidation in the business?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but it will be difficult for investors to play it.
Acquisitions usually involve buying a big factory or a division
that gets sold off, and it is difficult for investors to determine
what those parts are worth to a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   But there is definitely going to be some consolidation. Lots of
companies lost lots of money in their semiconductor businesses,
particularly in their memory business. You will see more of what
Texas Instruments did earlier this year, when it sold its memory
business to Micron Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The microprocessor businesses, like Intel and Advanced Micro
Devices, will continue to stand alone.

UTOPIA, Texas: they do not. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nancy and Tony do the feeding. It takes 40 minutes and 55 pounds
of Pedigree. They do the daily walks, and every afternoon, Nancy
sets up ``Cousin Nancy's Beauty Parlor,'' a grooming session atop
the picnic table.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy and Tony live in the trailer that sits beside the dog pens
and overlooks the pond where the duck has resurfaced. Of course,
Nancy is not really Kinky's cousin. She's a friend from the 1970s,
when he was a singer-songwriter and she embroidered hats and
jackets for Austin bands.
</P>
<P>
   She knows that beneath the cigar-breathing, dirty-talking
demeanor is a man with a weak spot for the downtrodden. She and
Kinky did their first rescue together a few years back:
</P>
<P>
   Kinky found a kitten on the side of the road. A hunter had shot
it in the leg. It hissed when Kinky leaned in for a closer look.
Well, Kinky picked it up anyway and brought it to the vet, who gave
the kitten two blood transfusions and amputated the leg. Then
Cousin Nancy took over, at Kinky's request, because he had to leave
on a book-signing tour. She named the three-legged cat Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   That, Cousin Nancy says, tells you where Kinky is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   If Kinky cared about being part of a trend, which he doesn't,
he'd have this to say, too:
</P>
<P>
   Compassionate people put down so many dogs and cats last year _
5 million nationwide _ that a bumper crop of alternative
organizations is springing up to rescue animals from the rescue
shelters. And his is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of dogs and cats ``put down,'' ``put to
sleep,'' whatever you call it, has dropped in recent years, the
numbers are still sickening. There were 750,000 in Texas in 1997
(39,000 in Fort Worth alone).
</P>
<P>
   True, Americans are waiting until they are older and more
settled to get a pet, and true, 56 percent get their pets from
shelters, and true, trends are encouraging in other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But in the South and Southwest, little has changed. In the Hill
Country, dogs are still dumped on two-lane roads, and litters of
mewing kittens are still abandoned in ditches, and pounds can only
keep them so long.
</P>
<P>
   Kinky and his celebrity friends didn't need statistics to tell
them that.
</P>
<P>
   Kinky cajoled a rich friend, beauty supplier John McCall, into
paying for 1,000 feet of chain-link fence. He shamed some other
rich friends into giving him more money, and he persuaded friend
Adri Brown to start a cat shelter four miles down the road. She
named the first rescued cat after him. The Kinkster is a 13-pounder
who never shuts up.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's his friend Copper Love. He talked her into helping
make the dogs adoptable. She's an animal trainer who worked in
Europe but retired in Kerrville. Copper is working in the Ann
Richards pen, soothing Hearty by rubbing his teeth. She's calming
him so they can work out his issues with jumping.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Kinky is schmoozing friend and country musician
Dwight Yoakam, aiming to get a benefit concert out of him before
long.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to find homes for every misfit here. Cousin Nancy
and Tony interview adoptive parents. They have a clause in the
contract that says they can repossess the dog if they get wind of
abuse or neglect. The contract also requires the new owner to
return the dog before setting it free or taking it to a pound.
</P>
<P>
   When one leaves, and Nancy always cries when one does, there's a
vacancy for another to be spared. So far, Kinky has talked 15 of
his friends into adopting. He's as rabid as a used-car salesman,
ready to talk you into adopting a dog.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a shell game of plugging holes without fixing the
leak, but what matters here is that the mutt with the black spots
didn't die.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz the runt is still alive. So is Alice the golden retriever
and Rosco, the boxer puppy whose mother got hit by a car. All that
matters here is that a dog named Red and another named Fred and
another named Lucille Ball got a second chance. This is Utopia,
after all.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Impact on man's best friend

Animal Rescue Ranch at (830) 966-2495.

   PARIS _ Here I was, making mental notes to tell everyone back
home about the nice folks in Paris, and suddenly, the stereotypical
rude Parisian reared his ugly head.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the ticket window in the Gare de Lyon train station, a
ticket clerk was ruining what had been a wonderful stay in the City
of Light. Our problem: seat reservations.
</P>
<P>
   We had a Europass for two, the five-country pass that gives the
illusion of carefree travel and usually delivers. But not in
France, where all the high-speed TGV trains required a seat
reservation and conductors warned us against boarding without one.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, it sounds minor _ until you're stuck with rude clerks
gleefully mocking you behind the ticket counter minutes before the
last trains depart for the evening. Or at least that's how it
seemed to this frustrated, suddenly paranoid non-French-speaking
American tourist.
</P>
<P>
   Images of Monty Python skits with a Frenchman played by John
Cleese hurling insults at King Arthur's men twirled through my head
as we tried to ascertain which intricate steps were required to
obtain a seat reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Our French-English phrase book didn't help. The clerks knew what
we wanted but insisted we were in the wrong line. After 20 or so
minutes in the next line, that clerk would direct us in a
Keystone-Coplike-fashion back to the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   This procedure went on for close to three hours as other
English-speaking tourists _ from both the States and Great Britain
_ were also met with alternating doses of rudeness and
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as the final trains were leaving for the night, that
last clerk left at the ticket counter grudgingly granted us seat
reservations to Grenoble in the French Alps. It wasn't our original
destination of the French Riviera, but, hey, who's complaining. At
this point, we would have settled for anything.
</P>
<P>
   After several months of reflection, I realize we could have
handled this situation with a little preparation. My downfall was
thinking that rail travel had stayed the same in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In college, I had used the Eurail pass _ the king of all rail
passes, which gives unlimited train travel across Western Europe _
and become accustomed to hopping on a train at a moment's notice. A
year before this most recent trip, my wife, Laura, and I had done
the same thing with an Italian rail pass and had no trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. European rail travel is still a marvel to a
car-mad American. Hop from one European capital to another while
the countryside rolls by. View the Swiss Alps, a Tuscan hill town
or the Mediterranean Sea while chatting with a retired grandfather
about his life in the hills above Naples. It sure beats antiseptic
air travel.
</P>
<P>
   And some of these new high-speed train rides come complete with
free drinks, exotic candy and headphones with music ranging from
Sinatra to Italian polkas (that was, naturally, on an Italian
train.)
</P>
<P>
   But rail passes do come with a hitch: Just as languages and
currencies multiply as you cross borders in Western Europe, so do
the dos and don'ts of train travel.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, it was one story. In Venice, another.
</P>
<P>
   And the rules weren't always logical. They seemed to follow the
mores of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Switzerland and Germany, rules were rules. In Italy,
well, everything seemed negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   With the scars of Paris only few days old, we dutifully lined up
in the Venice train station for seat reservations on the high-speed
Eurostar _ the Italian one, not the more well-known Chunnel train
that goes between London and Paris. After we waited in line several
minutes, the ticket clerk shrugged and told us there were no more
seats available.
</P>
<P>
   Out of luck? No way.
</P>
<P>
   We were told to arrive at our train a half-hour ahead of time
and the conductor would find us seats _ maybe.
</P>
<P>
   So there we were, with about 30 other confused tourists
thrusting our passes and tickets at the conductor in a frantic game
of reservations roulette. Ten minutes before departure, we were all
comfortably on board.

EX-BUDDHIST MONK FIGHTS FOR HIS LIFE ON DEATH ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jaturun Siripongs _ raised on dirt floors in a
rat-infested brothel in Thailand _ has found friends in high
places. Just days before his scheduled execution, he's waiting to
learn if they can help.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai ambassador to Washington, the minister of foreign
affairs of Thailand and former San Quentin Warden Daniel Vasquez
have asked Gov. Pete Wilson to commute Siripongs' death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   So have the husband of one of his victims and two of the jurors
who condemned him to die.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs, scheduled to die by lethal injection at 12:01 a.m.
Tuesday, was convicted of a double murder during a 1981 convenience
store robbery in Garden Grove, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his unusual array of allies, Siripongs has no champion
more devoted than Linda Schilling, a corporate attorney with
Fortune 500 clients who has befriended the former Buddhist monk and
fought for him without pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a better person for having known him,'' Schilling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has enriched my life,'' she said, in a voice tinged with
emotion. ``He is wise. He is insightful. He's a lot of fun to spend
time with. I will miss him very much if the state kills him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemency is Siripongs' last hope. Schilling has shepherded his
case through the state Supreme Court, the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court _ which declined to hear
arguments in October.
</P>
<P>
   She has declared that he was ineffectively represented by trial
counsel, that mitigating evidence was never presented to the jury
and, in a desperate finale, he has been denied his right to choose
between lethal gas or injection as required by state law. (A
federal judge has issued an injunction against gas-chamber
executions.) What's more, she said with conviction, Siripongs is
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that her client participated in a robbery of
the store, Schilling contends the killings were committed by an
accomplice whom Siripongs has declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested for the strangulation death of store owner
Packovan Wattanaporn, another Thai national, and the fatal stabbing
of clerk Quach Nguyen, a Vietnamese immigrant, two days after the
crime. Siripongs was caught using Wattanaporn's credit card to buy
a television set.
</P>
<P>
   In Siripongs' apartment, the police found $3,000 in cash and
$25,000 in jewelry taken in the robbery. They said Siripongs had
suffered wounds consistent with a hand sliding down the blade of a
knife during a stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, in turn, said none of the 30 sets of fingerprints
found at the crime scene matched those of her client. She said shoe
prints in the store and blood found in Siripongs' car indicated the
presence of someone else during the crime.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, Schilling doesn't want to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter because he accepts the whole ball of wax,''
she said. ``He accepts complete responsibility and he always has.
... You talk to him about the day of the crime and he just trembles
and weeps.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Siripongs' remorse was so intense that _ before his
trial _ he wrote to the judge and asked to be sentenced
immediately. ``He said, `I do not want to burden the court. I do
not want to contribute to anybody else's suffering,''' Schilling
said.

DEVELOPERS WORK ON IDEAS FOR THE HISTORIC PRESIDIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The years have been good to the Presidio of San
Francisco. It was a stunning promontory when Capt. Don Juan
Bautista de Anza settled there in 1776. It's breathtaking today,
and, God willing, the old fort will glisten even after 3.5 million
square feet of commercial real estate is developed.
</P>
<P>
   This is the pledge of the Presidio Trust, the manager of what in
1994 was the oldest continuously operating military base in the
United States when, after taps, it became a national park: There
will be revenue raised in commercial and residential rents so that
the Presidio can sustain itself by 2013, at $36 million in annual
costs, but above all it shall be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   James Meadows, the Air Force veteran and former developer who is
the trust's executive director, reiterated the conservation pledge
Thursday while mulling over the qualifications of 10 would-be
developers who are interested in the Presidio's major construction
project: nearly one million square feet of new lease space on a
23-acre site currently occupied by the vacant Letterman Army
Hospital and a research facility, which will be torn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we do in a real estate context is to achieve
self-sufficiency. That allows us to preserve the park, not the
other way around,'' Meadows said. ``The park drives the real
estate. The real estate does not drive the park.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of possible developers includes the Shorenstein Co. of
San Francisco, proposing a Presidio Green that would be a
mixed-use, live-work, pedestrian-oriented community that could have
as its anchor tenants C/NET and the San Francisco investment
banking firm of Hellman &AMP; Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   LNR Presidio Partners LLC of San Francisco imagines a
combination of offices and apartments plus a college campus and an
inn or retreat center. Possible major tenants would be Golden Gate
University and the nonprofit Goldman Institute on Aging, a
subsidiary of Mount Zion Health Systems caring for the frail
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   By Nov. 20, a short list consisting of three to seven developers
will be selected. A finalist for negotiations will be named Feb.
25.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the trust has also asked for the qualifications of
companies interested in developing the Officers Club _ the original
adobe structure was the city's first building _ and several other
buildings with a total of 175,000 square feet in the historic main
post.
</P>
<P>
   By 2013, when federal appropriations for the Presidio end,
revenue from nonresidential leasing is projected by the trust to be
$15 million annually. Tenants will be paying market rates for the
area, about $30 per square foot, which is considerably less than
what is being paid in some buildings in downtown San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some $20.6 million is expected from residential leasing.
</P>
<P>
   However, legislation holds that if it's not self-sufficient by
2013, most of the Presidio will be divided and sold by the General
Services Administration, the branch of the government that hands
property for federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Developers find the Presidio a fascinating and rich challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a modern swords-to-plowshares story, taking a government
base and turning it into a neo-traditional community center of
activity,'' said Stan Cohn, managing principal of the commercial
real estate firm of Whitney Cressman Ltd. in San Francisco. ``I
think it's a jewel.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the jewel's sparkle requires a thorough filtering
process now under way at the Presidio, for developers know that the
trust will welcome only nonprofit or for-profit tenants of all
sizes that it deems appropriate for a national park setting _ that
is, nonpolluting and respectful of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   These may be involved in education, the arts, scientific
research, environmental studies, scientific inquiry, health care,
philanthropy, international relations, or perhaps the Internet or
multimedia companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not limitations,'' said Monica Finnegan, managing
director of the San Francisco office of CB Richard Ellis, ``but
guidelines to build the best project and find the best mixture, and
it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   One critic of the planned development of the Presidio, Joan
Girardot, president of the Coalition of San Francisco
Neighborhoods, said the trust's first order of business should be
to start collecting revenue by renting or leasing existing
buildings before any new construction is contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you rationalize putting new construction in a national
park?'' she asked. ``We're not talking about adding bathrooms.''

STORM DAMAGE LEAVES MAMMOTH OBSTACLES FOR MILITARY TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMEROLA, Honduras _ A team of American Army doctors and medics
drove in a convoy up a steep, narrow dirt road trying to reach
hundreds of villagers isolated on the other side of the mountain in
the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   But facing thick fog, steady rain and thick mud, not even their
sturdy military Humvees could get through to the village of Santa
Rosa, located in a lush, coffee-growing region that has been
largely cut off from humanity by mammoth mudslides ever since
Hurricane Mitch smashed into northern Honduras on Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Thursday, the road had been opened. It was
being cleared even while the American convoy drove through, often
waiting while work crews cleared mounds of trees and mud.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough. The fog was thick and a steady rain has
turned the road into slick, red slush that often fell in clumps
hundreds of feet below.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the fog rolls in like this, we can't even see each other.
... And the red clay is like butter on a hot plate,'' said 2nd Lt.
Scarlett Tillery, a physician's assistant from Longview, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Other vehicles were spinning wheels and an Army Humvee missed a
curb, hanging precariously on the edge of a mountainside road until
it was pulled to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Tillery was disappointed she would not be able to treat any of
the villagers on this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them just start crying when they see you,'' she said
of the storm victims in Honduras. ``They say, `Oh my head hurts, my
heart hurts. I lost everything.'''

   Tillery and her team are among the 1,100 U.S. troops in Honduras
helping with relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10,000 people were killed in four Central American
countries when Mitch made landfall and then hovered in the region
for five days last month. Thousands are still missing, but a main
concern is staving off epidemics brought on by contaminated water
and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and specialists have descended on Honduras from around
the world. American troops are based at the Soto Cano Honduran Air
Force base in Palmerola. Half of the 1,100 soldiers are here
regularly on temporary duty.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to the base from the futile attempt to reach
Santa Rosa, flight surgeon Capt. Gail Glushko went to work
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Two men had been taken to the military hospital, and it turned
out they had malaria. At first, it was feared they had dengue, an
infectious tropical disease characterized by severe pain and rash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them have respiratory illnesses, diarrhea, funguses, a
fair amount of conjunctivitis,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. doctors here estimate they have not reached 14,000 people
in dozens of nearby villages. They will have to wait until the
roads open up, little by little.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gargantuan task considering there are thousands of people
still trapped by the flooding and mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   In the valley of San Pedro Sula, the rich banana growing region
that hugs the Caribbean Sea, there are several communities still
cut off by high water.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran and U.S. troops have flown numerous daily missions,
dropping staples from planes and helicopters to people until roads
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Scott Weliver, a paratrooper from Fort Bragg, N.C., who has
been coordinating joint military rescues and airplane drops of food
and medicine, pointed to a map that shows more than six communities
still cut off because the bridges are demolished or because of
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to go,'' he said of land routes. ``We'll be
here as long as it takes.''

GETO BOYS' SINGER DEDICATED CD TO SLAIN MENTOR, ASSISTANT DISTRICT
ATTORNEY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTI MUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Texas _ The aggressive, idealistic young prosecutor
and the streetwise rap musician stood on opposite sides of the
courtroom _ part of different worlds with no common ground.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it would seem.
</P>
<P>
   The truth was that Fort Bend County Assistant District Attorney
Gil Epstein knew about Bushwick Bill _ who in court went by the
name Richard Stephen Shaw _ and Houston's Geto Boys. Epstein also
knew about hip hop and rap music, and their mutual interest created
a most unlikely friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that a talent was about to be wasted during Bushwick
Bill's 1996 marijuana possession case, Epstein sat him down and
told him to get his act together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was supposed to be locking me up,'' Bushwick Bill said.
``Instead, he was telling me I was locking myself up in ignorance
by allowing things to stray me from the path I was on.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old prosecutor was gunned down in 1996 during an
attempted robbery outside the Jewish Community Center in Houston.
Now, two years later, Bushwick Bill has released a new compact disc
_ ``No Surrender...No Retreat'' _ ``dedicated to the loving
memory'' of his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the world to know he existed. He gave me a fair chance,
which was something I wasn't given in life all the time,'' Bushwick
Bill said by phone this week from Columbia, S.C., where he was on a
promotional tour.
</P>
<P>
   Released this week, the solo CD cover shows Bushwick Bill in
military garb. The CD is under his label, Lickle Getto Boy $ N'
Cents Ent. and is distributed by Ichiban Records Inc. of Atlanta.
Inside the cover are photos of Epstein: one from his district
attorney's ID badge and one of him and his young nephew.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the 19 songs are peppered with profanity _ a
parental advisory is on the cover, warning of explicit content _
one song, ``Let DA Rain Come Down,'' is expletive-free and written
for Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the world to know what it all meant to me. People who
know him can fill in the blanks before the words come on,'' said
Bushwick Bill.
</P>
<P>
   The song symbolizes the rain washing away the pain as the world
goes around, he said, and it ends with: ``I hear the angels cry.''
It refers to the driving rain that deluged Houston the night
Epstein was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most terrible rainstorm going on that night,'' said
Epstein's partner, Assistant District Attorney Greg Gilleland.
``Everybody from our office that drove down there to the hospital
remembers it.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's parents, who at first agreed to the CD
dedication, had second thoughts after considering the raw and often
shocking lyrics in the music. But after Gilleland explained their
son's appreciation of that type of music, and his unusual
friendship with Bushwick Bill, they agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Baruch ``Benny'' Epstein, the prosecutor's father, said he and
his wife, Zohara, were very touched to receive the CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really loved people and he saw what potential they had,''
Epstein said of his son.
</P>
<P>
   The Epsteins are making another of several return trips to
Richmond, Texas, next month to volunteer at the Fort Bend County
shelter for battered women, a tradition the couple started to carry
on their son's work.
</P>
<P>
   His killer, Marcus Cotton, 24, of Houston, is on death row. A
Harris County jury convicted and sentenced him in November 1997
after his first trial ended in a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony showed that he and a friend had ridden their bikes to
the Jewish Community Center to rob people, and Epstein, just
leaving his regular Wednesday night basketball game, was a random
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Gilleland said he formally dismissed the marijuana possession
case against Bushwick Bill and a misdemeanor assault case that the
rapper's girlfriend filed after Epstein's death. The marijuana
case, which involved one of Bushwick Bill's friends driving the
rapper's car and carrying marijuana, was dismissed after Epstein
ordered the rapper to give motivational talks at Fort Bend County
high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bushwick Bill _ who says he is 28 although court records
indicate he is 31 _ again was charged with assault in Fort Bend
County in 1997 involving the attempted shooting of his brother, but
that also was dismissed, prosecutors said, because of the brother's
lack of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Bushwick Bill's attorney, Ron Wilson, said Epstein's advice to
his client had a major impact on the rapper's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was insistent from the beginning that he wanted to pay
tribute to Gil's life through his music,'' said Wilson, who plays
bass and lead guitar on the CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange deal. This is rough stuff, but at the same
time, it was music Gil was familiar with. He had some respect for
the genre.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night Epstein was killed, Wilson called the rapper to
tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I felt a cold chill in my body, then I started
crying,'' said Bushwick Bill. &QL;

WEB-DIGITAL (Los Angeles) _ LA.com, a Web site dedicated to all
things Angeleno, debuts, while Microsoft overhauls its Sidewalk
city directory sites so they'll be of more use even to people in
cities such as Los Angeles that don't have their own Sidewalk. By
David Bloom. 
. 
SING-STAGE (Los Angeles) _ Maxed out on Monica-gate? Weary unto
death of the Bill and Ken Show? Well, if it's any consolation, the
politics of the 1930s apparently were every bit as silly, salacious
and deserving of satire as our own. Imagine a reckless, boyishly
seductive president surrounded by sleazy advisers, feckless
senators, scandal-mongering scribes and a romantic scandal
involving a pretty White House intern. And that's only the first
act of ``Of Thee I Sing.'' By Reed Johnson. 
. 
JAILS-STAGE (Los Angeles) _ Be careful: You may become what you
consume. If there's a single, simple message that can be distilled
from ``Jails, Hospitals &AMP; Hip-Hop,'' Danny Hoch's scrappily
intelligent, pugnaciously funny new solo show, this may be it. By

again to buy, buy, buy. Miz Hot Tips is talking about the
re-release of ``Wizard of Oz,'' and she learned that the Warner
Bros. store in Topanga Plaza, Canoga Park, is already sold out of
those ruby slippers. By Barbara De Witt. 
. 
MARTHA-CLONES (Hanrahan) _ She's tall, blond and almost beautiful.
She favors jeans and button-down shirts with the sleeves rolled up,
tail untucked. She has her own line of products for the home and
can spout a dozen creative ideas for bed canopies or moss on a
moment's notice. No, she's not Martha Stewart, but Sandra Lee of
Marina del Rey doesn't mind the comparison. By Jenifer Hanrahan.

MOVE OVER, MARTHA

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Sandra Lee is no Martha Stewart, but she doesn't
mind the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Like Stewart, Lee is tall, blond and pretty.
</P>
<P>
   She has her own line of products for the home, and she can spout
a dozen creative ideas for moss on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   What makes her more than a Martha clone? For starters, she uses
Minute Rice and canned cream of mushroom soup in recipes. She
creates bed canopies from ordinary sheets. She mixes eggs, powdered
milk and oatmeal from the kitchen cabinet to create home spa
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Martha would surely die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha Stewart was a pioneer in bringing back the `cocooning'
way of life,'' Lee says, fluffing sheets with stylists in her
Marina del Rey apartment during a recent photo shoot. ``But now,
it's evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart, the queen of a multimedia empire that grew like
ivy up a trellis, had better watch out. In raising homemaking from
a chore to an art form, she's spawned a new generation of televised
housewives ready to teach us their own version of the art of
homemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding glue guns, cheesecloth and tile cutters, these would-be
Marthas have designs on usurping her throne. Many of them have
written books and landed their own TV shows about interior design
and decorating, gardening and landscaping, entertaining, cooking
and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Lee, who makes appearances on national talk shows
touting her tips for ``Simply Living,'' are shopping demo tapes.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some of the home and garden hosts on television now
have been around as long as _ or longer than _ Martha Stewart.
Carol Duvall, who hosts her own weekly crafts show on cable's Home
and Garden Television (HGTV), did her first on-air project in
Detroit in the 1960s. Kitty Bartholomew, who also has an HGTV
series, was the resident decorating expert on ABC's the ``Home
Show,'' which ran from 1988-94.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Emmerling, host of ``Country at Home'' on HGTV, wrote the
first of her 18 books, ``American Country,'' in 1980. Martha's
first book, ``Entertaining,'' didn't arrive until two years later.
</P>
<P>
   But none of them soared to Martha's heights. She has had 24
books published and fills 5{ hours of airtime a week in Los
Angeles, plus a regular Tuesday morning appearance on CBS' ``This
Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha's competitors say they're inspired by her success. Lee
has several years' worth of Martha Stewart Living magazines saved
for quick reference. Others admire her business acumen.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless Martha,'' said Christopher Lowell, host of
``Interior Motives,'' a one-hour home decorating show on the
Discovery Channel. ``She was the first to convince the
entertainment industry that `how-to' was watchable. She was the
first to have incredible merchandising and marketing savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the master has her weaknesses, they say. Martha's
projects are too difficult, time-consuming and expensive for most
people. She uses too much beige and pale green and not enough
vibrant colors like purple, red and gold. She sends viewers on wild
goose chases for exotic ingredients not on sale at the local
grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will ultimately be her undoing,'' said Lowell, who gets
fan mail from frustrated Martha defectors. ``She is on the air
because she claimed that territory first.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynette Jennings, host of her own design show on Discovery,
believes that Martha's insistence on one correct way of doing
things will drive audiences away _ eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been teaching achievable design and trying to demystify
the design world so that more people can have beautiful homes
styled their own way,'' Jennings said. ``But that is less
media-worthy than the other extreme, which is high end, extremely
elegant, elitist design that most people can't get their hands on
and never will. Frankly, I'm going to win in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Martha's New England cool, Lowell's effusive slapstick
or Jennings' accessible elegance will win the most fans, what's
sure is these shows are proliferating. The three big networks each
run syndicated shows; PBS, Lifetime, Discovery, the Learning
Channel and Romance Classics have home shows in their lineups.
Five-year-old Home and Garden Television airs 20{ hours of
home-oriented programming a day.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big change from a few decades ago, when there were only
a handful of shows dedicated exclusively to home ``how-to,'' said
Robert Thompson, professor of television and founding director of
the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse
University.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia for the days before microwavable Salisbury steak
replaced Mom's cooking may account for some of the appeal of these
shows, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   But a primary reason is purely modern: the rapid expansion of
channels that allows for specialty programming like home and garden
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's created the illusion that there's an explosion of
interest in cooking or home and garden, but that's not necessarily
true,'' Thompson said. ``Stations are able to (air specialty
programs) because you don't have to get large audiences watching
anymore to be profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   While audience sizes are small in comparison to prime-time
network programming, the shows do reach a loyal, upscale, niche
audience that is attractive to advertisers, said Steve Sternberg,
director of broadcast research for TN Media in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``A successful syndicated show like `Martha Stewart' is a money
machine,'' Sternberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, the shows cost less to produce than dramas,
sitcoms or documentaries, said Burton Jablin, HGTV's senior vice
president for programming and production.
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for the loyalty?
</P>
<P>
   A phenomenon called ``information escapism,'' Jablin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are truly looking for an escape from the hassles and
frustrations of everyday life,'' he said. ``The home and garden
becomes a haven from all that.'' &QL;

BARBARA SMITH &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 49
</P>
<P>
   Show: ``B. Smith With Style.''
</P>
<P>
   Where to watch: Syndicated; 9:30 a.m. Sundays on NBC (Channel
4).
</P>
<P>
   Where it's filmed: New York.
</P>
<P>
   Recent episode: Cooking risotto with Sally Jessy Raphael. A tour
of a glass-blowing studio. Getting creative with fabric dye. How to
dress up your little black dress.
</P>
<P>
   Before she was a lifestyle guru: Growing up in western
Pennsylvania, Smith learned how to can fruit and refinish
furniture. She moved to New York at 19 to start modeling.
</P>
<P>
   She and her second husband own restaurants in Manhattan, the
Hamptons and Union Station in Washington, D.C. He's her executive
producer.
</P>
<P>
   How she's different from Martha: To point out the obvious, Smith
is African-American. She says she has a more urban outlook, drawing
on elements of style from American Indians and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha loves muted colors _ moss green, pale green and milk
glass. My style is richer, more vibrant, funkier _ like silks,
velvets, tassels and vibrant colors. I'm more into things that
really say `life.' She's like classical music, and I'm like
improvisational jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Practical idea: Rather than give a boring bottle of wine when
you're invited to someone's home, get creative. Wrap packets of
heirloom seeds in a bow, or give a basket of bulbs. Make your own
themed gift baskets: for instance, a compete Italian dinner with
pasta, Parmesan cheese, tomato sauce, crusty bread and wine.
</P>
<P>
   Motto: ``Whatever you do, do it with style.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HEIDI AND MICHAEL SPOUND &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Ages: She's 38. He's 41.
</P>
<P>
   Show: ``Better Homes and Gardens Television.''
</P>
<P>
   Where to watch: 5:30 a.m. Sundays on KABC (Channel 7).
</P>
<P>
   Where it's filmed: Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Recent episode: The cute couple cooked Sausage, Beans and
Greens, a recipe developed and approved in Better Homes and
Gardens' test kitchens in Des Moines, Iowa. (In fact, all recipes
they make have gone through their extensive screening process.)
Making topiaries. Tour of a Victorian-style home and a how-to
segment on hanging pictures from a Victorian-style picture rail.
</P>
<P>
   Life before stardom: The duo played husband and wife on the
series ``Hotel,'' which ran from 1983-88. During the fourth season,
``a brick hit us over the head, and we completely fell in love,''
Heidi said. The couple live in Woodland Hills with their two
children.
</P>
<P>
   How they're different from Martha: Martha's a divorcee. The
Spounds are happily married.
</P>
<P>
   Motto: ``We've got two kids, and we're running around all the
time to soccer and baseball and karate and basketball and carpools.
If we can do it, you can.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MARY EMMERLING &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Where filmed: On location around the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Secret of her success: ``I write thank-you notes.''
</P>
<P>
   But seriously: ``We may say modern is in, but the J.C.
Penney-style country has been big for 200 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent episode: Visit a country crafts and furniture store in
Manhattan, a blacksmith and a country-style loft in Manhattan.
Alternate uses for birdhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Life before stardom: Emmerling has 30 years of experience in
interior design and publishing. She even had her own, short-lived
publication in 1993-94 called Mary Emmerling's Country.
</P>
<P>
   How she's different from Martha: ``I smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Most popular ideas: Group candles of different sizes together in
a basket. You can set them atop greens for Christmas or inside a
gourd for Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Motto: ``Country never goes out of style.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LYNETTE JENNINGS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 50
</P>
<P>
   Show: ``Lynette Jennings Design.''
</P>
<P>
   Where to watch: 11 a.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. Saturdays on the
Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>

gardening tools. A visit to a desert botanical garden and an
Arizona house.
</P>
<P>
   Life before stardom: Owned an architectural and design firm.
</P>
<P>
   How she's different from Martha: ``To look to another style and
covet something that isn't you, a style that someone else says is
the only way to do it and the only style that says `status,' that's
not what design is all about ... design has many faces and many
approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Practical idea: To ``antique'' a wall quickly and inexpensively,
apply an oil-based stain to a white wall with a plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   Weirdest idea that looks great: The paper bag wall. Tear
12-by-18-inch strips of wrinkled paper bags and secure them to the
wall with wallpaper glue. When it dries, ``it looks like leather.''
</P>
<P>
   Motto: ``Trust your instincts. When you close the door at night,
you live there, not anybody else.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHRISTOPHER LOWELL &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Age: 43
</P>
<P>
   Show: ``Interior Motives.''
</P>
<P>
   Where to watch: noon and 3 p.m. weekdays on the Discovery
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Where filmed: Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Recent episode: Visiting a Beverly Hills hotel for ideas, then
re-creating the look in a bedroom. Interview with a commercial
interior designer. Interviewed a viewer on air and made suggestions
for fixing up her living room. How to create a gossamer bed canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Life before stardom: Designed theatrical sets and lighting.
</P>
<P>
   How he's different from Martha: For one, Lowell is a man, making
him a ``nonthreatening presence'' to women, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Practical idea: Instead of putting two potted palms on the floor
or in corners, make them ``dramatic focal points'' by putting them
on pedestals with lights that shine from the base to create
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Advice to the uninitiated: ``If you can put together a nice
outfit, you're already working with texture, scale and accessories.
If you can put your makeup on, you're already overqualified to
faux-finish. If you can do your hair, you already understand
symmetry, asymmetry and texture, which means you'll probably be
very good at flower arranging.''
</P>
<P>
   Motto: ``Where there is fear, there is no creativity.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
KITTY BARTHOLOMEW &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Age: She does not reveal her age.
</P>
<P>
   Show: ``Kitty Bartholomew: You're Home.''
</P>

<P>
   Recent episode: Bartholomew renovating her '60s-era harvest gold
and chocolate brown kitchen in her own Santa Monica home on a
$4,000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Life before stardom: A former interior designer, Bartholomew was
a regular on ABC's ``Home Show'' until it went off the air in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   How she's different from Martha: ``I don't try to tell people
this is the only way to do things. I like to showcase creative
people in their homes. My goal is they will incorporate their own
creative touches and personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Practical ideas: Making large bows from window screening, then
spray-painting them gold. Covering lampshades with buttons to
create interesting shadows on the walls. A ``belt chair,'' made by
weaving old leather belts back and forth across the frame of a
chair.
</P>
<P>
   Motto: ``It's not what you don't have. It's what you do with
what you do have.'' &QL;

'30S' `OF THEE I SING' A PERFECT '90S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maxed out on Monica-gate? Weary unto death of the
Bill and Ken Show?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if it's any consolation, the politics of the 1930s
apparently were every bit as silly, salacious and deserving of
satire as our own. Imagine a reckless, boyishly seductive president
surrounded by sleazy advisers, feckless senators, scandal-mongering
scribes and a romantic scandal involving a pretty White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the first act of ``Of Thee I Sing,'' the
Pulitzer Prize-winning George and Ira Gershwin musical, with a book
so eerily farsighted that it seems to have been written by Jeanne
Dixon rather than George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring one of the Gershwins' wiliest scores, and a number of
outstanding comic performances, the production that opened
Wednesday at UCLA's Freud Playhouse makes a fine tonic for those
old post-election blues. This is the sixth show in the 2-year-old
``Reprise!'' series of staged concert musicals, and, abetted by Rob
Barron's elegant choreography, it's probably the smoothest and
all-round snappiest since the series' inaugural effort, ``Promises,
Promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's hard to imagine better timing for a show about a
U.S. chief executive threatened with impeachment by a
re-election-minded Congress. How did handsome, cocky President John
P. Wintergreen (Gregory Harrison) land in this mess in the first
place?
</P>
<P>
   By following the trusted advice of his cigar-chomping aides (Gus
Corrado and Craig Wasson) and a Hearst-like newspaper publisher
(Lenny Wolpe). Facing the fall campaign, bachelor Wintergreen is
persuaded that the best way to whip up voters is to stage a Miss
America-style pageant in Atlantic City, with the winner being
crowned first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But the cold-footed Wintergreen spurns the committee's choice of
unreconstructed Southern belle Diana Devereaux (Heather Lee) in
favor of sunny, girl-next-door intern Mary Turner (the sterling
soprano Maureen McGovern). Mary's recipe for cornless corn muffins
steals the president's heart, and wins a Supreme Court ruling that
corn muffins are more important than justice.
</P>
<P>
   That's not enough to stop the White House press corps' tongues
from wagging, or the scorned Dixie hellcat from vowing, ``See you
in court, y'all!'' at the close of Act 1.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, though. This is still, at bottom, a lighthearted
if trenchant musical comedy, halfway between Gilbert and Sullivan
and the next ``Reprise!'' regular-season offering, ``Fiorello!''
All ends well.
</P>
<P>
   Under Arthur Allan Seidelman's direction, the production
maintains a tone of charming ingenuousness, never breaking stride
or straining to push contemporary parallels.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have to. Though far-fetched in 1931, the now
all-too-believable plot beautifully prefigures the merger of public
policy and tabloid celebrity that now defines American politics.
Harrison's Wintergreen, with his square-jawed, matinee-idol good
looks, is the very model of the eager-to-please modern politician
who essentially stands for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one the people choose, loves the Irish and the Jews''
goes the opening ``Wintergreen for President'' number.
</P>
<P>
   The once-over-lightly cyncism of that line is as delectable as
the timely resonance of the Act 2 moment when a White House tour
guide informs a group of visitors that the Oval Office ``is the
room in which the president discharges his official duties.'' Note:
Not one word has been altered since 1931.
</P>
<P>
   The show's spoofy construction means that the pleasant Harrison
and McGovern mostly serve as foils to more broadly comic
characters, like Lee's pouty Miss Devereaux and Charlie Dell's
priceless performance as the milquetoast Sen. Throttlebottom, a
vice president so useless that no one remembers his name.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Jason Graae gives the production a terrific jolt of
energy as a mincing, witheringly indignant French ambassador.
Somebody should find this guy a starring musical role in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Though keenly melodic, the score isn't quite as effervescent as
earlier Gershwin shows. You won't find the equivalent here of
``Lady Be Good'' or ``Someone to Watch Over Me.'' But musical
director Peter Matz and his small, smart ensemble polish it to a
fine gloss. Who could ask for anything more?

ANNUAL AND PERENNIAL: ADAPTING TO NATURE'S RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 15) 
(lb) 
 By CASS PETERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend with a newly dug flower bed wanted advice last spring
on what to plant in it. She wanted something that would not only
bloom profusely from spring to fall, with little care, but would
also come up again of its own accord the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The best idea I could offer was plastic posies.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the nature of gardeners to wish for attributes that
their plants do not have, like a longer season of bloom, and it is
in the nature of plant breeders to provide as many of those
attributes as their art can manage. But so far no horticultural
wizardry has been developed that will turn an annual _ the best
choice for a steady supply of blooms _ into a perennial. So we may
as well learn to live with the distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Annuals are plants that live for one season. They germinate,
flower, produce seed and die in less than a year. Most common
bedding plants _ petunias, marigolds, impatiens, zinnias _ are
annuals. If you want them in the garden, you must plant them afresh
each spring.
</P>
<P>
   What an annual lacks in winter-hardiness it more than makes up
for in flowering prowess. That is because its raison d'etre is to
produce seed. Since the plant itself will die, its only method of
perpetuating itself is through seed. It blooms and blooms, and if
you keep thwarting its reproductive efforts by removing the
blossoms as they fade, it blooms and blooms some more.
</P>
<P>
   A few annuals will come back the following year, but from the
seed they manage to produce, not from their own roots. Alyssum,
annual hollyhocks, cosmos and cleome are among these, and in some
protected sites they are so reliable that they may as well be
perennials.
</P>
<P>
   Perennials, for that matter, may not come back at all. They are
defined as plants that live for at least three seasons (to set them
apart from biennials like sweet William, which live for two
seasons, producing foliage in the first, and flowers and seed in
the second).
</P>
<P>
   But the definition doesn't take into account that some are
perennial only in climates that suit them. The lovely late-blooming
Mexican sage, for example, is perennial, as are English daisies,
but the sage is too tender for my frigid winters in Pennsylvania,
and the daisies cannot tolerate my hot, humid summers.
</P>
<P>
   Trees and shrubs are perennials, too, but the perennials under
discussion here are herbaceous perennials rather than woody ones.
Woody perennials, like lilacs, azaleas and maple trees, leaf out
and bloom on the skeleton of last year's plant. Herbaceous
perennials die to the ground each winter and come back from their
roots in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to survive from one year to the next means that
perennial species are far less bent on progeny than are annuals.
Notwithstanding that the flowers of many perennials are voluptuous
to the point of licentiousness, perennials are quite chaste, in
contrast to annuals' promiscuity. A perennial's bloom period, which
is a plant's equivalent of a sex life, is typically short, and
occurs at the same time each year.
</P>
<P>
   This is an inconvenience for gardeners who want the Oriental
poppies to bloom all summer, or the Japanese iris to flower with
the pink turtlehead, because they would look so good together.
Alas, it is not to be.
</P>
<P>
   Endless tinkering by scientists has produced some hybrid
perennials that bloom more than once a year or for longer periods
than normal for the species. Many modern-day lilies are repeat
bloomers, for example, and a few, including the famous Stella de
Oro, flower all season long.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, however, the breadth is achieved at the sacrifice
of the depth. Perennials bred for an extended flowering season tend
to be stingy with their blossoms, producing a few at a time, albeit
for a long time. If I am to see only 100 blossoms all season on my
dianthus, then let me see them all at once, in a show that will
take my breath away, rather than a half-dozen each week that I will
scarcely notice.
</P>
<P>
   It is the artful blending of perennials with different bloom
periods that makes a perennial garden appear to be in full flower
all season. If the perennials are young and have not yet spread to
fill their allotted space, or even if they have, it is no breach of
garden etiquette to use a few drifts of annuals as insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But even the best annuals will not bloom from earliest spring to
frost. Petunias come closest, because of their frost-hardiness and
the fact that some have been bred to set no seed or only sterile
seed. They bloom and bloom, satisfying the gardener but not their
reproductive urges.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest show from annuals, it is wise to plant hardy and
tender ones. Hardy annuals, like snapdragons and calendula, can
handle late spring frosts and will flower gleefully by the time it
is safe to plant the impatiens and coleus.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy annuals tend not to like the heat of midsummer, and in any
case will probably have bloomed themselves out by then. They can be
pulled out and replaced with annuals that will be hardy at the
other end of the season, like annual chrysanthemums and petunias.
</P>
<P>
   None of this completely answers my friend's wish for a steadily
blooming flower garden that requires little care. But to be a
gardener presupposes some tolerance of, even some desire for,
working in the soil and getting a little dirt under the
fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Without these, there is still the option of vinyl violets and
plastic petunias.

THE BLOWOUT TAKES OVER HAIR FASHION IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 15) 
(mk) 
 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some call it an addiction. They must have it once,
twice or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   The truly indulgent need it twice a day, before and after work.
</P>
<P>
   Do it once, they say, before a special occasion, and you will
never be able to stop.
</P>
<P>
   That works out well for Robert Lyon, a hair stylist at the Peter
Coppola salon on Madison Avenue, who because of his magic fingers
and upper-arm strength is in constant demand. On Halloween night,
Lyon, who is in his 20s and has a soothing English accent, had to
get to bed early for an 8:30 house call the following morning, a
Sunday, to a woman on Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   To blow out her hair before she went to church.
</P>
<P>
   For all the New York women, whether heading to the Park Avenue
Methodist Church or to Moomba, who love to sport a straight, shiny,
smooth-hair look, with just the right flip and swing, there is an
army of people like Lyon. They will tug on their locks with big,
round brushes for 20 to 40 minutes and dry them with a jet blast of
hot air.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for the talents of blow-dry specialists, who charge
from $20 (Astor Place Hair Stylists) to $275 (John Sahag salon on
Madison Avenue), seems to be at an all-time high. That is because
the long curl-free look, as flaunted by women from Jennifer Aniston
on ``Friends'' to Hillary Rodham Clinton on the cover of the coming
December Vogue, bespeaks power and unassailable style at this
moment, especially in New York. It has led to a virtual cult of the
blowout, as the blow-dry is often called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-five percent of my business is from blow-drying,'' said
Renato Vasconcellos, owner of Color and Cut on East 43rd Street, an
economy-class hair salon that does a land-office business weekday
evenings in the hour preceding cocktail parties and dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Around 6 p.m., ``the place is a nightmare,'' Vasconcellos said,
filled with clients from midtown office buildings, their heads
wrapped in towels after a quick shampoo or just a wet-down _ but
generally not a hair cut _ awaiting their blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   Before last week's charity reception for the Lenox Hill
Neighborhood House, held at the Chanel store on East 57th Street,
the Frederic Fekkai salon in the same building was packed with
partygoers waiting for a blowout by Ronald Braso, a stylist who is
a favorite of the preppy set. ``We had a cocktail party before the
cocktail party,'' Braso said, describing how the women gossiped and
sipped soda as he twirled his round, natural-bristle brushes into
their hair, working the brushes like rollers.
</P>
<P>
   Just as women who dyed their hair once had a secret that ``only
their hairdresser knew for sure,'' many devotees of the blowout
conceal it. They want friends and colleagues to think their hair is
naturally straight and full.
</P>
<P>
   (Some blow-dry specialists are also secretive, because they do
not fully report earnings. One such stylist, who spoke on the
condition that his identity not be revealed, said, ``You can't
believe how much money we're making just to blow out hair.'' He
charges $60 a house call, $100 to $150 on weekends, and admitted
making more than $1,000 a week off the books.)
</P>
<P>
   But other women are proud of the fact that they are getting
their hair blown out regularly, since it smacks of a luxury once
available only to the rich.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had her hair
blown out two or three times a week, either at home or at Kenneth,
the salon in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. ``If she had things to do,
things that mattered, she wanted to look polished and together,''
Kenneth Battelle, the salon's owner, said.
</P>
<P>
   It was an era when the approach many women took to styling was
to visit a salon once a week to have their hair set, then to
petrify it with spray so they wouldn't have to touch it until the
next visit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many more women avail themselves of a beauty treatment once
the exclusive preserve of the super-chic. ``All those girls,
models, have their hair and makeup done before they go to parties,
and that's why they look so good _ not because they're models,''
Candace Bushnell, the author of ``Sex and the City,'' said. ``Who
knew? How come no one ever told us to do this before?'' Now Ms.
Bushnell gets her hair blown out two to three times a week. ``The
problem is you get addicted to blow-drying because your hair looks
so much better instead of the ratty mess before,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Greenfield, 31, owner of the hip clothing store Scoop,
has standing appointments two mornings a week at Color and Cut to
get her long, wavy hair blown out by Bernadette Brady (although
only Brian Devine at Garren New York is allowed to cut her hair).
With someone holding her toy poodle, Annabelle, Ms. Greenfield does
paperwork while getting her hair blow-dried.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Kramer, 29, a beauty director at Fitness magazine, is
also usually in a hurry, so she goes to the John Frieda salon,
where two people, at the same time, blow out her reddish-brown
hair. One person directs the air and someone else holds the brush.
She calls it her ``menage a trois blow-dry.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lizzie Grubman, 27, owner of a public relations agency, has
her hair blown out four times a week by four different stylists _
at home, in her office and in the salon. ``No one has ever seen me
with curly hair,'' she said, ``and they never will.''
</P>
<P>
   Why all the fuss about a salon blow-dry? The home blow-dryer,
after all, has been around for decades, so presumably most women
would have learned to master it by now. But devotees say an expert
can do a better job. When the hair is wet, a stylist with a
blow-dryer pulls out sections of hair with a round bristle brush
and stretches the hair until it dries straight inch by inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obsession is that since hair has gotten longer and less
layered, and the finishing has gotten smooth and straight, women
can't do that on their own,'' said Garren, owner of the Garren New
York salon at Henri Bendel, where a blowout is $70 to $110. ``Since
the clothes have become more minimal and the hair has become
simpler, there isn't a lot going on. It's smooth and simple, shiny
and swings. Women love hair that swings.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hair experts say the blow-out-only salon visit is mainly a New
York phenomenon, although it is also found in Los Angeles.
Elsewhere, it is almost unknown. In Washington, where Braso of
Fekkai worked until recently, he said stylish women dress in
evening gowns with beautiful jewelry, but leave for parties with
their hair still wet from the shower. Why such a difference between
the two cities? New York women, he surmised, are more
image-conscious, thanks to all the photographers snapping them at
parties for magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Many women in a hurry press salons to speed their blowouts, and
the salons in turn are using hotter dryers, which leads to hair
damage, says Dr. Steven Victor, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill
Hospital, who has a private practice on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, 10 years ago the blow-dryers were 500 or 700
watts,'' he said. ``Now I think I've seen one for 2,000 watts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair is dead protein that has moisture and water,'' Victor
added. ``When it's moist, it's bendable and pliable. When you dry
it out, you take out all the moisture and it's basically burning it
and it breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said hair can endure regular blow-drying, but that
practitioners should slow down, use less heat and apply a hair
conditioner with animal protein twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   At a party on Wednesday night for the shoemaker Sergio Rossi at
Simply Caviar, a restaurant on Park Avenue, an informal survey
revealed that one out of 10 women had had her hair blown out that
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Spendlove, 33, a vice president for music and soundtracks
at Miramax Films, recalled his surprise at discovering the love
affair of New York women for the blowout. He had no idea so many of
the women he met really had curly hair. He recalled one day coming
across an acquaintance at the gym, when her hair was curled from
sweat. ``I had no idea who she was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman probably didn't want him to.
</P>
<P>
   Because, like the Wicked Witch of the West, there is one thing
that instantly spells the demise of blow-dried hair, no matter how
expensively styled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water is our enemy,'' Ms. Grubman said.

CUSTOMS AGENTS IN SOUTHWEST BOOST AMOUNTS OF SEIZED DRUGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ U.S. Customs agents in a three-state area of the
Southwest that includes Texas seized nearly 40 percent more
cocaine, 31 percent more marijuana and 22 percent more heroin in
the fiscal year that just ended than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Heroin seizures included $3 million worth of small, drug-filled
balloons in the body of a man taken into custody at Bush
Intercontinental Airport in August.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs spokeswoman Judy Turner credited new X-ray
technology and a new interdiction initiative with helping the
agency intercept drugs, but added, ``Do we think we're catching it
all? Certainly not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the demand is high. We're certainly aware, we don't
even make the claim we're getting all the drugs coming into the
United States. Drug smugglers are smart, creative,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, cocaine seizures in Texas,
Oklahoma and New Mexico jumped from 18,103 pounds in 1997 to 25,197
pounds in 1998, according to statistics from U.S. Customs. Heroin
seizures rose from 190 pounds in 1997 to 231 pounds in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Agents confiscated 355,718 pounds of marijuana this year in
Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, compared with 271,042 pounds last
year. Customs agents also upped the amount of cash seized by 18
percent. The figures are only for drugs seized by the Customs
Service.
</P>
<P>
   At ports of entry in the East Texas region that includes Houston
and Oklahoma, heroin seizures rose 16 percent, while cocaine and
marijuana seizures dropped 17 and 37 percent, respectively. More
cocaine was seized in the South Texas region; more marijuana was
seized in the West Texas region which includes New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroin is up, with a lot of it in Houston,'' Turner said.
``What we find is a lot of swallowers.''
</P>
<P>
   White heroin, the highest grade, usually comes through Bush
Intercontinental Airport, packed in condoms or the fingers of
surgical gloves that smugglers have swallowed, Turner said. If the
container breaks, it can cause an instant, fatal overdose.
</P>
<P>
   A suspicious person may be asked to consent to an X-ray. If the
X-ray reveals drug packets, the person is taken to a medical
facility where customs agents wait for the person to expel the
pellets. In the past, they've had to authorize emergency surgery to
remove a life-threatening pellet remaining in a person's system,
Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the amount of drugs couriers ingest seems to be
increasing. In August, 46-year-old Santo Argueta-Rochec, who had
flown into Houston from El Salvador, was arrested. A hospital X-ray
confirmed the presence of 100 heroin-filled balloons weighing
nearly 3 pounds in the man's digestive system.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the increased seizures were partly a result of
Operation Brass Ring, a stepped-up narcotics interdiction effort
which implemented operations that would be unpredictable by
smugglers  &UR;  &LR; and more thorough inspection methods.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors have fiber optic scopes they can use to peer inside a
gas tank, Turner said. A density measuring device can detect hidden
compartments in tractor trailers, such as a false ceiling or wall.
Mobile X-ray machines are being used on the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly updating what we need to do,'' Turner said.
``We want to keep people and goods moving (across the border).''
</P>
<P>
   Since the amounts vary so much from year to year, it is
difficult to tell whether the drug seizures are good news, or
evidence that the war on drugs is futile.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Maxwell, director of research at the Texas Commission on
Alcohol and Drug Abuse, said it is impossible to get a clear
picture of trends from those numbers alone: ``Seizure data is real
difficult (to interpret). If you get lucky and make one big bust,
then the numbers really go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston Police Department narcotics Sgt. Bill Stephens said
rather than looking at the drug problem in its entirety, he tries
to identify the targets that will make the biggest difference in a
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it in the same perspective as a disease,'' he said. ``Do
you let it run rampant in your body? Or do you try to do everything
you can to stop it? In some instances, you're successful.'' &QL;

PROTECTING THE LOSERS IN THE GLOBAL SPREAD OF CAPITALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also sent with `e' code) 
(bl) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ In Western capitals there is a rush to rethink the
world. At issue is the end of the so-called Washington consensus,
which has held more or less unchallenged since the end of the Cold
War: that more open markets, freer trade and larger international
capital flows are necessarily good.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst has been disaster that no rally on Wall Street can
quickly undo. The global financial crisis has thrown 20 million
Asians back into poverty in the last year, made 40 percent of the
Russian population poorer than ever, and produced growing
unemployment in Brazil, a country already racked by some of the
greatest disparities between rich and poor in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``International volatility has been such that free-market
capitalism is on the defensive,'' said Robert Hormats, vice
chairman of Goldman Sachs International. In place of the old
certainties lies disquiet.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the disquiet is the growing sense that however
fecund the global exchange of trade, information and money has been
in recent years, this unbridled flow can also be capriciously
destructive. Forms of intervention to control or direct the flow
are therefore being heatedly discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very important debate has begun, sparked by the general
realization that you cannot leave people unprotected before the
global market,'' said Anthony Giddens, the director of the London
School of Economics. ``There is a will to recognize the need for
some new governance of the world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of just what that new governance should be is
creating a world of unusual intellectual flux, one comparable to
the post-1945 era in its quest for some overarching design for
equitable development. Just as the development of the New Deal and
the European welfare state rescued industrial capitalism from its
interwar collapse, so a similar and equally critical quest has now
begun at a global level for cushions to the harsher effects of
electronic capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent economists have suggested a global taxation on
currency speculation, the establishment of a second United Nations
Security Council for economic affairs that would act to avert
disaster in the economic field, limits on international flows of
capital, and setting target zones for exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   But such steps, which have fairly wide support in Europe, tend
to provoke deep suspicion in the United States, although the danger
that further volatility could lead to spreading protectionism and
possible political upheavals is widely recognized in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the disagreement between Americans and
Europeans lies the nature of today's instantaneous world. Has this
new global society amounted to an electronic energizer, as the
Clinton administration has tended to argue, a revolutionary
generator of new wealth, new job possibilities and greater freedom?
</P>
<P>
   Or has the brave new world, as many European intellectuals have
insisted, been no more than a slick reincarnation of the unfettered
capitalism of the 19th century, using new technology to atomize
societies, isolate the poor and advance a new ideology of
exploitation upheld by an ever-wealthier, online global oligarchy?
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an increasingly unequal world,'' said Elmar
Altwater, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin,
``and what we have now understood is that this will continue as
long as there is no political correction. Incomes based on labor
simply have not grown in real terms, even as income based on the
global application of capital has soared. What is needed is more
political intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Fitoussi, an economist and adviser to French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, said: ``If there are systematic losers from
today's global economy, we could be overwhelmed. A way must be
found to bring the Frankenstein of deregulated global financial
markets under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Such references to ``Frankenstein'' in the same breath as
``markets'' makes many American economists grimace. After all, the
United States under Bill Clinton has seen the creation of millions
of new jobs, a vigorous economy that derived 30 percent of its
growth from international expansion and, until recent volatility,
consistently soaring share prices.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, by contrast, high unemployment and increasingly
strained social security systems have bolstered a far darker
vision, popularized by a best seller called ``The Economic Horror''
by French writer Viviane Forrestier. It has sold more than 310,000
copies and been translated into 17 languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame should be quoted on the stock exchange for it is an
important element of profit,'' Ms. Forrestier writes in one of the
milder phrases of her uniformly bleak catalog of contemporary
devastation.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Bourdieu, a French intellectual with a large and
passionate following, a man who is perhaps the nearest figure that
France now has to a Jean-Paul Sartre, has made his name with
relentless and more sophisticated attacks against what Europeans
and Latin Americans generally call ultraliberalism, that is,
unfettered free-market orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   A dapper, soft-spoken man, Bourdieu argues that the central aim
of ``the pure logic of the market'' has been to weaken every
collective group _ the nation itself, the state, labor unions,
cooperatives, associations _ to install what he calls a worldwide
``reign of absolute flexibility'' in which international capital
and multinational corporations dictate terms of employment and
wages. ``Ours is a Darwinian world of insecurity and stress, where
the permanent threat of unemployment creates a permanent state of
precariousness,'' he has written.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for fairness has been strengthened in Europe by the
arrival of governments whose intellectual inspiration comes from
the left: Tony Blair in London, Lionel Jospin in Paris, Massimo
D'Alema in Rome and Gerhard Schroeder in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has also been reinforced by the ravages that the rapid, often
herd-like daily movement of money across frontiers has recently
inflicted on such societies as Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt unmasking of Russia's sham capitalism _ with its
``stock market,'' its ``financiers'' and its privatized companies
beside zero regulation, almost zero tax collection, rampant
asset-stripping and a general absence of the rule of law _ has also
brought home the danger of exporting a modern capitalist market
economy to a society unready for it.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing this and other fiascos, World Bank president James
Wolfensohn said last month, ``We have to learn to have a debate
where mathematics will not dominate humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, too, has noted recently that a quarter of the world's
population now lives in countries with declining growth. He has
begun to talk about the need to ``lift the lives of ordinary
people.'' Still, what form of regulation the market needs and in
what degree remain matters of sharp dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Blair talks about the ``rebirth of progressive politics,'' by
which he seems to mean that the state has an active role to play
after the Thatcher years but one that is highly disciplined and
ultimately aimed at giving everyone a stake in the national
economy. Clinton has proposed a ``third way,'' between capitalism
and socialism.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``third way'' is not new, however, and has been applied
during this century to everything from German social democracy
through Yugoslav economic experiments to attempted reforms in the
Soviet Union during the Gorbachev era. What both Blair's and
Clinton's formulations have in common, though, is the notion that
highly disciplined public entities can bring the necessary balance
to market forces.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Western governments have instructed the World Bank to
direct extra funds to ``the most vulnerable groups in society'' and
provided an extra $90 billion to the International Monetary Fund to
be used to try to pre-empt crises. But these are essentially
short-term band-aids.
</P>
<P>
   More sweeping measures are certain to meet resistance. ``The
last thing the world needs is an economic Security Council at the
United Nations,'' said Hormats of Goldman Sachs. ``If you really
want to undermine confidence, that would do it.'' He added that
limits on flows of capital through controls or regulations should
be approached warily.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krugman of MIT has argued in The New Republic, however,
that pressure to constrain or limit international capital flows
seems certain to grow if the response to crises continues to be
governed by the need to ``mollify market sentiment.'' Krugman says
that cutting interest rates is what is really needed to revive
these economies and give poor people in countries like Brazil a
better chance to make their way.
</P>
<P>
   Such limits on capital flows would be a body blow to the spirit
of American capitalism, which has been so buoyant and dominant
since the Cold War's end. This capitalism has been revolutionary,
introducing millions of people to stock-holding both directly and
through mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   But capitalism elsewhere has also had a much crueler face as
rising poverty rates in Asia, Latin America and Russia
show.``Capitalism survived after World War II,'' said Fitoussi, the
French economist, ``because we invented a system where there were
no consistent losers, everyone gained a little.'' The problem, he
said, is that that is no longer the case.

SUSPECTED SLASHER IGNORED TERMS OF HIS PROBATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACOB H. FRIES  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A self-proclaimed vampire who is suspected in
four throat-slashing attacks ignored the terms of his probation
after committing a violent assault last year, and the city's
Probation Department admits it did nothing to get him off the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Rudiger, 21 _ who was arrested Tuesday and charged with
slashing the throats of four homeless people _ had been placed on
probation May 4 for shooting his roommate in a September 1997
bow-and-arrow attack.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of his probation, he was required to meet with a
probation officer twice a month, but he missed at least one of his
first two appointments, and never made another one after that,
according to one high-ranking probation official.
</P>
<P>
   ``He absconded shortly after he was placed,'' said Carmen Bushe,
director of the probation division responsible for Rudiger. ``He
told us he was homeless, so we didn't have much to follow up on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bushe acknowledged that the Sheriff's Department could have put
Rudiger behind bars had her division formally acted to revoke his
probation. But that was never done, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Rudiger's probation was revoked. He was held without
bond after being arraigned on one count of murder along with
charges of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon in
connection with the slashing attacks on San Francisco streets last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Rudiger was arrested after a 48-year-old homeless man was
attacked as he slept in a small Chinatown alley. Police believe
Rudiger also is responsible for the Oct. 29 murder of Shirley
Dillahunty, 48, whose throat was slashed as she slept on a Mission
District sidewalk, and two Oct. 16 nonfatal slashing attacks in
Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Rudiger has admitting responsibility for all four
attacks and, while in custody, claimed to be a 2,000-year-old
vampire who lived off the blood of his victims.
</P>
<P>
   Bushe said probation is almost always revoked in the first 90
days after a person fails to report to the department. But ``some
probation officers are more diligent than others,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Rudiger, who has a history of mental problems, was
permitted to continue to walk the streets for six months after
violating probation and allegedly slashed the throats of four
people has left some in the district attorney's office and
Sheriff's Department wondering how the system broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of supervision allows a guy like this to go around
attacking people?'' asked district attorney's spokesman John
Shanley. ``It raises all sorts of questions.''
</P>
<P>
   An evaluation done by the Probation Department before he pleaded
guilty to shooting his roommate, Myron Scholes, with the makeshift
bow and arrow found that Rudiger ``has serious problems with
controlling his violent tendencies.''

PROTECTING THE LOSERS IN THE GLOBAL SPREAD OF CAPITALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also sent with `f' code) 
(bl) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ In Western capitals there is a rush to rethink the
world. At issue is the end of the so-called Washington consensus,
which has held more or less unchallenged since the end of the Cold
War: that more open markets, freer trade and larger international
capital flows are necessarily good.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst has been disaster that no rally on Wall Street can
quickly undo. The global financial crisis has thrown 20 million
Asians back into poverty in the last year, made 40 percent of the
Russian population poorer than ever, and produced growing
unemployment in Brazil, a country already racked by some of the
greatest disparities between rich and poor in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``International volatility has been such that free-market
capitalism is on the defensive,'' said Robert Hormats, vice
chairman of Goldman Sachs International. In place of the old
certainties lies disquiet.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the disquiet is the growing sense that however
fecund the global exchange of trade, information and money has been
in recent years, this unbridled flow can also be capriciously
destructive. Forms of intervention to control or direct the flow
are therefore being heatedly discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very important debate has begun, sparked by the general
realization that you cannot leave people unprotected before the
global market,'' said Anthony Giddens, the director of the London
School of Economics. ``There is a will to recognize the need for
some new governance of the world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of just what that new governance should be is
creating a world of unusual intellectual flux, one comparable to
the post-1945 era in its quest for some overarching design for
equitable development. Just as the development of the New Deal and
the European welfare state rescued industrial capitalism from its
interwar collapse, so a similar and equally critical quest has now
begun at a global level for cushions to the harsher effects of
electronic capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent economists have suggested a global taxation on
currency speculation, the establishment of a second United Nations
Security Council for economic affairs that would act to avert
disaster in the economic field, limits on international flows of
capital, and setting target zones for exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   But such steps, which have fairly wide support in Europe, tend
to provoke deep suspicion in the United States, although the danger
that further volatility could lead to spreading protectionism and
possible political upheavals is widely recognized in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the disagreement between Americans and
Europeans lies the nature of today's instantaneous world. Has this
new global society amounted to an electronic energizer, as the
Clinton administration has tended to argue, a revolutionary
generator of new wealth, new job possibilities and greater freedom?
</P>
<P>
   Or has the brave new world, as many European intellectuals have
insisted, been no more than a slick reincarnation of the unfettered
capitalism of the 19th century, using new technology to atomize
societies, isolate the poor and advance a new ideology of
exploitation upheld by an ever-wealthier, online global oligarchy?
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an increasingly unequal world,'' said Elmar
Altwater, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin,
``and what we have now understood is that this will continue as
long as there is no political correction. Incomes based on labor
simply have not grown in real terms, even as income based on the
global application of capital has soared. What is needed is more
political intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Fitoussi, an economist and adviser to French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, said: ``If there are systematic losers from
today's global economy, we could be overwhelmed. A way must be
found to bring the Frankenstein of deregulated global financial
markets under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Such references to ``Frankenstein'' in the same breath as
``markets'' makes many American economists grimace. After all, the
United States under Bill Clinton has seen the creation of millions
of new jobs, a vigorous economy that derived 30 percent of its
growth from international expansion and, until recent volatility,
consistently soaring share prices.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, by contrast, high unemployment and increasingly
strained social security systems have bolstered a far darker
vision, popularized by a best seller called ``The Economic Horror''
by French writer Viviane Forrestier. It has sold more than 310,000
copies and been translated into 17 languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame should be quoted on the stock exchange for it is an
important element of profit,'' Ms. Forrestier writes in one of the
milder phrases of her uniformly bleak catalog of contemporary
devastation.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Bourdieu, a French intellectual with a large and
passionate following, a man who is perhaps the nearest figure that
France now has to a Jean-Paul Sartre, has made his name with
relentless and more sophisticated attacks against what Europeans
and Latin Americans generally call ultraliberalism, that is,
unfettered free-market orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   A dapper, soft-spoken man, Bourdieu argues that the central aim
of ``the pure logic of the market'' has been to weaken every
collective group _ the nation itself, the state, labor unions,
cooperatives, associations _ to install what he calls a worldwide
``reign of absolute flexibility'' in which international capital
and multinational corporations dictate terms of employment and
wages. ``Ours is a Darwinian world of insecurity and stress, where
the permanent threat of unemployment creates a permanent state of
precariousness,'' he has written.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for fairness has been strengthened in Europe by the
arrival of governments whose intellectual inspiration comes from
the left: Tony Blair in London, Lionel Jospin in Paris, Massimo
D'Alema in Rome and Gerhard Schroeder in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has also been reinforced by the ravages that the rapid, often
herd-like daily movement of money across frontiers has recently
inflicted on such societies as Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt unmasking of Russia's sham capitalism _ with its
``stock market,'' its ``financiers'' and its privatized companies
beside zero regulation, almost zero tax collection, rampant
asset-stripping and a general absence of the rule of law _ has also
brought home the danger of exporting a modern capitalist market
economy to a society unready for it.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing this and other fiascos, World Bank president James
Wolfensohn said last month, ``We have to learn to have a debate
where mathematics will not dominate humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, too, has noted recently that a quarter of the world's
population now lives in countries with declining growth. He has
begun to talk about the need to ``lift the lives of ordinary
people.'' Still, what form of regulation the market needs and in
what degree remain matters of sharp dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Blair talks about the ``rebirth of progressive politics,'' by
which he seems to mean that the state has an active role to play
after the Thatcher years but one that is highly disciplined and
ultimately aimed at giving everyone a stake in the national
economy. Clinton has proposed a ``third way,'' between capitalism
and socialism.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``third way'' is not new, however, and has been applied
during this century to everything from German social democracy
through Yugoslav economic experiments to attempted reforms in the
Soviet Union during the Gorbachev era. What both Blair's and
Clinton's formulations have in common, though, is the notion that
highly disciplined public entities can bring the necessary balance
to market forces.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Western governments have instructed the World Bank to
direct extra funds to ``the most vulnerable groups in society'' and
provided an extra $90 billion to the International Monetary Fund to
be used to try to pre-empt crises. But these are essentially
short-term band-aids.
</P>
<P>
   More sweeping measures are certain to meet resistance. ``The
last thing the world needs is an economic Security Council at the
United Nations,'' said Hormats of Goldman Sachs. ``If you really
want to undermine confidence, that would do it.'' He added that
limits on flows of capital through controls or regulations should
be approached warily.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krugman of MIT has argued in The New Republic, however,
that pressure to constrain or limit international capital flows
seems certain to grow if the response to crises continues to be
governed by the need to ``mollify market sentiment.'' Krugman says
that cutting interest rates is what is really needed to revive
these economies and give poor people in countries like Brazil a
better chance to make their way.
</P>
<P>
   Such limits on capital flows would be a body blow to the spirit
of American capitalism, which has been so buoyant and dominant
since the Cold War's end. This capitalism has been revolutionary,
introducing millions of people to stock-holding both directly and
through mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   But capitalism elsewhere has also had a much crueler face as
rising poverty rates in Asia, Latin America and Russia
show.``Capitalism survived after World War II,'' said Fitoussi, the
French economist, ``because we invented a system where there were
no consistent losers, everyone gained a little.'' The problem, he
said, is that that is no longer the case.

POETS LEAVING ACADEMY TO PROTEST ABSENCE OF MINORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DINITIA SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two prominent American poets, both of them women,
have resigned as chancellors from the Academy of American Poets, a
venerable body at the symbolic center of the American poetry
establishment, to protest the absence of blacks and other minority
groups on the academy's board of chancellors. The chancellors,
Carolyn Kizer and Maxine Kumin, both of whom have lobbied to admit
minorities to the board, submitted their resignations to academy
president Jonathan Galassi this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a black woman chancellor,'' Ms. Kizer, who
won a Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1985, said in a telephone
interview. Ms. Kizer said she was also upset by a larger problem,
which she defined as ``the insularity among the chancellors, and
the lack of women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the way the collection of chancellors sets itself
apart from the mainstream,'' Ms. Kumin, who won a Pulitzer in 1974,
said in an interview. ``I don't want to see it identified with
elitism. It's very much an East Coast group.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy, which was founded in 1934 by Marie Bullock and is
based in Soho, at 584 Broadway, at Prince Street, promotes poetry
nationally. Its 12-member board of chancellors exists mainly to
administer the Tanning Prize, at $100,000 the country's largest
literary award, and a smaller prize, the Academy Fellowship, of
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The board includes some of the country's best known and most
influential poets, including John Ashbery, Richard Howard, John
Hollander, Jorie Graham, Donald Justice, J.D. McClatchy, Mark
Strand, Mona Van Duyn, David Wagoner and W.S. Merwin. This year the
board awarded the Tanning Prize to A.R. Ammons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always go to the same person again and again,'' said Ms.
Kizer, meaning, she said, that the prize is frequently awarded to
white male poets.
</P>
<P>
   When the first Tanning Prize was awarded in 1994, Ms. Kizer said
she lobbied for it to go to Gwendolyn Brooks, an African-American
poet. The chancellors awarded the prize instead to W.S. Merwin, and
were criticized because Merwin is a chancellor himself. In 1996,
Adrienne Rich won the prize. The other winners have been James Tate
and Anthony Hecht.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1946, when the academy began awarding its annual
fellowship, the prize has been given to only two African-American
poets, Jay Wright and Robert Hayden. Of the 64 Fellowships that
have been awarded, 14 have gone to women. There have been 57
chancellors in all. There has never been a black chancellor, but
there have been 12 women on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kumin said that as vacancies have occurred she has lobbied
for the poet Lucille Clifton, who is black, to be elected. ``We've
just been out voted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Galassi, president of the academy and editor in chief of Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, said of the resignations of Ms. Kumin and Ms.
Kizer: ``I was very sorry that they are doing this at a time when
we are in the process of putting our governing structure through
review.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he would not accept the resignations and that he
would try to persuade both poets to remain as chancellors to help
him instate changes at the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Galassi said the academy was in the process of assembling an ad
hoc committee that ``will look at the constitution of the
chancellors.'' ``The academy has been in the process of broadening
for four or five years, and before that,'' he said. ``We started
the National Poetry Month. We are starting a Poetry Book Club, an
online poetry classroom. They're all outreach programs. They are
very inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be an organization for everyone,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   William Wadsworth, the academy's executive director, added that
the lack of women and minority groups on the board ``has always
been a controversial aspect of the academy.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, German writer Fred Viebahn, who is married to Rita
Dove, a black poet and former Poet Laureate of the United States,
attacked the academy in the International Quarterly for what he
said was ``unapologetic racial `purity' and gross gender
imbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   Viebahn pointed out that the academy had received $250,000 from
the Lila Acheson Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund in 1997, and
criticized the National Endowment for the Arts for awarding the
academy $95,000 this year despite what he called a ``tradition of
race `purity' in its highest ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Galassi called the charge ``totally unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what the academy is doing, and who is working
there, I just don't think you can say it's exclusionary,'' he said.
``But even the appearance of being exclusionary is unfortunate and
needs to be addressed. And that's what we're in the process of
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy's board of directors controls the day-to-day running
of the institution; the chancellors are mainly responsible for the
two prizes. The board has 26 members and only one of them, Jamaica
Kincaid, is black. Seven are women. Until 1987, there were no
blacks or Jews on the board. That year, when Lyn Chase, an heiress
to the Folger coffee fortune, became president of the board, she
began recruiting Jews and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth pointed out that the academy's full-time staff of 10
has several minority group members and administers 160 college
prizes and awards, worth about $92,000, a number of which go to
women and minorities. Among the prizes the academy staff gives are
the Walt Whitman Award, which is $5,000 along with book
distribution worth $35,000. It administers two other book
publication awards, the James Laughlin Award and the Lenore
Marshall Prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chancellors sound like they are the universally recognized
spokespersons for the world of poetry,'' said Ms. Dove, who has
served as a judge for the academy's Walt Whitman award and has
taken part in many academy functions. ``To have an academy where
minorities and women are underrepresented or not represented does
send a subliminal message to the world that there may not be
minorities who are poets or many women who are poets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dove said she had no interest in being a chancellor herself.
``The message the makeup of the board is sending is the message
that we are the ones who hold the power,'' said Ms. Dove, ``and
it's a closed club.''

 &HT;    THOUSANDS OF U.S. TROOPS HEADED FOR PERSIAN GULF
 &HT;    With US-IRAQ-1114.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A total of 21,520 U.S. troops were on their way to
the Persian Gulf Friday to back up America's insistence that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein give up his refusal to cooperate with
United Nations weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman said some of the troops already were
scheduled to be deployed to the gulf to rotate with personnel who
were stationed there before Saddam precipitated the most recent
crisis by refusing to allow the inspectors to visit suspected
weapons of mass destruction sites.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear when the troops scheduled to return to the
United States actually would leave, however.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said the breakdown of new troops by service was:
Navy, 12,000; Army, 4,920; Air Force, 2,400; and Marine Corps,
2,200.
</P>
<P>
   The largest contingent of Army troops to be deployed is from
Georgia's Fort Stewart, which sent 3,600 troops from its 3rd
Infantry Division to Kuwait. Another 400 soldiers from Fort Drum,
N.Y., were sent with Patriot missile units.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade at Fort Bliss,
Texas, was sending slightly over 900 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Navy personnel were primarily members of the crews of ships in a
carrier battle group formed around the nuclear powered aircraft
carrier, U.S.S. Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The group consists of two guided missile cruisers, two guided
missile destroyers, one conventional destroyer, a guided missile
frigate, two attack submarines and four support vessels. The
Enterprise would carry from 70 to 75 strike aircraft, the Defense
Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise sailed from Norfolk Naval Station to relieve a
battle group headed by the U.S.S. Eisenhower. However, the
Eisenhower battle group may remain in the Persian Gulf ``for now,''
a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force was sending six B-52 bombers from Barksdale Air
Force Base, La., and six from Minot Air Force Base, N.D.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 24 Air Force F-16s and 12 F-15s were on their way
to the Persian Gulf, along with six B-1 bombers and 12 F-117
Stealth fighters from Holliman Air Force Base, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Support aircraft, such as KC-135 refueling tankers and C-130
transport planes, also were dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Marines deployed to the region were from Camp
Pendleton in California, but most were en route aboard the
helicopter assault ship U.S.S. Belleau Wood, which is based in
Sasebo, Japan.

NO EMMY YET FOR MEN'S STYLE ON TV, BUT STAY TUNED 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 15) 
(bl) 
 By ROBERT MORITZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ratings are bad. The reviews are worse. There is,
however, a bright side to the otherwise dim lineup of network shows
that made debuts this fall: television has finally discovered a
sense of men's style.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions _ Don Johnson in ``Miami Vice'' and David
Hyde Pierce in ``Frasier'' _ the networks have never been known for
a fashion sense with male characters. Typically, they have offered
a bland parade of white sneakers, tool belts and goofy sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be hope. This fall has a batch of
designer-friendly male leads, including a Gucciesque avenger, a
``Fantasy Island'' host who looks like an Armani advertisement and
even a Dries van Noten-influenced Roman god of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``The male characters are being allowed to look groovy,'' said
Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York and author
of ``Confessions of a Window Dresser'' (Penguin Studio, $40), a
cheeky account of his life in fashion. ``Men's designer wear has
become less avant-garde in the last few years, so it's much easier
for a male character to wear fashion without being branded a
hairdresser or, worse still, a window dresser.''
</P>
<P>
   Doonan is accustomed to appraising celebrity style. He gained
fame and occasional notoriety for holiday window displays at
Barneys that placed sculptured caricatures of famous people in
designer outfits and compromising positions. They included Tammy
Faye Bakker, Madonna and Margaret Thatcher (wearing a ``Tory Toy''
belt buckle). On a fall afternoon in his Greenwich Village
apartment, Doonan turned his attention to fashion-forward moments
from the fall television collection.
</P>
<P>
   Extricating the VCR remote control from beneath a porcelain Kate
Moss figurine, Doonan began by screening episodes of the NBC sitcom
``Encore! Encore!'' In the show, Nathan Lane, once a portly drag
queen in ``La Cage aux Folles,'' is a skirt-chasing, washed-up
opera singer who returns to his family's Northern California
vineyard. ``They should rename this show `Ascots and Novelty
Vests,''' Doonan said.
</P>
<P>
   The wardrobe of neckwear accessories and smoking jackets means
to portray Lane as a cosmopolitan Lothario, a fish out of water.
``It's dandyism without the savoir-faire,'' Doonan said. ``The
character is a cultivated connoisseur, and that's supposed to be
represented by all this puffy detailing. The reality is he's being
strangled by his ascot.''
</P>
<P>
   To Doonan a more successful example of dandyism was Ricardo
Montalban, the star of the original ``Fantasy Island,'' who wore
his white suits as smoothly as his Latin charm. That 1970s camp
classic has been updated. Replacing the island's benevolent host
and impresario is Malcolm McDowell. The British actor, known for
his evil wit, is best remembered as the sadistic gang member
wearing a bowler in Stanley Kubrick's ``Clockwork Orange.''
</P>
<P>
   Doonan popped in the pilot episode of the new ``Fantasy
Island.'' It was instantly apparent that the show has taken a dark
twist. McDowell, in black double-breasted Armani, confronts a
closet full of immaculately preserved white suits and orders them
to be burned. ``They're a little dated,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But aren't white suits very much back in style at the moment?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, white would have been great, but in terms of the
nudge-nudge, wink-wink, Ricardo Montalban thing, the black works
fine,'' Doonan said. ``Very fashionable.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out the character's lack of collar stays and his
well-fitted double-breasted suits, a style he said people don't
wear often enough. ``Very groovy _ it shows that older dudes can
look just as fashionable as younger dudes,'' said Doonan, 46, who
was wearing a fake chinchilla vest, a T-shirt and vintage jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was the latest addition to medical dramas, CBS' ``L.A.
Doctors.'' In this series about a band of merry doctors pursuing
the dream of a small, caring practice, Ken Olin stars as a
Jaguar-driving, playboy physician with a weakness for monochromatic
tie-shirt combinations. The goal appears to be a visually soothing
fashion statement for a character who is at once a clotheshorse and
dedicated caregiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a watered-down version of Gucci four years ago,''
Doonan said. He also cited the role of solid colors on television.
``The best way to tell who the main character is _ look for the one
wearing the solid blue shirt with the solid blue tie. The rest of
the men are in Dockers world.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``I expect my doctor to be a little more tweedy,'' he
said, adding, ``Maybe that's because I grew up in England, where
doctors dress either like politicians or priests.'' Watching
television in South London in the '70s, Doonan was first impressed
by television fashion on the sitcom ``Sanford and Son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Weren't they protogrunge?'' he asked. ``In America, everything
on TV was upscale. It was pretty beyond to have people looking sort
of ratty.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fashion watershed for Doonan was ``Starsky and Hutch.''
``I just remember how shockingly tight their clothes were,'' he
said, inserting into the VCR an episode of ABC's ``Vengeance
Unlimited.'' In this high-testosterone crime drama, Michael Madsen
plays a man of mystery out to avenge the unjustly wronged in a
vintage muscle car. His menacing presence is augmented by sartorial
discipline. He wears two outfits: a dark suit with open-collar
sport shirt, and a black leather jacket with open-collar sport
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what people should look like on TV,'' Doonan declared.
``It's a noirish show, and the look is stylized just enough to
match. He has a sort of a louche, Calvin y Gucci thing that
enforces the identity of the enigma. It's also a smart move to keep
him out of ties.'' Doonan approved of the retro-'70s sex appeal.
``He could wear that to Balthazar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moving on, ``Sports Night,'' ABC's ESPN-inspired sitcom, offers
a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of two young and eligible
anchors on a cable sports newscast. Fashionably speaking, the actor
Josh Charles gets the better of the deal, with less conservative
on-the-air suits and funkier off-the-air casual wear than his
co-star, Peter Krause.
</P>
<P>
   ``As anchors, they're looking very Today's Man,'' Doonan said,
alluding to the generic suits and ties on the show. ``They're much
more fashionable when they're not on-air.'' Of Charles, he said,
``They're going for that Ethan Hawke kind of look _ disheveled, a
little bit rebellious _ which is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Doonan decided that ``Sports Night'' was a good model for men
wondering how to dress on casual Fridays, a day of the week he
deplores. ``Oh, casual Fridays are a nightmare,'' he said. ``Have
you ever visited one of those buildings downtown? You should see
what people wear. Between jeans with a sweatshirt and a suit,
American men have no idea what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   An exception, however, is Jeremy Piven on ABC's ``Cupid,'' who
floats effortlessly from one fashion realm to the next. The god of
romance has been expelled from Mount Olympus to Chicago, where his
penance requires him to make love connections between 100 couples.
If the premise seems implausible, so does his wardrobe. The first
episode found Piven in a psychiatric ward with $170 in his pocket
and a $1,000 sharkskin suit on his back, complete with red Shantung
tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right off a runway,'' Doonan said. ``He looks like Harry
Connick Jr. going to an awards show _ and that's a good look if
you're a deity.''
</P>
<P>
   Doonan also gave high marks to Cupid's casual wear, including a
peasant sweater-and-coat combination. Doonan said that if he could
package it, he would label it ``late '90s groovy for men.'' He
pronounced Piven the most fashionable character of the new season.
</P>
<P>
   When looking for personal inspiration, however, Doonan said he
wouldn't tune in to ``Cupid,'' or to any other new show. He'd
rather flip to his old favorites. ``The only two programs I watch
regularly are `Cops' and `America's Most Wanted,''' he said. ``The
drama is incredibly real and poignant, and you get tons of styling
ideas.''

   Mutual fund shareholders keep a sharp eye on managers for
``style drift'' _ straying outside stated investing practices _ but
rarely has a manager's personal style drifted as far as Peter
Young's. Young, 40, a former manager of several Morgan Grenfell
mutual funds, showed up in a London court last week dressed as a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Young is scheduled to go on trial next year on fraud charges.
Prosecutors say he set up dummy corporations to hide his funds'
ownership of stakes in small, unlisted companies in violation of
the funds' charters.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, which owns Morgan Grenfell, dismissed him in 1996
and has since set aside $700 million to pay fines and restitution
to the funds' investors.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Young did not return calls. But The Daily Telegraph
of London described his attire as ``a light brown jumper with a
pattern of violet and blue pansies over a flowing white dress with
red and orange floral prints.'' It added that he carried a coral
pink handbag that matched his lipstick.

   Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chief executive of IBM, is touchy
about his reputation as a tough manager. Fortune magazine found
that out after it ran a generally glowing cover article on his
resurrection of the company in April 1997: ``He's Smart. He's Not
Nice. Lou Gerstner Isn't Easy to Love, but You Have to Respect
Him.'' Ever since, Gerstner has banned IBM employees from
cooperating with Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   But at a banquet on Monday in the Rose Main Reading Room of the
New York Public Library, he displayed his softer side. Though a
titan in an industry that has lured millions to computer screens,
Gerstner said, ``I don't think reasonable people are going to forgo
the pleasure of reading a book _ or better yet, holding a child and
reading her a book.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he wanted to read his ``68 unpublished,
unfinished, unpolished poems,'' but was discouraged by two table
companions, Mary Jane Salk, the date of Michael Bloomberg, founder
of Bloomberg L.P., and Toni Goodale, wife of James Goodale, a
partner at Willkie, Farr &AMP; Gallagher, the New York law firm.
</P>
<P>
   If he even tried, he said, the two ``promised to kill me.''
Gerstner was honored with four others for contributions to the
library.

   Marjorie M. Scardino, chief executive of Pearson PLC, is used to
the slights that come from being the only woman executive in the
room. In January 1997, when she became the first American and the
first woman to head Pearson, the British media group that owns The
Financial Times and Penguin publishing, eyebrows rose in the
male-dominated City and the stock fell 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the stock has soared, and so has Ms. Scardino's
reputation. Last week, in a speech at the Knight-Bagehot Fellowship
Dinner at the Sheraton New York, Ms. Scardino, a Texas native,
talked about being the ``first woman'' in another setting _ the
Conagra board room in Omaha, where she became a director in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by ``white men in suits,'' she recalled being told,
``I hope you don't feel too much like a token woman.'' No, she
replied, ``I'm getting used to this woman thing.'' The man pressed
on: ``Well, what's got the board in a complete dither is that you
are the first Democrat to get within 100 miles of here.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to slashing assets and consolidating businesses at
Pearson, Mrs. Scardino boasts another accomplishment: ``I've put
smiling pictures in our annual report.''

   When Robert Crandall retired as chief of American Airlines in
May, he said he wanted to take a year off. But already, Crandall,
62, is popping up on radar screens of companies looking for a new
boss. People close to Electronic Data Systems, the
computer-services giant founded by H. Ross Perot, say Crandall is
being considered as the new No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Though not the leading candidate, Crandall has an impressive
track record as the man who turned the AMR Corp., American's
parent, into an information-technology power. The biggest obstacle
to his taking the helm at EDS is probably the noncompete agreement
he signed when he left AMR.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall was sailing to the Caribbean last week and could not be
reached for comment. People at EDS said the company might be
willing to buy Crandall's freedom from AMR. One friend said
Crandall would probably take the job because his wife, Jan, was
already tired of having him around the house.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recurrent bouts with heavy windswept rain will plague the
Northwest Coast this weekend as a series of disturbances arrive in
a vigorous onshore flow. Local flooding is expected near some
rivers and streams in western and central Washington. Snow levels
in the northern Cascades will be near 8,000 feet early Saturday but
will fall below 7,000 feet by Saturday night. The interior
Northwest will be rather cloudy with some showers, especially near
west-facing slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Dry weather will prevail over the Southwest as high pressure
remain strong over the Great Basin. Patchy valley fog will
dissipate by midday in central California. Otherwise, abundant
sunshine will bathe the region.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding rain of recent days will end over eastern Texas
although clouds and patchy rain will linger into the afternoon.
Meanwhile, bands of heavy showers will accompany low pressure as it
moves across the extreme southern Mississippi Valley. Rain amounts
of 1 to 3 inches will be common near the central Gulf Coast by
early Sunday. Lighter showers will spread east from Alabama to the
Carolinas later Saturday and Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Breezes from the southwest ahead of a frontal system will draw
milder air into the Northeast. The milder air will be preceded by
scattered light valley rain and mountain snow showers in northern
New England. Elsewhere in the Northeast, clouds will be mixed with
some sun, especially near the coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the front, gusty winds from the northwest will
deliver seasonably colder air to the western Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Northwestern Rain
</P>
<P>
   Torrents of rain fell near the Washington coast on Friday and
several more inches of rain is expected to be measured along the
east slopes of the Cascades this weekend. The Pacific Northwest's
rainy season is now underway. The season for Northwestern rain
starts in the middle of autumn, when the average position of the
jet stream finally dips south over the area directing a parade of
Pacific storms across the region. The jet stream will be forced
farther south by deepening Arctic chill during the next few weeks
resulting in the beginning of the rainy season along the coast of
California.

 &HT;    THOUSANDS OF U.S. TROOPS HEADED FOR PERSIAN GULF
 &HT;    With US-IRAQ-1114.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A total of 21,520 U.S. troops were on their way to
the Persian Gulf Friday to back up America's insistence that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein give up his refusal to cooperate with
United Nations weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman said some of the troops already were
scheduled to be deployed to the gulf to rotate with personnel who
were stationed there before Saddam precipitated the most recent
crisis by refusing to allow the inspectors to visit suspected
weapons of mass destruction sites.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear when the troops scheduled to return to the
United States actually would leave, however.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said the breakdown of new troops by service was:
Navy, 12,000; Army, 4,920; Air Force, 2,400; and Marine Corps,
2,200.
</P>
<P>
   The largest contingent of Army troops to be deployed is from
Georgia's Fort Stewart, which sent 3,600 troops from its 3rd
Infantry Division to Kuwait. Another 400 soldiers from Fort Drum,
N.Y., were sent with Patriot missile units.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade at Fort Bliss,
Texas, was sending slightly over 900 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Navy personnel were primarily members of the crews of ships in a
carrier battle group formed around the nuclear powered aircraft
carrier, U.S.S. Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The group consists of two guided missile cruisers, two guided
missile destroyers, one conventional destroyer, a guided missile
frigate, two attack submarines and four support vessels. The
Enterprise would carry from 70 to 75 strike aircraft, the Defense
Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise sailed from Norfolk Naval Station to relieve a
battle group headed by the U.S.S. Eisenhower. However, the
Eisenhower battle group may remain in the Persian Gulf ``for now,''
a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force was sending six B-52 bombers from Barksdale Air
Force Base, La., and six from Minot Air Force Base, N.D.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 24 Air Force F-16s and 12 F-15s were on their way
to the Persian Gulf, along with six B-1 bombers and 12 F-117
Stealth fighters from Holliman Air Force Base, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Support aircraft, such as KC-135 refueling tankers and C-130
transport planes, also were dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Marines deployed to the region were from Camp
Pendleton in California, but most were en route aboard the
helicopter assault ship U.S.S. Belleau Wood, which is based in
Sasebo, Japan.

<P>
   When the bulls run, these days, they really sprint. That's the
gist of the most recent data from Investors Intelligence, a
newsletter in New Rochelle, N.Y., that conducts a weekly poll of
the market sentiment of some 130 private investment newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   According to Investors Intelligence, 53.1 percent of the
newsletters expressed bullish sentiment during the week ended Nov.
7, up from 47.8 percent the week before. Bearish sentiment among
the newsletters declined to 35.4 percent from 38.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bullish streak represents a remarkably sudden turnaround
from this year's trough of newsletter optimism on Sept. 18, when
bulls accounted for just 36.4 percent of those polled and bears
47.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen so quickly in this market,'' said Michael Burke,
the editor. ``What used to take months, now takes weeks. We've gone
from being a bearish extreme to being a bullish extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the eighth consecutive week that optimism has risen.
``That's a streak that's very rare,'' Burke said, adding that the
last time optimism increased eight weeks in a row was in the fall
of 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Many technical analysts view rampant optimism as a bad portent
for the market because it suggests that bulls have already spent
their spare cash, leaving none to fuel a further run-up.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the turn in sentiment is partly a function of the
Federal Reserve Board's rate-cutting and the market's recent good
fortune _ ``don't fight the Fed and don't fight the tape,'' as
Burke puts it. But he, for one, noting that there is still ample
bearishness in the numbers, is not ready to hoist a warning flag.
``We'd view this as neutral to slightly positive,'' he said.

   A Value Player Finds an Advertising Bargain
</P>
<P>
   When William Miller III buys a stock, many investors take
notice, because it usually means he thinks a company is a good bet
for years to come. Last year, Legg Mason Value Trust, the $5.7
billion fund that Miller has watched over for 16 years, had a
turnover rate of just 13 percent _ meaning that the fund still owns
about seven of every eight stocks that it held a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at an investment conference sponsored by Legg Mason
in New York, Miller revealed his latest bet: WPP Group, a
London-based advertising and public relations firm. Miller bought
27 million shares, or roughly 6 percent of WPP's stock, making him
one of the company's three biggest shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that WPP's shares have run up nearly 50 percent in
little more than a month, Miller said; they still are trading at
``a giveaway'' valuation based on the company's ``huge cash flow.''
To make way for WPP in the Value Trust portfolio, Miller said he
sold 6.5 million shares of Columbia/HCA Healthcare, the troubled
hospital company.

 &HT;    WITNESS: MICROSOFT FORECLOSES BROWSER WARS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. has unnecessarily crafted Windows
98, its flagship product, to make it impossible for users to delete
the Internet Explorer browser, according to testimony by a
government witness that was released Friday
</P>
<P>
   in the antitrust trial against the software maker.
</P>
<P>
   In 47 pages of direct testimony released by the Justice
Department, computer consultant Glenn Weadock argued that ``many
organizations wish to use browser products and have compelling
reasons to standardize on a single such product, but want to select
that product independently of any particular operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft has effectively removed that choice from the
marketplace, the government witness maintained, to the detriment of
the Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator, which has rapidly
lost market share to Microsoft's integrated offering.
</P>
<P>
   Weadock is president of Independent Software Inc., a small firm
based in Golden, Colo., a Denver suburb. Last January, in an
earlier antitrust round with Microsoft, he also served as an expert
witness, seeking to show that Windows 95, an earlier operating
system, and its browsing tool, were essentially separate products.
</P>
<P>
   While the government won that round in the federal district
court, the rulings were largely reversed on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   To open the trial's fifth week, Weadock will appear in court on
Monday to be cross-examined on his recorded testimony. On Friday,
Microsoft responded to the testimony with a statement that ``there
are real and tangible benefits to the integration of Internet
Explorer technologies into Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   The company claimed that Weadock's testimony ``offers only an
opinion formed from talking to a hand-picked list of companies and
individuals who already support the government's allegations. It
ignores the wishes of the vast majority of
</P>
<P>
   customers and developers who use this technology every day.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As Weadock sees it, some organizations, having standardized on
Windows 95 for their operating system needs, have sought at some
cost to remove Internet Explorer from their personal computers by
either deleting access to Internet Explorer or by standardizing on
the original version of Windows 95, which did not come with the
browser.
</P>
<P>
   But, he adds, organizations that have moved to Windows 98 or who
are considering doing so ``are confronted with the inability to
remove Internet Explorer from the operating system, and accordingly
view themselves as having little or no choice but to standardize on
Internet Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   In creating that locked code, the government argues, Microsoft
has behaved in an anti-competitive manner and deserves to be
punished.
</P>
<P>
   Weadock cited a variety of reasons why the high-tech industry
would be better off with a diverse climate in which Microsoft was
no longer king of the browser hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, he noted, wish to deny some of its employees
access to any browser. Others want to standardize on a browser
across many operating system platforms, while still others may be
concerned with compatibility with other custom applications or
digital security systems.
</P>
<P>
   For all these reasons, Weadock argues, ``managers generally do
not want to have their selection of browser products linked to
their operating system decisions.''

GIRL SCOUTS USE MARKETING SKILLS IN COOKIE SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By HUBERT B. HERRING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Down a drab corridor in the basement of the Empire
State Building, in an austere, glaringly lighted employee dining
room, six security guards chatted at a table on Wednesday morning.
In front of them sat a box of Girl Scout Thin Mints.
</P>
<P>
   On the far side of a flimsy partition, Robert Stockard, a
cheery, upbeat sales pro, was in the midst of a training session.
He had come here on this rainy morning to try to impart a
professional's touch to a group of Girl Scouts, ages 7 to 11, who
were about to head off into the cruel, man-eat-cookie world _ the
lobby _ to sell some Samoas, Thin Mints and Trefoils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selling is a lot of acting,'' Stockard told them. ``Now my
partner, Maria, is going to play a tough cookie.'' Up stepped Maria
Massaro, who turned out to be not such a tough cookie after all.
Stockard, the designated cookie-seller, made his pitch, and she
smilingly demurred, saying, ``I don't eat chocolate.'' (Stockard,
in a stage whisper: ``She really loves chocolate.'') But Ms.
Massaro quickly became a pushover, buying box after box of whatever
he offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notice,'' Stockard said, ``that I didn't ask, `Would you like
to buy?' but `How many would you like to buy?''' Try as he might,
he couldn't keep the odd bit of sales jargon from bubbling to the
surface: ``When I ask, `Do you have any friends who want cookies?'
that's what we call the final close.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls joined the role-playing, and they too proved to be
soft touches, eagerly buying even when the whole pitch was a faint
``Would you like to buy some cookies?''
</P>
<P>
   They were having fun now. It had not taken long to break through
their shyness. Stockard, president of Sales Staffers International
of Andover, Mass., had started with a hearty ``Ready to have some
fun?'' Eliciting a chorus of muffled affirmatives, he then asked
what the girls wanted to raise money for. One girl said, ``Disney
World,'' and then Stephanie Rivera, a tiny, black-haired 7-year-old
from the Bronx, murmured something indecipherable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to do bikes with lobsters?'' Stockard asked
incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   He leaned close to Stephanie; she whispered something, and
Stockard stood up and clarified matters. ``Oh, you want to do your
nails, buy dresses and go to the Red Lobster,'' he said. Stephanie
gave a faint nod.
</P>
<P>
   The Girl Scouts would seem to be in scant need of sales advice;
nationwide, they sold 190 million boxes last year. (Local councils
set prices and keep profits, so no dollar figures were available.
But do the math: This is a half-billion-dollar business.)
</P>
<P>
   Stockard, unawed by such numbers, plunged ahead with his
``cookie wheel,'' a nine-step sales process. Step 1 was ``Smile,''
and Stockard asked the girls why that was important. Kandis Bennet,
a self-assured 11-year-old from Queens, responded quickly, ``To
make a good impression.'' Very good, Kandis.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling all the way, Stockard, 40, led them along the wheel,
through Step 4, ``We now have cookies for people on special
diets''; Step 7, ``Are you sure you ordered enough boxes?'' to the
final, indispensable Step 9, ``Thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven girls _ resplendent in brown or green uniforms _ took
this all in with varying degrees of attentiveness, the younger ones
clearly with less weighty thoughts on their roving minds.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to head upstairs to the lobby, amid murmurs of
``They got more than us'' as the samples were gathered. What did
Stephanie, say, glean from her half-hour or so of training? ``Be
polite,'' she said with a shrug, and then, more gleefully, ``Get
some money.'' How many would she sell today? ``A whole bunch,'' she
said spiritedly.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of truth was at hand. In the lobby, 100 cartons of
cookies were stacked against one wall, and the girls lined boxes up
meticulously on a table.
</P>
<P>
   Corrine Rivera, Stephanie's twin, had removed one of her shiny
black shoes and nearly tumbled as she danced playfully on the
polished floor. A tiny figure in the spacious lobby, she seemed
more badge-covered uniform than girl.
</P>
<P>
   A workman on a ladder putting up a banner for the event, dubbed
``Turning Cookies Into Dough,'' called over, ``Do you take credit
cards?''
</P>
<P>
   Jade Randall, a sharp 10-year-old who had just made the day's
first sale, eyeing the $10 bill closely through thick glasses, shot
back, ``No, just cash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have come on payday, then,'' the workman countered
jovially.
</P>
<P>
   The table ready, some girls started making their pitch, the
nine-step script usually crumbling to ``Want to buy some cookies?''
They soon discovered that the Empire State Building crowd was not a
pushover like Ms. Massaro. Some passers-by gave puzzled looks;
others walked with the stony obliviousness that New Yorkers have
polished to a high art. ``We're just looking for the observatory
elevator,'' one flustered woman said by way of a no.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin Faraday, 8, at the suggestion that potential customers
were getting by unpitched, said with a firm sense of territory,
``We're getting them from this aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockard, born salesman, could not for the life of him stay out
of the fray. ``Make any sales yet, ladies?'' he asked. Or, ``Good
try, girls!'' Often he made a pitch himself. ``I can't help it,''
he said, grinning. Once he reported excitedly, ``That girl upsold a
customer.'' Upsold? Uh-oh. Jargon alert. ``Got her to buy more than
she'd planned,'' he hurriedly translated.
</P>
<P>
   And when a woman asked, ``Do you have any low-fat?'' he was in
trainer's heaven. ``I love it when they follow the script,'' he
exulted.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually customers materialized. ``Can we just buy some?'' one
woman asked sheepishly amid the banners and cameras. ``I have a
list,'' another said as she scooped up eight or 10 boxes. And
another: ``I heard you were down here and I came running.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the professionally honed sales pitch help? ``It was the
smiles,'' one man said. ``Always effective.'' But another said
gruffly, ``It's the product, not the sales pitch,'' as he snared
his Thin Mints _ the top seller nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're $3 a box?'' one customer said in mock horror, and then
added, ``Oh, Girl Scouts _ wonderful organization!'' Yes, $3 is a
lot for an 8- or 10-ounce box (which costs the organization 82
cents), but the good cause reels them in.
</P>
<P>
   Near noon, Jade asked for the time _ not because she was tired,
but so she would know whether to say ``Good morning'' or ``Good
afternoon.'' As the day wore on, the girls did grow weary, and by
lunch time, with the lobby hopping, it was mostly the troop leaders
doing the selling. Half the 100 cartons had vanished. By day's end,
nearly all had been sold.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So what is Stockard's angle? Is his donated training just a
publicity stunt for Sales Staffers, a private company that provides
training, marketing services and sales representatives to large
corporations? He dispelled that idea convincingly. ``I was a Scout
as a kid,'' he said. ``I saw how much parents helped. Now we want
to do anything we can to help these girls' confidence levels. It's
nice to see their eyes light up.''
</P>
<P>
   Why seek publicity then? ``We want to make our employees proud,
and to have clients see what we're doing _ we'd like them to give
something back to society.'' The children, he said, ``are our
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Cheuvront, public relations director for the Girl Scout
Council of Greater New York, added: ``The real value is to learn
how to set goals, do budgeting, meet goals. These skills are
transferable to all aspects of their lives.'' She had offered the
girls a real-world use: ``You can use these sales skills to
convince your teacher you deserve an A.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Massaro, president of Sales Consultants of Boston and
co-founder of Stockard's company, echoed the upbeat tone but
refined the goal, saying: ``I hope a few girls are inspired today
to go into sales. You don't grow up wanting to be a sales rep,
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kandis, at the suggestion that she might go into sales, crinkled
her nose in a distinct negative. Then she enthusiastically got back
to her selling.

 &HT;    WITNESS: MICROSOFT FORECLOSES BROWSER WARS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. has unnecessarily crafted Windows
98, its flagship product, to make it impossible for users to delete
the Internet Explorer browser, according to testimony by a
government witness that was released Friday
</P>
<P>
   in the antitrust trial against the software maker.
</P>
<P>
   In 47 pages of direct testimony released by the Justice
Department, computer consultant Glenn Weadock argued that ``many
organizations wish to use browser products and have compelling
reasons to standardize on a single such product, but want to select
that product independently of any particular operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft has effectively removed that choice from the
marketplace, the government witness maintained, to the detriment of
the Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator, which has rapidly
lost market share to Microsoft's integrated offering.
</P>
<P>
   Weadock is president of Independent Software Inc., a small firm
based in Golden, Colo., a Denver suburb. Last January, in an
earlier antitrust round with Microsoft, he also served as an expert
witness, seeking to show that Windows 95, an earlier operating
system, and its browsing tool, were essentially separate products.
</P>
<P>
   While the government won that round in the federal district
court, the rulings were largely reversed on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   To open the trial's fifth week, Weadock will appear in court on
Monday to be cross-examined on his recorded testimony. On Friday,
Microsoft responded to the testimony with a statement that ``there
are real and tangible benefits to the integration of Internet
Explorer technologies into Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   The company claimed that Weadock's testimony ``offers only an
opinion formed from talking to a hand-picked list of companies and
individuals who already support the government's allegations. It
ignores the wishes of the vast majority of
</P>
<P>
   customers and developers who use this technology every day.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As Weadock sees it, some organizations, having standardized on
Windows 95 for their operating system needs, have sought at some
cost to remove Internet Explorer from their personal computers by
either deleting access to Internet Explorer or by standardizing on
the original version of Windows 95, which did not come with the
browser.
</P>
<P>
   But, he adds, organizations that have moved to Windows 98 or who
are considering doing so ``are confronted with the inability to
remove Internet Explorer from the operating system, and accordingly
view themselves as having little or no choice but to standardize on
Internet Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   In creating that locked code, the government argues, Microsoft
has behaved in an anti-competitive manner and deserves to be
punished.
</P>
<P>
   Weadock cited a variety of reasons why the high-tech industry
would be better off with a diverse climate in which Microsoft was
no longer king of the browser hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, he noted, wish to deny some of its employees
access to any browser. Others want to standardize on a browser
across many operating system platforms, while still others may be
concerned with compatibility with other custom applications or
digital security systems.
</P>
<P>
   For all these reasons, Weadock argues, ``managers generally do
not want to have their selection of browser products linked to
their operating system decisions.''

SITE-SEEING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Getting around Los Angeles may get easier in the
near future, thanks to the debut of one city directory site and the
revamping of another.
</P>
<P>
   With a big party in, of all places, Santa Monica, a new Los
Angeles-oriented Web site debuted recently. With any luck, LA.com
(at www.la.com) will be around awhile, because the site has some
good resources to offer for those of us living in and around the
City of Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherman Oaks-based company has partnered with L.A. Weekly,
Variety and Comedy.com to provide an array of entertainment, dining
and lifestyle-oriented material, the sort of stuff that's common on
city directory sites.
</P>
<P>
   But LA.com also offers such offbeat additions as a wedding
planner site, travel and hotel connections; auto dealers; chat
rooms; a dating service; gossip and legal columnists; local news;
information about high school athletes; traffic reports; area radio
stations; coming conventions and attractions; and even free e-mail
with the LA.com address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's everything that's L.A.,'' said LA.com producer
Adam Rogas. ``It's an all-encompassing city guide for L.A. and the
area, moving a little into Orange County and some nearby resorts.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's owners recently sold off their first city guide,
Vegas.com, to start LA.com, said president David Ezra. Proceeds
from that sale are financing the new venture and a planned similar
venture in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   LA.com is taking on some of the same territory that Microsoft
has been trying to cover over the past two years with its Sidewalk
service, which recently was revamped.
</P>
<P>
   Sidewalk (www.sidewalk.com) has concentrated on local arts and
entertainment information in nine cities, including San Diego, San
Francisco and Seattle, though not Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Though its sites have been busy, Microsoft is now expanding them
to be useful to people who don't live in the nine Sidewalk cities,
Sidewalk product manager Gayle Troberman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love Sidewalk as far as it goes,'' Troberman said.
``But there's a whole other set of decisions people have to make.
There's a universal sense of not having enough time to get things
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The big addition is consumer information on a wide variety of
durable goods and products in categories such as home electronics,
sports equipment, cars and computers. Sidewalk features buyers'
guides, reviews and links to local and online sellers of those
goods, said Moya Gollaher, Sidewalk's San Diego site general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   The sites also feature localized Yellow Pages directories,
Gollaher said, and provide a map and directions to nearby
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other nice touches include a fairly sophisticated search ability
that will allow you to choose companies based on such factors as
parking and delivery services.
</P>
<P>
   With research indicating that more and more people regularly
consult the Internet to research products and services, Microsoft
thinks it has a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one good place to do consumer homework on purchases
that might affect other people (such as family) other than
yourself,'' Troberman said. ``We can solve a lot of problems for a
lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   IT'S A WIRED WORLD: It sounded a bit like the recent Apple
Computer commercials honoring ``the dreamers and the doers,'' but
there was no arguing with who Wired magazine chose to spotlight for
its Wired 25 in a party this week in a stunning mansion atop a
ridge in Silver Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The event included many of the 25 ``dreamers, inventors,
mavericks, leaders'' whom the magazine chose to spotlight for their
visionary attempts to change the way the world works.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes the well-known (Apple CEO Steve Jobs,
billionaire philanthropist George Soros, Zapatista leader
Subcomandante Marcos, Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi),
the techno-evangelists (Gutenberg Project founder Michael Hart,
spread-spectrum radio champion Dave Hughes), the scientists
(geneticist Reinhold Rau, quantum computing's David Deutsch), even
smart machines (the Honda P3 robot, artificial intelligence pioneer
Doug Lenat's Cyc).
</P>
<P>
   It also includes some Hollywood players, such as Doonesbury
creator Garry Trudeau and movie director Robert Altman, who are
collaborating on a TV show about the computer business, and Disney
Online president Jake Winebaum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they're going down (in history) as a genius or
a crackpot,'' Wired editor Kevin Kelly said of the honorees.
``Sometimes even trying is enough to change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney fellow Danny Hillis also spoke at the party, quoting
management guru Peter Drucker: ``He said people who are
monomaniacs, who are trying to change the world, are almost
certainly doomed to failure. He then went on to point out that
everybody else is doomed to failure as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which was recently bought by Conde Nast, seems to
have been in a list-making mode in recent issues. In October, it
picked the people influencing Hollywood's future, concentrating on
the digital-effects people who are making synthespians and
computer-generated images part of the new reality while proclaiming
Steven Spielberg ``boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the local figures tabbed by Wired were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Special-effects supercouple Jeff Kleiser and Diana Walczak,
whose Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co. has a Hollywood office.
Kleiser, who attended the Wired 25 party, said his company has just
about completed work on Universal Studios' smashing new Spiderman
ride in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tomlinson Holman, a University of Southern California
professor who has turned his influential work on movie sound into
his own company, THM Corp., with a desktop system that reproduces a
movie's audio the way it sounds in a theater.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ken Williams, who heads Sony Pictures Entertainment's in-house
special-effects house.
</P>
<P>
   What was interesting to note, however, was how many of the
Hollywood 3.0 list were people whose companies aren't anywhere near
Los Angeles. The implications for the region's economy and primacy
in entertainment are worth pondering.
</P>
<P>
   BOWIE WANTS YOUR LYRICS: David Bowie is undergoing yet another
transformation these days, this time into an Internet music
pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he the first rock star to create his own Internet
service provider (so you can have his name in your e-mail address),
he now is running a contest on his Web site (at
www.davidbowie.com!) where fans can help finish a song he has
partially completed.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie has written all of the music, and the lyrics for the
chorus. Help him finish the lyrics, and you can earn songwriting
credit and eternal fame. A link at the site allows you to hear the
half-done song.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie also is one of several artists creating online music
``channels,'' consisting of 100 to 200 favorite songs from their
own catalog and those of musicians who influenced them, said Brett
Atwood, RealNetworks' editor of music services.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the artists also are taping comments, explaining
their choices, to be played between songs, Atwood said. The
channels are popping up all over the Internet as a way to draw fans
to Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Toy giant Hasbro has started a site (www.hasbrocollectors.com)
for people who collect its action figures, beginning with an online
charity auction of some pretty nifty collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the coolest offering is the chance to have a G.I. Joe
(or Jane) created in your own image. Other special items include an
entire line of Hasbro's figures from next year's ``Star Wars''
prequel; a signed G.I. Joe in the likeness of Colin Powell; and a
signed figure of home-run hitter Mark McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the auction, which ends Tuesday, benefit a
children's hospital in Providence, R.I., that Hasbro is associated
with.
</P>
<P>
   _ And from music critic Fred Shuster comes a Web recommendation
for all you underground music fans. It's called InterFACE Pirate
Radio and is the legal Internet successor to an illegal broadcaster
in London spinning great drum-and-bass, jungle, house and other
electronic dance music.
</P>
<P>
   The music streams in on the RealPlayer plug-in, but even cooler
is the ability to talk with the DJs and other listeners in an
online chat room and to watch a video feed of the DJs as they mix
and play music. Point your Internet radio dial to
www.interface.pirate-radio.co.uk. &QL;

   US-IRAQ _ WASHINGTON _ As the U.S. continued its military
build-up in Peresian Gulf Friday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
said he was not trying to stop cooperation with the United Nations
and would accept ``positively any initiative'' that would lead to
the lifting of U.N. sanctions. In his first public statement in the
latest dispute over U.N. weapons inspections, the official Iraqi
News Agency quoted Saddam as saying his recent decisions to
restrict the activities of U.N. weapons inspectors ``were intended
to get responses to Iraq's legal demands.'' Without eleaborating,
Saddam apparently referred to Iraq's often-stated demand that
punishing U.N. trade sanctions imposed eight years ago be lifted.
In essence, the statement mirrored earlier Iraqi declarations since
the crisis began. But both President Clinton and U.S. Secretary
State Madeleine Albright today insisted that airstrikes can only be
averted if Iraq rescinds its decision to halt arms inspections.
Meanwhile, U.S. troops, ships and planes were converging on the
Gulf for a possible attack on Iraq after President Clinton said he
was ready to use force to compel Baghdad to submit to arms
inspectors. LEDE-ALL. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   RUSSIA-IRAQ _ MOSCOW _ Although Russia _ one of Iraq's

use of military violence against Iraq, Russia's statements have
been a bit more tempered. That is likely due to the fact that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein broke the deal with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and there aren't many diplomatic channels left. Still,
Russia sought to mediate the crisis by sending letters to Hussein

difference in their tone was highlighted this week when the Gulf
countries, Syria and Egypt signed a statement saying that Iraq will
be at fault if there are air strikes. If the U.S. keeps pressure on
Israel to maintain the peace process, the theory goes, it will be
more accepted around the region for the U.S. to also pressure Iraq.

deal, it could reject it and continue to pursue its suit against
the industry, which seeks $2.78 billion for costs to Medicaid for
tobacco-related illnesses in Georgia from 1970-1997. A coalition of

   INTERNET-FEES _ WASHINGTON _ In recent years, phone and cable
conglomerates have moved into local phone markets to provide
services to thousands of Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The
upshot: The regional Baby Bell phone companies and GTE this year
are expected to pay millions to these competitors in ``reciprocal
compensation'' to place ISP connections. But the Bells and GTE say
these fees are unfair. Bell South is refusing to pay, and SBC
Communciations is putting its money into an escrow account rather

   BALLOON _ WASHINGTON _ Raven Industries Inc. of Sioux Falls,
S.D., which has 1,500 employees and subsidiaries in Springfield,
Ohio, and Sulfur Springs, Texas, has been selected to design, test
and build NASA's newest space vehicle, a huge helium-filled balloon
that will remain 60 miles high for up to 100 days and circle the
Earth four or five times. The Ultra-Long Duration Balloon, ``ULDB''
in NASA acryonese, will be made of polyethylene fabric the
thickness of sandwich wrap and strong enough to withstand enormous
pressure variations that occur between day and night in the
stratosphere. It will cost only about $360,000 and carry one ton of
scientific gear and support equipment. It will be manufactured at a
Raven plant in Sulfur Springs. Proponents of ultra-long duration
balloons think that, in addition to cheap space research, the
balloons eventually could be right for many other uses, including
as relay stations for radio telephone networks. (Nesmith, Cox News

CREATOR OF THE ONLINE SWAP MEET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Md.)   (af)  
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What really captivates him, Pierre Omidyar says, are
computer-programming challenges. But he says he never expected to
get rich tackling them, and recalls that most of his efforts to
make money on them failed.
</P>
<P>
   With one huge exception. Three weeks ago, Gary Bengier, the
chief financial officer of Ebay Inc., the company Omidyar founded
in 1995, walked into his office to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You're worth a billion dollars today,''' Omidyar
recalled in a telephone interview from his headquarters in San
Jose, Calif. ``I said, `No,''' his voice still trailing off in
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Omidyar, now 31, had started Ebay on a lark, posting
a Web page to help people auction the stuff that was gathering dust
in their attics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had it in mind that I would start a company and one
day it would be really successful,'' he said. ``I have just been
motivated by working on interesting technology.''
</P>
<P>
   To his surprise, collectors of Barbie dolls, Beanie Babies and
household junk of all sorts seized upon Ebay almost immediately,
both as an online classified-ad page and as a forum to discuss
their common obsessions. And since its public offering in
September, the stock has become a more treasured addition to
Internet stock portfolios than the Princess Diana bear is to Beanie
Baby fans.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Omidyar's stake in the company is already closing in on
$2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Omidyar was born in Paris but moved to Maryland after his
father, a surgeon, began his medical residence at the Johns Hopkins
University Medical Center. As a teen-ager, he kept sneaking out of
physical-education classes to play with the computers in his high
school.
</P>
<P>
   This modest rebellion turned into a first brush with the
financial power of technology: he was hired to write a program to
print catalogue cards for the school's library for $6 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Studying computers at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., his
entrepreneurship proved little more lucrative. He wrote a program
to help Apple Macintosh programmers manage memory and distributed
it on line as ``shareware,'' asking users to pay on the honor
system.
</P>
<P>
   The two or three checks he received barely covered the cost of
the post office box he had rented for his receipts.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Omidyar worked at several companies, designing
graphics programs for the Macintosh. In 1991, he founded a company
with three friends to write programs for computers that received
instructions by pen rather than keyboard. Pen computing turned into
one of the more notable technology flops, but the company was sold
to Microsoft, which was attracted to a shopping service it had
started.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with start-ups, Omidyar took a job as a programmer for
General Magic, a developer of mobile computing devices. In his
spare time, he made pages for the newly emerging World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for Ebay came from Pamela Wesley, who is now his
fiancee. Ms. Wesley, a collector of Pez candy dispensers, had
complained that she couldn't find an efficient way to buy or sell
them on the Internet. So Omidyar started a Web page in 1995,
allowing people to list items for sale and take bids over several
days.
</P>
<P>
   The service, first called Auction Web, was free until the page
grew so big that it outgrew Omidyar's personal Internet account and
had to be moved to a much more expensive business account.
</P>
<P>
   So early in 1996, he started charging a few dollars to list an
item and collecting a small commission if it was sold. It took just
a few months before he quit his day job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest clue was that so many checks were piling up at my
door I had to hire part-time help to open them all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Omidyar had drilled into one of the richest veins of the online
world, the desire of people to connect with others who share their
interests. And few interests, he came to realize, generate more
passion than collecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought people would simply use the service to buy and sell
things,'' he said. ``But what they really enjoyed was meeting other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebay's popularity astounded almost everybody. More than a
million people have registered for the service, and they spend an
average of 96 minutes a month perusing it, far more than for other
major Web sites. Every day, 70,000 new items are put up for sale on
Ebay.
</P>
<P>
   Its rapid growth and the fact it was one of the Internet's few
profit makers made Ebay one of the most eagerly anticipated initial
public offerings of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The path, however, was rocky: Last August, on the day before the
company began its road show to drum up investor interest, the Dow
Jones industrial average plunged by 500 points.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of September, the deal was completed, at an
offering price of $18. The stock closed on Friday at $123.9375, off
$2.0625, making the company worth $4.93 billion and Omidyar's 38.3
percent stake worth $1.89 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when you ask Omidyar about the high points of the last
few years, he doesn't mention money. Rather, he talks of letters
from Ebay customers who say their lives have been changed because
the company has let them turn their collecting hobbies into
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They became accidental entrepreneurs and found they could quit
their jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Does that sound familiar? He pauses, then acknowledges the
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't set out to create a huge business on Ebay,'' he said.
``When it happened, I took advantage of it.''

`BLUES UP AND DOWN': SPEAKING WITH THE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The blues language developed at the turn of the
century has spread in so many ways over the last 100 years that its
beauty is now as ignored as an often-seen landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The small accumulation of its repeated ideas, the graceful
rising and falling of melodies, its percussive drive, all have
become familiar. The miracle of the blues riff _ the way it
constructs narrative, its systemic coherence and its
improvisational electricity _ is taken as simply improvisation,
something tossed off.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz at Lincoln Center's ``Blues Up and Down: A Battle in the
Bucket,'' at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday night, came advertised as
a cutting contest, but instead acted as a dust-clearer, ridding
older compositions and melodies and improvisatory ideas of their
status as antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Songs like Nat Adderley's ``Work Song'' and Bobby Timmons'
``Moanin''' became crystalline blues compositions again. The
clarity with which the material was played helped, each tune
receiving its own tempo, as did the deep understanding that a
melody with few notes could be as important as a composition with
more formal variety. Meaning comes from all angles, and the
musicians, who will be performing again Saturday night, made sure
that the compositions were articulated.
</P>
<P>
   But something else happened at the show. The musicians relaxed
into playing in the blues idiom. Improvisation after improvisation
brought together all the various rhetorical techniques jazz
musicians learn from the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Edwards, the tenor saxophonist, used his nasty and bitter
intonation to make his solos sound distilled, entire improvisations
defying the mathematical clarity of the piano, as if he were
singing in a different language.
</P>
<P>
   Al Grey, the trombonist, using a mute and a rubber plunger,
talked through his trombone, using a whole series of vocal sounds,
playing lines that were originally sung. And the trumpeter Harry
``Sweets'' Edison used a series of riffs in his solos, three- or
four-note ideas, that added up to improvisations with hurtling
momentum and logic.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the elders in the show. The younger musicians came
fully equipped as well, and the trumpeter Nicholas Payton, on
``Moanin','' produced a solo of such power, using ripped and
tattered notes, that the entire hall seemed startled.
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus Chestnut, playing piano, silenced the auditorium with his
solo entrances; he let quiet spaces speak for him, and then used
small, repeating figures, machinelike, to build his improvisations,
connecting them all with lines or percussive slaps.
</P>
<P>
   The show brought the musicians together in all sorts of
different combinations: Payton and Edison played together; the
saxophonists Stephen Riley and Sherman Irby joined with the
vibraphonist Stefon Harris to play Joe Henderson's ``Isotope.''
Competition didn't really exist. The musicians were there to
luxuriate in the glories of a communal language, all the shadings,
tricks and tonalities, musical and emotional, that the blues has
given us.

<P>
   To a man, the members of Boston College's football team know it
is time to move on. Time to forget about what transpired at the end
of last week's devastating 31-26 loss to Notre Dame. Time to get on
with the business at hand.
</P>
<P>
   In desperate need of a victory to not only snap a six-game
losing streak but erase the memory of that squandered goal-line
opportunity against the Fighting Irish, the Eagles (3-6 overall,
2-3 Big East) will focus on winning their final two games,
beginning Saturday against Pittsburgh (2-6, 0-4) at Pitt Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It will pit two of the league's most frustrated teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``With just two games left, the way our won-loss record has
turned out doesn't reflect how our team plays or what type of
character our team has,'' said senior running back Mike Cloud, who
rushed 28 times for 141 yards against ND but was stuffed on four
tries from inside the Irish 4. ``I think in these last two games,
we're going to come up with a couple of W's.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing its home finale last week, BC came within inches of
upsetting the 13th-ranked Irish. But Cloud was dropped for a 1-yard
loss by Deke Cooper on fourth down from the 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, meanwhile, remained winless in conference play
after blowing a 20-0 lead with 6:20 left in the second quarter of a
36-33 loss against Temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're going through a lot of the same things that
we went through,'' said BC coach Tom O'Brien. ``(Pittsburgh coach)
Walt Harris and I came in the same year. We're both second-year
guys in programs that are not, obviously, the way our respective
universities want them to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both trying to get the same thing done both on the field
and in the classroom. We both face big tasks and we both understand
what we're up against, and I'm sure he goes to work every day
trying to make Pitt football better, just like I do in trying to
make BC football better every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing will make BC's day better than a victory over the
Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we went to Pittsburgh, we were embarrassed in a
Thursday night game my freshman year and it was very tough,'' said
junior free safety Pedro Cirino, recalling the 20-13 loss two years
ago on Halloween Night, after which all sorts of skeletons came
tumbling out of BC's locker room. ``That's when all that stuff (the
gambling scandal) came out. That's where it all started right
there, so we have to exorcise some demons down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud will certainly look to do that against the Panthers,
especially after the loss to Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the right call, and obviously, Notre Dame had the right
call,'' he said. ``They just made a good play on it. They came up
and had the gap filled and made a tremendous play.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his preseason objective of a 2,000-yard season no longer
appears attainable, Cloud is within easy reach (20 yards) of
breaking the school's season rushing record (1,387 yards) set by
Chuckie Dukes in 1992, and within striking distance (266 yards) of
supplanting Troy Stradford (3,504 yards, 1982-86) as the school's
career rushing leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Sunday's practice, Coach Jags (BC offensive coordinator
Jeff Jagodzinski) called up the offense and pointed me out and said
that I had an opportunity to make history,'' Cloud said. ``He said
the offensive line was dedicated to helping me get that in the next
couple of weeks. I think that type of statement is only going to
make me play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the Notre Dame loss continue to haunt the team?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all think about every now and then, maybe late at
night,'' Cloud said. ``I think because it was such a big game,
against Notre Dame, on national TV, and we came so close in our
last home game, that it was a little harder to swallow and was in
the back of our minds much more than some of the other losses. But
right now we're all focused on Pitt, and I think we're all ready to
take out our frustration on them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Down a drab corridor in the basement of the Empire
State Building, in an austere, glaringly lighted employee dining
room, six security guards chatted at a table on Wednesday morning.
In front of them sat a box of Girl Scout Thin Mints.
</P>
<P>
   On the far side of a flimsy partition, Robert Stockard, a
cheery, upbeat sales pro, was in the midst of a training session.
He had come here on this rainy morning to try to impart a
professional's touch to a group of Girl Scouts, ages 7 to 11, who
were about to head off into the cruel, man-eat-cookie world _ the
lobby _ to sell some Samoas, Thin Mints and Trefoils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selling is a lot of acting,'' Stockard told them. ``Now my
partner, Maria, is going to play a tough cookie.'' Up stepped Maria
Massaro, who turned out to be not such a tough cookie after all.
Stockard, the designated cookie-seller, made his pitch, and she
smilingly demurred, saying, ``I don't eat chocolate.'' (Stockard,
in a stage whisper: ``She really loves chocolate.'') But Ms.
Massaro quickly became a pushover, buying box after box of whatever
he offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notice,'' Stockard said, ``that I didn't ask, `Would you like
to buy?' but `How many would you like to buy?''' Try as he might,
he couldn't keep the odd bit of sales jargon from bubbling to the
surface: ``When I ask, `Do you have any friends who want cookies?'
that's what we call the final close.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls joined the role-playing, and they too proved to be
soft touches, eagerly buying even when the whole pitch was a faint
``Would you like to buy some cookies?''
</P>
<P>
   They were having fun now. It had not taken long to break through
their shyness. Stockard, president of Sales Staffers International
of Andover, Mass., had started with a hearty ``Ready to have some
fun?'' Eliciting a chorus of muffled affirmatives, he then asked
what the girls wanted to raise money for. One girl said, ``Disney
World,'' and then Stephanie Rivera, a tiny, black-haired 7-year-old
from the Bronx, murmured something indecipherable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to do bikes with lobsters?'' Stockard asked
incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   He leaned close to Stephanie; she whispered something, and
Stockard stood up and clarified matters. ``Oh, you want to do your
nails, buy dresses and go to the Red Lobster,'' he said. Stephanie
gave a faint nod.
</P>
<P>
   The Girl Scouts would seem to be in scant need of sales advice;
nationwide, they sold 190 million boxes last year. (Local councils
set prices and keep profits, so no dollar figures were available.
But do the math: This is a half-billion-dollar business.)
</P>
<P>
   Stockard, unawed by such numbers, plunged ahead with his
``cookie wheel,'' a nine-step sales process. Step 1 was ``Smile,''
and Stockard asked the girls why that was important. Kandis Bennet,
a self-assured 11-year-old from Queens, responded quickly, ``To
make a good impression.'' Very good, Kandis.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling all the way, Stockard, 40, led them along the wheel,
through Step 4, ``We now have cookies for people on special
diets''; Step 7, ``Are you sure you ordered enough boxes?'' to the
final, indispensable Step 9, ``Thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven girls _ resplendent in brown or green uniforms _ took
this all in with varying degrees of attentiveness, the younger ones
clearly with less weighty thoughts on their roving minds.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to head upstairs to the lobby, amid murmurs of
``They got more than us'' as the samples were gathered. What did
Stephanie, say, glean from her half-hour or so of training? ``Be
polite,'' she said with a shrug, and then, more gleefully, ``Get
some money.'' How many would she sell today? ``A whole bunch,'' she
said spiritedly.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of truth was at hand. In the lobby, 100 cartons of
cookies were stacked against one wall, and the girls lined boxes up
meticulously on a table.
</P>
<P>
   Corrine Rivera, Stephanie's twin, had removed one of her shiny
black shoes and nearly tumbled as she danced playfully on the
polished floor. A tiny figure in the spacious lobby, she seemed
more badge-covered uniform than girl.
</P>
<P>
   A workman on a ladder putting up a banner for the event, dubbed
``Turning Cookies Into Dough,'' called over, ``Do you take credit
cards?''
</P>
<P>
   Jade Randall, a sharp 10-year-old who had just made the day's
first sale, eyeing the $10 bill closely through thick glasses, shot
back, ``No, just cash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have come on payday, then,'' the workman countered
jovially.
</P>
<P>
   The table ready, some girls started making their pitch, the
nine-step script usually crumbling to ``Want to buy some cookies?''
They soon discovered that the Empire State Building crowd was not a
pushover like Ms. Massaro. Some passers-by gave puzzled looks;
others walked with the stony obliviousness that New Yorkers have
polished to a high art. ``We're just looking for the observatory
elevator,'' one flustered woman said by way of a no.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin Faraday, 8, at the suggestion that potential customers
were getting by unpitched, said with a firm sense of territory,
``We're getting them from this aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockard, born salesman, could not for the life of him stay out
of the fray. ``Make any sales yet, ladies?'' he asked. Or, ``Good
try, girls!'' Often he made a pitch himself. ``I can't help it,''
he said, grinning. Once he reported excitedly, ``That girl upsold a
customer.'' Upsold? Uh-oh. Jargon alert. ``Got her to buy more than
she'd planned,'' he hurriedly translated.
</P>
<P>
   And when a woman asked, ``Do you have any low-fat?'' he was in
trainer's heaven. ``I love it when they follow the script,'' he
exulted.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually customers materialized. ``Can we just buy some?'' one
woman asked sheepishly amid the banners and cameras. ``I have a
list,'' another said as she scooped up eight or 10 boxes. And
another: ``I heard you were down here and I came running.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the professionally honed sales pitch help? ``It was the
smiles,'' one man said. ``Always effective.'' But another said
gruffly, ``It's the product, not the sales pitch,'' as he snared
his Thin Mints _ the top seller nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're $3 a box?'' one customer said in mock horror, and then
added, ``Oh, Girl Scouts _ wonderful organization!'' Yes, $3 is a
lot for an 8- or 10-ounce box (which costs the organization 82
cents), but the good cause reels them in.
</P>
<P>
   Near noon, Jade asked for the time _ not because she was tired,
but so she would know whether to say ``Good morning'' or ``Good
afternoon.'' As the day wore on, the girls did grow weary, and by
lunch time, with the lobby hopping, it was mostly the troop leaders
doing the selling. Half the 100 cartons had vanished. By day's end,
nearly all had been sold.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   So what is Stockard's angle? Is his donated training just a
publicity stunt for Sales Staffers, a private company that provides
training, marketing services and sales representatives to large
corporations? He dispelled that idea convincingly. ``I was a Scout
as a kid,'' he said. ``I saw how much parents helped. Now we want
to do anything we can to help these girls' confidence levels. It's
nice to see their eyes light up.''
</P>
<P>
   Why seek publicity then? ``We want to make our employees proud,
and to have clients see what we're doing _ we'd like them to give
something back to society.'' The children, he said, ``are our
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Cheuvront, public relations director for the Girl Scout
Council of Greater New York, added: ``The real value is to learn
how to set goals, do budgeting, meet goals. These skills are
transferable to all aspects of their lives.'' She had offered the
girls a real-world use: ``You can use these sales skills to
convince your teacher you deserve an A.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Massaro, president of Sales Consultants of Boston and
co-founder of Stockard's company, echoed the upbeat tone but
refined the goal, saying: ``I hope a few girls are inspired today
to go into sales. You don't grow up wanting to be a sales rep,
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kandis, at the suggestion that she might go into sales, crinkled
her nose in a distinct negative. Then she enthusiastically got back
to her selling.

A KID BRINGS BASKETBALL TO A CYNICAL FAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frustrated by the mutual suicide run that is the NBA lockout and
just plain bored in general, I went to Providence Monday night to
see the official collegiate debut of Lamar Odom.
</P>
<P>
   Full disclosure: I went to the Civic Center as a suspicious and
perhaps even downright hostile witness. I went to bury this kid,
not to praise him. I could not stomach the hype. I wanted him to be
Dontonio Wingfield, yet another useless, overrated player elevated
to premature greatness beyond all reason by foolish people whose
computers and microphones ought to be confiscated for the good of
the sports fan, if not all mankind.
</P>
<P>
   So before I issue my report, I would suggest that if you are
standing, you sit down, and that if you are sitting down, you might
consider stretching out on the nearest sofa.
</P>
<P>
   I come to you as Mr. Basketball Conservative, Mr. Hard Marker,
Mr. Very Hard To Please, and Mr. Guardian Of The Game's Integrity,
and I am here to say that the kid I so wanted to hate turns out to
be the most intriguing player to come into the college game since
Larry and Magic.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how this will all turn out, of course. Corruption
of some sort is the almost inevitable state when a young man
progresses through our increasingly reprehensible system, but what
I can assure you is that Lamar Odom has a rare gift. Even better,
he seems to understand what he has and is unlikely to abuse it, at
least in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   He comes to us with baggage. There were school changes upon
school changes before he landed at the University of Rhode Island,
and he stands accused of some sort of chicanery with regard to his
ACT score. Should he really be in college at all? I surely don't
know, and frankly, I don't care, either, because anyone who thinks
either Division 1-A football or Division 1 basketball is pure is
pathetically naive.
</P>
<P>
   I'm just talking basketball here. I love the game, although my
fidelity has been put to the test by this sorry NBA spectacle. That
is why Lamar Odom is important. It is almost as if he has been
placed in our midst to divert our attention from that NBA mess.
When you see this kid play the game the way he does, and that means
with skill, imagination and _ how's this? _ joie de vivre, it is a
much-needed reminder why we are sports fans in the first place. We
are not fans because we enjoy monitoring negotiating sessions. We
are fans because certain athletes can perform feats that titillate
our senses and emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Magic Johnson has anyone been able to make the
following statement: Lamar Odom is a completely legitimate
6-foot-10-inch guard. We have endured nearly two decades of
wannabes, and now we have the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   He is not Magic; he is Lamar. Right now that is quite enough.
</P>
<P>
   The bare bones of his debut are easy to document. He submitted a
19-14-9 line while spending most of the game running the team after
starting point guard Preston Murphy sprained his ankle. The
striking thing is not so much the fact that Odom possesses the
technical skill to play point guard at 6-10, but that he is in full
possession of the mental requirements of the position. He fulfills
Rule 1 of the Bob Cousy litmus test for a point guard. ``When the
man passes midcourt,'' quoth The Cooz, ``is he thinking pass first
or shoot first?''
</P>
<P>
   Odom took 13 shots. He had 9 assists. Any questions?
</P>
<P>
   But those are numbers. I saw what he did. He forced nothing for
himself. He is selfless to such a fault, I am sure this will be the
only conceivable NBA rap (``He won't take over,'' or some such
nonsense). Upon finding himself involved in a size mismatch with
5-9 TCU point guard Prince Fowler, he patiently manipulated the
situation, not to get himself a shot but to get himself in position
to pass over the diminutive guard for an efficient 2 for, I
believe, center Luther Clay.
</P>
<P>
   For the chosen few, the game is a deceptively logical exercise.
Odom already knows what many a contemporary multi-time NBA All-Star
doesn't, and I won't even stoop to compare his elevated
understanding of the game to that of a certain locally based
``veteran'' All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   He plays a no-frills, fundamentals-based game that would be
recognizable to someone who hadn't seen an NBA contest since Bill
Russell retired. Imagine. No wiggles. No dances. No
finger-pointing. Not even any needless between-the-legs dribbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is a simple game,'' he explained after making the
winning basket. ``You don't need to make it fancy. I don't think
it's that hard. You can make it easy on yourself by thinking one
play ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   About that basket. ``They were in a zone,'' he recounted. Coach
(Jim Harrick) told me to attack with eight seconds left. I put on a
hard dribble and got an easy layup.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he say, ``(itals)easy layup(unitals)''? The basket in
question was a Gervinesque 6- or 8-foot finger roll. Degree of
difficulty, 2.2.
</P>
<P>
   With Odom in the lineup, URI, which plays archenemy Providence
in a sold-out Civic Center Saturday, is capable of beating anybody
in the country. The Rams won't, naturally, but they could. But
that's not the point for us neutrals. The point is that we don't
care whether the NBA players will get 50, 52, 57, or 99 percent of
the gross. We don't care that Kenny Anderson might have to sell off
one of his eight luxury cars. We don't care that owners don't seem
to have the simple capacity to say no when it comes to signing
these people ($5 million a year for Jim McIlvaine?). Most fans have
moved from apathy to ``Go away and don't bother me, and I hope you
all get jock itch.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is that we do have basketball. College basketball. I
don't want to burden Lamar Odom with being a savior, but I can
assure you he already brings more to the table than 90 percent of
the current NBA population.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have imagined a night in Providence would be so
uplifting?
</P>

STRONG RETAIL SALES RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT RATE CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buoyed by brisk spending on new cars and other big ticket items
such as appliances and furniture, US retail sales jumped more than
expected in October, fueling speculation that the Federal Reserve
may be more reluctant to cut interest rates again when it meets
next week.
</P>
<P>
   October sales increased 1 percent to $227.15 billion, according
to figures released Friday by the US Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people were looking for about half that,'' said Wayne
Ayers, chief economist for BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected sales gain is a good sign that a solid holiday
season lies ahead for US retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers seem ready, willing, and able to shop,'' said Fred
Breimyer, chief economist for State Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Asian crisis, the US economy is being
scrutinized almost daily for signs of weakening, and so far the
data appears inconclusive _ good one day, poor the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting mixed signals,'' said Breimyer, who called
Friday's retail numbers a very ``positive'' signal.
</P>
<P>
   If the US economy is humming, as the October retail sales
suggest, the Fed may find the case for lowering interest rates to
be less compelling.
</P>
<P>
   But if sales are taken in the context of such other measures of
economic performance as declining exports, declining capital
spending, and increasing layoffs, the outlook is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly complicates the decision that the Fed will have
to make next week,'' Breimyer said after reviewing the October
retail numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Based on October sales, there is little evidence so far that the
Asian crisis is putting a damper on US consumer spending, said Sara
Johnson, North American research director for Standard &AMP; Poor's
DRI, a Lexington forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Johnson predicted US retail sales for the fourth
quarter should increase by a respectable 5 percent over the same
period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Johnson said she saw nothing in the October sales
figures that made her want to revise her holiday estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson expects the Fed to reduce interest rates yet again, for
the same reasons it has lowered rates twice before in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite October sales, none of the reasons for trimming rates
has gone away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still anticipating future cuts,'' she said. ``Certainly,
the economy is weakening .... And the Asian crisis is far from
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   At BankBoston, Ayers said economists now seem evenly divided
over whether the Fed will cut interest rates next week.
</P>
<P>
   As for retail sales, auto sales were especially strong last
month. When autos were excluded, retail sales grew 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   September sales, in contrast, grew a mere 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that inflation is in check, the US Labor Department
reported that its Producer Price Index, a yardstick used to measure
wholesale prices, rose only 0.2 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   While more mixed signals may be on the way, for a moment at
least, the news about the US economy was good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The much anticipated slowdown in consumer spending hasn't
happened yet,'' Ayers said.

MAKING A MOUNTAIN OUT OF AN ANT HILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Three years ago, ``Toy Story'' proved that an
entirely computer-animated feature could not only be made but could
be made wildly popular.
</P>
<P>
   The movie grossed $350 million worldwide, generated hundreds of
millions more in, well, toy sales, and set an imposingly high bar
for all future computer-graphics productions to rise to.
</P>
<P>
   Now Pixar Studios and Disney _ which, respectively, made and
distributed ``Toy Story'' _ are ready to release Phase Two, ``A
Bug's Life,'' beginning Friday at the El Capitan in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of a beleaguered ant colony that fends off marauding
grasshoppers with the help of a troupe of circus insects, ``Bug's
Life'' takes CG animation into complex, work-intensive new
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bug's'' required exponentially greater computer power than
``Toy'' did. Composed almost entirely of natural shapes (which are
much harder for geometrically minded computers to copy), busy with
12 main characters and a background throng of hundreds, and shot
through with never-before-seen qualities of light, color,
translucence and scale, it's a quantum leap forward, technically
and artistically, from the adventures of Buzz and Woody.
</P>
<P>
   And it's the second one this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-emptive maneuver (and since these things take three to
four years to make, it was some maneuver), DreamWorks, the upstart
movie studio co-owned by former Disney executive Jeffrey
Katzenberg, rushed out its first CG feature, ``Antz,'' to strong
critical and box-office response in October.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy about a nonconformist worker ant has proven
tenaciously popular up to the eve of the $85 million ``Bug's Life''
release. ``Antz'' enjoyed a highly unusual 23-percent increase in
ticket sales last weekend; it has grossed more than $75 million in
North America, which makes it the most successful non-Disney
animated feature ever made.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Bug's Life'' camp's response to the early ``Antz'' attack
is an interesting blend of mild commercial concern, palpable anger
and a sense of creative dedication bordering on artistic
superiority. The general line is that the pest's appearance had no
bearing on Pixar's picnic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out about `Antz' some two years into working on `A
Bug's Life','' says the film's co-director and -screenwriter Andrew
Stanton. ``You realize very quickly that you have no control over
what people are going to do. All I could directly do was make
`Bug's' the best movie possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been going for the high road, which is to make a
movie that will last, that people will want to see after the hype.
We knew it would take this long to make the movie as good as we
wanted to, because that's how long `Toy Story' took. We just put on
our blinders, didn't want to know a thing about `Antz' and figured,
if this is a good movie, somebody will see that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love good, healthy competition; I'm the most competitive
person on the planet, and I think it's good for every industry,''
adds John Lasseter, the Pixar vice president who directed ``Toy
Story'' and co-directed ``Bug's Life.'' ``Our close friends at
Industrial Light and Magic are doing their first computer-animated
film of `Frankenstein,' and I am so excited about that. But what I
love is to be challenged by other studios with fresh, original
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ``Bug's Life'' actually goes back to Aesop; it's a
show-bizzy update of his fable about the ants and the grasshopper.
The voice cast here isn't quite as stellar as that of ``Antz,''
which boasted Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman and Sylvester
Stallone. But ``Bug's'' does include Oscar winner Kevin Spacey as
the leader of the belligerent 'hoppers and such well-known TV
throats as ``NewsRadio's'' Dave Foley, ``Seinfeld's'' Julia
Louis-Dreyfus and ``Frasier's'' David Hyde Pierce, not to mention
the veteran vocal stylings of Phyllis Diller and the late Roddy
McDowall.
</P>
<P>
   Pixarians insist that star power, merchandising considerations
and even technical breakthroughs are all secondary to story in
their productions. But ``Bug's Life's'' most apparent creative coup
is its detailed visual sumptuousness. Filmed in wide-screen, the
movie's miniature world possesses an epic quality unlike anything
seen on the big screen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time we were doing the research and being inspired by
the insect world, I wanted the audience to be reminded that this
was a little world,'' Lasseter explains. ``A fallen leaf would be
huge to them, or when an ant climbs up on a dandelion and floats
down on one of the seeds, it's like he's hang-gliding.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial research got as low-tech as animators, on their bellies,
looking under the plants outside Pixar's East Bay headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our techie colleagues said, `Y'know, we can help you with
this,''' Lasseter recalls. ``They invented this tiny, tiny video
camera _ we called it the Bugcam _ that they put on a stick with
little wheels, and we could roll it along in the grass and look up
underneath plants from half an inch above the ground. You can't
even get your eye that low.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting video footage revealed a landscape in which light
and color intermingled beautifully; a world that appeared to exist
under stained glass. But achieving that effect in the computer was
just one of many groundbreaking challenges Pixar's talented program
designers faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always jumped into the deep end of the pool with no idea
how we're going to get out of it,'' Stanton says. ``We've always
been, `OK, we're gonna make a movie about two toys that go outside
and chase down the street,' or `We're going to make a movie about
all these bugs,' and half our staff says, `We can't do that'.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `A Bug's Life' is denser than any animated film you've ever
seen,'' says Pixar chairman and computer industry legend Steve
Jobs. ``The subtlety of the characters' facial expressions
absolutely defines the state of the art, but the other things
you'll see are autonomous elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, we wanted to have the grasses and the clovers
blowing in the wind. Well, if the animators had to worry about
that, they'd never get to the characters. So we actually developed
programs that make the grasses know how to blow by themselves. The
animators just set the direction of the wind and the burst
patterns, and the rest was taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting so much of the film outdoors in the daytime required
groundbreaking new software that could approximate natural light,
shadows and color tints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We invented a whole new way to shade and light everything we
do for this film,'' Jobs notes. ``It was a much more
computationally intensive way, but the results, I think, are just
stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the film's beauty, though, Lasseter insists it's
character that counts _ even when a scene involves 800 characters
who, in real life, are so tiny they're indistinguishable from one
another. It worked so well, he says, that the number of crowd shots
ballooned from the 50 that were originally planned up to 460.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big technical advances on the film was the system
we developed to create the animation for the crowd shots,'' he
says. ``It allowed the computer to replicate designs created by
animators through thousands of versions of the characters. But the
system also changes it so they're not just the same few characters
repeated; they're all subtly different. It also changes each ant's
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of character, the questions remain: What did Katzenberg
know and when? DreamWorks claims that the ``Antz'' concept was
developed independently, but Katzenberg _ who formed the new studio
with friends Steven Spielberg and David Geffen after losing a power
struggle at Disney _ was still overseeing the Disney animation
operation when Pixar first floated ``Bug's.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Schumacher, Disney's executive vice president of feature
animation, is circumspect about the concept-theft issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I arrived at Disney in '87, they had a film that had been
in development for three years called `Army Ants,''' he explains.
``When John pitched the idea of `Bug's' to me in the summer of '94,
he had no knowledge of this ant thing we'd had that never went
anywhere. Of course, Jeffrey was still at the studio then, so he
would have known (about `Bug's').
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, from this, you can take any number of things away. One is
that we had been developing an ants story before John came up with
his totally independently _ and that happens all the time. It's
also a logical conclusion that whenever you go into the
three-dimensional world, insects are interesting. And there is a
consistency of a small number of people who have known about all of
these projects the whole time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Draw your own conclusions. But the point I want to make is, I
don't find it unusual that someone would spontaneously think of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Disney had the biggest hit of the year with
``Armageddon,'' a meteor-threatens-Earth spectacular that was
released two months after DreamWorks' similar (and successful)
``Deep Impact.'' And Schumacher points out that Disney's summer
animated hit ``Mulan'' was not dealt perceivable box-office damage
by the preceding feisty heroine cartoons ``Anastasia'' and ``The
Quest for Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   So, angry and betrayed though they may feel, the ``Bug's Life''
gang at least doesn't see too much need for concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, DreamWorks made the decision that they didn't want
to come out after `Bug's,'' Jobs notes. ``Some people argue that
that will be better for our film, some people argue it will be
worse. I argue that it won't matter. What matters is, did we make a
film that people want to go see?''

ROY JONES JR.: SEEKING A DEFINING MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LEDYARD, Conn. _ Like all great artists, Roy Jones Jr. sees
his world differently from the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus throughout boxing is that Jones has thus far been
denied his true greatness because he has never faced an opponent as
fearsome as he is, one who could push him to the brink of
destruction before he finally beat back the challenge. Such moments
are what every exalted champion has had, so they have come to
define greatness in a boxing ring, but to Jones, such moments are
overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I want that?'' Jones joked this week.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good question if one considers boxing merely the manly
art of self-defense, but prizefighting is different than
self-defense. Prizefighting is not the Sweet Science, as A.J.
Liebling once called it. It's the Bittersweet Science and it
demands much pain from its practitioners before it allows a mantle
of greatness to fall across one's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Ray Robinson needed Randy Turpin and Jake LaMotta
and Carmen Basilio. Why Ray Leonard needed Thomas Hearns and
Roberto Duran, and so did Marvin Hagler. Why Duran needed Ken
Buchanan and Esteban De Jesus. Why Muhammad Ali needed Joe Frazier.
Why Battling Nelson needed Joe Gans and Henry Armstrong needed
Barney Ross and Fritzie Zivic.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest icons in boxing all have had fierce foils, yet at
nearly 30, Jones has gone unchallenged while winning world titles
at 160, 168, and 175 pounds and building a 37-1 record marred only
by a loss to Montell Griffin, who defeated him while on his knees
after Jones was judged to have hit him when he was down and was
thus disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing much is expected to change Saturday night when Jones
puts the World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association light
heavyweight titles on the line against World Boxing Organization
middleweight champion Otis Grant at Foxwoods on an HBO card that
will also include the best lightweight in the world, International
Boxing Federation champion Shane Mosley, defending his title
against former world champion James Leija.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Grant is a sound practitioner of his art, but he is
a sketch artist while Jones is Picasso, a mad genius who paints the
canvas he works on with his opponent's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all his fights end when Jones decides they will, taking
his time in some circumstances and ridding himself of his opponent
quickly in others, as he did with Griffin when he won their rematch
in just over two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jones does not believe his genius is being denied by this
apparent lack of an Olympian peak to climb. He believes his genius
is being denied by mere mortals who do not realize what they are
seeing when true greatness is in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had opponents, too, but I blew them out,'' Jones said this
week. ``James Toney was killing everybody. Before we fought, there
were plenty of people who said he would win, but I blew Toney away.
The next time you saw him, he weighed 230 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the same thing when I fought Bernard Hopkins. I beat
him so bad, he won't move up (from middleweight to super
middleweight) and fight me again even though he's always saying he
wants a rematch. How bad do he want Roy Jones?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the same kind of challenges Ray Robinson and Sugar Ray
Leonard had. They just didn't blow them away. They weren't that
much better than those guys. I was. They passed their tests. I blew
my tests away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I want to fight a great battle? People who want to
see that aren't doing the fighting. Do I need that to get my due?
For what?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my tests, but I got rid of mine once and for all. I
didn't leave the job half done like other guys, so they had to
fight again. Look at Virgil Hill. He was one of the greatest light
heavyweight champions. Never been stopped. You saw what happened
when we fought. That's why I don't live to satisfy other people.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was Hill was sent writhing to the canvas from the
only body shot Jones threw, his face a contorted mask like the ones
Picasso used to paint. Somehow Hill got up, but he could not
straighten up, his ribs and his spirit having been broken at 1:10
of the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   So it has gone for Jones, who has 31 knockouts and indicated
this week that as much as he fears for his opponent's health in the
ring, he would like to add Grant to his list of victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otis can fight,'' Jones said of Grant (31-1-1). ``He fights to
the caliber of his opponent. He has a hell of an opponent in front
of him now, but I've seen him rise to the challenge. But he's got a
hell of a lot of rising to do Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know on any night, anything can happen, but I just don't
think anyone can beat Roy Jones in his time. I'm sure Sugar Ray
Robinson rests comfortably (in his grave) when he sees Roy Jones
Jr. fight, throwing six, seven left hands at a time. Taking things
from him and adding to them. Lord, have mercy! I shock myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see anybody out there for me? You see anybody out there
destroying opponents the way Toney was?''
</P>
<P>
   One fighter is. Roy Jones Jr. But Jones cannot fight himself. As
a matter of fact, just the thought of that seemed to chill the
Pensacola pugilist for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight myself?'' Jones said when asked how he would combat
himself if given the chance. ``I wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Jones and HBO, for whom he has four more fights,
including one pay-per-view show, left on his contract, there are
men like Grant who will. A counselor at Lindsay Place High School
in the West Island section of Montreal, Grant is college-educated
and the WBO's 160-pound champion, so you would think he would know
better than to risk himself against so special a problem as Jones
presents. But he is a fighter above all, and so, as Leija said when
describing why he had agreed to fight the vastly more talented
Mosley, ``When opportunity knocks, you invite it in for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how Grant, a realist by trade and predilection, looks at
Roy Jones Jr. Frankly, that's how Roy Jones Jr. looks at Roy Jones
Jr., too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect guys like Otis because they try,'' Jones said.
``People have no idea what it takes to get up in that ring with Roy
Jones Jr. It's hard for them, but it's like they're getting paid to
play the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why I like cockfighting. Every chicken has a chance to
win if he's a fighter. Same here.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Grant seemed to express a similar notion when asked about
the difficulty of facing someone who is arguably the best fighter
in the world. Grant thought about that for a moment before
explaining it in the best terms he could think of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at his record, I can't do much worse than the 39 guys
he fought previously,'' Grant said, apparently already putting
himself in the past tense three days before the fight. ``I'm not
unrealistic. I'm not looking to win the lottery, but if I go in and
stick to my battle plan, I should be OK. Win or lose, I'll be ahead
of the game because of the exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking to land one shot on Roy and knock him out.
Who's done that? Why should I? I don't think I'm going to go in
there and teach Roy Jones Jr. a lesson. But if I don't get caught
early, I think I'll give him as formidable a challenge as he's
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Grant, as Jones himself acknowledges, that
wouldn't be saying much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never gone into the ring thinking there was a
possibility of losing,'' Jones said. ``I don't know what that feels
like. I've been in with guys who were faster or who punched harder,
but I always knew I was smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When history is written, people will say, `He was right (about
his greatness).' People won't realize it until it's over, but
they'll remember one day how they thought James Toney would beat
me. That was the high point. I passed my test, and that was it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The once lofty goal to open up the high-tech
glories of the Internet to all of America's schoolchildren has
degenerated into an increasingly nasty partisan squabble.
</P>
<P>
   In this fall's election campaign, Republicans accused the
Democrats of backing an illegal tax on all telephone users to
underwrite an ineffective bureaucracy that so far has done little,
if anything, to help more than 100,000 eligible schools get the
equipment and service they need to put the Internet in every
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats portrayed a Republican-led bid to alter the funding
plan, known as the ``e-rate,'' as a move against improving
education, creating more useful libraries and investing in the
nation's future work force.
</P>
<P>
   Government regulators find themselves trapped in the middle of
this political fight, which will resume in the next Congress.
Although the e-rate program remains in force, it has been
substantially scaled back by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) in the face of sharp congressional protests.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the nation's large telecommunications companies, or
telcos, guardedly watch events unfold. They have a huge financial
stake in the eventual outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Under the landmark 1996 Telecommunications Act, the telcos are
obliged to offer all schools, from kindergarten through the 12th
grade, as well as all public libraries, discounts on their lowest
institutional rate for telephone and Internet services. These
discounts range from 20 to 90 percent, depending on economic need
as measured by the percentage of students eligible for the national
school lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers originally saw it, the e-rate discounts _ the ``e''
stands for ``education'' _ would be relatively painless to
consumers because the telcos could offset their costs with some of
the additional revenue they earned through deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   But the telcos, faced with a spate of mergers amid a newly
ultra-competitive climate, declined to continue a 60-year-old
tradition of hidden subsidies. Starting in July, they insisted that
their costs of subsidizing the school wiring effort _ a small part
of a longstanding ``universal access'' fee _ appear as a separate
charge on most phone statements.
</P>
<P>
   This fee increasingly began to be portrayed by opponents of the
program as yet another federal tax _ and worse yet, one that
Congress had never specifically voted into law.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans even had a politically convenient label, the ``Gore
tax,'' thanks to the vice president's prominent role in driving the
school wiring bill through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One critic of the e-rate, Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., said, ``the
FCC is incorrect in its contention that the 'Gore Tax' is a fee. A
fee is a charge for a service rendered; however, long-distance
users are not receiving a service. Thus, if a charge is levied and
no direct service is provided then it is characterized as a tax,
regardless of whether it shows up on your IRS 1040 form or your
telephone bill, and only Congress can impose a tax under the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Weller, Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., wants the Congress
that will convene in January to cut the current 3 percent telephone
excise tax that pays for the hookups to 1 percent, and earmark that
money for state block grants for schools and libraries. Both
members sit on the House Ways and Means Committee, where all
revenue legislation originates.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters, the telcos saw the changes made
to the universal service funding mechanism in the 1996 law as a
chance to once more put the entire question before the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans is considering a case from Texas that challenges the
legality of the whole universal service program, including the
e-rate. A ruling on this issue could come by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The e-rate program builds on 1936 federal legislation that
created a special fund to subsidize basic telephone service to
every home in the nation, offering phone companies the financial
means to deliver a dial tone to even the most rural, sparsely
populated areas, where connections would otherwise be prohibitively
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   About 27 percent of classrooms in U.S. libraries and schools
have Internet connections. Roughly 2 million more need to be
connected, and within the next five years, some 10,000 new schools
will be built.
</P>
<P>
   The universal service fund was supposed to provide $2.2 billion
for Internet modernization in 1998. Since the total tab from the
approximately 30,000 schools and libraries that have applied for
aid came to slightly more than $2 billion, it appeared at first
that the federal kitty would more than fully support the actual
demand.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress soon raised alarms, fueled in part by a General
Accounting Office report that labeled the e-rate program a prime
candidate for fraud, waste and abuse. In response, on June 12 the
FCC cut e-rate funding by 43 percent, to $1.3 billion. And the
agency stretched out overall funding by six more months to June 30,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress originally saw the discounts as an entitlement to all
schools,'' noted David Byer, vice president for government affairs
for the Software Publishers Association. But, as matters stand,
only the very poorest school districts in the country will qualify
for inside (Internet) wiring.''
</P>
<P>
   In focusing on the discounts, Congress had failed to take into
full account that low-cost hookups were of little value to schools
unless they could be supported by a full panoply of switches,
routers and wires, to say nothing of training, needed to make the
system function effectively.
</P>
<P>
   But in focusing on the supportive Internet hardware, some school
administrators saw a fresh source of federal funds to fix up their
schools under the guise of making them ``Internet-ready.'' Reports
of such attempted end runs incensed key members of Congress and
helped force the FCC's decision to stretch out and scale back
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of June, the FCC had collected about $650
million to fund the e-rate program. Regulators plan to limit
collections for each subsequent quarter through mid-1999 to $325
million per quarter. Since the federal program can pay out no more
than has been collected, it's evident that many eligible schools
and libraries will not get the funding they want until well into
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Held up since July, the first allocation of $2.25 billion in
funds are now scheduled to be released by the end of this month.
Meantime, the FCC extended the application deadline for the next
funding period to Dec. 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I fear we may be losing our perspective on these
matters,'' said Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore, a strong backer of the
e-rate plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-distance phone bills are now at their lowest point in
history,'' he said. ``The telecommunications industry has saved
billions in costs as a result of telecommunications reform to date.
And yet a controversy has erupted over one element that would
represent less than one cent per day per customer line to provide
Internet access for America's schools and libraries.''
</P>
<P>
   Concludes Blumenauer: ``Schools and libraries across the country
took the federal government at its word. They spent countless hours
and tens of thousands of dollars preparing applications to receive
funds from the FCC under the e-rate program. We must not break that
commitment.''

 &HT;    Time running out to make decision on tobacco settlement
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia will face a one-week deadline to take or leave
the tobacco industry's latest proposed national settlement after
state officials view it for the first time Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was negotiated by eight state attorneys general on
behalf of their states and 38 other states, including Georgia, that
have filed suit to recover the medical costs of smoking-related
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the industry could pay more than $200 billion over
25 years, of which Georgia would stand to collect at least $2
billion to $3 billion, based on conservative estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting to get the (settlement) document by midday
Monday,'' Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he planned to meet with other attorneys general next
Friday to evaluate the proposal. ``If a sufficient number sign on,
we could have some kind of final deal by Monday (Nov. 23),'' Baker
added.
</P>
<P>
   If the state rejects the deal, it would pursue its August 1997
suit in Fulton County Superior Court, which seeks $2.78 billion in
damages from the industry for costs to Medicaid for tobacco-related
illnesses in Georgia from 1970-1997.
</P>
<P>
   Because the suit was filed under Georgia's Racketeering
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, a jury could award the
state triple damages.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting years of court battles, Florida, Minnesota,
Mississippi and Texas have obtained independent tobacco liability
settlements totalling more than $40 billion. Georgia, the nation's
six-largest tobacco-producing state, was one of the last states to
take legal action against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   If Georgia accepts the settlement proposal, it would terminate
its racketeering suit.
</P>
<P>
   A coaltion of Georgia public health organizations argues that
Georgia should fight hard for the best possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's settlement _ $6.6 billion and industry concessions
on tobacco logos, advertising and other issues _ is an appropriate
model, said Andy Lord, chairman of Coalition for a Healthy and
Responsible Georgia, whose members include the Georgia Hospital
Association and the state chapters of the American Cancer Society,
American Heart Association, American Lung Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do as well as Minnesota, that would be something very
special,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest settlement proposal is the product of five months of
negotiations between the industry and the eight attorneys generals,
three of who are now lame ducks.
</P>
<P>
   A previous settlement proposal worth $368 billion collapsed in
Congress. It would have required the Food and Drug Association to
regulate tobacco as a drug, and it would have earmarked the way the
proceeds were spent.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the latest proposal is likely to offer unrestricted
funds that would go directly to each state's general funds. That
means state legislators would decide how to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The source of this money is the pain and suffering of tobacco
use victims,'' said Lord, who favors using 20 percent to 30 percent
of all settlement proceeds to preventing smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a strong commitment to reducing kids'
smoking,'' said June Deen, vice president of the lung association's
state chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he would have preferred more time to evaluate the
proposal. He said Georgia wasn't in a position to take a lead role
in negotiations because it was such a late entry in tobacco
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia filed suit three months after Baker was appointed to
succeed Mike Bowers as attorney general.

 &HT;    Unimpeachably pretty
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's hard to be judged by your peers
when the peers just aren't around.
</P>
<P>
   Who didn't show their spring lines last week? Isaac Mizrahi: out
of business. Todd Oldham: no more collections. Adrienne Vittadini:
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Helmut Lang, Vivienne Tam: all showed
in a pre-Fashion Week in September.
</P>
<P>
   That still left a lot to see. Ralph Lauren. Vera Wang. Oscar de
la Renta and others.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of it all was Election Day. Powers shifted. It
made no ripple on the runways.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Newt resigned. A model named Noot strutted in a
``storm gingham cotton georgette skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion Week went on.
</P>
<P>
   Some insisted the ``glam rock'' look was in. But the majority
voted for sweet, sensible, meet-me-in-the-Rose-Garden wear.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict? It depends on how you define the word ``style.''
</P>
<P>
   PINK-QUIRY
</P>
<P>
   Everyone showed something in pink. How democratic! Even Carolina
Herrera used it to turn a leather dress into something you could
wear to tea. Most went with the lighter, more innocent shades, but
Ellen Tracy chose neon for her career-girl clients. Oscar de la
Renta, BCBG and Geoffrey Beene used the neon to set off an
otherwise red dress. Cynthia Rowley _ ``We're in the pink,'' her
show notes said _ was the color's biggest fan. Overhead bins even
sprinkled pink bits of paper on passing models.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTES
</P>
<P>
   Sandals are in, and flats in general. The better for
maneuverings, legal or otherwise. Michael Kors' clear-strap sandals
made the models look barefoot, and Bill Blass' sandals had the same
effect. Designer Daryl K was the only one to pair hers with socks,
often bright red or turquoise. Those who missed the memo on flats,
or ignored it, were Kevan Hall for Halston, Badgley Mischka and
Carolina Herrera. Herrera's stilettos _ backless, even! _ made
model-watching exciting, especially with the tight ``fishtail''
skirts that kept snaking around the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   MISS DEMEANOR
</P>
<P>
   In hot water? Spin cycle working overtime? Your shirts will turn
out perfect for spring. When they weren't showing tube tops,
designers went for cropped tops (Ralph Lauren) or open shirts (John
Bartlett) that showed the tummy in a sweetly casual way. Just keep
that belly button clean.
</P>
<P>
   A THREAT OF LEAKS
</P>
<P>
   Designers are like those darned special investigators _ they're
always finding an opening somewhere. Or creating one. Hussein
Chalayan for TSE and Daryl K used slices to draw eyes to otherwise
monotone get-ups. Cynthia Rowley zipped a top and skirt together.
But Geoffrey Beene got the standing O with his multizippered
dresses, letting the models choose what they were willing to bare.
</P>
<P>
   BINDING RESOLUTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Amazing what you can string up these days _ sleeves, necklines,
hemlines, even hips. Anna Sui laced up her leather pants at the
hips and let the strings blend with the fringe on the legs. Maybe
designers have caught on to the talk about full-size models and
Americans getting bigger. Maybe it's some philosophical thing about
controlling your own destiny. Maybe it's just drawstrings.
</P>
<P>
   DIVISIVENESS
</P>
<P>
   Designers were split on a few issues: Glam or prim? Capri pants
or relaxed fit? The good news is, so many showed separates that
you're free to mix and match. Go wild. Put Ralph Lauren's cargo
pants with Ellen Tracy's tube top. Try a Richard Tyler leather
jacket with an Issey Miyake printed pleated skirt. They may veto
the idea, but hey, it's a free country.
</P>
<P>
   HEMMING (AND HAWING)
</P>
<P>
   People have been so edgy lately. Must be those legal bills. Or
the election returns? Designers seem to admire the ``laser-cut''
fabrics as much as ever, but they're also dressing up ho-hum hems.
Oscar de la Renta and Marc Jacobs did scallops. Bill Blass liked
tiny beaded fringe. Others made it look like they just put down
their shears before nudging the model into the lights _ BCBG,
Geoffrey Beene, Ellen Tracy, Daryl K and Patrick Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   UNIFORM VOTE
</P>
<P>
   Why not replace gray, winter's cool color, with khaki or a nice
olive drab? Like spring, they've got some warmth. Ralph Lauren's
``khaki fatigue bikini bottom'' with pockets was popular. John
Bartlett and Michael Kors also liked the colors, Kors mixing his
with a bit of construction-sign orange. Might make nice PR flak
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   MIDTERM ELECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Those women under model height might not like the
neither-here-nor-there of knee-length skirts. But like pink,
everyone who wasn't doing evening wear seemed to show it. With
heels, sandals or boots, doesn't matter. Pockets (Marc Jacobs) or
odd, oversized outward pleats (Hussein Chalayan for TSE), doesn't
matter. Go for it. These things appear scandal-free.
</P>
<P>
   WHITE-BLOUSE STAFF
</P>
<P>
   Ah, white. So clean, so innocent. So crisp, like the feel of
fresh subpoena. Indulge, like Bill Blass, in white top, skirt and
jacket. Strut your stuff, like Daryl K, in white top, pants,
sandals and socks. Stand tall, like Ralph Lauren, in white cropped
jacket, shell and pants. Calm. Confident. (Look, the mudslingers'
arms are twitching.)

</P>
<P>
   Under the landmark 1996 Telecommunications Act, the telcos are
obliged to offer all schools, from kindergarten through the 12th
grade, as well as all public libraries, discounts on their lowest
institutional rate for telephone and Internet services. These
discounts range from 20 to 90 percent, depending on economic need
as measured by the percentage of students eligible for the national
school lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers originally saw it, the e-rate discounts _ the ``e''
stands for ``education'' _ would be relatively painless to
consumers because the telcos could offset their costs with some of
the additional revenue they earned through deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   But the telcos, faced with a spate of mergers amid a newly
ultra-competitive climate, declined to continue a 60-year-old
tradition of hidden subsidies. Starting in July, they insisted that
their costs of subsidizing the school wiring effort _ a small part
of a longstanding ``universal access'' fee _ appear as a separate
charge on most phone statements.
</P>
<P>
   This fee increasingly began to be portrayed by opponents of the
program as yet another federal tax _ and worse yet, one that
Congress had never specifically voted into law.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans even had a politically convenient label, the ``Gore
tax,'' thanks to the vice president's prominent role in driving the
school wiring bill through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One critic of the e-rate, Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., said, ``the
FCC is incorrect in its contention that the 'Gore Tax' is a fee. A
fee is a charge for a service rendered; however, long-distance
users are not receiving a service. Thus, if a charge is levied and
no direct service is provided then it is characterized as a tax,
regardless of whether it shows up on your IRS 1040 form or your
telephone bill, and only Congress can impose a tax under the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Weller, Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., wants the Congress
that will convene in January to cut the current 3 percent telephone
excise tax that pays for the hookups to 1 percent, and earmark that
money for state block grants for schools and libraries. Both
members sit on the House Ways and Means Committee, where all
revenue legislation originates.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters, the telcos saw the changes made
to the universal service funding mechanism in the 1996 law as a
chance to once more put the entire question before the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans is considering a case from Texas that challenges the
legality of the whole universal service program, including the
e-rate. A ruling on this issue could come by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The e-rate program builds on 1936 federal legislation that
created a special fund to subsidize basic telephone service to
every home in the nation, offering phone companies the financial
means to deliver a dial tone to even the most rural, sparsely
populated areas, where connections would otherwise be prohibitively
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   About 27 percent of classrooms in U.S. libraries and schools
have Internet connections. Roughly 2 million more need to be
connected, and within the next five years, some 10,000 new schools
will be built.
</P>
<P>
   The universal service fund was supposed to provide $2.2 billion
for Internet modernization in 1998. Since the total tab from the
approximately 30,000 schools and libraries that have applied for
aid came to slightly more than $2 billion, it appeared at first
that the federal kitty would more than fully support the actual
demand.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress soon raised alarms, fueled in part by a General
Accounting Office report that labeled the e-rate program a prime
candidate for fraud, waste and abuse. In response, on June 12 the
FCC cut e-rate funding by 43 percent, to $1.3 billion. And the
agency stretched out overall funding by six more months to June 30,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress originally saw the discounts as an entitlement to all
schools,'' noted David Byer, vice president for government affairs
for the Software Publishers Association. But, as matters stand,
only the very poorest school districts in the country will qualify
for inside (Internet) wiring.''
</P>
<P>
   In focusing on the discounts, Congress had failed to take into
full account that low-cost hookups were of little value to schools
unless they could be supported by a full panoply of switches,
routers and wires, to say nothing of training, needed to make the
system function effectively.
</P>
<P>
   But in focusing on the supportive Internet hardware, some school
administrators saw a fresh source of federal funds to fix up their
schools under the guise of making them ``Internet-ready.'' Reports
of such attempted end runs incensed key members of Congress and
helped force the FCC's decision to stretch out and scale back
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of June, the FCC had collected about $650
million to fund the e-rate program. Regulators plan to limit
collections for each subsequent quarter through mid-1999 to $325
million per quarter. Since the federal program can pay out no more
than has been collected, it's evident that many eligible schools
and libraries will not get the funding they want until well into
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Held up since July, the first allocation of $2.25 billion in
funds are now scheduled to be released by the end of this month.
Meantime, the FCC extended the application deadline for the next
funding period to Dec. 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I fear we may be losing our perspective on these
matters,'' said Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore, a strong backer of the
e-rate plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-distance phone bills are now at their lowest point in
history,'' he said. ``The telecommunications industry has saved
billions in costs as a result of telecommunications reform to date.
And yet a controversy has erupted over one element that would
represent less than one cent per day per customer line to provide
Internet access for America's schools and libraries.''
</P>
<P>
   Concludes Blumenauer: ``Schools and libraries across the country
took the federal government at its word. They spent countless hours
and tens of thousands of dollars preparing applications to receive
funds from the FCC under the e-rate program. We must not break that
commitment.''

CARROLL MUM ON VITAL POINT: WHO'S GOING TO PLAY VS. BUFFALO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Evidently, Pete Carroll decided to keep his
Patriots on edge this week. While speculation has been gorwing that
there will be changes for Sunday's game against the Buffalo Bills _
and the coach reiterated it Friday _ the players know nothing about
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: Chris Canty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to ask Pete that,'' said the cornerback when asked
if he expected to be benched in favor of Steve Israel. ``Nobody has
said anything to me. If I don't start, I'm still out there on the
nickel and dime packages. This isn't gonna change anything with me
a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Canty didn't practice as much with the regular defense this
week, while Israel got a bit more work with that unit. Speculation
among the players is that Israel will start, but that may be purely
symbolic because the Patriots spend so much time in their nickel
package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was doing a good job,'' said Canty. ``I'm still in
the nickel and dime packages. This isn't gonna change anything with
me or my attitude or how I approach my job. Whatever is best for
the team. I had a good week of practice. I practiced hard. If I'm
not starting it makes no difference to my approach. I'm going to
give it everything I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit B: Heath Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   The third-year offensive lineman worked with the first team at
both guard spots and center but didn't sense any change in the way
he'll be used in Buffalo. The Patriots have spotted him at both
guard positions. Will he start over Max Lane? Will he play more?
Nobody was answering that one.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit C: Tebucky Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie cornerback did more work with the regular defense in
practice this week than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   This may mean absolutely nothing, but while the Patriots have
been leading him by the hand, there are signs they are beginning to
let him crawl. Jones probably won't be a factor against the Bills,
but it appears the coaching staff will not be averse to using him
if one of the cornerbacks is ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit D: Larry Whigham.
</P>
<P>
   The special-teams All-Pro said he will be involved in more of
the substitute packages in the secondary than he has been recently.
Whigham may be blitzing some with the linebacking corps decimated
by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did make a couple of roster moves, but nothing that
would shake up the team. They waived wide receiver Anthony Ladd in
anticipation of Brisby's return and signed practice-squad
linebacker Shawn Stuckey to the active roster.
</P>
<P>
   With the linebacking corps thinning out, Stuckey, a 6-foot,
229-pound rookie free agent from Troy State, will likely play some
on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Besides subtle changes, the Patriots really can't do much else
with 10 players currently on the injury report.
</P>
<P>
   Some will return, but they'll be playing in pain. For isntance,
wide receiver Shawn Jefferson reported, ``I'll probably have to
play with sore ribs all season.''
</P>
<P>
   On the brighter side, there's Derrick Cullors, the kick returner
and third-down back who was slowed for a while with an aching lower
back but reports that he's fine now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to break one last week, but I got
tackled from behind,'' said Cullors. ``I'm certainly due for
something big to happen. I want to contribute to this thing more
and be more involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Another player who seems ready to turn the corner is center Dave
Wohlabaugh, who has played the past four games with a cast on his
broken left hand. He said this may be the last week he needs it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get used to playing with it,'' said Wohlabuagh.
``There are just things you can't do as a center in this league,
but hopefully, I won't have to have much longer.''

LEARNING ... AND UNLEARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 15, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The years 1890 and 1891 were periods of intense labor and most
gratifying rewards....Convinced that I had finally found my proper
path, I attacked my work with positive fury.... During 1890 alone,
I published 14 monographs, not counting translations. Today I am
astonished by that devouring activity, which took aback even the
German investigators, who are the most industrious and patient on
the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   So wrote one of the founders of the modern study of
consciousness, long years after the event. But the author of
``Recollections of My Life'' was not the Austrian Sigmund Freud,
but rather the Spaniard Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the greatest of the
early students of the tissues of the brain, discoverer of the
neuron as the basic unit of the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   And though Freud is infinitely better known and more widely read
for his meditations on the unconscious, it is Ramon whose studies
during the years from 1890 to the 1930s made the breakthrough for
the salient of knowledge that now is racing ahead: Prozac, Viagra,
and the rest. The skein of investigation that began a hundred years
ago with the study of individual brain cells currently is paying a
lot more dividends than psychoanalysis has done.
</P>
<P>
   We may never agree on Freud, but it is becoming more clear all
the time that the immediate future belongs to that great
intersection of physiology, biochemistry, molecular and
evolutionary biology, and cognitive psychology known as
neuroscience. An especially good introduction to this most
promising frontier _ ``Creating Mind: How the Brain Works'' by John
E. Dowling _ has just appeared. It makes clear why brain science
may be to the 21st century what computer science has been to the
20th: a transforming experience, a cornucopia of opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But first, consider what we must unlearn. The power of Freudian
thought to confound understanding is about as great as it is
illuminating. A seemingly built-in propensity for taking things too
far is the subject of a fascinating new book by Edward Dolnick.
``Madness on the Couch: Blaming the Victim in the Heyday of
Psychoanalysis'' is a striking portrait of a small but noisy
industry in decline.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1900 that Freud published ``The Interpretation of
Dreams,'' the book that made his reputation. He wrote to a friend
at the time, ``Do you suppose that someday one will read on a
marble tablet on this house: `Here, on July 24, 1895, the secret of
the dream revealed itself to Dr. Sigm. Freud?''' Needless to say,
the tablet can be found today, at No. 19 Berggassein Vienna. But
what was the secret?
</P>
<P>
   Freud believed that dreams were the key to the existence of a
vast and turbulent region of unconscious desire that exists beneath
the surface of our everyday lives. They existed to disguise
forbidden impulses originating in this subterranean continent so
that we could bear to confront them. But this ``fear of the wish''
was forever spilling over into our daily lives as well. ``When a
member of my family complains to me of having bitten his tongue,
pinched a finger or the like,'' Freud wrote, ``he does not get the
sympathy he hopes for, but instead the question, `Why did you do
that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Dolnick, a veteran science writer, describes the lengths to
which Freud's followers took this insight in their search for the
Talking Cure. His account is less antic than those by writer Tom
Wolfe of similar fads _ among minimalist painters (``The Painted
Word'') and modern architects (``From Bauhaus to Our House'') _ but
it is more shocking and darkly amusing. Granted, the rival
treatments for common disorders such as schizophrenia,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, and autism were no bargains during
most of the 20th century: a poke in the eye with an icepick to
disconnect the brain's frontal lobe, insulin or electric shock
designed to induce convulsions and coma.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the special, strange, frenzied era'' of the 1950s and
1960s, as Dolnick describes it, when psychoanalysts engaged in a
rush to blame schizophrenia on the families of its sufferers, is
really startling in its cruelty. Frieda Fromm-Reichmann asserted
the existence of the ``schizophreogenic mother'' in 1948. Twenty
years later psychiatrist Theodore Lidz of Yale intoned, ``We know
now that the patient's family of origin is always severely
disturbed.'' R.D. Laing inaugurated the 1970s by painting the
schizophrenic as a heroic voyager impeded mainly by unsympathetic
family members.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was psychiatrist John Rosen. Inventor of ``direct
analysis'' and the American Academy of Psychotherapy's Man of the
Year in 1971, Rosen reported that he had learned to speak to
patients' unconscious _ directly. ``Sometimes,'' he explained,
``when I have the patient pinned to the floor, I say, `I can
castrate you, I can kill you, I can eat you. I can do whatever I
want to you, but I'm not going to do it.''' In 1983, charged with
multiple beatings and at least one death, he quietly gave up his
license to practice medicine.
</P>
<P>
   It is too late to short Freud, but not too late to go long on
the brain _ a case that is made with grace and remarkable clarity
by Dowling in ``Creating Mind.'' Dowling is a distinguished
scientist _ a professor at Harvard University, for many years
master of one of its 10 undergraduate houses, serving now as
president of the Corporation for Marine Biology at Woods Hole. The
book grew out of talks he gave to journalists on the swiftly moving
frontier of neuroscience. It is beautifully illustrated and
wonderfully clear.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of ``Creating Mind'' describes the operation and
architecture of the brain _ some 3 1/2 pounds of meat that
``oversees virtually everything we do and makes us what we are.''
Its neurons (the information-transmitting cells) and glia (which do
the housekeeping) are arranged in a shape of great complexity and
beauty. Its mechanisms, chemical and electrical, are surpassingly
intricate _ and yet increasingly well understood. How does dopamine
work? Why does Prozac do what it does? What are the enkephalins _
the natural opiate of the brain? It is all here, lucidly explained.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the book, Dowling moves systematically
from brain to mind, examining various functions of our brains:
vision, perception, language, memory, emotion. By the time he gets
to consciousness, the reader begins to understand the mysteries
that remain. Why do we sleep, for instance? It is one of our
strongest drives. Why are most dreams unpleasant, tinged with
sadness, apprehension, and even anger? What goes on when we
remember? When we think?
</P>
<P>
   Dowling says the pharmacopia of drugs to deal with mental
illness will grow over the next 50 years, of course; combinations
of agents will be fashioned to the mental profiles of individual
patients. Stroke damage will be easier to prevent, paraplegia and
quadriplegia will become curable illnesses, learning disabilities
will be easier to treat. The processes of aging will be better
understood. Even jet lag will have a pill. There will be be
enhancements to memory and mood; foreign languages will be easier
to learn. That, he says, is a conservative prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   And what about consciousness? And therapy? And all the other
topics that philosophers go endlessly round about today? Ever the
cautious scientist, Dowling has little to say on these topics. The
journalist Dolnick is more bold. ``We are unlikely to see a return
from biology to psychology,'' he writes; the triumph of the
biological picture of mental illness is complete. It is just
possible, however, that Sigmund Freud will remain around to share
in the last laugh. If the domain of the unconscious that he
discovered is not the simple problem in hydraulic engineering that
he imagined it to be, neither is it likely to turn out to merely a
matter a few large molecules. There will always be a seat at the
table for a clinical psychologist.

 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever I write about electric cars anymore, I trigger a batch
of letters from environazis who, regardless of what the piece may
actually say, offer the same tiresome shrieks usually beginning
with: ``As you are an advocate (or tool of) the oil lobby. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Next comes a recitation of alleged research findings, dire
environmental warnings, testimonials, and more accusations _ I am a
tool of (take your pick) Detroit, the oil companies, OPEC, big
business, Republicans, Democrats, the oligarchy, military
industrial complex, etc. What really generates hate mail is mention
of the term ``Green Gestapo.'' The fuzzy-brained extremists who
advocate battery-powered cars, suspension of logging, banning of
beef, and all jokes that may possibly offend someone, somewhere,
just hate to be identified with those Nazi thugs who interfered
with free speech, burned books, and murdered people. But what do
you call someone who hammers spikes into trees to kill loggers,
advocates gagging columnists who disagree with the politically
correct point of view, or who would condemn a whole class of people
to unemployment because they killed cute little seals? (Killing
flounder is OK, though; they're ugly.)
</P>
<P>
   By way of disclosure, I must admit that I do chat with the guys
at the gas station and I once did meet the guy who delivered my
heating oil _ but now I heat with gas and see nobody from that
utility. That's as close to the oil business as I ever got. I own
no oil stocks, no shares in auto companies, and am on no payrolls
other than the Globe Newspaper Co.
</P>
<P>
   I was mulling all of this last week as I was tooling around New
England in a high-tech hybrid four-passenger sedan with good
performance, a real heater, air conditioning, a smog-defeating
electric motor, and a clean-burning gas engine reportedly capable
of 66 miles per gallon plus. It is not a car of the future; it is a
Toyota Prius, a car of now _ today. It's on sale in Japan and
Toyota can't build them fast enough to keep up with demand. It's
slated to come here in 2000, probably selling for around
$16,000-$17,000.
</P>
<P>
   So why was the initial mention of this vehicle in this column in
September still another occasion of tool-of-the-oil-barons mail? Do
you suppose that some of these partisans of green are perhaps tools
of the power lobby? After all, the Prius will never need an outlet;
it recharges its own batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Prius is what is known as a parallel hybrid _ an internal
combustion engine and electric motor work together. In the Toyota
model, a unique transmission is the key, a transaxle that splits
power from the internal combustion engine between the drive wheels
and the charging system. The amount of power varies according to
demand.
</P>
<P>
   The power system consists of a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder gas engine,
electric motor, generator, inverter, and nickel metal hydride
battery. Driving it presents some differences, but no difficulties
_ if you forget for a moment that the test vehicle was a right-hand
drive model intended for the Japanese market, complete with
Japanese labels and radio designed for the home islands band
widths. But, there are dual radio controls, presumably for
passenger and driver. Toll booths did present some problems; I
could have used one of those long-handled baskets you sometimes see
in the hands of church ushers collecting donations.
</P>
<P>
   One turns the key and the dash lights up but the engine may or
may not start _ you don't care; it doesn't matter. From a dead stop
you'll be working off electric power anyway and as soon as you put
it in drive and press the pedal, the motor will purr to life. Under
light loads, it is an electric car _ read that as city driving,
level ground ,or downhill. On the highway at speed, all systems are
go; in hard acceleration, electric and gas power combine to afford
performance. At stop lights, the gas engine shuts down until called
upon _ no pollution idling.
</P>
<P>
   The digital speedometer offers the speed in kilometers; I'm
humming along a secondary road _ avoiding toll booths _ when a
police officer traveling the other way flashes his lights; a quick
recalculation of speed shows I am indeed indicating more Ks than
the zone warrants. Very civilized, flashing lights _ he must've
been the chief who set the ticket quotas rather than the patrol
officer who must fill them.
</P>
<P>
   On Interstate 95, the Prius accelerates well, moves with the
traffic. Climbing hills with that traffic, the car hums and groans,
but stays with the crowd. A VDT on the dash explains the operating
modes of the powertrain _ except that the explanation is in
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The gear shift offers park, reverse, neutral, and drive
positions _ plus a B position; that's to add engine braking on
downhill runs. The right hand drive setup still has the pedals in
the same relative position but the signal and wiper control stalks
are the reverse of usual providing occasions of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Headroom and legroom are good up front, fair in the rear; four
adults do fit and the car accelerates well with four hefty adults
on board. Handling is very good and the ride surprisingly good in
such a small vehicle _ the wheels are at extreme ends of the car
with virtually no overhang, thus lengthening the wheelbase to the
maximum to smooth the ride. Underway, Prius is quiet, civilized _
fun, even.
</P>
<P>
   The glove box is tiny and interior storage scant, but the trunk
is surprisingly roomy. The Prius is about the overall size of a
Beetle but with four doors and more room.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to extending fuel mileage, the Prius offers some
interesting advantages over a pure electric _ not the least of
which are an 850-mile range winter or summer, instant refueling,
real heat and AC, all the amenities, and real-car performance.
Prius does not need a formidable array of prohibitively expensive
batteries, nor does it require frequent deep discharge of its sole
battery, the factor that does the most to shorten battery life. The
battery, Toyota says, will likely last the useful life of the car.
</P>
<P>
   And, since it doesn't need external recharging facilities, no
new infrastructure need be built, a condition of electrics. Since
the power companies needn't provide the juice for Prius, it will
not be necessary to increase output and consequent pollution nor
will you ever be asked to park your Prius in a summer brown-out. Of
course, the utility profit potential will be lost, too, which may
be what really stirs up the campaign for useless golf carts
disguised as cars.
</P>
<P>
   When the oil does finally peter out, fuel will be found, albeit
more expensive than a buck a gallon. At 66 miles per gallon or
better in something like a Prius, we can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give the Prius a pair of thumbs up. A pox on the pure
electric car. OK, the letter opener's at the ready, folks. Let 'er
rip with the hate mail.

FOR A VARIETY OF `OZ' COSTUMES...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Dorothy's ruby slippers are clicking citywide
again, and fans eagerly are skipping down the yellow brick road to
buy, buy, buy.
</P>
<P>
   With the re-release of ``The Wizard of Oz,'' the Warner Bros.
store in Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park already is sold out of those
ruby slippers. However, it has other items, such as a ``Wizard of
Oz'' theme cookie jar for $45.
</P>
<P>
   But if the shoes are what you're really after, don't despair.
Miz Hot Tips hunted them down at Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills for
$26.50, as well as the Good Witch Glinda's crown for $20, and
children's costumes of each of the major characters. The store also
has a life-size stuffed Toto, and a cool vintage-inspired purse in
purple sequins with a ruby slippers motif. The purse, $30, could be
used by adult Dorothy fans.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also find Dorothy's famous slippers covered in red
glitter at Nordstrom for $24.95, and similarly priced styles at
Mervyn's.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if all you want is a little dose of nostalgia, Nicole by
OPI has the ticket. The North Hollywood-based company has created
Ruby Dooby Doo nail lacquer in a deep ruby hue with a little
sparkle, available for about $7 a bottle at Saks Fifth Avenue, and
J.C. Penney hair salons. Best of all, part of the proceeds benefit
local charities such as Gilda's Club, Rock the Vote and Starbright
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   NEW SHOPPING VENUES: Miz Hot Tips went on mall patrol and
discovered that Northridge Fashion Center now has a new Border's
Bookstore with a coffee and pastry bar. The grand opening hoopla is
scheduled throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Century City Shopping Center also has a new store to try. It's
Joan Vass, a boutique specializing in sporty women's knitwear, with
leopard spots and pin stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Over in hipsterville, a k a Melrose Avenue, British designer
Liza Bruce is opening her first store. You'll find her trademark
silk bikinis, futuristic fashions and plenty of cruisewear clothing
that works so well for the SoCal scene.
</P>
<P>
   And in Santa Monica, look for Sur La Table, which opens Monday
at 301 Wilshire Blvd., across from the Third Street Promenade. It's
a cook's haven, with state-of-the-art kitchen equipment and
hard-to-find cook's tools, with lots of celebrity chefs making
personal appearances.
</P>
<P>
   HOW ORNAMENTAL: Stores already are decked out for the holidays
with tree ornaments galore, but most of the designs are ho-hum. For
something sure to start a conversation around the tree, consider
Kathie Lee Gifford's elegant Lenox china ornament with three
cherubs on the front to represent the ideals of childhood: beauty,
innocence and joy. It's $30 at department stores everywhere, and
proceeds benefit Cassidy's Place, an organization for needy
children.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Miz Hot Tips spotted patriotic
red-white-and-blue ornaments, as well as a few shaped like Faberge
eggs at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley. They're $7 and up.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ADDITIONS: Kathy Ireland has added yet another category to
her fashion collections at Kmart, and this time it's golf fashions.
The line has some bright red and yellow styles so you'll be easily
spotted on the green.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret stores have added something new, too. It's
Liquid Lingerie cosmetics, with some special-effects products to
make you more glam, giving a boost much like their push-up bras.
Most items are priced from $10 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   And over at Sears, they have new Santa suits for all those
holiday parties coming up. There are three styles (all red, of
course), priced from $59.99 to $200, plus belly boosters and beard
sets.

NEBRASKA IN UNFAMILIAR ROLE _ UNDERDOG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ They arrive here in a different role.
Spoilers. Underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   And in a very real sense, the University of Nebraska comes into
this afternoon's game against No. 2 Kansas State perfectly cast.
</P>
<P>
   With a 7-2 record, the Cornhuskers have no chance to defend
their national championship, and if the oddsmakers who have made
coach Frank Solich's team a nearly two-touchdown underdog are
right, they have only a slim hope of retaining their Big 12 title.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say the Huskers are ready to concede anything.
After all, we're talking about Kansas State, a team that has not
beaten Nebraska since 1968 and, despite its 9-0 start and co-No. 1
ranking in the coaches' poll (with Tennessee), remains a mystery to
many. It's a team whose record and reputation have been built
against inferior competition.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at KSU Stadium, that changes. With a national
television audience looking on, the Wildcats of Bill Snyder face
their first character as well as talent check of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the game will signify a transition in power in the Big
12. Nebraska, which has won two of the last three national
championships, is not ready to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't pass along anything to anybody,'' said first-year
coach Solich, who has already seen Nebraska suffer more losses in
nine games than it totaled in the last three seasons under Tom
Osborne. ``Everybody has to earn what they get, whether it's
against us or somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska has lost to Texas A&AMP;M and Texas and has hardly looked
like the dominant team of past years. With starting quarterback
Bobby Newcombe sidelined by a knee injury and tailback DeAngelo
Evans in and out of the lineup because of injuries, the Huskers
have looked and proven to be vulnerable all season.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, does not make Nebraska incapable of winning. ``We
haven't been in this position in a long time,'' said fullback Joel
Makovica, part of a senior class that has won 43 of 47 games.
</P>
<P>
   Motivation has not been a problem this week in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, overconfidence has been a worry here. A headline
this week in the Manhattan Mercury _ ``Snyder warns not to take NU
lightly'' _ suggests the K-State coach's concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evident thing is the fact that they haven't had all their
personnel they want in the game,'' said Snyder. ``Injuries have
jumped up and got them more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder was asked if he was surprised that the Huskers have lost
twice. ``It's not surprising, but it's not what you are accustomed
to seeing,'' he said. ``They lost to two very fine football teams.
Texas is playing so well right now, and of course, A&AMP;M has played
well all year. But it's not something you anticipate.''
</P>
<P>
   If it happens this afternoon, the final chapter of Nebraska's
remarkable run, highlighted by three national championships in five
seasons, will have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   It will also signify a new role for Kansas State _ national
championship contender.
</P>
<P>
   But to achieve it, the Wildcats will have to end a 30-year run
of futility.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With additional American troops, warships and
attack planes streaming toward the Persian Gulf, President Clinton
said Friday that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein still ''has it
within his hands'' to avoid U.S. airstrikes by agreeing,
unconditionally, to open his weapons of mass destruction program to
United Nations inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejected, however, Saddam's suggestion that inspections
go forward in exchange for assurances that Gulf War-era economic
sanctions on Iraq be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's ''real goal is to end the sanctions without giving up its
weapons of mass destruction program,'' Clinton said. ''This is
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that the diplomatic clock is running out, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Saddam faced the
prospect of U.S. air strikes without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ''No further warnings are needed,'' she told reporters, before
leaving for Malaysia, where she and Clinton are to rendezvous this
weekend in preparation for talks next week with their counterparts
in the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
   ''For months we have said that every option was on the table.
Unfortunately, one by one, the diplomatic options have been
rebuffed,'' Albright said. ''Iraq has a simple choice: reverse
course or face the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was slated to leave Saturday evening for the APEC
conference, part of a scheduled week-long swing through Asia that
would also take him to Japan, Korea and Guam.
</P>
<P>
   With the prospect of air strikes on Iraq looming, however, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart on Friday declined to rule out a
last-minute cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president very much wants to go to APEC,'' Lockhart told
reporters at a White House news briefing. ''We're watching the
situation in Iraq very closely, and when and if there is a change
in the schedule, I'll let you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, however, advised against reading too much into whether
Clinton went ahead with his scheduled trip.
</P>
<P>
   The president travels with a full contingent of senior national
security and military staff. And Air Force One, the presidential
aircraft, is equipped with secure communications gear that keeps
Clinton in touch with anyone he might need to contact -- regarding
diplomacy or war.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the mix is the timing on a continuing U.S. military
build-up in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   With some 23,000 U.S. troops already in the region, the
president is deploying 21,500 more, most of which are expected to
be in the region by the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Additional bombers and fighter jets are also en route, as is the
massive nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Enterprise. It
isn't expected in the region until Nov. 23, the day after Clinton
is scheduled to return from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   As the military build-up continued, so did diplomatic efforts to
end the latest stand-off between the United States and Iraq over
Saddam's refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council met late Friday with Secretary General
Kofi Annan to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Annan traveled last February to Baghdad, where he brokered a
last-minute deal that averted threatened U.S. airstrikes against
Iraq. He has said he has no plans to try to reprise that effort
this time.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, Saddam said he would accept ''any initiative,'' that
would lead to the fulfillment of Iraq's ''legal demands,'' an
apparent reference to the lifting of U.N. sanctions that have
crippled the Iraqi economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a public statement, Saddam said he had restricted, in August,
then ended, in October, Iraqi cooperation with U.N. inspections
teams, in order to force a U.N. decision on when the sanctions
might be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intended to get responses to Iraq's legal demands,'' said
Saddam. ''Iraq will accept positively any initiative that meets
these just and balanced demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said ''there is nothing new and nothing positive or
productive,'' in Saddam's comments. ''To say that the sanctions
must be lifted, and detail a number of issues which he knows are
non-starters is not a productive way for him to use his time.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright treated Saddam's gesture not as an olive branch, but as
a smokescreen, saying the United Nations had repeatedly, and as
recently as last August, presented Saddam with a specific road map
that, if followed, would end the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   She said the United Nations would provide a current review of
the steps Iraq must take to end the sanctions, but only if Saddam
first publicly ''rescinds'' his restrictions on U.N. inspections
and takes concrete steps to cooperate fully with inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Still, Saddam Hussein has it within his hands to end this
crisis now, by resuming full cooperation with UNSCOM,'' Clinton
said, using the acronym for the U.N. Special Commission on weapons
inspections in Iraq. ''This choice is his alone, and the
consequences, if he fails to comply, his alone, in terms of
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president remained hopeful that strikes could
be averted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our belief and our preference that we can work this out
in a peaceful way that allows UNSCOM to return,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.N. resolutions, sanctions against Iraq can only be
lifted after U.N. inspectors can verify that all of Iraq's
biological and chemical weapons have been destroyed and the
Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Association certifies that
Saddam's alleged nuclear weapons program is out of business.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials have said Iraq could be within two
years of producing an effective nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. sanctions sharply restrict Iraq's oil exports, crimping
the resources the country has to devote to its weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam agreed in 1991 to destroy his weapons of mass
destruction, and to submit his weapons industry to U.N.
inspections, as part of the terms of his surrender to the U.S.-led
coalition forces that drove Iraqi troops from neighboring Kuwait
during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has grown impatient with the sanctions, just as the
United States and much of the global community has been frustrated
with Iraq's continuing refusal to fully cooperate with weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is believed to have nearly 100 sites from which it produces
chemical or biological weapons or components.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these sites double as pharmaceutical manufacturers or
makers of other civilian-use materiel, and would be likely targets
of U.S. air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible targets would include Saddam's elite
Revolutionary Guard, some 26,000 of his best soldiers, as well as
the command and control structures that support them; air defense
systems; military airports and aircraft; and the Iraqi intelligence
agencies and secret police deemed critical to Saddam's grip on
power.

<P>
   ''No further warnings are needed,'' she told reporters, before
leaving for Malaysia, where she and Clinton are to rendezvous this
weekend in preparation for talks next week with their counterparts
in the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
   ''For months we have said that every option was on the table.
Unfortunately, one by one, the diplomatic options have been
rebuffed,'' Albright said. ''Iraq has a simple choice: reverse
course or face the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was slated to leave Saturday evening for the APEC
conference, part of a scheduled week-long swing through Asia that
would also take him to Japan, Korea and Guam.
</P>
<P>
   With the prospect of air strikes on Iraq looming, however, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart on Friday declined to rule out a
last-minute cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president very much wants to go to APEC,'' Lockhart told
reporters at a White House news briefing. ''We're watching the
situation in Iraq very closely, and when and if there is a change
in the schedule, I'll let you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, however, advised against reading too much into whether
Clinton went ahead with his scheduled trip.
</P>
<P>
   The president travels with a full contingent of senior national
security and military staff. And Air Force One, the presidential
aircraft, is equipped with secure communications gear that keeps
Clinton in touch with anyone he might need to contact -- regarding
diplomacy or war.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the mix is the timing on a continuing U.S. military
build-up in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   With some 23,000 U.S. troops already in the region, the
president is deploying 21,500 more, most of which are expected to
be in the region by the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Additional bombers and fighter jets are also en route, as is the
massive nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Enterprise. It
isn't expected in the region until Nov. 23, the day after Clinton
is scheduled to return from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   As the military build-up continued, so did diplomatic efforts to
end the latest stand-off between the United States and Iraq over
Saddam's refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council met late Friday with Secretary General
Kofi Annan to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Annan traveled last February to Baghdad, where he brokered a
last-minute deal that averted threatened U.S. airstrikes against
Iraq. He has said he has no plans to try to reprise that effort
this time.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, Saddam said he would accept ''any initiative,'' that
would lead to the fulfillment of Iraq's ''legal demands,'' an
apparent reference to the lifting of U.N. sanctions that have
crippled the Iraqi economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a public statement, Saddam said he had restricted, in August,
then ended, in October, Iraqi cooperation with U.N. inspections
teams, in order to force a U.N. decision on when the sanctions
might be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intended to get responses to Iraq's legal demands,'' said
Saddam. ''Iraq will accept positively any initiative that meets
these just and balanced demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said ''there is nothing new and nothing positive or
productive,'' in Saddam's comments. ''To say that the sanctions
must be lifted, and detail a number of issues which he knows are
non-starters is not a productive way for him to use his time.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright treated Saddam's gesture not as an olive branch, but as
a smokescreen, saying the United Nations had repeatedly, and as
recently as last August, presented Saddam with a specific road map
that, if followed, would end the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   She said the United Nations would provide a current review of
the steps Iraq must take to end the sanctions, but only if Saddam
first publicly ''rescinds'' his restrictions on U.N. inspections
and takes concrete steps to cooperate fully with inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Still, Saddam Hussein has it within his hands to end this
crisis now, by resuming full cooperation with UNSCOM,'' Clinton
said, using the acronym for the U.N. Special Commission on weapons
inspections in Iraq. ''This choice is his alone, and the
consequences, if he fails to comply, his alone, in terms of
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president remained hopeful that strikes could
be averted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our belief and our preference that we can work this out
in a peaceful way that allows UNSCOM to return,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.N. resolutions, sanctions against Iraq can only be
lifted after U.N. inspectors can verify that all of Iraq's
biological and chemical weapons have been destroyed and the
Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Association certifies that
Saddam's alleged nuclear weapons program is out of business.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials have said Iraq could be within two
years of producing an effective nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. sanctions sharply restrict Iraq's oil exports, crimping
the resources the country has to devote to its weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam agreed in 1991 to destroy his weapons of mass
destruction, and to submit his weapons industry to U.N.
inspections, as part of the terms of his surrender to the U.S.-led
coalition forces that drove Iraqi troops from neighboring Kuwait
during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has grown impatient with the sanctions, just as the
United States and much of the global community has been frustrated
with Iraq's continuing refusal to fully cooperate with weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is believed to have nearly 100 sites from which it produces
chemical or biological weapons or components.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these sites double as pharmaceutical manufacturers or
makers of other civilian-use materiel, and would be likely targets
of U.S. air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible targets would include Saddam's elite
Revolutionary Guard, some 26,000 of his best soldiers, as well as
the command and control structures that support them; air defense
systems; military airports and aircraft; and the Iraqi intelligence
agencies and secret police deemed critical to Saddam's grip on
power.

THE VOICE OF HOLLYWOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It was just another day in the star-studded world
of bachelor Stephen Schochet.
</P>
<P>
   He'd just left TV icon Aaron Spelling's house, dropped by Rodeo
Drive, cruised the Sunset Strip. Now, he stood on a hilltop above
Hollywood Boulevard, the glitter that is Tinseltown spread out at
his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a long line of tourists patiently waited for him,
cameras at the ready to record the day they spent with Stephen
Schochet _ tour bus guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Hollywood, with all its stories,'' said Schochet, 35,
snapping photos of couples from Texas and Australia with the
Hollywood sign in the background. ``And I love to tell all the
stories I find to the people on the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Hollywood news he finds in the entertainment trade
papers and the screen history he digs up in the public library, the
Marina del Rey resident is working to parlay a nine-year career as
a tour guide with VIP Tours &AMP; Charters near Los Angeles
International Airport into a future as an audio publisher.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Valley free-lance record producer Ivor Francis,
Schochet has produced a cassette tape titled ``Tales of Hollywood''
that traces the roots of motion-picture production. The two also
collaborated on a lushly orchestrated double tape/CD biography of
animator and studio head Walt Disney. And the two are putting
together a mini-library of CDs containing 100 two- or three-minute
history vignettes, based on the American Film Institute's recently
released list of the 100 greatest films, that they'll try to
syndicate to radio stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephen has a story about every actor, every director, every
producer in the city, so there's no shortage of stories about every
movie,'' said Francis, brother of ``General Hospital'' star Genie
Francis and owner of Emerald City Records. ``We hope the CD library
is done by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Schochet considered writing a book of Hollywood
tales, ``but it just seemed like my strength was as an oral
storyteller.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he !ital!has!off! had nine years of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always driving past the same places, so I started to look
for new stories to keep the tour fresh,'' Schochet said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't start out as a tour guide. After college, he went to
work for a limousine company and began researching and writing
stories about early Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I could write while I waited for people in the
limo,'' Schochet said. After telling some of his stories to
appreciative limo passengers such as Sammy Davis Jr., it occurred
to him that he'd have a lot more fun telling the stories to a
bigger audience. He signed on with the tour company.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Khorasani, general manager for VIP Tours, said Schochet
offers tidbits of Hollywood history, as well as the latest
entertainment news and gossip, to tour bus passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has so many stories,'' Khorasani said. ``Every day, he
comes up with something new and entertaining for the tourists to
listen to. They seem to love it. And he always shares his stories
with the other tour guides, which they love.''
</P>
<P>
   Schochet's tour route varies only when construction bars the
way: From LAX-area hotels, he heads through Marina del Rey, Venice,
Westwood, Beverly Hills, Holmby Hills and up Sunset Boulevard to
Hollywood. Out-of-towners can briefly stroll along Rodeo Drive, get
a panoramic view of Hollywood from the parking lot of the hilltop
Japanese restaurant Yamashiro, check out stars' handprints and
footprints at Mann's Chinese Theater, then lunch at Farmers Market
before heading back to their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Schochet points out the mud flat that may someday
be the new DreamWorks studio complex; Arnold Schwarzenegger's Santa
Monica restaurant, Shatzi on Main; star magnets Spago and the Viper
Room on the Sunset Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye out for movie stars, he tells tourists _ no telling
where you may spot them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy Stewart was always driving around in a green Volvo
waving at the buses,'' Schochet said. ``George Burns, I used to see
all the time, always with a big smile, always waving at buses. One
time I was loading up the bus at Rodeo Drive, and Kirk Douglas came
by, said `How are you?' to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists love to visit the Regent Beverly Hills Hotel near Rodeo
Drive, where Julia Roberts and Richard Gere filmed lobby scenes for
``Pretty Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to stay in the suite they stayed in in the
movie,'' Schochet told his passengers. ``But they can't; it doesn't
exist. It was filmed on the lot at Warner Bros. Studios.''
</P>
<P>
   But where are the stars?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to see somebody like Leonardo de Caprio of
Gwyneth Paltrow or whoever's the star of the moment, the Skybar (on
the Sunset Strip) is the place to do it,'' he advises.
</P>
<P>
   Schochet offers up some possible luminaries of the future: a
handful of grungily dressed young men lounging on the sidewalk in
front of the sad-looking Laugh Factory on Sunset Boulevard. ``Those
are all young comedians,'' Schochet tells the tourists. ``They get
eight minutes on stage tonight, and they hope somebody will turn
them into the next Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the hills, the tour bus paused in front of former
president Ronald Reagan's home. ``You can see the bulletproof guard
shack,'' Schochet announces.
</P>
<P>
   Composer Quincy Jones' home ``has 25 rooms on six floors'';
``Steel Magnolias'' producer Ray Stark, who owns the home once
occupied by Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, is ``so afraid of
burglars, he bought a used police car and he parks it in the
driveway''; and at Hugh Hefner's Playboy mansion, Schochet shares:
``They had a wild party the other night, lots of people running
around in the buff.''
</P>
<P>
   But the home that drew oohs and aahs from the tourists was
Spelling's palatial 56,500-square-foot home, where the ornate
wrought-iron gates opened, and a cream-colored Mercedes drove out
just as the bus drove by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope, that's not Aaron,'' Schochet told the excited tourists.
``He waves at the buses.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyplace else the tourists want to see?
</P>
<P>
   ``How about O.J.'s house?'' suggested somebody in the back of
the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not on our route, and we're not supposed to go there
because the neighbors got really annoyed by all the tour buses,''
Schochet said regretfully. ``I heard about a driver who got a $256
ticket there the other day just for slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he noted, the Simpson house was recently bulldozed, so
there's nothing left to see.
</P>
<P>
   Schochet's favorite stories _ tales of how Hollywood and its
legends were born _ come after lunch, as he heads back to tourists'
airport hotels.
</P>
<P>
   He tells how people came to see the first silent movies again
and again, agog at the movement, unbothered by lack of plot or
story.
</P>
<P>
   At one theater, a grizzled old farmer came dozens of times to
see a short film that featured a pretty girl disrobing beside a
lake. As she began to remove her final garment, a train streaked
past, between the girl and the camera, and when the train had
passed, the girl was submerged up to her neck in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theater manager asked the old farmer why he kept coming
back to see the film,'' Schochet said. ``The farmer said, `Well,
sonny, I'm hoping one of these days, that train will be late.'''
</P>
<P>
   He tells how Samuel Goldfish, a Polish glove
maker-turned-moviemaker went into partnership in 1916 with Edgar
Selwyn and, four years later, dissolved the partnership _ but
adopted half of Selwyn's last name.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how he came up with the name Goldwyn,'' Schochet
deadpanned. ``Because he didn't want to be Selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   And, complete with a passable voice imitation, Schochet tells
how W.C. Fields' father, determined to deter his son from the evils
of alcohol, filled a glass with live worms, then poured booze over
them, drowning them. But Fields drew his own conclusions from the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen,'' he once told his drinking companions, ``I'll
never forget the lesson my father taught me: When you drink, you
don't get worms.''

INDONESIA SEES WORST VIOLENCE SINCE SUHARTO RESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia, _ Students, thugs and soldiers fought in the
streets of Jakarta Friday night, as parliament adopted a series of
decrees intended to nudge this suffering nation toward a more
democratic future. It was the worst violence since President
Suharto resigned last May.
</P>
<P>
   At least five people were killed, and scores were injured as
well-ordered soldiers and riot policemen fired volley after volley
above and directly into throngs of demonstrators and into the
grounds of a university.
</P>
<P>
   For hours Friday night, as the parliament voted to hold general
elections next spring and to begin a series of reforms, the streets
were filled with shouts and screams and gunfire and the sting of
tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Like the students whose protests helped bring down Suharto, the
people throwing rocks and gasoline bombs Friday night were
pressing, with the passion of the young, for immediate change. But
unlike those earlier protesters, their demand that Suharto's
successor, President B.J. Habibie, step down immediately was less
representative of the national mood.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the violence of the streets and the country's
painfully shrinking economy, Indonesia seems in the past six months
to have settled into a tentative course aimed at real reforms on
which both the government and its opposition generally agree.
</P>
<P>
   But the fury on both sides of the battle Friday night showed the
depth of anger Suharto left behind him in the country he built but
also ruined over his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   The volleys of gunfire Friday night set off rattling echoes on
the glass walls of tall office buildings which, along with the
violence itself, are among Suharto's legacies.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the night, small white ambulances with flashing red
lights drove in and out of the grounds of Atmajaya Catholic
University as the fighting surged around them. Many of the
casualties had gunshot wounds, but it was unclear if these had been
inflicted by live ammunition or by rubber bullets, which can be
fatal at close range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry for my country,'' said Eky, a student journalist
who like many Indonesians uses only one name. ``This is brutal, too
brutal. I don't understand why the military is doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no clear explanation for the harsh tactics of the
security forces. Jakarta was filled with rumors Friday of a
possible coup involving the military and opposition politicians who
might be using the protests as a pretext.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the students _ joined by young men from nearby
slums _ seemed driven by an unslaked anger over the abuses of the
Suharto years and an impatience with the deliberate pace of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The young thugs had their reasons too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody hates the police,'' said Andri, 17, who had just
thrown a plastic bottle of water toward the police lines. ``I see
the police officer as a cruel person and I hate him.''
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat watching the demonstrators Friday night said:
``They are sick of being poor. They are sick of being at the
bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is notable, he said, that the students are essentially
leaderless and that even the newly assertive democratic opposition
no longer shares their urgency for change.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral outline presented to parliament by Habibie suits
both those in power today and those who hope to gain it in the
future. The students, with their vague demands for immediate
change, have been left to shout and throw stones in the streets
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of their passions and potential violence may have
helped push the parliament toward reforms, but the decrees enacted
Friday night were modest.
</P>
<P>
   A vote is to be held next year for an electoral assembly that
will name a new president at the end of 1999. The military's
powerful role in politics is to be phased out, but only gradually.
And past corruption _ including that of Suharto _ is to be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that a form of democracy is dawning, the parliamentary
decrees issued Friday night were the product of the first contested
votes in more than three decades. At one point, one of the parties
staged a brief walkout.
</P>
<P>
   But still, as in the Suharto years, the work of the parliament
was carried out in something of a political vacuum, insulated from
the passions of the streets outside.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clearly under orders to keep the demonstrators far away, the
military stood in massed formations along the roads leading to the
parliament building. When the session ended near midnight, scores
of legislators were stranded in the area, unable to cross the
battle lines to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Though the demands voiced by various student groups vary, the
parliamentary decrees failed to satisfy many of them, and the
possibility of further violence hung over the nation Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motives of the students and the tactics of the
military, the violence Friday night moved far beyond the realm of
policy or politics and became a visceral struggle between enraged
demonstrators and enraged soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students are crazy now,'' a plainclothes security officer
muttered to a reporter. ``Maybe because since the afternoon they
have nothing to eat. And the police are the same. They have gone
crazy too.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the gunfire, foreign diplomats paced the streets with cell
phones to their ears, reporting the action to their embassies. They
said they were angered and shocked by what they were seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the game?'' said one of them. ``What's the objective of
this military operation? To wound the students? The kids are inside
the campus now. The shooting should stop.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, six truckloads of riot police officers drove along
the white iron fence that surrounds the university, standing and
firing their weapons from the back.
</P>
<P>
   The officers jumped from their trucks and began running and
shooting among the bushes by the side of the university. One turned
and shot an Indonesian journalist in the back; his colleagues
carried him to an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Later the police, in their heavy, padded helmets, formed a tight
line only 30 yards from the university's fence and began firing
point blank into its grounds from behind their tall plastic
shields. Some broke ranks to hurl back rocks that the students had
thrown at them.
</P>
<P>
   An officer stood behind them with a megaphone, directing their
fire.
</P>
<P>
   From inside the campus grounds came a constant and extraordinary
roar of animal rage: shouts, yelps, snarls and inarticulate cries,
along with the sound of smashing glass and a relentless banging of
sticks and stones against iron railings.
</P>
<P>
   In the main foyer, dozens of casualties were laid out on the
floor and medical workers performed surgery without anesthetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts, it's hot!'' moaned a young student named Imelda, who
had a gunshot wound to her inner thigh. ``Jesus Christ, help me, I
don't want to die!''
</P>
<P>
   Other students shouted and wept in shock and anger and fear.
They washed their faces with wet rags to clear away the tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   They ran to the iron fence and shouted at the soldiers: ``You
are killers! You are dogs!''
</P>
<P>
   On the street outside, lined with banks and office towers, as
many as 10,000 demonstrators surged, taunting the military. The
leaped up and down in the light of burning gasoline bombs, running
forward occasionally to hurl stones and then retreat.
</P>
<P>
   They chanted, ``Killers! Killers!''
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers chased some of them into an alley and an officer
shouted after them: ``Whoever doesn't live here, please go home. Go
home! But if you want to take us on, please, come ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in the midst of this, at just about the hour the
parliamentary session ended, a police officer walked into the
no-man's land outside the university's gate. He stood amid the
rubble of stones bits of brick and offered a truce over megaphone.
</P>
<P>
   A student ran from the gate and embraced him.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds more poured out, shouting, leaping, uncertain whether
to fight or cheer. They, too, embraced the startled riot policemen,
some trying to kiss them through their heavy visors. ``Thank you!
Thank you!'' one young man shouted over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations began over whether the students would be allowed to
march to the now-empty parliament building. A light rain began to
fall. In a widening circle, students and policemen lowered
themselves to the ground in the thin yellow light of the street
lamps. They sat together and after a while they began to sing the
national anthem.

OIL COMPANIES DELAY DECISION ON CASPIAN PIPELINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKU, Azerbaijan _ Buffeted by political and economic pressures,
oil companies drilling in the Caspian Sea are postponing their
much-awaited decision on where to lay their main export pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The oil consortium canceled a meeting scheduled for Thursday at
which members were to discuss pipeline routes. No date for another
meeting was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is lobbying intensely for a route
across Turkey that would favor U.S. interests. Russia and Iran have
proposed routes of their own. This heavy political crossfire,
coupled with low oil prices and uncertainty about how much oil lies
beneath the Caspian, has made the companies reluctant to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1994 contract between Azerbaijan and 11 foreign
companies, including four from the United States, the companies
were to have chosen an export route by last month. When that
deadline passed, executives said they would probably decide in
November, but now that seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a deadline for a decision,'' said Pamela
Mounter, spokeswoman for the consortium. ``There are a lot of
meetings going on with governments and organizations. This is a
pipeline for the long term, and it's much too important to be
rushed into.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and oil executives said the postponement would give
Turkey time to improve its offer to the companies. U.S. officials
are urging Turkey to offer subsidies big enough to close what oil
executives call the ``billion-dollar gap'' between the cost of this
route and others.
</P>
<P>
   The postponement also reflects oil executives' hopes that U.S.
policy toward Iran could change, making a pipeline through Iran
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies never say it publicly, but they are very much
hoping that if they wait long enough, they will be able to build
their pipeline through Iran, which is the route most of them
favor,'' a European ambassador said. ``So the decision that is
supposed to be coming soon may well be no decision at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence, visited Azerbaijan this week and said
that he fervently hopes for an improvement in Iranian-U.S.
relations that would make a pipeline there possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be the cheapest and the shortest route,'' Shelby
said in an interview. ``I'd like to see it happen. Lots of us in
Congress would like to see relations with Iran improve
tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope there will be a thaw, a real one. We'd go the first
mile and probably the last mile. But the other side has to meet us.
Iran has to show that it can be relied on as far as controlling
terrorism and other things that would help strengthen the family of
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the pipeline contest, which is being closely
followed in many capitals, could hinge in part on whether a second
oil consortium strikes it rich in a promising Caspian field called
Shah Deniz. The Shah Deniz consortium does not include any U.S.
companies, so it would be free to support a pipeline through Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Geological data suggest that Shah Deniz could be a very rich
field, but results of the first test drilling will not be known
until early next year. If they confirm high estimates, the pipeline
picture could change suddenly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We're not here to play politics; we're here to make money,''
said Mike Shearman, a British Petroleum executive who heads the
Shah Deniz consortium. ``We'd be foolish to rule out any option.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent visit to Istanbul, Turkey, President Clinton's
special envoy to the Caspian region, Richard Morningstar, urged the
companies to weigh their options ``in a broader political and
economic context'' and not to ignore ``political considerations and
political realities.''
</P>
<P>
   On his return to Washington, Morningstar acknowledged that it
was unlikely that the oil companies would decide to build a
pipeline to Turkey anytime soon. But he said any statement they
make about their intentions should include a ``concrete
commitment'' to build a line to Turkey at some point in the future
and a pledge to begin ``intense negotiations'' with Turkey over
ways to bring down the cost of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'll see a decision this year,'' said Brian
Chipman, an investment adviser based in Baku. ``There may be some
statements or even signatures, but nothing firm as far as
committing money. The companies want to put things off as long as
possible.''

`JAILS' HOLDS US CAPTIVE WITH HUMOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Be careful: You may become what you consume.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a single, simple message that can be distilled from
``Jails, Hospitals &AMP; Hip-Hop,'' Danny Hoch's scrappily intelligent,
pugnaciously funny new solo show, this may be it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the sexual braggadocio of rap, the mindless fashion
slavery of MTV and Tommy Hilfiger, or the Big Lie propaganda that
flows from Washington, Wall Street and Hollywood, Hoch strongly
advises us, his audience, to pay close attention to what we're
swallowing. After all, what we don't know can hurt us.
</P>
<P>
   Take Victor, a young, Puerto Rican shooting victim whose uncanny
mixture of street smarts and crippling naivete gives new meaning to
the phrase ``walking wounded.'' Flirting with a girl, Victor
confesses his dream is to fly a stealth bomber for Uncle Sam,
though his life thus far hardly conforms to anyone's patriotic
ideal of the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Or the upstate New York prison guard who's been sent to a female
counselor after roughing up an inmate. Like nearly all Hoch's
characters, the guard feels overpowered by vague forces beyond his
control. Between taunts, he quietly recalls picking apples on a
nearby orchard, years before the massive penitentiary was built.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of troubling confession _ compassion and humanity
jostling with subtle social commentary _ in which Hoch's writing
truly takes flight. At their best, his deftly rendered
characterizations, punctuated by Jo Bonney's direction and Stan
Pressner's lighting design, can whack you upside the head like a
hurled 40-ounce can of malt liquor.
</P>
<P>
   In the 90-minute show, which he also wrote, Hoch typecasts
himself as the perpetual outsider, a white homeboy who sees that
hip-hop isn't about style, but about the willingness to identify
with the underclass.
</P>
<P>
   His signature character is a white Montana teen and his black
rapper alter-ego, who imagines himself chatting with Jay Leno
between bouts of yelling with his mom through the bedroom door. The
belligerent poses Hoch strikes before an imaginary mirror suggest a
B-Boyz version of Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle in ``Taxi Driver'':
``You talkin' to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hoch prescribes winning through intimidation as an
antidote to the ghetto (either Brooklyn or Billings variety). His
toughest character ultimately may be the gentle, funny Gabriel, a
disabled, speech-impaired son of a crack-addicted mother, and a
die-hard Yankees fan to boot. Hmm, maybe there's something to be
said for patriotism after all.
</P>
<P>
   Working only with a grab bag of baseball caps and flannel
shirts, which he plucks off two metal filing cabinets, Hoch paws
his way through the contradictions of a city, and a time in
history. It's New York, city of 7 million voices, which Hoch seems
to have absorbed through his pores.

DIVERSIFIED PILLOWS FOR RESTING EASY IN STORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 15)  
(mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to hit home runs,'' said Benjamin Thorndike,
lead portfolio manager of the Scudder Pathway Series of funds. ``We
are trying to do well and sleep well at night.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a diversified money manager talking about an investment
style that has not always fared well in the era of double-digit
annual gains in the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stock market has rallied sharply recently, the
memory of the third-quarter selloff should make diversification
attractive to investors. In the 12 months through the end of the
third quarter, which marked the recent low point for the outlook
for the world economy, some diversified funds outperformed more
focused bets on the stocks in the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is simple. If your investments are spread around _ in
stocks, in bonds, in foreign stocks, in different kinds of bonds
and different kinds of stocks _ you have a good chance of getting a
cushioning rise in one area while another is plunging. In the third
quarter, for example, the return from government and corporate
bonds was 4 percent while the Dow, the S&AMP;P 500 and the Nasdaq index
fell 10 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Diversification is not the way to big stock returns because it
reduces risk in exchange for lower returns. But it is a way to
survive the volatile swings of the stock market, which have become
much more common over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should ``find the comfort zone'' between return and
risk, said Gary Brinson, chief executive of Brinson Partners, which
manages a diversified mutual fund. Diversification, he said, means
``the path of that return is much less bumpy.''
</P>
<P>
   For conservative investors, diversification is also a way to
take a dip into stocks. In fact, Scudder is focusing on 401(k)
investors who have kept too much of their retirement money in
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But deciding to be diversified is not enough. Investors must
decide how much risk to take on, which means looking closely at the
mix of investments in their fund or portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   One of the better-performing diversified funds is MFS Global
Total Return, which has returned 11.8 percent this year, through
October. It slipped 3 percent in the third quarter, faring better
than the top stock indexes. Over the last 12 months through
October, the return was 14.3 percent, while the Dow was up 15.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Brinson Global I fund has returned 4.2 percent for the year,
through October, with two-thirds of its money in bonds. The
balanced fund of the Scudder Pathway Series is up just 2.4 percent;
it had more invested in declining emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of the MFS fund is in stocks, and 40 percent in
bonds. The stocks are spread across sectors and many of them are
from abroad. But they all tend to be large-capitalization stocks of
high quality, said Frederick Simmons, the portfolio manager. The
bonds, both American and foreign, are all government issues.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said the fund's success this year was based on several
factors. The government bond holdings meant the fund was already
``there'' when investors fled to the haven of the bond market this
summer. The fund had a very small exposure to emerging markets,
although up to 10 percent of the fund had been invested in these
markets in the past. Simmons had sold most economically sensitive
stocks because he feared that economic growth was slowing. And, he
said, ``I stayed away from shark-infested waters.'' This meant
almost no technology stocks, except for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Among his major stock holdings are Philip Morris; Tyco
International, the maker of security systems; Pinault-Printemp, the
French department store operator, and British Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the good performance this year, Simmons said his fund
was for conservative investors, including himself. He has put a lot
of his own money into the fund.
</P>
<P>
   But the diversification it provides would also suit many other
investors because, although the returns are lower than focused bets
that work, they come with less risk. And that means it is, as
Thorndike said, easier to sleep at night.

   Negotiators in the talks at Buenos Aires, Argentina, on global
warming were locked in a last-minute struggle Friday night to
resolve key questions that seemed merely procedural _ but that in
reality went to the heart of the politically charged question of
how fast the world can and should move to deal with the prospect of
climatic change.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were the shape and pace of the work schedule for
putting flesh on the bones of the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement
reached a year ago in Japan under which industrialized countries
have committed themselves to make legally binding reductions in
emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon
dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream scientists say that if the emissions are not reduced,
the world's climate could be seriously disrupted in coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   As the Buenos Aires discussions opened on Nov. 2, virtually all
major figures in the talks said that the measure of their success
would be the successful adoption of a work schedule. But as the 12
days of negotiations approached their scheduled end of midnight
Friday, no accord had been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The work schedule is crucial because it will govern how soon
operating rules are established for the mechanisms of achieving
emissions reductions. Not until then, assuming the Kyoto Protocol
is ratified by the required countries including the United States,
can the protocol truly take effect.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, the conference chairwoman, Maria Julia Alsogary
of Argentina, circulated a draft proposal establishing a two-year
deadline for fashioning the operational rules.
</P>
<P>
   As midnight approached, there was cautious optimism. ``I think
it's likely we're going to reach closure, but the clock is
ticking,'' said Dirk Forrister, a member of the U.S. delegation. It
was clear, he said, that the deadline would be extended: ``We're
going to be going into the wee hours'' of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At Kyoto, the industrialized countries agreed to reduce their
emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which are
produced mainly by the burning of coal, oil, wood and natural gas,
by an average of about 5 percent below 1990 levels in the next 10
to 14 years. The United States' reduction would be 7 percent.
Developing countries so far have no specific targets, but are
required in general to control their emissions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two operational mechanisms established at Kyoto is
called emissions trading. It would allow a country or private
company to achieve its cuts partly by buying reductions from a
country or company that has reduced its emissions more than
required.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, say the method's proponents, this would bring about
faster reductions at lower cost. They say this has been proved by
an emissions trading system for reducing industrial sulfur dioxide
emissions in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The other arrangement, called the clean development mechanism,
is designed to enable rich countries to invest in
emissions-reduction projects in poor countries. One example is
high-efficiency power plants that emit less carbon. In this way, in
theory, the poor countries would reap both environmental and
economic benefits. The investor and the recipient would share
credit for the emissions reductions achieved.
</P>
<P>
   One sticking point in Buenos Aires involved which of the two
mechanisms should receive priority. Many developing countries,
seeing the prospect of reaping new investment in their economies,
wanted the rules and regulations for the clean development
mechanism to be worked out first, on an accelerated schedule, with
those for emissions trading completed later.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other rich countries feared that if the
clean development mechanism received first priority, developing
countries would then refuse to approve rules and regulations for
emissions trading. Developing countries have been suspicious of
emissions trading, fearing that it might be used by any given
industrialized country as an excuse for not reducing its own
emissions as much as it could or should.
</P>
<P>
   The United States therefore insisted that the two mechanisms
move toward operational status on parallel tracks.
</P>
<P>
   As the Buenos Aires session moved into its final hours, the
parallel-track idea appeared to be ascendant. Ms. Alsogaray's
proposal would require that ``substantial progress'' on rules for
the operational mechanisms be demonstrated a year from now, with a
firm decision in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Between the yearly benchmarks, according to a U.S. proposal,
more frequent high-level discussions would attempt to speed the
decisions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One particular obstacle in the way of eventually making
emissions trading a reality is an insistence by the European Union,
backed by some developing countries, that a limit be placed on the
amount of a country's emissions reduction target that could be
achieved through trading. The United States adamantly argues that
this would rob the arrangement of its cost-cutting value and allow
fewer reductions, worldwide, as well.

   SATURDAY'S KEY GAMES
</P>
<P>
   No. 8.......... Arkansas (8-0)
</P>
<P>
   No. 2.......... at Tennessee (8-0)
</P>
<P>
   They will probably meet again in the Southeastern Conference
title game, but Tennesseee can help its national-championship
aspirations here. Arkansas has a balance offense and can make the
big play. As coach Phillip Fulmer of Tennessee said, ``In a lot of
ways, it's like looking at ourselves in a mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 12 (tie)....Nebraska (8-2)
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 ..........at Kansas State (9-0)
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State has won 17 straight. It leads the nation in scoring
offense (52.4 points a game) and scoring defense (7.7), and its
defense may be good enough to contain Nebraska. But it hasn't
beaten the Cornhuskers in 29 years, and as coach Rick Neuheisel of
Colorado warned, ``I think Nebraska is still Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 9 ......... Wisconsin (9-0)
</P>
<P>
   No. 18 .........at Michigan (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin is 9-0 for the first time in 97 years, and if it wins
it will probably go to the Rose Bowl. The Badgers can run and stop
the run, but they have beaten only two teams with winning records.
Beware of Michigan's defense, which last week held Penn State to
200 yards and collected five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   No. 16 ........ Missouri (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 ......... at Texas A&AMP;M (9-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies lead the Big 12's southern division. They have not
given up a touchdown in 10 quarters, and cornerback Jason Webster
said, ``We know we have something special going.'' But beware:
quarterback Corby Jones of Missouri is healthy again and Randy
McCown of the Aggies is banged up and may not start.
</P>
<P>
   EAST
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech (7-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Syracuse (5-3)
</P>
<P>
   Tough game to figure. If Tech wins, it is headed for the Big
East title.
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 Notre Dame (7-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Navy (3-5)
</P>
<P>
   If the Irish beat Navy, Louisiana State and Southern California
in their last three games, they will probably get to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   No. 21 Miami (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Temple (2-7)
</P>
<P>
   Temple has upset Virginia Tech and Pitt, but Miami's offense
looks too explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern (2-8)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 25 Penn State (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   Penn State should show it is much better than it looked against
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia (5-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Rutgers (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia should win big, but Rutgers is on a
hard-to-believe roll.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane (8-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Army (2-6)
</P>
<P>
   Tulane gave Memphis 454 yards and three fourth-quarter
touchdowns and still won.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   at Penn (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   Penn (4-1) leads the Ivy League, and as coach Al Bagnoli said,
``Right now, life is good. We don't want to share this with
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeton (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   at Yale (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   Penn was able to run against Princeton, and Yale can run, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   at Columbia (3-5)
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's four-game losing streak is over, but its offense
still sputters.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   No. 17 Georgia (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Auburn (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   As good as Georgia is, its Southeastern Conference hopes are all
but dead.
</P>
<P>
   No. 22 Alabama (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Mississippi State (5-3)
</P>
<P>
   Alabama, which gave up 206 yards rushing last week to Kevin
Faulk of Louisiana State, faces another rough runner in James
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 24 Virginia (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's receivers have trouble getting open, but its runners
can run.
</P>
<P>
   MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 Ohio State (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Iowa (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Joe Germaine of Ohio State after the upset loss to
Michigan State: ``We can learn from this and go on or we can tuck
our tail.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 23 Purdue (6-4)
</P>
<P>
   at Michigan State (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State cannot afford a letdown against Drew Brees'
passing.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHWEST
</P>
<P>
   No. 14 Texas (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Texas Tech (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   With Ricky Williams' running and Major Applewhite's passing,
Texas is tough. So is Tech.
</P>
<P>
   FAR WEST
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 UCLA (8-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Washington (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Toledo on UCLA's narrow victory at Oregon State:
``It's hard on 18-, 19-, 20-year-old kids, and it's hard on a
52-year-old man.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 10 Arizona (9-1)
</P>
<P>
   at California (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has the Pacific 10's best defense and a dangerous runner
in Trung Canidate.
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 Air Force (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 12 (tie) Wyoming (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   If Air Force wins, and it is favored, it will tie Wyoming for
its division lead.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 19 Oregon (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is rolling up the yards on the passing of Akili Smith.
</P>
<P>
   MISMATCHES
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Florida State (9-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Wake Forest (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke is gone for the year with
a neck injury. Marcus Outzen, his sophomore replacement, will hold
the fort.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina (1-8)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 4 Florida (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   With Doug Johnson's passing, Florida (571 yards against
Vanderbilt) has become scary again.

ARCHITECTS TO COMPETE FOR A ROLE IN NYC PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This city has been chosen as the first site of a new
international competition to help cities develop innovative visions
in architecture and planning. Architects are to be invited to come
up with plans for pivotal sites in major cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called the International Foundation for the
Canadian Center for Architecture Prize Competition, offers a
$100,000 prize and will take place every three years in a different
city.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Lambert, the founding director of the Canadian Center
for Architecture in Montreal, said the architects selected in this
initial cycle of the competition will be asked to focus on a
12-block area on the west side of midtown Manhattan between 30th
and 34th Streets. The architects will be free to imagine how the
site should be used, but the goal is to generate new urban concepts
that look toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The prize comes at a time of lively public debate over recent
proposals for major civic projects in New York, like Yankee
Stadium, Governors Island, Columbus Circle and the expansion of
Pennsylvania Station into the old post office building. For the
most part, discussion of these projects has focused on issues of
economic development, or in the case of Penn Station, historic
preservation. The prize competition provides an opportunity to lift
public discussion of civic architecture in New York into the realm
of architectural excellence or cultural significance.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals will center on the area bounded by the Hudson
River and Eighth Avenue, between 30th and 34th Streets, a district
now dominated by a tangle of roadways, rail lines, tunnels, ramps
and other pieces of transportation infrastructure. The site is
owned by a myriad of private interests as well as by public
entities.
</P>
<P>
   The district includes a Metropolitan Transportation Authority
rail yard at 33rd Street and 11th Avenue, which has been mentioned
as a possible site for a new Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lambert said the architects would be challenged to propose
innovative solutions for linking large-scale infrastructure with
smaller urban spaces, not for vast swaths of urban renewal. She
imagined something far more lively than a purely residential zone
or a district of new office towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many developers are horrified by this site, because of all the
roadways and tunnels,'' she said, ``but they're what's so good
about it. Because of the existing infrastructure, and the riverside
location, the site is connected to the rest the city and beyond. We
want to see how architects might turn it into a place for people.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is no assurance that the winning design will be
realized, the inclusion in the competition jury of Charles Gargano,
chairman of the Empire State Development Corp., and Joseph Rose,
chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, increases the
likelihood that the competition will be more than an academic
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Five architects, to be chosen by a distinguished international
jury, will be invited to compete. They are to be be chosen in
February from a list of nominations submitted by major
architectural institutions in the United States and abroad. To
qualify for consideration, nominees must have achieved a
significant and original body of work in architecture or urban
design.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Lambert, the jurors are Frank Gehry,
architect of the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, and the Walt Disney
Concert Hall in Los Angeles; Arata Isozaki, architect of the Sant
Jordi Palace Gymnasium for the Olympic Games, Barcelona, Team
Disney Headquarters in Buena Vista, Fla. and the master plan for
the Brooklyn Museum of Art; Rafael Moneo, architect of the Atocha
Railway Station, Madrid, the Museums of Art and Architecture,
Stockholm, and the Potsdammer Platz Hotel and Office Building,
Berlin; Elizabeth Diller, associate professor of architecture,
Princeton University, and co-founder of Diller &AMP; Scofidio, an
interdisciplinary studio in architecture, print and performance;
Gargano; Rose, and Gary Hack, a city planner and dean of the
Graduate School of Fine Arts at the University of Pennsylvania.
Ralph Lerner, dean of the School of Architecture at Princeton
University, is director of the competition, which is intended to
support the Canadian center's mission of making architecture a
public concern.
</P>
<P>
   (The Pritzker Prize, established 20 years ago and widely
regarded as the highest honor in the field, also carries a $100,000
grant.)
</P>
<P>
   The center, a major study facility, library and museum, will
publish all the projects and will mount an exhibition in New York
City in autumn 1999. A winner is to be announced early in 2000.

 &HT;    REP. PAUL SAYS HOUSE GRIDLOCK NOT BAD IDEA
 &HT;    For release Monday, Nov. 16
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A would-be House leader called Rep. Ron Paul,
R-Surfside, last week and asked for Paul's vote, promising that he
would ``make the trains run on time'' if elected this week.
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Wrong number.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress-speak, ``making the trains run on time'' means
moving legislation, particularly the federal spending bills, to the
House floor and passage as smoothly as possible. The chugging of
those trains is not necessarily a pleasant sound to Paul, a former
Libertarian presidential candidate who believes the Constitution
places strict limits on what Congress can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are `on-time trains' such a good thing if they carry off more
of our money and freedoms while delivering more regulations?'' Paul
asked in his weekly column. ``It may be that our leaders should
demand that we stop the trains entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul may get his wish next year: with Republicans holding 223
seats and Democrats 211, a mere six votes will decide whether the
House passes legislation or grinds to a halt.

   ``The frustration and gridlock may not be all that bad for those
of us who want to slow the growth of the federal government,'' said
Paul, who was re-elected Nov. 3 to represent parts of Travis,
Williamson and Hays counties in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Paul's column didn't mention any leadership candidates by name,
but House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, who campaigned for
Paul last summer, is fighting to keep his job and has mentioned his
expertise with legislative trains. As of Friday, seven Texans were
among the 37 Republicans who had publicly endorsed Armey's
re-election. Paul wasn't on the list.

COMMENTARY: NATURAL BORN SHILLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the national orgy of infotainment known as All Monica
is nearing its end, one network was at last willing to come forward
and say it has standards and will sin no more. Or so it seemed, for
one brief but shining moment last week.
</P>
<P>
   That moment came when ABC released a strong statement expressing
how ``increasingly uncomfortable'' it has become ``with the
confusion (that) could exist between fact-based entertainment and
hard news.'' The statement continued: ``We came to believe that
television viewers could find it difficult to distinguish between
the two forms,'' and that ``fact-based entertainment'' might ``not
be appropriate for a television network with a strong news record
and identity.''
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who thought ABC News was once tops in the game,
this was a welcome mea culpa and return to sanity. Surely the
statement meant that ABC would no longer have its supposedly
objective Monday-through-Friday Washington reporters Sam Donaldson
and Cokie Roberts confusingly double as highly biased pundits on
Sunday, peddling incorrect predictions about President Clinton's
fate and moralistic homilies about his conduct as fact-based
entertainment (hilarious though much of it has been).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the statement meant, too, that ABC News shows would no
longer sport tie-ins to other Disney products, from ``Ellen'' to
Animal Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Through some bizarre slip-up, the ABC statement turns
out not to apply to ABC News at all but only to filmmaker Oliver
Stone, whom the network had commissioned on a free-lance basis to
produce what he calls a ``new-style'' news magazine. The network's
long-overdue, principled stand was aimed at a single segment in
that show about the TWA Flight 800 crash _ a segment that had not
even been filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Some news accounts implied that ABC was concerned that Stone
might want to spread an irresponsible theory about the crash, but
my conversations with Stone and one of the former longtime NBC News
producers he hired to do the piece suggest otherwise. Stone's aim
was to ``investigate the investigation'' of the accident and raise
unanswered questions, rather than posit any conclusions, much in
the skeptical manner of the essay by Elaine Scarry, a professor at
Harvard, in The New York Review of Books over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   I have my own no doubt half-baked conspiracy theory _ not about
TWA 800 but about why ABC stood up loudly against a 12-minute story
that hadn't even been produced yet. By taking the high road against
Stone, an easy target and not an ABC employee, perhaps the network
could deflect attention from the dirty laundry in its actual news
division, some more of which is about to be aired in public. The
new issue of Brill's Content has put Mickey Mouse on its cover for
a story about ABC's decision to kill another news magazine story
last month _ this one for ``20/20,'' by Brian Ross, the network's
top investigative reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' story was about alleged pedophilia at theme parks. The
Brill's Content story depicts a network at which various executives
each have different and conflicting policies about how independent
the news division can be when covering unflattering stories about
Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole mess validates the viewing public's worst fears
about conglomerate ownership of major news outlets,'' the story
concludes. Brill's Content was unable to find a single senior
journalist at ABC News ``willing to say, even not for attribution,
that he or she concurred with the editorial judgment'' that led to
the killing of Ross' theme-park investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Like many media critics, Oliver Stone believes that ``to link
the news to profit is a historical disaster,'' and he dates the
phenomenon back to Laurence Tisch's short-lived, news-downsizing
ownership of CBS. That link explains not only why ABC promotes
Disney products or sometimes hides Disney embarrassments; it
explains the entire culture, hardly limited to ABC or CBS, that
gave us ratings-driven All Monica and All Diana and All O.J., and
that turns once reputable TV journalists into performing seals.
</P>
<P>
   It says much about how steep the slide in news has been that
Stone now has every right to seize the moral high ground: while he,
too, has provided feverish, speculative entertainment about an
American president or two, he has never pretended to be a
journalist while doing so.

BRITISH TABLOID ALTERS POLICY ON NAMING GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Times certainly are changing when Britain's largest,
most sensational tabloid is considered more enlightened on the
subject of homosexuality than the country's biggest-circulation
broadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun, the racy tabloid that uses short words and long
looks at naked women to sell some 4 million copies a day, announced
on Thursday that it would no longer publicly name homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Daily Telegraph, whose 1 million copies are
read each day by Britain's conservative elite, continues to print
homophobic columns and letters to the editor. Friday, one of its
columnists, Tom Utley, proudly noted that only six of more than 500
letters he received in response to his column last week that
described homosexuals as immoral were critical.
</P>
<P>
   All of this occurs as Britain undergoes a major review of its
attitudes about homosexuals, prompted by a series of outings, or
exposure as homosexuals, of three men in Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   It began two weeks ago when Ron Davies, the Welsh secretary,
resigned after he was robbed in a park where gay men meet to
arrange sex. A few days later, Trade and Industry Secretary Peter
Mandelson was named as gay by a former member of Parliament,
Matthew Parris, who is also gay, on the BBC's ``Newsnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson has not commented on the claims that he is gay, but
the controversy grew when the BBC ordered its journalists not to
make references to his sexuality, prompting howls of censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the debate raged about politicians' privacy, a third
Cabinet minister, Agriculture Secretary Nick Brown, acknowledged
his homosexuality last Saturday after a former lover tried to sell
his story to the News of the World, a Sunday tabloid owned, like
the Sun, by press baron Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Sun, which a few days earlier had impressed some
gay rights activists by opining in an editorial that Mandelson was
a talented politician whose sexuality was irrelevant to his job
performance, asked on its front page, ``Are we being run by a gay
Mafia?''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, the Sun seemed to have answered its own question
when it said, ``Our readers are tolerant of private behavior and
find unwarranted intrusion offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun editor David Yelland fired Parris, who among other things
wrote a column for the tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to be controversial and brilliantly
innovative,'' said Yelland, who in the tradition of Murdoch tabloid
editors is not altogether humble. ``But the Sun is no longer in the
business of destroying closet gays' lives by exposing them as
homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, before anyone pronounces a profound cultural change in
Britain, some longtime media watchers warned that the Sun is
notoriously opportunistic and its editorial policy more expedient
than principled.
</P>
<P>
   Some find it no coincidence that the Murdoch tabloid went out of
its way to praise Mandelson. Murdoch, after all, needs Mandelson's
approval to buy the Manchester United soccer team, which is crucial
to Murdoch's new digital TV network.
</P>
<P>
   Also, critics pointed out, the Sun left itself a loophole by
saying it would name homosexuals in cases of ``overwhelming public
interest,'' and the Sun would be the sole arbiter of what
constitutes such public interest. Also, while Parris was fired from
the Sun, he still writes for The Times, which Murdoch also owns.
</P>
<P>
   The Telegraph, owned by Murdoch rival Conrad Black, suggested
Murdoch was simply trying to curry favor with the government in
general and Mandelson in particular. A spokesman for Mandelson, who
is a close friend of Murdoch's daughter, Elizabeth, said he had no
contact with the Sun about its editorial policy or the firing of
Parris.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun's change of heart on homosexuals came a day after The
Guardian, one of Britain's two liberal broadsheets, published a
poll that showed a majority of Britons are tolerant of homosexuals.
Some 52 percent of those surveyed said being gay should not
preclude someone from holding a Cabinet post, while 33 percent said
gays should not be in the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Davies' problems forced Blair to postpone plans to unveil his
``family policy'' to encourage marriage and stable families aimed
at ``middle England,'' Britain's middle class. Those plans were
unveiled last week to underwhelming reaction, while homophobic
letters and columns filled the right-wing papers, leaving some to
suggest that a good chunk of Blair's much hyped Cool Britannia
remains puritanically Victorian.

CRABTREE TURNS TO THE KITCHEN FOR NEW SCENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A potpourri pioneer, Crabtree &AMP; Evelyn Ltd., has high hopes
for some new scents.
</P>
<P>
   Most store-bought fragrances are designed to make the indoors
smell like the outdoors. Light a scented candle near a cat's litter
box, and a blindfolded sniffer is supposed to think of English
gardens or a Victorian grandmother's lavender sachet.
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to expand beyond scents, soaps, and pump
lotions _ and to try to stay ahead of a host of lower-priced
copycat rivals _ Crabtree's new ownership is bottling a different
kind of olefactory experience.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of evoking pine forests, $5 aerosol sprays waft the
aromas of a Julia Child-like kitchen. One spray smells like ginger
snaps, another like fresh bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make your house smell like you've spent the whole day
cooking even when you haven't been,'' says Elliot Lasky, the
marketing chief of a retail chain with 170 US stores.
</P>
<P>
   Such innovative fragrances may have practical applications as
well, especially for folks trying to sell their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real estate agents always say, `Bake bread,''' says Crabtree
board member Diane Hessan, noting a theory that bread smells may
help convince prospective buyers that the house they're sizing up
is indeed a warm and cozy comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   With a Crabtree aerosol, a woman selling her house can simply
say: ``Hey, the hell with baking bread. I'll just do a couple of
sprays with this cooking fragrance,'' Hessan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a sleeper product,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree could use a sleeper product. A &UR;  &LR;  company that traces
its roots to a small Cambridge, Mass. shop once loomed large in the
business of nice smells, but competition has gotten fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Under Anglophile founder Cyrus Harvey, the idea in 1970 was to
offer garden-scented bath products to sophisticated women.
</P>
<P>
   Hosting a high tea? No problem. Almost from the start, Crabtree
stocked oolong and pekoe and biscuits and marmalades.
</P>
<P>
   As a shop grew into a chain, Harvey named his company after two
17th-century Englishmen he greatly admired. According to company
lore, John Evelyn was a gardening gourmet who invented salad
dressing. George Crabtree was a kindred spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 1970s were palmy days for Crabtree &AMP; Evelyn. But it
soon became clear that the demand for bath oils and body washes was
nearly insatiable.
</P>
<P>
   As interest grew in aromatherapy and the wellness movement,
rival retailers began crowding the field, pricing their fare above
drugstore toiletries but below Crabtree's premium lines.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1979, the British-based Body Shop invaded the US market,
promoting sales with a save-the-world marketing message.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bath &AMP; Body Works came on the scene in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bath &AMP; Body Works is a creation of Intimate Brands Inc., the
Ohio company that owns Victoria's Secret. As PaineWebber analyst
Richard E. Jaffe sees it, Intimate Brands simply took its
Victoria's Secret formula and applied it to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken a commodity _ soap _ and made it fashionable and
trendy,'' Jaffe says. ``It's the same thing they did with
underwear. Instead of Ivory or Safeguard, they've gotten women to
pay a little more for papaya soap and pina colada shampoo.''
</P>
<P>
   The underwear formula seems to be working. Bath &AMP; Body Works
sales have gone from $100 million in 1993 to $1.2 billion today, he
says. (Crabtree does not disclose sales.)
</P>
<P>
   Now a chain of 1,000 stores, Bath &AMP; Body Works has thrived, in
part, by developing a flavor-of-the-month approach that has been a
hit with young women and teen-age girls, Jaffe says.
</P>
<P>
   One day ``pink bubblegum'' may be the body mist du jour; a month
later, it'll be something else, he says, adding: ``They're a
fashion company. They're about novelty and newness.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just mall stores selling scrubs and soaks. Go into some
supermarkets and bath oils and tony moisturizers are widely
available. The trend has even hit discount chains, with stores such
as Bradlees and Kmart carrying lower-priced product lines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, with rivals multiplying and founder Harvey nearing
retirement, Crabtree was sold to Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd. The
Malaysian company owns plantations that grow palm oil and cocoa,
two ingredients often used in the making of spa-like toiletries
that Crabtree specializes in.
</P>
<P>
   Under KLK, Crabtree's goal is to develop new products _ products
not just for the bathroom, but also for the kitchen, the garden,
and the rest of the house.
</P>
<P>
   As Crabtree seeks to evolve into a wellness and lifestyle brand,
some of the 20 new stores it plans to open over the next year may
also include tea bars.
</P>
<P>
   With its new products, Crabtree wants ``to help the customer be
able to create an environment she feels comfortable in,'' Lasky
says. ``The tea bar helps create that sense of calm.''
</P>
<P>
   To attract new talent, KLK just moved Crabtree headquarters from
Woodstock, Conn., to Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In looking to grow its niche, Crabtree thinks it enjoys several
advantages. For one thing, 80 percent of its products are made by
its own factories, allowing for superior quality.
</P>
<P>
   And Crabtree may be more appealing to older, more affluent women
who want something more sophisticated than bubblegum soap.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree is about ``taking care of yourself,'' Hessan says; it's
about women who want the best when they buy gifts and women who are
not afraid to buy gifts for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who'll pay $4 for a bar of soap?'' Hessan says. ``It's the
same woman who'll pay $3 for a Starbucks coffee drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jaffe thinks that may not be a very large group.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to rivals, he says: ``Crabtree provides a much more
luxurious experience _ and they charge for it. Bath &AMP; Body Works is
moderately priced so customers can use the products every day.
Crabtree &AMP; Evelyn soaps end up in the guest bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hessan, young women shopping at Bath &AMP; Body Works
today may some day graduate to Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point in her life, a woman decides she no longer wants
to smell like a strawberry,'' she says.

BOY COULD HAVE HAD SEX WITH GIRL, 9, DOCTOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A medical authority confirms it is physically possible
for a boy as young as 9 to commit rape, the way prosecutors this
week said a 9-year-old Boston boy did in a case dating back to last
summer in which the alleged victim was a 9-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   But it's almost impossible for the boy to have produced viable
sperm or, in the unlikely event he did, for a girl that young to
become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's attorney, Chester Darling, maintains the complaint is
unfounded. Darling said Friday he is ``confident'' the charge will
be dismissed before a pretrial hearing set for next week. ``We're
seeking to have a meeting with the DA's office and hopefully we'll
have that soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Borghesani, a spokesman for Suffolk County District
Attorney Ralph Martin, said the case ``still is in the process of
being investigated and at this point there's been no decision made
not to proceed. Nothing has changed from a few days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The rape is alleged to have happened last June. The girl
reported it to a third person, who informed the girl's mother in
late July, Boston Police say. The mother reportedly phoned police
that same day, and they interviewed the girl then, and again in
August. Martin's Child Abuse Unit asked police to obtain criminal
complaints in Boston Juvenile Court, police say, and a charge of
rape against the boy was issued following a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The case has generated horror and dismay, but it has also raised
scientific questions about what a boy that young is physically
capable of.
</P>
<P>
   Even infants get erections, but they are involuntary, explained
Dr. Paul Church, a urologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center. For a child to have a ``sexual erection,'' he added, ``that
could occur as soon as there's the development of those thought
patterns. Children certainly from the age of 5 or 6 could have
sexual thoughts, sexual fantasies that would translate into an
erection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect this kind of case means the child had received some
pornographic information or whatever that allowed him to know what
to do with those urges . . . I don't think it's the kind of thing a
9-year-old would intuitively know what to do, but with all the
pornography on the Internet and everywhere else, it's not much of a
stretch of the imagination to think a 9-year-old could get access
to that and try to mimic it.''
</P>
<P>
   Male puberty, however, doesn't kick in generally until 12 or 14,
Church added, ``and unless this is an exception the boy would not
be expected to ejaculate or have sperm at age 9 . . . It's not
likely he could produce mature sperm in any substantial
quantities.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the 9-year-old girl who allegedly was raped?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible for the girl involved to become
pregnant,'' Church said. ``Girls go through puberty earlier than
boys but that's still awfully early.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time this fall that the sexual capabilities
of young children have arisen surrounding a gruesome crime, or
alleged crime.
</P>
<P>
   In September, authorities in Chicago dropped murder charges they
had brought against two boys aged 7 and 8. Cook County State's
Attorney Richard Devine said he made that decision after a state
crime laboratory discovered semen on the underwear of Ryan Harris,
the 11-year-old girl whose body was found in a gritty South Side
neighborhood in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we received the report from the state crime lab,''
Devine said back then. ``It showed semen on the panties of the
victim. Medical experts who we consulted confirm that the
possibility of semen coming from boys this age is at best remote.''

 &HT;    Theglobe.com benefits from hottest trends on Web
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Theglobe.com (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .theglobe.com) isn't much to look at, but the combination of
community areas, chat, search, news, gaming and shopping
capitalizes on two of the Web's hottest trends: portals and
homegrown content. In the post-Wired world of the Web, this is as
trendy as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   The site was launched in 1995 by college grads Stephan Paternot
and Todd Krizelman, who are the classic ``two kids in a garage''
entrepreneurs. They had big ideas and a small bankroll.
</P>
<P>
   Theglobe.com, is a member-based, community-oriented site. Its
1.7 million members can join for free or pay up to $9.95 per month
for membership that includes extra storage space and shopping
discounts. Globe members can build homepages and chat in related
community areas, called cities. Members can shop at the Globe
marketplace, essentially a list of links to shopping sites.
Theglobe.com also has partnerships with Reuters, Thompson Financial
Network and entertainment site EOnline, and search engine GoTo.com.
</P>
<P>
   Theglobe.com is similar to GeoCities (http://www
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    HBO in eye of storm: top executive resigns
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The sudden storm surrounding HBO &AMP; Co. intensified
Friday after the company announced a top executive was resigning.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co., the nation's leading health-care software company,
said Jay Gilbertson, co-president, co-chief operating officer and
chief financial officer, will be leaving ''to pursue other
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of HBO &AMP; Co. dropped 9 percent to close at $22.87 1/2,
down $2.31 1/4 in Nasdaq trading of more than 27 million shares.
Average daily trading volume for the company is 6 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The stock decline mirrors a similar drop last month, when HBO &AMP;
Co. announced it would be acquired by San Francisco-based McKesson
Corp., the leading U.S. pharmaceuticals distributor.
</P>
<P>
   The $11 billion deal prompted analysts to question the strategic
fit between the two companies. HBO &AMP; Co. and McKesson said the
merged company, called McKesson HBOC, would realize a gain of $75
million in the first year from a combination of cost savings and
the cross-selling of each other's products to hospitals and other
health-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, though, said Gilbertson's departure casts new doubts
about the acquisition. He's leaving well before the anticipated
close of the deal in first quarter 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises another red flag,'' said analyst Steven Halper of
Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette. ``When you go through a
transaction, the management team usually sticks together until the
transaction is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear when Gilbertson would leave HBO &AMP; Co. He was not
available for comment. HBO &AMP; Co. also didn't return calls for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The company, with headquarters on Perimeter Center North, also
recently said it has laid off ''fewer than 50'' employees as a
result of closing its acquisition of Alpharetta-based Imnet
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Halper, who recently downgraded HBO &AMP; Co. to ''market
perform,'' said the company has acknowledged the layoffs were
higher than that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Al Bergonzi, also co-president, will assume Gilbertson's duties
and become chief operating officer, HBO &AMP; Co. said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the McKesson agreement, Bergonzi and Gilbertson were
contenders to succeed HBO &AMP; Co. Chairman and CEO Charles McCall.
But the McKesson deal squashed that speculation.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co.'s acquisition talks with McKesson stalled earlier this
year, partly over employment contracts for Bergonzi and Gilbertson.
</P>
<P>
   The two were expected to run the new company's health care
information subsidiary, which eventually would be based in
Alpharetta's Windward area. The combined company would be based in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pulido, chairman and chief executive of McKesson, would
hold the same job in the unified company.
</P>
<P>
   While Gilbertson may have been viewed as a top contender to
replace McCall at HBO &AMP; Co., he would be behind several others to
succeed Pulido.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Gilbertson) will be a CEO for another company, and
that opportunity wasn't going to be there for him'' at the merged
company, Halper said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson's departure will have an impact on the financial
convergence of the two companies, said analyst David Francis of
Volpe Brown Whelan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay was the key guy in doing the due diligence on transactions
they had done, and making the numbers work,'' said Francis, who
recently downgraded HBO &AMP; Co. to a ''neutral'' rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an even murkier situation now,'' Francis said. ``You have
even more questions about the senior management team of this new
organization, and about the (projected) synergies.''
</P>
<P>
   Under McCall's leadership, HBO &AMP; Co., built largely on
acquisitions, had soared past competitors in revenues and net
income. For the past two years, it has led all other Georgia public
companies in performance as measured by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitu-
</P>
<P>
   tion.
</P>
<P>
   But HBO &AMP; Co. may have felt a need to strike the McKesson deal
because it likely would struggle to maintain its current earnings
pace, Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're a victim of their own success,'' he said.
``They grew themselves into a box. There were no more good
acquisition targets.''

 &HT;    SunTrust restates earnings, settling loan loss issue with SEC
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ SunTrust Banks has resolved a disagreement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, paving the way to complete its
planned purchase of Richmond, Va.-based Crestar Financial by
year-end.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta banking company agreed to reduce its reserves for
loan losses in 1994, 1995 and 1996 by a total of $100 million, an
accounting adjustment that will add a total of $61 million to
earnings during those three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little surprised by the magnitude of the restatement. We
always knew SunTrust was conservative and had good credit quality,
and now the SEC has proven it without a doubt,'' said Coffey.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the crux of the SEC's problem with SunTrust _
that the regulators felt the Atlanta company was being
unrealistically conservative in building up high loss reserves
against a high quality portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust announced Oct. 23 that a ``dialogue'' with the SEC was
delaying the closing of the Crestar Financial deal which was
announced July 20 at a price of $9.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not singling out banks, nor do we feel (reserve levels)
are a prevalent problem among banks. We have two overriding
considerations : That companies present an accurate financial
picture to their investors and that investors are protected,'' said
SEC spokesman Christopher W. Ullman in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, loan loss reserves should be commensurate with the
level of risk that a bank has assumed, and it's a case-by-case
situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fully cognizant of the need for having loan loss
reserves, but the need is to strike a balance between adequate
exposure (of information) to investors and adherence to accounting
rules,'' Ullman said. ``The key is balance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just flabbergasted that the SEC can mandate that a
federally insured bank has loan loss reserves that are too high _
after everything we've been through in the last 3 months in the
global economy,'' said Coffey.
</P>
<P>
   Reserves for bad loans create a safety net for rough times, but
the SEC in public statements has said these reserves can be used to
present an inaccurate picture of a company's condition or employed
to manage earnings by adding high amounts to reserves in good
years, low amounts in bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no way were there statements or innuendoes (by the SEC)
that (SunTrust Banks) was managing or manipulating earnings,'' said
John W. Spiegel, chief financial officer of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey said the accounting restatements ``will have neglible
impact on the company going forward. It's simply a transfer of the
reserves from the current balance sheet to the past income
statements.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to striking an agreement with the SEC, Spiegel
said, was to delay the Crestar Financial merger, which is expected
to close Dec. 31. Shareholders of the two companies will vote on
the deal Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ``this (accounting adjustment) is not material, ``
Spiegel said. ``It represents only 13 percent of reserves.'' And
the SEC had no bones to pick with the bank about 1997 and 1998
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a conservative bank before, and it's still
consevative bank.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting adjustments reduces loss reserves by $25 million
in 1994, $35 million in 1995, and $40 million in 1996. Restated net
income and income per share are $538 million and $2.32 in 1994;
$586.8 million million and $2.56 in 1995; and $641 million and
$2.87 in 1995.

 &HT;    Quest offers comforts of home
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It can be difficult to figure just where Nissan's
all-new Quest minivan is coming from _ design credits include
``design context lab'' studies of owners interacting with vehicles
_ but it's easy to see where it's going: toward all the comforts of
home with a carlike ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Quest, available in three trim levels with prices starting
at $22,159 and topping out at $26,299, even gets a chromed grille
reminiscent of Nissan's upscale Infiniti cars to help distance it
from the trucklike characteristics of vans of old. The test Quest
SE, base-priced at $23,899 and with a final cost of $25,218,
clearly reflected the effort applied to its design, a major
reworking six years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   With a maximum capacity of seven persons, the Quest boasts
captain's chairs comfortable enough to have come from a living
room. Storage spaces include a slide-and-lock underseat tray, a
handy net between the front seats and an optional rear storage unit
that adapts to a variety of cargo. Drink holders abound.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's view, according to design exec Jerry Hirshberg, is that
of ``the interior of a minivan as a forum for social interaction
... where you meet as a family, where you eat meals and vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of a moving vehicle as a social scene may be alarming
to drivers obsessed with concentrating on the road and safety, but
the reality is that the family that rides together has little
choice but to communicate. If not, there's always the 130-watt,
seven speaker stereo with a front-mounted CD changer for amusement.
</P>
<P>
   Even better for buyers who wait until early next year, there
will be more entertainment in the Quest. Nissan plans to offer a
TV/VCR package that will mount between the front seats, a feature
now found primarily on limousines and in long-haul trucks with
sleepers and other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers, however, will find the Quest, which has a 112.2-inch
wheelbase and an overall length of more than 16 feet, very
driveable with good visibility. Its 170-horsepower V-6 engine will
move it smartly even when loaded. The steering is tight enough to
prevent wandering _ turbulence from other vehicles is noticeable,
though _ and anti-lock brakes keep the Quest in line when stopping.
(Traction control, which isn't offered, would be an additional
plus).
</P>
<P>
   The plethora of standard features and options available
contributes to a busy dash loaded with instrumentation, controls
and vents. But few buyers are likely to complain about a base
minivan that comes with air conditioning, two sliding side doors,
power windows and locks, power heated mirrors, cruise control and a
keyless entry system. Not all options are available on the $22,159
GXE version, but the $23,899 SE and the $26,299 GLE can be
seriously loaded. Leather costs $1,499 for the SE, which has a
sport-tuned suspension with larger tires and easier-to-read
white-faced gauges as standard features.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Quest, along with other minivans and particularly its
Nissan/Ford-built near twin, the Mercury Villager, continues an
evolution. It's one that any day now may totally erase any
lingering fear of having to accept trucklike characteristics in
order to get the convenience and space of a van.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Quest isn't quite there, but credit Nissan with
seriously making that the target.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Nissan Quest SE front-drive, four-door
minivan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $25,218 (base price: $23,899)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, power anti-lock brakes with
front discs and rear drums, pipe-style steel side-impact beams
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 3.3-liter V-6 engine (170 horsepower), four-speed
automatic overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: package with automatic headlamps,
six-way power adjustable driver's seat, power flip-out rear quarter
windows, flip-up glass rear hatch, rear storage shelf with net,
garage door opener, $799
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 17 mpg regular unleaded city, 24 mpg highway

NATIONS SEEK PLAN TO DEFUSE US-IRAQ SITUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In a last-ditch diplomatic effort to prevent US
strikes against Iraq, China, France and Russia began cobbling
together a face-saving package Friday that would allow Baghdad to
step back from its latest confrontation with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The move came as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein offered to
resume cooperation with UN inspectors in exchange for a firm
commitment from the council to lift economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The three countries are seeking to persuade United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan to send a letter to the Iraqi leader
pledging to begin lifting sanctions on Baghdad if it meets its
obligations to destroy its chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons. The proposal -- which has the backing neither of the US
nor Iraq -- is currently being considered by the UN chief.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council debated the proposal, and the possibility
of a trip by Annan, Friday afternoon and into the evening. A senior
UN source said that Annan would only endorse the deal if he has the
support of the Clinton Administration and an ``airtight'' assurance
from the Iraqi government that it will grant unfettered access to
UN weapons inspectors in his country. A second senior UN source
would not rule out a trip to the region by Annan in the event that
a deal is struck. But US officials have made it clear that they
oppose a diplomatic mission by Annan to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration has continually insisted that Iraq
must meet a number of conditions -- including disarmament,
compensation for the damage of Kuwaiti property, and the return of
Kuwaiti prisoners of war -- before it will agree to lift sanctions
on Baghdad. And there is no indication in any quarter that the US
is willing to soften its position.
</P>
<P>
   The White House quickly dismissed the Iraqi leader's appeal as
an old gift in new wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein has it within his hands to end this crisis now
by resuming full cooperation with UNSCOM (the UN Special Commission
charged of eliminating Iraq weapons of mass destruction),'' Clinton
said Friday in Washington. ``The Security Council and the world
have made it crystal clear now that this is unacceptable and that
none of us can tolerate an Iraq free to develop weapons of mass
destruction with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His own neighbors in the Arab world made it clear that this
choice is his alone and the consequences, if he fails to comply,
his alone, in terms of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright also warned Saddam to
``reverse course or face the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want a peaceful outcome,'' she said. But ``one by one,
the diplomatic options have been rebuffed.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first public statement since the crisis began, Hussein
explained Friday that his country's decision to block the UN
inspectors was designed to provoke a response to what he described
as ``Iraq's legal demands'' -- a reference to easing economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq will accept positively any initiative that meets these
just and balanced demands,'' he said in a statement published by
the Iraqi News Agency. The UN and US, he added, would have to
``commit themselves to the letter and spirit of the resolutions as
Iraq has done over the past eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   UN diplomats suggested that there is a link between Hussein's
statement and the latest diplomatic initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The council debate came at a time when Hussein is as isolated
from the world community as he has been since the Gulf War. Despite
the latest diplomatic initiative by France, China and Russia,
diplomats from those countries have privately expressed
exasperation with Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   None of the trio has opposed US action as forcefully as all
three did last February, when Hussein last brought to world to the
brink of armed conflict. And eight arab countries authored a
statement Thursday distancing themselves from the consequences of
continued Iraqi intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   According to a French diplomat, Iraq had recently been offered
its best chance to have economic sanctions against it eased when
the Security Council pledged on October 30 to conduct a
comprehensive review of its relationship with the UN. But Baghdad
immediately turned down the offer and decided to bar UN arms
experts from probing Iraq's suspected weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the diplomatic activity in New York, the US military
buildup in the Gulf continued unabated Friday. And the US State
Department issued a worldwide alert warning US travelers to take
special precautions when opening `` unfamiliar'' mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi leader agreed, under the terms of the 1991 cease fire
agreement ending the Gulf War, to rid his country of all long-range
weapons and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. But he has
repeatedly blocked UN arms experts from investigating if he has
lived up to its commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The chief UN weapons inspector, Richard Butler, withdrew all UN
inspectors from Baghdad on Monday following a warning from the US
that it is no longer safe for them to remain in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining UN relief workers and diplomats in Baghdad Friday
moved from their hotels to the UN headquarters. Lloyds Register, a
British company that approves the sale of food and medicine
entering Iraq under the oil-for food program, withdrew 54 employees
from the country, severely hampering the operation. The top UN
humanitarian coordinator -- Benon Sevan -- said he would try to
restore the operation.

MIXED FINISH REFLECTS ANTICIPATION OF FED MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market finished mixed Friday as investors
awaited the meeting of the Federal Reserve policy-makers Tuesday to
see whether the central bank would cut its target for short-term
interest rates for the third time since September.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts still expect a cut but the subsiding of the
financial crisis since the last reduction in October, the continued
buoyancy of the U.S. economy and the deal reached Thursday for
international assistance for Brazil may make Fed officials decide
to wait until their next meeting in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the stock market has priced in a Fed rate cut,'' said
Christine Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse
First Boston. ``If it cuts, then the market might bounce up for a
few days. But if it doesn't, we think the market will have an
erratic consolidation'' that will see it trend lower.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, technology and smaller-company stocks faltered while
the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of
500 stocks moved higher.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the rallies, the major indexes finished the week lower
after a four-week surge in which they all jumped 13 percent or
more.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 89.85 points, to 8,919.59, while the SP climbed
8.03 points, to 1,125.72. But the technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 3.07
points, to 1,847.99, and the Russell index of smaller-company
stocks dropped 2.84 points, to 389.36.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose
2/32, to 100 4/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from the price, fell to 5.24 percent, from 5.25 percent
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But while inaction by the Fed might unsettle the market, Ms.
Callies said the central bank was no longer the main driver of
investors. ``The market is rallying because it is celebrating the
absence of disaster,'' she said. ``It had thought the world was
going to end.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's mania for Internet stocks continued, with another
company soaring after its initial public offering. Friday it was
shares of Theglobe.com, which offers free home pages on the World
Wide Web. It went public Thursday at 9 a share and then soared 54
1/2 Friday, to close at 63 1/2, in the best first-day trading
performance of any stock.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Earthweb also made a debut to a rousing
demand from investors, rising 55 1/4, to 69 1/4, in two days of
trading. Friday it fell 2 1/4, to 67. Ebay is another Internet
offering that has recently soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, given what has happened in Ebay and Earthweb, that
the after-market demand from retail investors is extraordinary,''
said Henry Blodget, an Internet analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer. The
stocks ``are being played, not invested in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The retail sales data released Friday would not support another
Fed easing, analysts said, because the figures showed that the
economy was healthy and, especially, that consumer spending was
strong. October retail sales rose 1 percent after an increase of
three-tenths of 1 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Producer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in
October. But for the year, the index is down five-tenths of 1
percent, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. That performance
does make it possible for the Fed to cut rates without worrying
much about inflationary consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts acknowledged that the outlook for the world
economy and financial markets was far better than it was on Oct.
15, when the Fed surprised investors with a rate cut in between its
regular policy-making meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in
Pittsburgh, said he still expected the Fed to cut its target for
short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage point. ``The capital
crunch has substantially abated, but it is not over,'' he said.
And, he added, the future risks for the economy ``are still tilted
downward,'' and he expected that most Fed policy-makers would want
to buy some more insurance by cutting rates again.

FAMED SURGEON DEBAKEY ATTENDS GERMAN IMPLANTATION OF TINY HEART
PUMP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ German heart surgeons Friday implanted a new tiny heart
assistant pump in the chest of a 56-year-old patient while Dr.
Michael E. DeBakey, who developed the device, looked on.
</P>
<P>
   The pump, called the DeBakey VAD (ventricular assist device), is
no bigger than two AA batteries _ one-tenth the size of portable
heart-assist devices now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey, chancellor emeritus of Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston, implanted the first successful VAD in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, he has worked on improving the assist pumps
that takes over the job of the left ventricle, the heart's main
pumping chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Development of the DeBakey VAD began as a collaboration with
NASA engineer David Saucier, who was a heart transplant patient.
</P>
<P>
   He and DeBakey had discussed the engineering problems associated
with developing a pump so simple that it could not fail and still
fit in a child's chest.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the work on the heart pump became an official
program at NASA. When the heart got to the point where it could be
used in patients, MicroMed Technologies Inc. was chosen to develop
it for the market.
</P>
<P>
   Saucier has since died. His work with DeBakey is now coming to
fruition, a fact that the surgeon finds fulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the surgery in Germany, DeBakey said, ``It is
very gratifying to see the successful human implantation of this
device. I have worked on developing a VAD for over 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The first devise he developed was a pulsatile pump that mimicked
the heart's pumping action. But pulsatile pumps are too big for
most women and children. They also are complicated with several
moving parts and valves that can fail.
</P>
<P>
   The little DeBakey VAD is a rotary pump with a single moving
part that pushes the blood along at a rate of 10 liters per minute,
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Anderson, president of MicroMed, said the German patient
is in stable condition, although he is confined to an intensive
care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by telephone, Anderson said the patient will be kept
alive by the DeBakey VAD until a suitable donated heart can be
found for transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really happy and hopefully, he'll be very happy,''
Anderson said. ``For the first week or two, we will keep a close
eye on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This patient was really sick,'' Anderson said. ``We hope by
giving him good blood circulation, all of his organs will start to
get better.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company hopes to use the heart pump in several more
implantations at the German Heart Institute in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The device was implanted by Dr. Roland Hetzer, chief of
cardiothoracic surgery at the Deutsches Herzzentrum, with the
assistance of Dr. George P. Noon, a professor at Baylor and a
well-known Houston heart surgeon. Also participating were Dr.
Matthias Loebe and Dr. Yo-Guo Weng of the Berlin institute.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey hopes the VAD eventually can be used to keep people
alive while their hearts recover. Several patients at the German
Heart Institute have had the bigger pumps implanted. After several
months to two years, the device was removed, and their hearts had
recovered enough to take up the job of pumping blood through the
body once more.
</P>
<P>
   MicroMed received European approval to use the heart in humans
in October.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey said he hopes to get the U.S. Food and Drug
Administrations' approval for human studies in this country early
next year. &QL;

LEADERS AT ASIAN ECONOMIC PARLEY FACE DAUNTING TASK 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ It has been a year since President
Clinton downplayed the Asian financial crisis as a mere ``glitch in
the road.''
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes. Since Clinton's remark at the
last summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders in
Vancouver, the Asian currency crisis has plunged the world's
fastest-growing region into recession and political upheaval and
toppled four heads of state. The crisis has sent shock waves
through Russia, Latin America, and Wall Street, threatening a
worldwide catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   So it is an anxious group of cabinet minister gathering here
todayfor the sixth annual APEC summit to set an agenda for economic
recovery and continued market liberalization. For the United
States, the stakes are huge, as APEC countries account for
two-thirds of US trade.
</P>
<P>
   APEC's goal since its creation in 1989 has been to promote free
trade, but observers worry that mission will be obscured this year
amid a dispute over how open markets should be during financial
havoc. Friday, bureaucrats from APEC countries failed to reach an
accord on lifting tariffs, a defeat that does not bode well for the
success of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Clinton and 20 other APEC leaders, who are to
meet here early next week, will be to prevent economic and
political turmoil from derailing APEC's agenda, and to resist
mounting pressure for protectionism in Asia and the United States.
This year's summit will test whether APEC's ideals can be sustained
in times of bust as well of boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders are coming together this year at a time of great
strain for a number of Asia-Pacific economies, and ... on the
international financial system,'' said John S. Wolf, US ambassador
for APEC. ``We need to learn the lessons of the 1930s. Now is not
the time for protectionism; it is the time to move forward toward
greater market openness.''
</P>
<P>
   That mantra will not be easy to sell. Two months ago, Malaysia
imposed rigid controls on the flow of capital, a move that flies in
the face of APEC's open-market philosophy. Pacific Rim members
Mexico and Chile opted out of tariff reductions discussed last
year. Japan, which accounts for three-quarters of Asia's economic
activity, has backpedaled on opening certain trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting also occurs as a behind-the-scenes debate roils in
Asia over whether democratic or authoritarian governments better
foster growth, equity, and stability.
</P>
<P>
   The drumbeat for political change is particularly sensitive in
Malaysia, where the deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, was
ousted two months ago after a dispute with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad over capital controls. Anwar is on trial on sex and
corruption charges that his supporters say were invented to
discredit his reform movement, and street protests are likely to
distract from APEC's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   For a meeting drawing 8,000 delegates and 3,000 reporters,
Mahathir has deployed 5,700 security officers to deter protests and
has warned visiting leaders not to comment on the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie have expressed concern over Anwar's arrest, and
Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have refused to
meet with Mahathir in protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect the (Malaysian) prime minister ... to ask
President Clinton how the impeachment is going,'' responded
Malaysia's trade minister, Rafidah Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   Political drama nothwithstanding, APEC leaders will debate
reducing barriers to trade and investment, recapitalizing banks and
creating a social safety net for people affected by the downturn.
If heads of state are able to make good on tariff reductions agreed
upon in principle last year, they will have accomplished a task
worth $1.5 trillion in trade.
</P>
<P>
   APEC was established to remove barriers to investment and trade
when Asia-Pacific growth seemed to know no limits. US exports to
APEC countries have risen 70 percent since 1990, and APEC has
surpassed Western Europe as America's biggest trading partner. Last
year, US trade with APEC totaled $956 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, US exports to Asia started to fall as the crisis
made American goods unaffordable here, fueling a US trade deficit.
By August, that deficit was approaching last year's $110 billion.
US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky says it could top $300
billion next year _ a prospect that has many American manufacturers
clamoring for trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington retreats from APEC's free-market goals, ``it will
be license for everyone else to do the same. If we blink, it'll be
the end of the APEC process,'' said Christopher Lingle, author of
``The Rise and Decline of the Asian Century.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has dismissed protectionist demands
by arguing that a stronger Asia-Pacific region will mean markets
for US goods and jobs for Americans. But it is not only a home
audience Clinton has to persuade.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has threatened to derail the plan to reduce tariffs in
nine sectors by 2002 to 2005, by balking at the opening of forestry
and fishing industries. That could prompt harder-hit nations to
backpedal, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is growing increasingly impatient with
Japan,'' US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Friday.
``Token participation at the end of the day by the world's
second-largest economy doesn't cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Japan made other overtures Friday, proposing a $148 billion
economic stimulus package to deflect criticism that it has not done
enough to help the region.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an APEC panel of experts headed by Fred Bergsten,
director of the Institute for International Economics in
Washington, has urged member governments to cut interest rates and
increase spending in a concerted effort that Bergsten says could
produce growth of 4 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Host Malaysia is expected to promote capital controls like those
imposed here two months ago that fixed the exchange rate and barred
repatriation of profits. Malaysia will also likely push for an
organization to monitor global monetary movements by hedge funds
and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, are wary of proposals that entail
government intervention and doubt APEC can do anything to hasten
the pace of a recovery that will come in its own time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing (for APEC leaders) to do now would be to step
down and let markets solve the problem rather than politicians,''
said Marc Faber, head of an investment fund and research outfit in
Hong Kong.

RELIGION: PLURALISM NURTURES EVANGELICALS INSTEAD OF STIFLING
THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the biggest questions facing anyone interested in
understanding American society, indeed the modern condition
generally, is why conservative evangelical Christianity not only
persists in the United States but positively thrives.
</P>
<P>
   By now, it is no secret that evangelicals are growing in number.
Less well known is that evangelicals outrank even fundamentalists
in their adherence to traditional doctrines, their defense of the
Bible, their rate of churchgoing, their personal evangelizing and
their financial support for efforts to spread the Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to believing in social change, participating
in politics, voting or volunteering in community programs,
evangelicals leave mainline Protestants, as well as Roman
Catholics, in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. Wasn't this kind of straightforward
Bible-based faith banished to the nation's cultural backwaters 73
years ago by the anti-evolution excesses of the Scopes trial in
Dayton, Tenn.?
</P>
<P>
   And if that didn't do the trick, shouldn't the certainties of
the old-time religion have long since fallen victim to the
corrosive effects of modern pluralism?
</P>
<P>
   These are questions not to be answered by pundits' obsession
with charting every last twitch of the religious right, which is
only one facet of conservative religion in the United States. Nor
can they be answered by a couple of popular theories.
</P>
<P>
   One is that evangelical Christianity flourishes only in
sheltered zones where geography, demography, ignorance or
homogeneity shields it from contact with what Walter Lippmann, in
1929, called the ``acids of modernity.''
</P>
<P>
   The other is that evangelical beliefs appeal to anxious people
who feel their social status threatened and yearn for security in a
world of rapid change.
</P>
<P>
   Neither theory fits the facts. By most standards measuring
contact with this elusive thing called modernity _ level of higher
education, employment patterns, income, urban vs. rural residence _
people who identify themselves as evangelical Christians are barely
different from other Americans.
</P>
<P>
   They are more highly educated, for example, than are those
calling themselves religious liberals or nonreligious, and only
slightly less likely to have a graduate education than mainline
Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there evidence that evangelicals are any more
economically anxious or threatened by downward mobility than other
Americans. Although they do feel that traditional values are under
siege, they appear to be more worried about the danger this poses
to others than to themselves and their own families.
</P>
<P>
   These findings are from a careful new study, ``American
Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving'' (University of Chicago
Press), by Professor Christian Smith, a sociologist at the
University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's conclusion, based on extensive polling and interviews,
is that evangelical Christianity is thriving not merely in the face
of modern pluralism but precisely because of it. A zest for
conflict and for drawing up religious battle lines is deeply
embedded in the ``cultural DNA'' of American evangelicalism, Smith
says, and pluralism is just the environment where it can flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals are confident that they possess an ultimate truth,
although Smith found that they ``are not particularly arrogant or
triumphalistic'' about it. They are similarly convinced that they
have a superior morality to guide them through life and a mission
to bring these gifts to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Pluralistic modernity may implicitly challenge such claims. But
this condition of ``sustained dissonance,'' rather than undermining
evangelical identity, Smith believes, only sharpens and strengthens
it.
</P>
<P>
   His book offers a theory of religious subcultures that
supplements the theory that evangelical success owes primarily to
its entrepreneurial competitiveness in the nation's ``free market''
of religions. He also amends the theory emphasizing strictness of
belief and practice as the key to the religious groups' vitality:
if that were the case, evangelicals would not be enjoying greater
vitality than their more unbending theological cousins, the
fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, American evangelicalism has created a subculture
managing to maintain ``both high tension with and high integration
into mainstream American society simultaneously,'' he writes.
``Contemporary pluralism creates a situation in which evangelicals
can perpetually maintain but never resolve their struggle with the
nonevangelical world.''
</P>
<P>
   That last sentence, of course, points to a problem. The vibrant
evangelical Christianity of the last century not only flourished in
the interstices of personal and family life but also moved the
whole culture and shaped the nation's institutions. It inspired
social reforms, from abolitionism to temperance. It founded
colleges, built hospitals, created charities and molded national
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Smith points out, the very factors that assure the
continuing vitality of evangelicalism also appear to cripple its
hopes of transforming the world. Many Americans, for example, are
turned off by some of the traits _ ``personal conviction, confident
evangelism, moral rectitude, fervent devotion'' _ that Smith cites
as part of evangelicalism's distinctive identity. Even more of an
obstacle, he argues, are the practical limits of evangelicals'
preference for a strategy of changing society through individual
conversions, personal influence and strictly voluntary action.
</P>
<P>
   Smith does not say so, but there may be something still more
basic operating here. Has evangelical Christianity grown
unconsciously fond of the cultural gridlock that has become a chief
precondition of evangelicalism's continuing vigor?

THOMAS QUASTHOFF: A BARITONE OF AMPLE PERSONALITY AND VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Colin Davis, in his first series of concerts as
principal guest conductor of the New York Philharmonic, has
assembled an offbeat program of works more or less familiar from
recordings but seldom heard in concert. And for the most part, he
did a fine job with it on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But the show, varied as it was, was stolen, in the best sense of
the term, by Thomas Quasthoff, a German baritone making his debut
with the orchestra in songs by Mahler to texts from ``Des Knaben
Wunderhorn.'' Quasthoff, heard to adequate effect two years ago in
a performance of Bach's ``St. John Passion'' with the Philadelphia
Orchestra, seemed ideal for this music.
</P>
<P>
   His rotund bass-baritone belies his tiny stature, which was
shaped by his mother's use of the drug thalidomide during
pregnancy, and it occasionally takes on a grainy edge that suits
the folkish nature of these songs.
</P>
<P>
   Quasthoff's oversize personality, given ample scope here in
material ranging from the farcical (the donkey's ``Ija'' in
``Praise From an Advanced Intellect'') to the forlorn, persuaded a
listener to forget, for the moment, those great performances
available on records.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said for the work of his partner here, Inger
Dam-Jensen, a Danish soprano, also in her Philharmonic debut. Ms.
Dam-Jensen sang honorably _ indeed, very well _ and with an
attractive tone but did not connect with the texts in a specific
enough fashion to rid the brain of a yearning for familiar
presences in this music: the fragility and suppleness of Elisabeth
Schwarzkopf, the warmth, depth and plushness of Christa Ludwig.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra showed its Mahlerian stripes beautifully in Davis'
practiced hands, though an occasional tempo had yet to settle in.
The strings were especially appealing, and the cellos applied a
delightfully schmaltzy touch to ``Rhine Legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Martin's ``Petite Symphonie Concertante'' afforded a
quirky but attractive showcase for several orchestra members: Nancy
Allen, the guest principal harpist; Lionel Party, the
harpsichordist, and Harriet Wingreen, a pianist.
</P>
<P>
   Berlioz's ``Roi Lear'' Overture filled out the program but did
little more. The work has always struck this Berlioz fan as a
potboiler, and even as ardent a champion of the composer as Davis
was not able to make it seem more than that.
</P>
<P>
   The program is to be repeated Saturday evening at Avery Fisher
Hall. Even sated fans of Mahler, let alone perennially starved fans
of Martin, should not miss it.

GLOBAL CRISES COMMANDING CLINTON'S ATTENTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More and more, it's the global crises _ whether in
Iraq, Kosovo or Asia _ that command the attention of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this most widely traveled of American presidents still
struggles to define the role of the United States in a post-Cold
War world without a black-and-white guide to foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton prepares today to travel to Malaysia for the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum _ a critical session in
light of the economic downtown sweeping the Pacific Rim _ while at
the same time trying again to force Iraq's Saddam Hussein to comply
with United Nations regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, which could be postponed or canceled if the Iraq
crisis deepens, would be the president's sixth overseas journey
this year. Clinton already has visited 13 nations since March. The
APEC trip is scheduled to include stopovers in Japan and South
Korea. Next month, he plans a trip to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's globetrotting this year especially underscores the
highs and lows of his foreign policy, which has been dominated by
the quest to expand free trade, brightened by pushes for peace in
Northern Ireland and the Middle East and blemished by hesitancy in
Iraq and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you've seen less of a sense of direction on foreign
policy than you saw under President Bush,'' said Richard Stoll,
associate director of Rice University's James A. Baker III
Institute for Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a confusing era in the sense that we as a county
have not made a decision about how we see ourselves functioning in
the world in the post Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to be the world's policeman? Should we let the
world run itself? You're not going to get something like the Cold
War where there was a strong consensus about what our main mission
was,'' Stoll said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really tough job and no one could have achieved a great
consensus by now, but he hasn't really tried,'' Stoll said.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 40 years, the bipartisan American foreign policy
was dictated by the idea of containing the spread of communism,
especially from the Soviet Union. When the Berlin Wall fell a
decade ago and the Soviet empire collapsed, the United States was
the world's sole superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration declared a new world order afoot after
international partners, including Russia, condemned Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and supported the
subsequent U.S.-led military action to remove his forces.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, mocked by Clinton in 1992 for interest in
international affairs, was defeated. Clinton became the first
president since Truman free to craft a foreign policy for a new
era.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't one simple doctrine that can take the place of
containment because we have a world awash in problems rather than
one monolithic threat to American security,'' said Will Marshall,
president of the Public Policy Institute, the think tank of the
centrist Democratic Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the lack of conceptual clarity in American foreign
policy is due to the fact that the world is a messier, more
complicated place. On the other hand ... the administration could
have done a better job of imposing clarity and coherence on its
foreign policy actions,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed bag of the Clinton's foreign policy includes
successful efforts to expand trade to Latin America and Asia; to
expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to three former
Soviet bloc nations; to help negotiate peace in Northern Ireland
and to become personally involved with Israeli and Palestinian
leaders to secure an interim peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He reached out to the nations of sub-Saharan Africa this year by
touring six countries, the most extensive visit ever by a U.S.
president.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the world's troublemakers _ from Saddam in
Iraq and Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia who helped finance the
Bosnian slaughters and who directed the crackdown in Kosovo _
Clinton has drawn criticism for failing to act decisively.
</P>
<P>
   After U.S. embassies were destroyed and people killed in two
African nations this year, Clinton finally took action against
terrorist suspect Osama bin Ladin, long thought to be the financial
backer of attacks against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As for Iraq, the administration repeatedly has been criticized
for failing to keep cohesion within the international coalition
formed by Bush to fight Saddam in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   And three times within a year, Saddam has stopped cooperating
with international arms inspectors charged with destroying his
chemical and biological weapons, only to back down after military
threats by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Until this latest crisis, Clinton had to contend with opposition
from France, Russia and China to any military response to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton, finishing his sixth year in office, appears to
have learned much since an ill-defined mission in Somalia left U.S.
troops dead in the administration's first foreign debacle in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out of a background as a governor where he just dealt
with domestic policy. I think it's a whole new world when you
become president,'' Stoll said. &QL;

RECORD NUMBER OF ENDANGERED CRANES EXPECTED AT TEXAS REFUGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Record numbers of endangered whooping cranes are
expected to spend the winter at the Aransas National Wildlife
Refuge on the Texas Gulf Coast following their annual 2,500 mile
flight from Canada, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 17 here last week, which is a week or two later than
normal,'' said Kim Halpin, outdoor recreation planner for the
refuge. ``They will continue to come in small groups and we will be
monitoring them with weekly flights.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials want citizens to help monitor the cranes' annual
flight from their summer home in northern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Whooping cranes are protected as a federal endangered species,
and officials are requesting the aid of Texans to help prevent the
birds from being harmed or harassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 190 are expected, and that would be a record,'' Halpin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year about 152 adults and 30 young birds spent the winter
at the Texas coast on or near the refuge.
</P>
<P>
   There were less than 20 birds in the wild in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The tallest birds in North America, standing more than 5 feet,
the cranes were once scattered across northern North America and
wintered from the mountains of Mexico to the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Similar in appearance to the gray sandhill crane, the larger
whooping cranes are solid white, except for black wing tips that
are visible only when the birds are in flight. Younger whooping
cranes are white, with a cinnamon-colored tint.
</P>
<P>
   The cranes that winter in Texas represent the only breeding wild
population.
</P>
<P>
   A re-introduction experiment in the Rocky Mountain region
failed, and captive-bred whooping cranes introduced into central
Florida over the last few years have not yet successfully
reproduced.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials said a record 49 nests were found in the
breeding grounds in northern Canada this summer, and 24 chicks were
found during an August survey.
</P>
<P>
   The cranes, which fly with necks and legs outstretched, often
pause overnight to use wetlands for roosting and agricultural
fields for feeding. They seldom stay in one area more than one
night until they reach the refuge.
</P>
<P>
   They usually migrate in small groups of less than 10 birds, but
they may be seen roosting and feeding with large flocks of the
smaller sandhill cranes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department asks that sightings of
the whooping crane be reported to department officials at
800-792-1112.)

EX-BUDDHIST MONK FIGHTS FOR HIS LIFE ON DEATH ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Updates throughout with governor denying clemency)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gov. Pete Wilson on Friday rejected appeals to
commute the death sentence of a former Buddhist monk who was
convicted of a double murder during a 1981 convenience store
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The denial followed appeals from the lawyer for Jaturun
Siripongs and a host of influential people _ the Thai ambassador to
Washington, the minister of foreign affairs of Thailand and former
San Quentin Warden Daniel Vasquez.
</P>
<P>
   The husband of one of his victims and two of the jurors who
condemned him to die also urged that he receive clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs, scheduled to die by lethal injection at 12:01 a.m.
Tuesday, was convicted for the deadly robbery in Garden Grove,
Calif. But the Thai native's lawyer contends he is innocent of
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs has no champion more devoted than Linda Schilling, a
corporate attorney with Fortune 500 clients who has befriended the
prisoner and fought for him without pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a better person for having known him,'' Schilling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has enriched my life,'' she said, in a voice tinged with
emotion. ``He is wise. He is insightful. He's a lot of fun to spend
time with. I will miss him very much if the state kills him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemency was Siripongs' last hope. Schilling has shepherded his
case through the state Supreme Court, the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court _ which declined to hear
arguments in October.
</P>
<P>
   She has declared that he was ineffectively represented by trial
counsel, that mitigating evidence was never presented to the jury
and, in a desperate finale, he has been denied his right to choose
between lethal gas or injection as required by state law. (A
federal judge has issued an injunction against gas-chamber
executions.)
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that her client participated in a robbery of
the store, Schilling contends the killings were committed by an
accomplice whom Siripongs has declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested for the strangulation death of store owner
Packovan Wattanaporn, another Thai national, and the fatal stabbing
of clerk Quach Nguyen, a Vietnamese immigrant, two days after the
crime. Siripongs was caught using Wattanaporn's credit card to buy
a television set.
</P>
<P>
   In Siripongs' apartment, the police found $3,000 in cash and
$25,000 in jewelry taken in the robbery. They said Siripongs had
suffered wounds consistent with a hand sliding down the blade of a
knife during a stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, in turn, said none of the 30 sets of fingerprints
found at the crime scene matched those of her client. She said shoe
prints in the store and blood found in Siripongs' car indicated the
presence of someone else during the crime.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, Schilling doesn't want to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter because he accepts the whole ball of wax,''
she said. ``He accepts complete responsibility and he always has.
... You talk to him about the day of the crime and he just trembles
and weeps.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Siripongs' remorse was so intense that _ before his
trial _ he wrote to the judge and asked to be sentenced
immediately. ``He said, `I do not want to burden the court. I do
not want to contribute to anybody else's suffering,''' Schilling
said.

ANNUAL BONUSES DELAYED AT CITIGROUP'S SALOMON SMITH BARNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORk _ In a sign that the turmoil at Citigroup Inc. may be
far from over, the financial giant's investment banking unit,
Salomon Smith Barney, told employees Friday that they will have to
wait a month longer than usual to collect their annual bonus
checks.
</P>
<P>
   The company will pay bonuses on Jan. 28, 1999, a month later
than scheduled. Bonuses usually make up the bulk of an investment
banker's annual compensation and are the subject of intense
competition and scrutiny. The decision was detailed in an internal
memorandum that stated that the company needed ``adequate time to
effectively manage the compensation process.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo said that Michael Carpenter and Victor Menezes, the two
executives in charge of managing the combined entity's corporate
banking group, needed additional time to figure out bonuses.
Earlier this month, Sanford Weill and John Reed, the co-chairmen of
Citigroup, promoted Carpenter and Menezes to their new roles after
dismissing James Dimon, the Citigroup president and heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The delay immediately raised concerns among bankers at Salomon,
many of whom are already shaken by the rapid-fire changes at
Citigroup. The concerns include worries that the new Citigroup will
pay smaller bonuses than Salomon employees expect. Combining
commercial and investment banking operations frequently brings
about compensation conflicts, because many Wall Street investment
banks pay their employees more than traditional banks do.
</P>
<P>
   Employees said they were also concerned that Carpenter and
Menezes will disregard the compensation process that was already in
full motion when Dimon and his chief lieutenant, Steven Black, left
the company. ``There's a sense that the new guys want to do this
their way _ and no one thinks that is good news for us,'' said one
Salomon Smith Barney banker, who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Wall Street expect that any Salomon bankers who are
unhappy about their prospects at Citigroup since the departure of
the popular Dimon will leave the firm, but not until after they
collect their bonuses. The delay in paying bonuses gives a bit more
time for the dust to settle before anyone defects. It also allows
the new leadership to reallocate the bonus pool in favor of people
they consider vital _ and to the disadvantage of those they do not
value as highly.
</P>
<P>
   Other employees said they did not find anything especially
disturbing about the announcement. One said that turbulent
financial markets combined with the management shake-up made this
an especially tricky year for deciding pay levels. ``I give them
the benefit of the doubt; they just need another month to get this
done,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   A Citigroup spokesman said the company did not comment on
compensation issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ It has been a year since President
Clinton downplayed the Asian financial crisis as a mere ``glitch in
the road.''
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes. Since Clinton's remark at the
last summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders in
Vancouver, the Asian currency crisis has plunged the world's
fastest-growing region into recession and political upheaval and
toppled four heads of state. The crisis has sent shock waves
through Russia, Latin America, and Wall Street, threatening a
worldwide catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   So it is an anxious group of cabinet minister gathering here
todayfor the sixth annual APEC summit to set an agenda for economic
recovery and continued market liberalization. For the United
States, the stakes are huge, as APEC countries account for
two-thirds of US trade.
</P>
<P>
   APEC's goal since its creation in 1989 has been to promote free
trade, but observers worry that mission will be obscured this year
amid a dispute over how open markets should be during financial
havoc. Friday, bureaucrats from APEC countries failed to reach an
accord on lifting tariffs, a defeat that does not bode well for the
success of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Clinton and 20 other APEC leaders, who are to
meet here early next week, will be to prevent economic and
political turmoil from derailing APEC's agenda, and to resist
mounting pressure for protectionism in Asia and the United States.
This year's summit will test whether APEC's ideals can be sustained
in times of bust as well of boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders are coming together this year at a time of great
strain for a number of Asia-Pacific economies, and ... on the
international financial system,'' said John S. Wolf, US ambassador
for APEC. ``We need to learn the lessons of the 1930s. Now is not
the time for protectionism; it is the time to move forward toward
greater market openness.''
</P>
<P>
   That mantra will not be easy to sell. Two months ago, Malaysia
imposed rigid controls on the flow of capital, a move that flies in
the face of APEC's open-market philosophy. Pacific Rim members
Mexico and Chile opted out of tariff reductions discussed last
year. Japan, which accounts for three-quarters of Asia's economic
activity, has backpedaled on opening certain trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting also occurs as a behind-the-scenes debate roils in
Asia over whether democratic or authoritarian governments better
foster growth, equity, and stability.
</P>
<P>
   The drumbeat for political change is particularly sensitive in
Malaysia, where the deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, was
ousted two months ago after a dispute with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad over capital controls. Anwar is on trial on sex and
corruption charges that his supporters say were invented to
discredit his reform movement, and street protests are likely to
distract from APEC's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   For a meeting drawing 8,000 delegates and 3,000 reporters,
Mahathir has deployed 5,700 security officers to deter protests and
has warned visiting leaders not to comment on the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie have expressed concern over Anwar's arrest, and
Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have refused to
meet with Mahathir in protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect the (Malaysian) prime minister ... to ask
President Clinton how the impeachment is going,'' responded
Malaysia's trade minister, Rafidah Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   Political drama nothwithstanding, APEC leaders will debate
reducing barriers to trade and investment, recapitalizing banks and
creating a social safety net for people affected by the downturn.
If heads of state are able to make good on tariff reductions agreed
upon in principle last year, they will have accomplished a task
worth $1.5 trillion in trade.
</P>
<P>
   APEC was established to remove barriers to investment and trade
when Asia-Pacific growth seemed to know no limits. US exports to
APEC countries have risen 70 percent since 1990, and APEC has
surpassed Western Europe as America's biggest trading partner. Last
year, US trade with APEC totaled $956 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, US exports to Asia started to fall as the crisis
made American goods unaffordable here, fueling a US trade deficit.
By August, that deficit was approaching last year's $110 billion.
US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky says it could top $300
billion next year _ a prospect that has many American manufacturers
clamoring for trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington retreats from APEC's free-market goals, ``it will
be license for everyone else to do the same. If we blink, it'll be
the end of the APEC process,'' said Christopher Lingle, author of
``The Rise and Decline of the Asian Century.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has dismissed protectionist demands
by arguing that a stronger Asia-Pacific region will mean markets
for US goods and jobs for Americans. But it is not only a home
audience Clinton has to persuade.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has threatened to derail the plan to reduce tariffs in
nine sectors by 2002 to 2005, by balking at the opening of forestry
and fishing industries. That could prompt harder-hit nations to
backpedal, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is growing increasingly impatient with
Japan,'' US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Friday.
``Token participation at the end of the day by the world's
second-largest economy doesn't cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Japan made other overtures Friday, proposing a $148 billion
economic stimulus package to deflect criticism that it has not done
enough to help the region.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an APEC panel of experts headed by Fred Bergsten,
director of the Institute for International Economics in
Washington, has urged member governments to cut interest rates and
increase spending in a concerted effort that Bergsten says could
produce growth of 4 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Host Malaysia is expected to promote capital controls like those
imposed here two months ago that fixed the exchange rate and barred
repatriation of profits. Malaysia will also likely push for an
organization to monitor global monetary movements by hedge funds
and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, are wary of proposals that entail
government intervention and doubt APEC can do anything to hasten
the pace of a recovery that will come in its own time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing (for APEC leaders) to do now would be to step
down and let markets solve the problem rather than politicians,''
said Marc Faber, head of an investment fund and research outfit in
Hong Kong.

ASIA'S FISCAL PROBLEMS HAVE REPERCUSSIONS ON U.S. RELATIONS 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Closely trailing any international
economic crisis is the geopolitical fallout, and the fiscal
problems in Asia have had pronounced repercussions on U.S.
relations in the region.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case, there has been increased reliance on
U.S.-led international financial institutions along with complaints
that the United States has been overbearing in its demands for
tough steps to restart what were once known as ``tiger'' economies.
</P>
<P>
   That love-hate context is likely to echo throughout the
deliberations this week of the annual meeting of leaders from the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States was seen as a sort of bulwark of
stability,'' said Christopher Lingle, a Hong Kong-based economic
consultant. ``But there's also a certain amount of resentment at
the sort of pressures the United States has put forth.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme will arise again when President Clinton flies on later
in the week to Japan, where he is expected to repeat his call for
Tokyo to take steps to rouse its slumbering economy and lead
eastern Asia out of the serious financial malaise. Japan's gross
national product accounts for about two-thirds of the GNP in the
vast region.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. demands that Japan open its financial system to outside
competition represents ``a historic change that is really
significant,'' said Walter LeFeber, a Cornell University professor
and author of ``The Clash,'' a study of U.S.-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the consistent themes of Japanese policy since World
War II has been to try to keep these kinds of financial
arrangements Japanese and not allow the Americans in,'' LaFeber
said. ``We've seen a rather interesting reversal in a long-term
Japanese policy, made necessary in part by the Japanese economic
weakness, in part by U.S. capital dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis has also seen a change in the attitude of some
Americans, including some in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inferiority complex toward Asia, the sense that there was
a distinctive and better Asian way of doing things ... that had
resulted from the high economic growth rates _ all that is over,''
said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the crisis began in southeastern Asia in the
summer of 1997, Lingle wrote a prescient book, ``The Rise and
Decline of the Asian Century'' with a subtitle that in retrospect
seems even wiser: ``False Starts on the Path to the Global
Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes his thesis has been borne out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis has led to somewhat of a retreat from the global
economy'' by some Asian nations, Lingle said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not good news for any U.S. administration because it cuts
off what for several years had been a booming market, especially
for business consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the worries, Lingle said, is how that retreat is
manifesting itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis is basically a failure of governance in the
region,'' he said. ``Now they want to hide behind capital
controls'' _ anathema to official Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Lingle foresees momentary ``illusions that the (Asian) markets
are stabilizing, only to have more misery heaped on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The judgment of international investors will be severe, he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The global flow of capital has raised the bar and raised the
standards,`` Lingle said. ``For those who do not meet them, these
will be exposed and they will be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists see problems _ if not intellectual dishonesty _
in the Clinton administration's effort to equate free trade and
free capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia University economist, wrote earlier
this year in Foreign Affairs: ``The claims of enormous benefits
from free capital mobility are not persuasive.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideology of free trade, he said, has ``in effect, been
hijacked by the proponents of capital mobility. They have been used
to bamboozle us into celebrating the new world of trillions of
dollars moving about daily in a borderless world ... The pretty
face presented to us is, in fact, a mask that hides the warts and
wrinkles underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, Yergin said, the consequences of the Asian crisis
have not completely played out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see an awful lot of cheap Asian goods coming
into our economy and taking our markets away,'' Yergin said. That
may increase protectionist pressures in Congress, which are rarely
far below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to keep the U.S. financial view as international as
possible, some federal agencies have gone out of their way to keep
a high profile in the region during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   David L. Aaron, undersecretary of Commerce for international
trade, recently led a U.S. high tech mission on a three-week tour
of southeastern Asia. The purpose, he told an investment conference
on his return, was to show ``we are not just fair weather
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was also to preach the Clinton administration gospel of
open trade and capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned that the so-called alternatives _ exchange
controls, import substitution, and state management _ do not
work,'' Aaron said. ``Capitalism is a system of profit and loss.
That is why capitalism works.'' &QL;

IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, THEY DON'T KNOW MO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Back home in Boston, Mo Vaughn dominates
the news. Mo this. Mo that. Say it ain't so, Mo. Mo Vaughn _ moving
on.
</P>
<P>
   It's different out here in the land where Mo may land. There is
no sense of urgency about the Anaheim Angels' chances of signing
big Mo. No 24-hour Mo channel on local cable TV. No special Mo
section in the Los Angeles Times or the Orange County Register,
which could become Mo's hometown newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   No, they don't know Mo. He could be anyone to southern
Californians. He could be an up-and-coming actor. He could be the
newest personal trainer to the stars. He could be a food group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo Vaughn _ isn't that some kind of cheese?'' said a
construction worker on the upscale tourist trap known as the Third
Street Promenade.
</P>
<P>
   Offered Marla, a first-name-basis-only massage therapist, ``I
think he's some old Chinese proverb dude.''
</P>
<P>
   Two guys with spiked hair and six earrings between them had
different but correct ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a baseball player,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo Vaughn? I think we should Mo(ve) On,'' said the other.
</P>
<P>
   A random sampling on the Promenade suggested that maybe 20
percent of southern Californians know Mo is a baseball player and
only a quarter of those know he might soon be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The young women working at the Disney Store, who are paid by the
same corporation that is offering Mo $72 million over six years,
had no idea who he is. They should. Someday soon, it could be
Mickey, Minnie, and Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a painter?'' a young woman in all black _ except for her
maroon hair _ announced tentatively.
</P>
<P>
   The guy behind the counter at Borders Books was clueless. Asked
if he knew Mo Vaughn, he started typing Mo's name into a computer,
presumably checking to see if Mo has had any recent best-sellers.
Mo, he should know, may have ``The Right Stuff'' but he definitely
doesn't have ``The Write Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Other guesses included a singer and a politician. This being La
La Land, the most votes went for movie actor. (There may be a film
clause in Disney's offer.) Unfortunately, no one furnished the
correct answer. No one even offered the best wrong answer: ``Mo
Vaughn? I think he's one of the Stooges.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at Edison Field in Anaheim, where Mo may anchor first base,
there was no Mo buzz. General manager Bill Bavasi was en route from
Naples, Fla., and vice president Tim Mead was serving on a jury.
The Angels said they have no announcements planned for the weekend,
and it looks like the team might let Mo sit on the offer until the
holidays. That could be Thanksgiving _ or Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County Register, in its fat Friday edition, had not a
word about Mo on the cover of the sports page. Instead, there were
stories about Stanford basketball, UCLA football, and Corona del
Mar High School football. Mo, the big-money man, the big man in
Boston, made Page 3. And he wasn't the lead story. The LA Times
gave Mo the same inside play.
</P>
<P>
   Mo might consider what his stature would be as he weighs his
options for the 21st century. He is, after all, a player who loves
the spotlight, and in southern California, the bright lights shine
on thousands of others. He'd have to get in line. At Laker games,
Jack Nicholson is a bigger star than Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe
Bryant. Even with his career on the skids, Kevin Costner gets more
attention at Dodgers games than any Dodgers on the field.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore that point, former Laker great James Worthy
strolled unnoticed down the Third Street Promanade. He was just
another tall guy in intentionally hip sunglasses. Some athletes
might like this anonymity. Mo might not.
</P>
<P>
   The man working the booth at Henna Temporary Tattoos didn't know
Mo but said he'd give him a free tattoo. The proprietor of the
Prima Donna bikini store knew nothing of Vaughn and offered no free
merchandise if he becomes an Angel. Heaven help him.
</P>
<P>
   An older gentleman, wearing a blue ball cap with no team
insignia, knew all about Mo Vaughn. He knew Mo was a first
baseman/slugger for the Red Sox and that the Angels had broken the
bank with their $72 million offer. But he came by his knowledge
inadvertently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it on the radio,'' he said. ``I hate baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where Mo is thinking about working for the next six
years, the place he may call home through 2004. It's where they
don't know Mo and they won't know Mo. He may be a big cheese in
Boston, but to some here, he's just cheese. Expensive imported
cheese.

REV. JOE MANTON: ONE OF BOSTON'S ELOQUENT ONES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 15, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ We've had our share of gifted orators hereabouts: James
Michael Curley for spellbinding, Tip O'Neill for Irish yarns, JFK
for understated eloquence, Daniel Webster for nation-building, John
Kenneth Galbraith for balloon-puncturing wit.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Boston's greatest in the verbal Vesuvius department
died Monday at St. John of God Hospital. The man who amused,
inspired, consoled, entertained, reassured and ususally capitvated
millions of New Englanders passed on to his eternal reward. He was
the Rev. Joe Manton, the Brooklyn-born Redemptorist priest whose
Wednesday night radio broadcasts of the Novena from Mission Church
spanned more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   He was ``an old priest, limping toward Heaven on highway 94, and
pausing shyly to knock on your door,'' he wrote this year in his
last letter accompanying the Catholic TV Channel Guide. What had
made him so powerful a pulpit presence was his innate modesty, a
real genius for picking the right words, and an unerring compass
for finding the most effective path to explaining something that
could be philosophically complex, morally exalted, politically
sophisticated, or diametrically opposed to the selfish gene that is
supposed to rule humankind.
</P>
<P>
   He was a master of the soft sell. This fall he concluded a
church newsletter: ``So when trouble rings your doorbell, and
leaves its bundle there _ maybe it's sickness _ life looks so
strange from the horizontal when you're sick. Maybe it is some
accident that overnight changes your world. Maybe it's death that
puts a black edge of bereavement around your family. When this
trouble comes, go to our Blessed Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   His faith was an inextinguishable fountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you went to central casting to find a priest,'' said Jack
Connors Friday of Father Manton, ``You'd find two guys: Barry
Fitzgerald, the actor, and Joe Manton.'' The son of Irish
immigrants, Manton was ordained in '29, the year of the Crash.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Mission Church in Roxbury in 1939, and lived there in
the same rectory bedroom for 59 years. ``They don't do that kind of
time at Walpole,'' he'd wink. With the explosion of faith inspired
by the stresses of World War II, he preached at nine different
services on Wednesdays, Novena days, when 20,000 people would have
streamed through the great wooden doors atop Mission Hill, and
thousands more listened via radio, those whom he called his
``unseen congregation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother used to go to the Mission Church on Wednesdays,''
said Connors, the advertising baron who is now chairman of the
board of the medical establishment known as Partners. ``And she'd
listen on the radio if she couldn't get in there. Father Manton
could have made a lot more money as an advertising copywriter or a
political speechwriter. He could break your heart with a sentence.
He had a very powerful voice. And his career was a tribute to a
different time, in the city and in the country, when what the
preacher had to say meant everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Manton was happy being who he was. ``He was a wonderful priest,
and totally thrilled with his role as a priest. One of the problems
these days is that everybody in life wants to be somebody else;
they're unhappy with this or with that. He was content to be Father
Joe Manton of Mission Church, he did not want to be anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Honors and adulation piled up, as recounted in the obituary
Wednesday in the Globe. Using the skills drilled into him by
parochial schooling in Brooklyn and various seminary and university
assignments, and leavened by years of studying Classical Greek and
Latin, Manton was a writer of prodigious output, including ten
books and countless sermons and radio scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight years ago, his immediate superior, the Rev. Joseph
Scannell, said ``He's modest and he thinks he can't write, but he
has a technicolor imagination. He even doubts his ability to speak,
and he pulls 20,000 people into Mission Church every Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Manton was modest in his self-assessment. ``I make almost 500
talks a year,'' he recounted in 1951. He was up at 5 a.m., sharing
in the daily mass schedule. ``But the real hard-working priests are
those who hear confessions and go out on calls. They're the real
heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   He had the habit of expressing folk-wisdom in a way that was
accessible to the masses. A yellowed Globe clipping from 1945
contains these excerpts from a Father Manton Novena sermon:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother love may not be entirely blind, but it often needs
bi-focals. Now, if I went on to tell you how to raise a model
child, you might allege that I have had no experience and that this
would make my arguments invalid _ though I do not demand that my
doctor shall first have had his tonsils out before he removes mine,
nor do I insist that the barber have a haircut before he lay a
scissors to mine.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1951 he gave the benediction at a dinner honoring Rodgers and
Hammerstein that, as brief as it was, brought down the house:
``Dear Lord, since you've given these men the gift of words and
music, give them the grace to use their talents nobly so that in
the Hereafter, the one will not have to swallow his words or the
other face the music. In brief, please make it easier for Rodgers
and Hammerstein to get into heaven than it is for any of us to get
into `South Pacific'.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 he gave the invocation at a breakfast honoring Robert
Briscoe, the Lord Mayor of Dublin: `` ... Deliver him, O Lord, this
real Irishman who risked his life for the land he loved, from any
professional Irishmen, with an angle _ there are mercifully few,
but spare him even these: the sham shamrocks, the bogus
bog-trotters, the synthetic Sinn Feiners, and especially, the
extravagant psycho-Patricks who love too loudly through a green
haze an Ireland that never was ... and today let the blessing come
down generously even on the English muffins and the Orange juice,
so that having broken our fast at the top of the mornin', we may
raise thanking you from the bottom of our hearts, Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   Can we agree that any man who can string that together at eight
o'clock in the morning has a way with words? I think so.

JONES CASE SETTLED, BUT MORAL ISSUES REMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Paula Jones sexual-harassment claim against
President Clinton now is over. But the questions raised by the
Paula Jones lawsuit will have some long-lasting effects _ on the
course of the next several months of American politics, on the
shape of the American presidency, and on the relations between the
sexes in American workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's landmark settlement also removed an embarrassment from
President Clinton's crowded agenda, but it did not wipe clean the
moral slate of the president as he approaches impeachment hearings
in the House Judiciary Committee next week.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did it sweep away the link between the Jones case and the
impeachment proceedings. The president's deposition in the Jones
case led directly to the widening of independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr's investigation of Clinton, transforming an inquiry into a
failed land deal in Arkansas into an inquisition about the
president's sexual conduct in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the sexual relationship the president acknowledged with
Monica S. Lewinsky, the Jones case began as less of a national
melodrama and more of an annoyance to White House. Indeed, the
president never acknowledged that he urged the onetime state
employee to engage in a sexual act _ and in a nation where the
accused, even the president, must still be regarded as innocent
unless proven guilty, that is a substantial difference between the
Jones episode and the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's opponents almost certainly will seize upon
the $850,000 settlement as a symbol of the president's impulse
toward sexual adventurism outside his marriage _ though the
settlement growing out of the 1991 incident pointedly includes
neither acknowledgement nor apology.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the impact of the Jones case remains even as it may
recede into history.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of the happy ambiguities of the American presidency has
been wiped away. The Jones case showed, in the most dramatic way
possible, that a sitting president could be sued in a court of law
for his personal conduct. And though White House officials,
constitutional scholars, historians, and commentators may continue
their debate over the virtue of allowing a president to be
vulnerable to lawsuits, there is no question that, in language
appropriated from the Nixon presidency, the president is not above
the law.
</P>
<P>
   The less lasting, but perhaps most immediate, effect of the
Jones suit is its role as the link between the Whitewater
investigation and the Lewinsky investigation. In short: Had Paula
Jones not sued President Clinton, Monica Lewinsky might not be a
household name today, nor the rationale behind a House impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied in the sworn deposition in the Jones case that he
had a sexual relationship with Lewinsky, and that deposition led
directly to the charges of perjury that are at the heart of the
impeachment inquiry that is under way this month.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, US District Judge Susan Webber Wright ruled
that even if Jones's allegations were true, they did not constitute
sexual harassment because the former state clerk was not penalized
for refusing the president's sexual request. The Jones case was
dismissed, but the accusations against the president derived from
the Jones testimony did not.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the notion that the president was vulnerable to suits
from his fellow citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, in a case rooted in the Nixon administration,
ruled that the president has absolute immunity from lawsuits from
actions taken in his official capacity as president. The Jones case
confirmed what the Supreme Court implied: that he still could be
sued for events that allegedly occurred outside the conduct of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling in May 1997 asserting that
the president could not even put off the Jones case until after his
term only served to underline his vulnerability to lawsuits. The
court said that such cases could go on with ``due regard'' for his
duties as president, suggesting that the legal action should be
scheduled around his official responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution protects the president from harassment,''
said Kate Stith-Cabranes, a constitutional-law expert at the Yale
Law School. ``But he can be sued like anyone else, though at his
convenience because of his duties.''

LEADERS AT ASIAN ECONOMIC PARLEY FACE DAUNTING TASK 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ It has been a year since President
Clinton downplayed the Asian financial crisis as a mere ``glitch in
the road.''
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes. Since Clinton's remark at the
last summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders in
Vancouver, the Asian currency crisis has plunged the world's
fastest-growing region into recession and political upheaval and
toppled four heads of state. The crisis has sent shock waves
through Russia, Latin America, and Wall Street, threatening a
worldwide catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   So it is an anxious group of cabinet minister gathering here
todayfor the sixth annual APEC summit to set an agenda for economic
recovery and continued market liberalization. For the United
States, the stakes are huge, as APEC countries account for
two-thirds of US trade.
</P>
<P>
   APEC's goal since its creation in 1989 has been to promote free
trade, but observers worry that mission will be obscured this year
amid a dispute over how open markets should be during financial
havoc. Friday, bureaucrats from APEC countries failed to reach an
accord on lifting tariffs, a defeat that does not bode well for the
success of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Clinton and 20 other APEC leaders, who are to
meet here early next week, will be to prevent economic and
political turmoil from derailing APEC's agenda, and to resist
mounting pressure for protectionism in Asia and the United States.
This year's summit will test whether APEC's ideals can be sustained
in times of bust as well of boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders are coming together this year at a time of great
strain for a number of Asia-Pacific economies, and ... on the
international financial system,'' said John S. Wolf, US ambassador
for APEC. ``We need to learn the lessons of the 1930s. Now is not
the time for protectionism; it is the time to move forward toward
greater market openness.''
</P>
<P>
   That mantra will not be easy to sell. Two months ago, Malaysia
imposed rigid controls on the flow of capital, a move that flies in
the face of APEC's open-market philosophy. Pacific Rim members
Mexico and Chile opted out of tariff reductions discussed last
year. Japan, which accounts for three-quarters of Asia's economic
activity, has backpedaled on opening certain trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting also occurs as a behind-the-scenes debate roils in
Asia over whether democratic or authoritarian governments better
foster growth, equity, and stability.
</P>
<P>
   The drumbeat for political change is particularly sensitive in
Malaysia, where the deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, was
ousted two months ago after a dispute with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad over capital controls. Anwar is on trial on sex and
corruption charges that his supporters say were invented to
discredit his reform movement, and street protests are likely to
distract from APEC's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   For a meeting drawing 8,000 delegates and 3,000 reporters,
Mahathir has deployed 5,700 security officers to deter protests and
has warned visiting leaders not to comment on the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie have expressed concern over Anwar's arrest, and
Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien have refused to
meet with Mahathir in protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect the (Malaysian) prime minister ... to ask
President Clinton how the impeachment is going,'' responded
Malaysia's trade minister, Rafidah Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   Political drama nothwithstanding, APEC leaders will debate
reducing barriers to trade and investment, recapitalizing banks and
creating a social safety net for people affected by the downturn.
If heads of state are able to make good on tariff reductions agreed
upon in principle last year, they will have accomplished a task
worth $1.5 trillion in trade.
</P>
<P>
   APEC was established to remove barriers to investment and trade
when Asia-Pacific growth seemed to know no limits. US exports to
APEC countries have risen 70 percent since 1990, and APEC has
surpassed Western Europe as America's biggest trading partner. Last
year, US trade with APEC totaled $956 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, US exports to Asia started to fall as the crisis
made American goods unaffordable here, fueling a US trade deficit.
By August, that deficit was approaching last year's $110 billion.
US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky says it could top $300
billion next year _ a prospect that has many American manufacturers
clamoring for trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington retreats from APEC's free-market goals, ``it will
be license for everyone else to do the same. If we blink, it'll be
the end of the APEC process,'' said Christopher Lingle, author of
``The Rise and Decline of the Asian Century.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has dismissed protectionist demands
by arguing that a stronger Asia-Pacific region will mean markets
for US goods and jobs for Americans. But it is not only a home
audience Clinton has to persuade.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has threatened to derail the plan to reduce tariffs in
nine sectors by 2002 to 2005, by balking at the opening of forestry
and fishing industries. That could prompt harder-hit nations to
backpedal, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is growing increasingly impatient with
Japan,'' US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Friday.
``Token participation at the end of the day by the world's
second-largest economy doesn't cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Japan made other overtures Friday, proposing a $148 billion
economic stimulus package to deflect criticism that it has not done
enough to help the region.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an APEC panel of experts headed by Fred Bergsten,
director of the Institute for International Economics in
Washington, has urged member governments to cut interest rates and
increase spending in a concerted effort that Bergsten says could
produce growth of 4 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Host Malaysia is expected to promote capital controls like those
imposed here two months ago that fixed the exchange rate and barred
repatriation of profits. Malaysia will also likely push for an
organization to monitor global monetary movements by hedge funds
and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, are wary of proposals that entail
government intervention and doubt APEC can do anything to hasten
the pace of a recovery that will come in its own time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing (for APEC leaders) to do now would be to step
down and let markets solve the problem rather than politicians,''
said Marc Faber, head of an investment fund and research outfit in
Hong Kong.

A DEFINING POINT FOR EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: This week's Supreme Court decision to allow Milwaukee's
school voucher program to continue unhindered may someday prove a
watershed event in the history of American education.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't set any precedent, but by leaving the matter to the
states to sort out for the time being, the high court ensured a
vigorous national debate on this issue well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   If America's public education establishment feels threatened by
the development, its concerns are justified. The concept of
allowing taxpayer-financed vouchers to fund alternatives to
traditional public schooling looms as a policy instrument of
radical change in American life.
</P>
<P>
   The key is the creation of choice for those dissatisfied with
the monopoly represented by the public school system. Choice
introduces competition, which is critical to sustaining and
improving the quality of any product or service in any market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem with primary and secondary education for most
American children is that it isn't subject to the discipline of
market forces. It's basically a state-sanctioned command economy
dominated by a government-created monopoly. The predictable result
for many communities is what happens eventually in all state-run
enterprises: They end up operated more for the benefit of the
bureaucracy than those for whom the system's benefits were
originally intended.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of school-choice vouchers say the concept is dangerous
because it will create a crippling funding drain on traditional
public schools if choice prompts a mass exodus to private
alternatives. This will mean a declining quality of public
education for those remaining.
</P>
<P>
   This argument misses a crucial point. Nothing happens in a
vacuum. If many public school systems weren't perceived as
deficient, there wouldn't be a controversy over alternatives. There
was, for instance, no substantial groundswell of support for school
choice a generation ago. Those who didn't choose to use religious
or private schools cheerfully sent their children to public
schools, fully confident of satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel laureate Milton Friedman recently predicted that
school vouchers would fuel the next great period of U.S. progress.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, a leading free-market economic theorist, said in an
interview with The Wall Street Journal that vouchers were a magic
bullet because ``they restore control to the people most competent
to decide on children's education: their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, incidentally, dismisses the charter school concept as
inadequate to the challenge because it's not enough to merely give
parents and schools a measure of independence to set policy while
still leaving government in control. Vouchers are the best
solution, he asserts, because they allow parents to control the
money, which guarantees market competition.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest sell for voucher supporters is weaning Americans
from the notion that government needs to run the education system,
which is a notion rooted in simpler times when most government was
local. Nowadays, even at the local level, government has become a
leviathan, often impervious to the efforts of the citizenry to
influence it.
</P>
<P>
   The control of money by parents, Friedman asserts, assures a
return to local control exerted by the actual consumers of
education.

 &HT;    Atlanta still stuck with traffic congestion
 &HT;    By David Goldberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The amount of time each Atlanta driver loses to
traffic jams jumped by nearly 20 percent from 1994 to 1996,
according to a national report on highway congestion.
</P>
<P>
   At 69 hours per driver each year, metro Atlanta ranks fourth in
the nation in time spent stuck in traffic, according to the Texas
Transportation Institute, which issues a widely followed report
each year. The study examined 70 urbanized areas, using statistics
from 1996, the most recent available.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta tied for seventh place on a ``congestion index,'' which
takes into account a range of factors _ from miles and duration of
traffic tie-ups to average speeds. With a score of 1 equaling
serious traffic problems, Atlanta scored 1.24, up from 1.18 in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of growth is so fast that merely to maintain congestion
at current levels would require 275 miles of new pavement each
year, if the region chose to rely on roads alone. That level of
road-building would cost more than $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ain't happening,'' said Frank Danchetz, chief engineer at
the Georgia Department of Transportation. Thirteen metro counties
are barred from spending federal money on new road projects because
the region lacks a plan to meet emissions standards.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation officials have come to grips with the fact that
Atlanta won't build its way out of congestion, Danchetz said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not for lack of trying. Over the 15 years from 1982 to
1996, the period covered by the report, Atlanta built more new
lanes on its freeways and arterial roads than all but the nation's
three largest metro areas. Atlanta was one of the few places whose
highway system grew at a faster rate than its population: 69
percent vs. 53 percent. The region now has more miles of freeway
lanes per 1,000 residents than any place but Dallas, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A key factor in Atlanta's inability to keep ahead of congestion
may be the spread-out nature of the region's development, said
David Schrank, co-author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more things spread out, the more driving that's
required,'' Schrank said.
</P>
<P>
   The Surface Transportation Policy Project, which advocates
alternatives to roads, did its own analysis of the data and found
that places that emphasized road-building ended up with the same or
worse congestion than those that didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no place that has successfully added lane miles and
kept ahead of the growth in congestion,'' said Barbara McCann, a
spokeswoman for the Washington-based group.

 &HT;    `Real conciliation,' healing just beginning, Tutu's daughter
says
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Truth and Reconciliation Commission report
detailing human-rights abuses during South Africa's apartheid era
reflects only the first step in a long healing process, Naomi Tutu
told an audience of 100 at Central State University Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work of South Africa is just beginning,'' Tutu said. ``The
real reconciliation starts now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, South African educator and program officer at the African
Gender Institute of the University of Cape Town, is the daughter of
Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, head of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission. The commission, set up a year after
1994's all-race elections ended white rule and drove ex-President
F.W. de Klerk from power, held hearings into apartheid-era
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   A 3,500-page report, delivered to President Nelson Mandela last
month, found the previous white minority government guilty of gross
human rights violations between 1960 and 1994. It also condemned
the Inkatha Freedom Party and the ruling African National Congress.
The report recommended that people who committed abuses and who did
not ask for amnesty be prosecuted. Prosecutors estimate the
country's already overburdened justice system faces six years of
investigations and trials, though some political leaders have
called for blanket amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu disagreed, saying to offer blanket amnesty now would be
unfair to those who stepped forward and admitted their crimes
before the commission, when an earlier amnesty offer was in effect.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of listening to the victims of the human-rights abuses
describe their torture. And she marveled at the spirit of those who
refused to give up the struggle for equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing I or my country could do to repay that level
of sacrifice,'' Tutu said. ``Except to ensure that these activities
never occur in our country again.''

CLINTON, JONES AGREE TO $850,000 SETTLEMENT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Paula Jones agreed Friday to
an $850,000 settlement of her sexual harassment lawsuit, litigation
that spawned a grand jury investigation of Clinton's sexual
misbehavior and a House impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement does not include an apology or admission of
wrongdoing from Clinton, conditions Jones sought during earlier
negotiations aimed at ending her lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paula is very pleased that it's finally over,'' said Bill
McMillan, an attorney who took over the talks when Jones' previous
legal team announced they planned to quit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit had been thrown out of court by a Little Rock
federal judge, but the Jones legal team was appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was reached as independent counsel Kenneth Starr
turned over more information to House impeachment investigators
about an encounter between Clinton and Kathleen Willey, who accused
the president of groping her outside the Oval Office. Sources said
Starr's filing does not accuse the president of an impeachable
offense.
</P>
<P>
   The delivery of the four boxes of documents comes less than a
week before Starr is to testify to House committee investigating
whether to recommend impeaching the president, a process that could
lead to his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, whose panel is
conducting the impeachment investigation, said the Willey material
_ locked in the House's Ford Office Building _ will not be
immediately available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until such time as the committee votes to release the
materials from executive session, House rules prohibit the
disclosure of information describing contents of the materials,''
Hyde said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment inquiry _ only the third involving a president
in U.S. history _ was prompted after Starr in early September sent
Congress 36 boxes of evidence from his investigation of Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation of the Lewinsky affair focused on the
president's denial _ made during a sworn deposition in the Jones
lawsuit _ that he and the intern had engaged in sexual relations
and that he urged her to mislead Jones' legal team.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' lawyers questioned the president on Jan. 17 after failing
to negotiate a settlement that would have resulted in a cash
payment from Clinton, along with an acknowledgment of wrongdoing
and an apology for his behavior during a meeting in Little Rock,
Ark., when he was governor.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who at the time was an Arkansas state employee, claimed
that her career was harmed when she rebuffed a crude sexual advance
from Clinton, during a meeting in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991.
Clinton vehemently denied the incident and said he could not recall
ever meeting Jones.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright ruled that
Jones' allegations, even if true, did not prove that she was forced
to work in a ``hostile environment'' as required in sexual
harassment cases and dismissed the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached Friday, which states that Clinton must pay
Jones within 60 days, requires them to ``unconditionally release
each other and representatives in connection with any claims''
stemming from the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to be an
admission of liability or wrongdoing by any party,'' said the
agreement signed by lawyers for the president and Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private attorney, Robert S. Bennett, said the deal was
clinched after McMillan became involved in the negotiations and
after Jones agreed to disassociate herself from a $1 million offer
made by New York businessman Abe Hirschfield, who promised her the
money if she would drop the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that nearly half of the $850,000
payment to Jones would come from Chubb Group Insurance. For a lump
sum of roughly $400,000, Chubb was buying out the president's
personal liability policy, which had been paying his Jones-related
legal bills, a legal source told AP.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Friday a federal grand jury being used by Starr
returned a 15-count indictment against presidential friend Webster
Hubbell accusing him of fraud and ``corruptly impeding''
investigations by banking regulators into the original allegations
stemming from the failed Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubbell case and the Willey allegations two of the remaining
matters in Starr's four-year, $40 million investigation of the
president, Hillary Clinton and their associates. In addition to
Whitewater and the president's sexual behavior, Starr has
investigated the possible misuse of FBI files and the firing of
White House travel office workers.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the sex-related charges, none of the issues have been
referred by Starr to Congress for consideration in the impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   By providing the Judiciary Committee with the documents on
Willey, Starr will be able to discuss the Willey case when he
testifies before the Judiciary Committee without violating grand
jury secrecy laws.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged meeting with Willey, but in his deposition
in the Jones lawsuit he denied any improper behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has secured the testimony of Linda Tripp, a former White
House secretary who told how she saw Willey as she left Clinton's
office after their encounter. Willey, whose hair and makeup were
mussed, adjusted her clothing and told Tripp that she and the
president had an intimate encounter, Tripp said, adding that Willey
did not appear upset.

BEST AND BRIGHTEST YOUNG PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE DEEP FLAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANIKA WHITE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Most students know the path to success in
school starts with hard work and good study skills.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the nation's brightest students say they earned
their A's another way: by cheating.
</P>
<P>
   That's what experts found when they surveyed 3,000 of the
700,000 students featured in this year's edition of Who's Who Among
American High School Students.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which was released Thursday, provides a peek into
the minds of those students who are traditionally expected to be
among the nation's future leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the students admitted cheating in school _ up
4 percent from last year and the highest percentage in the 29-year
history of the survey. More than half of those said cheating _ such
as borrowing a friend's homework or peeking at another student's
test paper _ was no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Tolerance is shrinking among the brightest teens. Forty-eight
percent said they are prejudiced against homosexuals. That's 19
percentage points more than last year's group. And 15 percent of
students said they are prejudiced against blacks and Hispanics _ up
8 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the students said the biggest problem facing their
generation today is a decline in social and moral values.
</P>
<P>
   The survey questionnaire, mailed randomly to students, did turn
up some good news.
</P>
<P>
   Students said they are drinking and driving less, and most
abstain from sex. Only 1 percent think violence is the most serious
problem facing their schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star asked eight Kansas City area high school
seniors on the Who's Who list their reactions to survey questions
dealing with cheating, prejudice and decline in values. None of the
students participated in the survey. Most denied cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Noblitt said the lack of values comes from students
being influenced by their friends and not their families. So when
peers deem cheating acceptable, she said, it can become
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of work to do,'' said Noblitt, 17, referring to
the heavy load of advanced classes and school and community
activities carried by many top students. ``It can be hard. And I
think it's the pressure that parents put on them to get into good
colleges'' that also contributes to cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Aylesi Bobo said time constraints and pressure to do well may
cause cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes if a student is very busy and may not be able to
study for a test, they may ask (a friend), `What was the answer to
that?' '' said Bobo, 17. ``It's something that may be needed right
at the moment to make sure that they don't get any lower (grade)
than they normally would have, because they've set a standard for
themselves as well as in the eyes of other people. Upholding that
standard is always the hard part.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the eight students admitted it can sometimes seem easier
to copy a friend's homework or peek at a neighbor's test paper.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Ford said such tricks are signs of youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe when we were freshmen, we cheated,'' Ford said. ``But as
we got older we knew what we had to do and we knew we didn't have
that much time to do it. We had to get prepared for college.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 18, said the increase in cheating is a sign of the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '90s it seems like everything is just corrupt,'' Ford
said. ``Everything has changed from the '80s. It seems like...it's
just going to get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Also getting worse, according to the survey, is prejudice toward
homosexuals, blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Students weren't asked why they were prejudiced against blacks
or Hispanics. But 47 percent said in response to a question about
affirmative action that such policies would make it more difficult
to get the jobs they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequent reason cited for prejudice against homosexuals
was religious or moral convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the area students agreed that gay people are disliked or
discriminated against by their peers.
</P>
<P>
   But they said racism was less prevalent than the survey
indicated. All of the students interviewed said their peers were
friends with people of different races, or at least accepted and
tolerated them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's more prejudice against homosexuals than
African-Americans or Hispanics,'' Noblitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Most students said violence against gays or open gay-bashing is
frowned upon, but behind-the-back jibes are common.
</P>
<P>
   Conor Kelly, 17, said many of his peers make jokes about gay
people, even though he doesn't know of any at his school.
</P>
<P>
   ``High school guys everywhere would be pretty afraid to admit
that they are gay because of the actions of their peers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Erica Smith said, ``We don't treat them any different'' at her
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people might make smart remarks about them to their
friends,'' said Smith, 17. ``It's subtle.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicolaus Church said his friends were tolerant of homosexuals,
even though he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any problem with different ethnic groups, but
I've been raised in a household that doesn't believe in
homosexuality,'' Church, 18, said. ``I'm a staunch believer that
it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Church said he doesn't openly criticize gays.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the survey are sad, said Juan Rangel, who lives
in Kansas City and is program director for the National Conference
for Community Injustice. They show that educating young people in
calculus and honors English isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Schools should teach about gender and sexuality, religion, race
and age oppression, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can learn the three R's,'' Rangel said. ``But there's a
real social injustice education that needs to be given as well.''

BORDER PATROL AGENT CHARGED WITH KILLING OF YOUNG MOTHER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE _ A U.S. Border Patrol agent has become the second
law officer charged this week in the 4-year-old murder of a young
mother, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County prosecutors said Randall Bruner Ledbetter, 30, a
former Brownsville police officer and currently a Border Patrol
agent in Douglas, Ariz., was arrested in Arizona late Thursday and
charged with murdering Laura Lugo.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Lugo, a 28-year-old Brownsville homemaker reported
missing in December 1994, was not known until this week when
officials confirmed through DNA testing that the remains of a woman
shot six times in the head belonged to Lugo. The skeleton had been
found in June 1995 in a field on the outskirts of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Lugo disappeared about three months after FBI agents returned
her 2-year-old son, who had been kidnapped in Mexico immediately
after his birth. The kidnapping case drew national attention after
Lugo told a bizarre story of being lured across the border by two
women who, with the help of a doctor in a Matamoros clinic, drugged
her, delivered her baby by Caesarean section against her will and
then stole the infant.
</P>
<P>
   The women were later convicted of child trafficking in Mexico
and received probation.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Brownsville police charged two suspects in the
murder case _ veteran Brownsville police Officer Roberto G.
Briseno, 44, and Janet Ramirez Lozano, a 28-year-old local woman
already jailed on welfare fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Ledbetter, the Border Patrol agent, had worked as a Brownsville
police officer from May 1989 to December 1996, and his family
members said he is a suspect because he helped investigate Lugo's
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he has any relationship to the murder. He's not
that kind of person,'' said Aubri Ledbetter, the officer's
15-year-old niece. ``He's very dedicated to his work, and would not
mess up like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Bill Hagan refused to discuss a
motive for Lugo's murder, or the alleged roles of the two officers,
but he said the homicide was unrelated to the earlier kidnapping. &QL;

LACK OF A US FOLLOW-UP PLAN IN IRAQ A CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Pentagon sent dozens more warjets to the
Persian Gulf Friday, even many people who support of bombing Iraq
questioned what the United States will do when the dust settles.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and congressional aides familiar with the region say
the CIA and other agencies have been working with Iraqi exiles and
defectors on plans to overthrow or kill Saddam Hussein. US agents
have even tried to enlist the help of intelligence services from
Arab countries, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   But current and former officials give widely differing accounts
of how effective the steps have been so far. Critics say that
despite millions of dollars, high-tech surveillance equipment and
the help of several defectors, US intelligence officers have had
difficulty penetrating Iraq, one of the most closed countries in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill and in think tanks, many experts in the Middle
East warn that Saddam Hussein is girding to withstand an attack,
then rebuild his weapons while appealing for an end to
international sanctions on his devastated country. With oil money
flowing in and trade embargos lifted, the specialists say, Hussein
could start acquiring the basic ingredients of chemical and
biological weapons unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the smoke clears, if his scientists are still alive,
he'll have the capability to produce chemical and biological
weapons or at least the ingredients for the weapons,'' said Barry
Posen, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology who specializes in military matters.
</P>
<P>
   Several critics of the US policy warned that the Clinton
administration, like the Bush administration, does not have a
long-range plan for dealing with an Iraq that is in ruins but still
ruled by Saddam Hussein. US officials have made gestures to the
Shiites who dominate southern Iraq and the Kurds in the north, but
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday that Washington
does not want to see Iraq broken into separate countries.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of what to do after an attack has gained urgency this week
because supporters and opponents of the Clinton administration say
the unrelenting rhetoric and military buildup leave less room for a
peaceful solution to the standoff than in February, when the
administration talked tough but used UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what other rabbit they have to pull out of a
hat,'' said a Congressional aide who is generally sympathetic to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those familiar with Iraq say that attacking military
bases and weapons factories with cruise missiles and hard-hitting
``bunker buster'' bombs will be relatively easy.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term political and undercover work that follows _
especially boosting the career of a moderate leader of Iraq _ will
be extraordinarily difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big missing piece of this whole picture: what are
the Americans going to do afterward?'' a bewildered European
diplomat said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   US officials also say that European and Arab allies will be
quick to turn on the United States if Iraq puts together compelling
television images _ true or not _ of civilians injured by blasts.
</P>
<P>
   In public, the Clinton administration will say only that it is
following the guidance of the ``Iraq Liberation Act,'' a law that
ensures money and training to oppostion groups. ``''Congress has
passed and the president has signed a law that allows more
intensive activity, and we will pursue that... we'll be working
even more actively with the opposition groups. That is our
policy,'' Albright said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the legislation calls for $2 million for Radio
Free Iraq, a clandestine broadcast service to the country. It also
calls for an unspecified amount for military equipment and training
for unnamed ``Iraqi democratic opposition organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   And the law gives the president until the end of the year to
select opposition groups that will receive aid. Eligible groups
``are committed to democratic values, to respect for human rights,
to peaceful relations with Iraq's neighbors, to maintaining Iraq's
territorial integrity, and to fostering cooperation among
democratic opponents of the Saddam Hussein regime,'' the
legislation says.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the law's proponents had in mind the Iraqi National
Congress, a dissident group with offices in Washington, London and
other cities. Supporters say the CIA initially promised to help the
group but backed out several years ago. Critics say the national
congress has been unable to effect change from outside Iraq and is
too dependent on US help.
</P>
<P>
   This year the administration has given no aid to the Iraqi
National Congress, said Laurie Mylroie, the editor of Iraq News,
who is close to the opposition group. ``They are going to do the
strike without being in touch without any significant members of
the Iraqi opposition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   MIT's Posen said no intelligence service has penetrated
Hussein's inner circle because he has managed to squelch the
opposition in the country. ``Every time he gets a whiff of a
conspiracy against him, he kills everyone even remotely associated
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The law also suggests that Clinton ask an international criminal
court to indict and prosecute ``Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi
officials who are responsible for crimes against humanity,
genocide, and other criminal violations of international law.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has been little public opposition in the United
States to the buildup. But administration officials say they are
keenly aware of the lessons of the US intervention in Somalia. The
public appeared apathetic _ until Marines were killed.
</P>
<P>
   A few academics, human rights groups and Arab-American leaders
have spoken out against an assault. ``It's completely
counterproductive,'' said Peter Pellett, a nutrition professor at
the University of Massachusetts who has led three research teams
from the Food and Agricultural Organization in Iraq since 1993.
``There's a great deal of macho feeling (in Washington) ... but
this is going to produce a great mess of people in the Arab world
who hate the United States.''

CHARTING THE FALL OF FINANCIAL WIZARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two months ago Myron S. Scholes made a sentimental journey to
the steel-manufacturing city of Hamilton, Ontario, to be honored as
a local boy made good.
</P>
<P>
   He had recently been awarded, with Robert C. Merton, the Nobel
Prize in economics, for breakthrough work in finding a way to value
risky financial investments known as options. Those formulas,
devised 25 years ago, made sophisticated investing more of a
science and less of an art, encouraging the growth of a host of new
securities markets. Many people made millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The trip home was one of a number of personal appearances that
amounted to, in Scholes' words, a victory lap. As the star guest at
a cocktail party in Hamilton, he described his trip to Sweden to
accept the Nobel and spoke fondly of the local people who had
looked after him in his youth. At the end of his reminiscences, he
nearly broke down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the crowd knew it. But the situation back home was
grave.
</P>
<P>
   The giant investment fund in which Scholes and Merton were
partners, Long-Term Capital Management, was teetering on the edge
of financial ruin. The fund had made a variety of big, risky bets
that had gone terribly wrong. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
would within a week organize a private takeover to prevent the
fund's outright failure and a rout in the world's financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the very thing that the two economists had taught
the world to understand _ managing investment risk _ proved to be
their undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that a fund with so much brain power could crash so
ignominiously is the decade's most powerful reminder yet of the
vast chasm between devising investment models and turning them into
profitable trades.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Merton, 54, nor Scholes, 57, agreed to comment for this
article. But interviews with dozens of friends, academics and
people close to Long-Term Capital paint a picture of two economists
who after years in academia were hired by some former students who
had made it big on Wall Street. The credibility of the two
economists made the firm something of a legend, attracting
heavyweight investors, lenders and trading partners. Scholes, who
had the charisma of an ace salesman, went on the road to help the
firm raise money.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the brilliance of their theory, it was based on an
assumption that the future performance of bonds would mirror their
past movements. When Russia decided to stop paying its debts in
August, investors in many markets panicked in a way that a
mathematical model could not have anticipated. And for all their
prominence as architects of the theories on which traders placed
their bets, Scholes and Merton in fact were not even directly
involved in the firm's trading; they were therefore somewhat
removed from the firm's daily operations. And they were ultimately
powerless to stop the fund from running aground. Suddenly, the
economists were each worth much less.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scholes is a natural salesman with a penchant for taking risks.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in 1941 in Timmins, a small mining town in northern
Ontario. His father, a dentist, moved the family south to Hamilton
when Myron and his little brother, David, were young. Myron met his
future wife, Bonnie Levy, at the public high school and received a
bachelor of arts from the local McMaster University in 1962. He
then headed to the University of Chicago, where a master's in
business was his stepping-stone to a doctorate in finance and
economics, awarded in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Even while pursuing an academic career, Scholes was an avid
investor. In an interview with The Ottawa Citizen a year ago, he
recalled a sobering experience speculating on stocks in the late
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would take my salary and invest it in the stock market,''
Scholes told the newspaper. ``Then I'd use the securities to borrow
from the bank to live. I always told my wife that we were
investing, not borrowing.''
</P>
<P>
   A bear market in the early '70s ravaged his stock portfolio.
With his loans coming due, he recalled, he pleaded with his banker
for an extension and got it. Stock prices recovered, allowing him
to repay his debts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the early '70s, he was on the faculty of the Sloan School at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Scholes elicits tales of
brilliance from colleagues and students at MIT, as well as the
University of Chicago, where he taught finance and banking from
1973 until 1983, and Stanford University, where he was a professor
in the business and law schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very charismatic,'' said Carol Levenson, a University
of Chicago graduate who is now editor of Gimme Credit, a high-grade
corporate bond investment advisory service in Chicago. ``He was so
far over our heads that nobody was smart enough to have any
interaction with him. We felt like we were studying with
Einstein.''
</P>
<P>
   At MIT, Scholes teamed up with Fischer Black, an economist who
had his own consulting firm. The two developed a formula for
valuing stock options, pioneering work that gave rise to an
explosion of futures contracts, options and other securities known
as derivatives, whose value is derived from some other instrument
like a stock or a bond. At the time, though, the men could not get
their work published.
</P>
<P>
   Merton, also an economist at MIT, examined their formula,
applied some high-powered mathematics and produced an elegant
elaboration that was quickly accepted for publication. Ordinarily,
the story would end there _ publication would have led the formula
to forever bear Merton's name.
</P>
<P>
   But Merton refused to publish his effort until the work of Black
and Scholes was published, which happened in 1973. So the formula
for placing a price on stock options is now known throughout the
financial world as Black-Scholes. This formula, with Merton's
elaboration, produced Nobel prizes for Scholes and Merton. Black
died in 1995, and the Nobel is not awarded after death.
</P>
<P>
   The work of the three economists ``created an entire new
industry,'' said Zvi Bodie, a finance professor at Boston
University and a textbook author with Merton. They devised a
trading strategy that could take the risk out of buying and selling
stock options. An investor with a stock option could offset the ups
and downs of its market price by buying and selling shares of the
underlying stock in a precise manner. The combination of options
and stock described by Black-Scholes is riskless, but also
theoretical, since it does not account for such things as
transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of devising this strategy, the economists
demonstrated how to put a market price on options, futures and
other derivatives. Once traders had that knowledge, they began
aggressively trading stock options on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, and began creating hundreds of other derivative
securities, like those backed by the stream of payments from home
loans.
</P>
<P>
   One of Scholes' former students marvels at the fact that the men
who came up with the options pricing formula did not sell it to the
private sector or trade with it themselves. While the formula made
their reputations, the three economists initially were content to
carry on their academic pursuits, consulting here and there, but
largely ignoring the sirens of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Merton looked for order all around him, whether in the stock
market or on the poker table. Known for his integrity and
brilliance, he has spent his career applying high-powered
mathematics to the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1944, Merton has had a lifelong fascination with numbers
and markets. By the age of 10, he was dabbling in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   He is the son of Robert K. Merton, a renowned professor at
Columbia University, who founded the sociology of science and
coined such phrases as deviant behavior, self-fulfilling prophecy
and role model. Robert C. Merton and two sisters, Stephanie and
Vanessa, grew up in the Westchester County town of
Hastings-on-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   The young Merton received an undergraduate degree in
mathematical engineering from Columbia and pursued mathematics
studies at the California Institute of Technology. But his interest
in stocks and other securities led him to drop mathematics in favor
of economics. The idea was to apply the mathematical machinery he
had mastered to complex situations.
</P>
<P>
   Because his background was not in economics, several graduate
schools rejected him. MIT accepted him in 1967 only after Harold
Freeman, a statistician and the only member of the economics
department without a Ph.D., intervened on his behalf after taking
note of the recommendations from impressive mathematicians.
</P>
<P>
   There Merton quickly hooked up with Paul A. Samuelson to work on
pricing financial securities. Samuelson, America's first Nobel
laureate in economics and the leader of the university's economics
department, said, ``Bob was one of the best graduate students we've
ever had and one of the youngest people we have ever tenured.''
Samuelson _ who pioneered the application of mathematics to
economic analysis _ added: ``Bob and I were working on some of the
same problems. One of the joys of teaching was to watch him surpass
my work.''
</P>
<P>
   After earning a Ph.D. in economics, Merton taught at MIT's
business school, where Scholes had been appointed assistant
professor of finance after leaving the University of Chicago. Among
others, Merton taught Lawrence Hilibrand, David Mullins and Eric
Rosenfeld. All of them would later become partners of Long-Term
Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Merton and Scholes did research on options pricing and other
projects at MIT, and became close friends. They also did some
consulting, including a project for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette to
develop models for pricing options for the over-the-counter market
and for the new Chicago Board Options Exchange. They even had a
joint mutual fund venture in the mid-1970s. It was not ``a
commercial success,'' Merton said last year, but ``a broadening
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two economists, Scholes is clearly the extrovert and
loves telling jokes and stories. Unlike many in academia, he does
not take himself too seriously. Friends say he would be more likely
to be mistaken for a salesman than an academic.
</P>
<P>
   Scholes can also be impetuous. Richard Roll, Allstate chair of
finance at the Anderson School at UCLA, recalled an incident in
1970, when Scholes spoke at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh. ``I'd
just bought a new motorcycle,'' Roll said. ``He wanted to get on it
to see how it felt to drive. I said, `Wait a minute, that's a big
engine there,' and before I knew it he had laid rubber, hit a curb
and landed in my neighbor's yard in a mangled heap.'' Later that
afternoon, Scholes sprained his ankle diving into his friend's
swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Merton, who built cars and drag-raced in his youth, spends his
spare time playing poker _ so seriously, says a colleague, that he
tries to throw off his opponents by looking into a light bulb to
constrict his pupils before playing his cards. Good players are
said to be able to determine by the dilation of their opponents'
eyes whether their cards are a blessing or a curse.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ideas of Scholes and Merton had an immense influence on Wall
Street. Still, the two economists did not work for a big investment
firm until late in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Marrying top economists to top traders was the idea of John W.
Meriwether, a managing director of Salomon Brothers in the 1980s
and the leader of the firm's bond arbitrage group. In 1988, one of
Meriwether's lieutenants, Rosenfeld, helped bring Merton to Salomon
as a consultant to John Gutfreund, then the chairman. Merton, who
also moved from MIT to Harvard University that year, provided
advice on business matters and changes in global financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   While Merton remained at Harvard full-time, Scholes took a
sabbatical from Stanford two years later to join Salomon as a
senior adviser to the bond arbitrage group, a group that had had
great success. Although Scholes had met Meriwether socially, it was
Rosenfeld who persuaded the academic to come to Salomon. Scholes
subsequently became a managing director.
</P>
<P>
   He worked not on trading strategy but on a problem the firm had:
Salomon's management was disturbed that it was losing derivatives
trades to rival firms. The reason? Some competitors _ such as J.P.
Morgan and American International Group _ had top ratings from the
big credit rating agencies; Salomon did not. A top-notch rating
provides comfort since one of the biggest risks in a derivatives
trade is that the firm entering into the transaction will not be
solvent or able to meet its financial obligations when the contract
expires.
</P>
<P>
   Over about two years, Scholes figured out a way to use some of
Salomon's capital for a separate subsidiary that landed a top
rating from the agencies. The stamp of approval cleared the way for
a greatly expanded derivatives business at Salomon.
</P>
<P>
   Scholes was also interested in identifying tax strategies. He
scoured the world for ways to turn an investment that generated
income into a capital gain, since gains are taxed at a lower rate
than income. He also looked for ways to turn pre-tax losses into
after-tax profits. ``He saw that as a new frontier,'' said a
partner at a rival Wall Street firm who recalled discussing the
strategies with him. ``By sheer dint of his brilliance, he could be
in a position to take advantage of tax loopholes or create some
himself that would open up vast opportunities even if the trades
didn't look so profitable on the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   After a scandal involving fraudulent bids for Treasury bonds in
1991, Meriwether and other top executives resigned from Salomon.
Three years later, when Meriwether started his own firm, Long-Term
Capital in Greenwich, Conn., Scholes and Merton joined him as
founding partners.
</P>
<P>
   Some friends of Scholes' noticed his growing affluence. ``He led
a higher lifestyle, the vacation houses, the cars he drove,'' said
a friend who spoke only on the condition that he not be identified.
``There were changes when he went to Salomon that were magnified
when he went to Greenwich.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholes was divorced from his wife, Bonnie, with whom he has two
daughters, in 1990. He married Jan Blaustein, a California lawyer,
in New York in September. The couple live in Greenwich in a white
clapboard house overlooking Long Island Sound. He also maintains a
home in Palo Alto, Calif., and a vacation retreat in Park City,
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Merton's say that his lifestyle appeared to change
little after his Wall Street endeavors, even when Long-Term Capital
was riding high and raking in profits. Merton was separated two
years ago from his wife, whom he met just before he turned 17, and
with whom he has three grown children.
</P>
<P>
   In Long-Term Capital's early days, Scholes acted as a salesman,
meeting with potential clients. ``When they first started out, he
was instrumental in helping them raise funds, go out on the road,''
said Matthew Richardson, associate professor of finance at the
Stern School of New York University and a research assistant to
Scholes at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Scholes was a natural. ``Myron is always
talking,'' said Roll, the professor of finance at UCLA. ``If you
met him on the street, the last thing you'd think was he won the
Nobel Prize for academic research.'' In just a few months, Scholes
and others raised $1 billion for the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Once the money was in hand, however, Scholes became less active
in day-to-day operations. He did not sit on the trading desk, but
in the back of Long-Term's offices, contemplating the big picture.
In the last couple of years he and Merton had been studying ways to
expand into other businesses, like managing money for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Merton was even more distanced than Scholes
from the fund's daily operations, venturing to Greenwich from his
office at Harvard once every two weeks or so. Often, his
contributions to the firm's operations were made by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Many outsiders have assumed that the economic models used by
Long-Term Capital to identify trading opportunities were the
creation of Merton and Scholes. But even there, the academics did
not dominate. People close to the fund said that while Scholes and
Merton laid the foundation for the models through their early work,
most of the refinements were done by the traders, who also
determined how much in securities to buy and when to sell.
</P>
<P>
   As any academic will attest, implementing investment models is
far different from creating them. The Black-Scholes option-pricing
model, as extended by Merton, is a theory based on assumptions that
stock and other trades can be executed without cost and _ crucial
to the fall of Long-Term Capital _ that the volatility of stocks
and bonds can be known from their past movements.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected events in the real world _ like Russia's decision in
August to stop paying its debts _ can wreak havoc on these models.
In fact, the spread in prices between similar securities rose to
three times their historical levels after the Russian debt
moratorium. Long-Term Capital had made bets that these spreads
would ultimately narrow; the fact that they widened caused giant
losses.

CIVIL RIGHTS STILL TOP ISSUE, KENNEDY TELLS ADL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Declaring that ``civil rights is still the unfinished
business of America,'' US Senator Edward M. Kennedy Friday outlined
an ambitious rights agenda for the new Congress _ which he
predicted would be slightly more liberal and significantly less
confrontational because of Republican defeats in the recent
elections and the departure of House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, addressing delegates to the national conference of the
Anti-Defamation League, said passage of hate-crime laws is
particularly necessary in the aftermath of the murders of James
Byrd, a black man dragged to death in Texas, and Matthew Shepard, a
gay youth beaten to death in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   These murders ``shocked the country and showed us strong action
still is needed,'' Kennedy said, asserting that the US Deparment of
Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ``must be available
to assist local authorities ... whenever that assistance is
requested.''
</P>
<P>
   Other legislative priorities, Kennedy said, should be protecting
the rights of gays and lesbians in the workplace, changing laws
that now require sudden suspensions of benefits to disabled people
when they take jobs, and curbing traffic stops that may be made by
police on the basis of race or ethnicity. He also endorsed a
proposal by US Representative John Conyers, Democrat of Michigan,
to monitor and analyze the demographics of traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stops are a significant civil rights issue, and an
important quality of life issue,'' Kennedy said. Blacks and Latinos
``should be free to drive ... without fear of being stopped and
harassed by police when their only offense is not DWI, but DWB _
driving while black, or driving while brown.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy spoke, David Newhouse presented the Norman
Newhouse Human Relations Communications Award to The Boston Globe
for ``working for harmony and understanding in this community...''
Norman Newhouse was a longtime Anti-Defamation League activist.
David Newhouse is his son.
</P>
<P>
   Both Globe editor Matthew V. Storin, who accepted the award for
the newspaper, and Senator Kennedy, used the occasion to praise
Leonard Zakim, New England regional director of the ADL, who is
battling cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anyone in this community who is more
important to the community than Lenny Zakim,'' Storin said. ``If
getting this award means that we stand for what he stands for, then
it is all the more an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy called Zakim, who has been involved in Democratic Party
policy-making since the 1980s ``a national treasurer (who) has
shown extraordinary courage in speaking out'' on issues of racism
and anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenny has been an important part of my work and life in the
Senate,'' Kennedy said. ``He is a womderful friend and pre-eminent
leader both to the Jewish community and the civil rights
community.''

 UNDATED: giant losses. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Merton and Scholes were not responsible for building
Long-Term Capital's models, they did serve as a sounding board for
the fund's traders. As members of the firm's risk management
committee _ all the partners were _ they questioned the trades and
discussed the size of various positions. The risk management
committee met every Tuesday, and Merton sometimes communicated by
conference call from Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Scholes, who serves on the board of several mutual funds in the
American Century family, is described as always asking the most
demanding questions at board meetings there. Randall Merk, managing
director for fixed-income investing at American Century, said:
``He'd make us think outside the box, think of things that might
have gone wrong that you might not have thought of before. Have you
thought of all the wild cards, if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   According to people close to Long-Term Capital, Scholes and
Merton posed such questions to their partners. For instance, they
asked about the size of specific trades and whether getting out of
them would be difficult if investors fled certain markets for
safety.
</P>
<P>
   But operations like Long-Term Capital Management do not run by
consensus. Disagreements over policy are a way of life. So even if
the economists asked tough questions, it is likely that they got
reasonable answers in return. After all, if a trader has taken a
position, he ought to know how to defend it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bit surprising that the firm had risk management
meetings only once a week. For a firm its size, daily meetings
would be more typical. But having made so much money for so long,
the partners could easily have been lulled into complacency.
</P>
<P>
   The first realization that they were in trouble came in June,
when the fund lost 15 percent of its value. Emerging markets were
starting to look dicey; in mid-June, the Russian government
canceled two if its planned debt sales owing to lack of investor
interest. July was quiet. Then, on Aug. 14, disaster struck.
Markets everywhere froze as it became clear that Russia was about
to default on its debt.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the firm's partners were out of the office, either on
vacation or away on business. Meriwether was on a plane to China,
Rosenfeld was on Nantucket, Mass. Hilibrand was out. Scholes was in
the office, part of a skeleton crew who watched in horror as
markets around the world tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   According to people close to the firm, the partners returned to
Greenwich as soon as they could. Their capital was dwindling fast,
and there was no sign of relief from the markets. Nevertheless, the
traders continued to believe that their positions were sound and
would ultimately be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long, however, for them to realize that the
large size of their positions presented an insurmountable problem
in markets seized up by fear of risk. But no one at the firm
realized how many other firms across Wall Street had mimicked the
broad outline of Long-Term's trades for their own accounts. As a
result, when Long-Term tried to liquidate some positions to raise
capital, it found few buyers. Everyone on the Street was trying to
sell at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A series of events occurred that were outside the norm,'' said
Martin Gruber, Nomura professor of finance at NYU's Stern School
and a friend of both men. ``These catastrophes happen. The fault
isn't with the models.'' Rather, it was what can be called an
organizational flaw: the firm had simply become too big.
</P>
<P>
   The Long-Term partners decided that raising money was the only
way out of the mess. They wanted more cash not to abandon their
trades _ though they did jettison some of what they called
nonessential positions _ but to see their bets through, according
to people close to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh money failed to materialize in an acceptable form, despite
talks with several investment firms and such moneyed investors as
Warren Buffett and George Soros. Unable to meet calls for more
collateral from its trading partners, Long-Term sought help from
the Federal Reserve and a Wall Street consortium. To save their
fund, the partners sold 90 percent of their equity to a group of
banks and brokerage firms for $3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The personal fortunes of the partners were immediately wiped
out. Some partners, having borrowed to invest in their firm, are
facing bankruptcy; Scholes and Merton are not.
</P>
<P>
   While Long-Term's near collapse does not look good on a resume,
the economists remain well regarded in academia and will surely be
in demand as consultants. Scholes had hoped to set up a foundation
and retreat somewhat from the firm. Those plans are on hold now.
</P>
<P>
   What Merton and Scholes are learning first hand is just how
humbling markets can be. It is a lesson that investors repeatedly
learn but always manage to forget.

SADDAM HAS POWER TO END THIS CRISIS, CLINTON SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stepping up the pressure on Saddam Hussein,
President Clinton said Friday the only way to avoid U.S. military
strikes is for the Iraqi dictator to take immediate steps to
co-operate with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than three months the United States and the
international community have very patiently sought a diplomatic
solution to Iraq's decision to end all of its cooperation with the
U.N. weapons inspectors,'' Clinton said in remarks before a bill
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi dictator ``has it within his hands to end this crisis
now'' by allowing the U.N. inspectors full access to sites
suspected of housing weapons of mass destruction, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   While the current conflict appears reminiscent of recent
stand-offs between the United States and Iraq, the president
stressed that this time Saddam was even more isolated. He noted
that even many of Iraq's Arab neighbors have refused to come to
Saddam's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton statement was part of a tough talking campaign by key
U.S. officials to make clear that the time for diplomatic solutions
was running out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has a simple choice: reverse course or face the
consequences,'' said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, Saddam signaled that he might be willing to back
down on the inspectors if the U.N. was willing to lift economic
sanctions against his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq will accept positively any initiative that meets these
just and balanced demands, '' he said, according to reports by the
Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   But administration spokesman Joe Lockhart quickly dismissed the
proposal as ``nothing new.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talking about an initiative based on his terms and based
on his conditions,'' said Lockhart.``And the message that he needs
to get is this has to be done based on the conditions and terms of
the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Iraq's goal is to get economic sanctions
lifted while continuing to build chemical or even nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Security Council and the world have made it crystal clear
now that this is unacceptable and that none of us can tolerate an
Iraq free to develop weapons of mass destruction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the United Nations the Security Council met to
consider recommendations from Russia, China and France that the
international body broker a solution to the latest conflict.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is also scheduled to leave Saturday for the
Asian economic forum in Malaysia, an indication that military
action may not be immediately forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the United States continued to send more jet
fighters, heavy bombers, ships and ground forces to the Persian
Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met for about two hours Friday with Albright,
Defense Secretary William Cohen, and National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger, talking about the military option.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also said that Clinton called Mideast allies, the crown
prince in Saudi Arabia, the Emir of Kuwait and talked to U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   A number of lawmakers, including Pennsylvania Republican Sen.
Arlen Specter, have said that the president should obtain
congressional approval before moving against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that the president has the constitutional
authority to act but has consulted with members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has talked to outgoing House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., Lockhart said, but not to Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La.,
whom Republicans are expected to elect succeed Gingrich next week.
</P>
<P>
   One lawmaker with strong credentials on foreign policy, Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., has suggested that if the U.S. launches a
military campaign against Iraq the goal should be to kill Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the purpose of any military action would be to
``degrade (Saddam's) capacity to develop and deliver weapons of
mass destruction and to degrade his ability to threaten his
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time she said, ``we would look forward to working
with a post-Saddam regime, and we'll be working even more actively
with the opposition groups. That is our policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In an acknowledgment of possible military action and potential
retaliation, the state Department warned Americans worldwide to
maintain a ``high level of vigilance.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department also suggested Americans traveling abroad,
``vary routes and times for all required travel and treat mail from
unfamiliar sources with suspicion.'' &QL;

KENNEDY NONCOMMITTAL ABOUT KERRY PRESIDENTIAL TRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If US Senator John F. Kerry decides to run for
president, he can't automatically count on the support of his
Senate colleague, Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who has a close relationship with President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore and who is also friendly with House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, another might-be candidate, took a
wait-and-see attitude Friday when asked whether he would back Kerry
if he seeks the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will make whatever decision down the road based upon, you
know, conversations, what candidates are going to be in the race,''
said Kennedy after a luncheon speech to the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who travels to New Hampshire to speak to the Portsmouth
Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday as part of his presidential
exploration, said Friday he saw nothing unusual about Kennedy's
noncommital stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the most normal thing in the world,'' Kerry said. ``I
wouldn't expect Kennedy to say anything else. I would say the same
things in the same circumstances until somebody had made up their
mind and come to the person and asked them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who says he hopes to decide whether to run by ``the turn
of the year,'' said he plans to speak with Kennedy in the near
future about his potential candidacy. Kerry conceded that if he
does run, and Kennedy doesn't support him, it would harm his
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having Ted Kennedy's support would be important,''
Kerry said. ``To have your own colleagues not support you in a
race. ... I think it would be important to have that kind of
support.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kerry's inner circle, there has been some worry that the
senior senator, whose own presidential hopes are now a thing of the
past, may not be terribly enthusiastic about seeing a junior
colleague vault beyond him into the national limelight.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy has other obvious pressures as he decides what to
do. One individual close to Kennedy, who asked not to be
identified, said the president had personally asked Kennedy to
support Gore in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has asked him to be with Gore,'' the Kennedy
confidante said. ``Anyone who is tight with the administration the
way Kennedy is is going to be with Gore. Or maybe he'll be sort of
neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about whether he would back Kerry, Kennedy seemed
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own view is that I don't know what John Kerry's plans are
going to be,'' Kennedy replied. ``I'm always glad to get a chance
to visit with him.''
</P>
<P>
   After a conversation between the two senators, Kennedy called
later in the afternoon to praise _ but still not to endorse _
Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enormous respect for him,'' Kennedy said. ``He has done
a brilliant job as a senator, and I think he would do an
outstanding job as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Neverthless, Kennedy said he'd have to wait and consider before
offering his support for a Kerry presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will have to talk to him about his plans, and I look forward
to that discussion,'' Kennedy said. ``When he makes a final
judgment, I think he ought to make it on the basis of what he feels
he can provide for the party and the country.''

ACK OF A US FOLLOW-UP PLAN IN IRAQ A CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Pentagon sent dozens more warjets to the
Persian Gulf Friday, even many people who support of bombing Iraq
questioned what the United States will do when the dust settles.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and congressional aides familiar with the region say
the CIA and other agencies have been working with Iraqi exiles and
defectors on plans to overthrow or kill Saddam Hussein. US agents
have even tried to enlist the help of intelligence services from
Arab countries, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   But current and former officials give widely differing accounts
of how effective the steps have been so far. Critics say that
despite millions of dollars, high-tech surveillance equipment and
the help of several defectors, US intelligence officers have had
difficulty penetrating Iraq, one of the most closed countries in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill and in think tanks, many experts in the Middle
East warn that Saddam Hussein is girding to withstand an attack,
then rebuild his weapons while appealing for an end to
international sanctions on his devastated country. With oil money
flowing in and trade embargos lifted, the specialists say, Hussein
could start acquiring the basic ingredients of chemical and
biological weapons unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the smoke clears, if his scientists are still alive,
he'll have the capability to produce chemical and biological
weapons or at least the ingredients for the weapons,'' said Barry
Posen, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology who specializes in military matters.
</P>
<P>
   Several critics of the US policy warned that the Clinton
administration, like the Bush administration, does not have a
long-range plan for dealing with an Iraq that is in ruins but still
ruled by Saddam Hussein. US officials have made gestures to the
Shiites who dominate southern Iraq and the Kurds in the north, but
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday that Washington
does not want to see Iraq broken into separate countries.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of what to do after an attack has gained urgency this week
because supporters and opponents of the Clinton administration say
the unrelenting rhetoric and military buildup leave less room for a
peaceful solution to the standoff than in February, when the
administration talked tough but used UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what other rabbit they have to pull out of a
hat,'' said a Congressional aide who is generally sympathetic to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those familiar with Iraq say that attacking military
bases and weapons factories with cruise missiles and hard-hitting
``bunker buster'' bombs will be relatively easy.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term political and undercover work that follows _
especially boosting the career of a moderate leader of Iraq _ will
be extraordinarily difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big missing piece of this whole picture: what are
the Americans going to do afterward?'' a bewildered European
diplomat said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   US officials also say that European and Arab allies will be
quick to turn on the United States if Iraq puts together compelling
television images _ true or not _ of civilians injured by blasts.
</P>
<P>
   In public, the Clinton administration will say only that it is
following the guidance of the ``Iraq Liberation Act,'' a law that
ensures money and training to oppostion groups. ``''Congress has
passed and the president has signed a law that allows more
intensive activity, and we will pursue that... we'll be working
even more actively with the opposition groups. That is our
policy,'' Albright said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the legislation calls for $2 million for Radio
Free Iraq, a clandestine broadcast service to the country. It also
calls for an unspecified amount for military equipment and training
for unnamed ``Iraqi democratic opposition organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   And the law gives the president until the end of the year to
select opposition groups that will receive aid. Eligible groups
``are committed to democratic values, to respect for human rights,
to peaceful relations with Iraq's neighbors, to maintaining Iraq's
territorial integrity, and to fostering cooperation among
democratic opponents of the Saddam Hussein regime,'' the
legislation says.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the law's proponents had in mind the Iraqi National
Congress, a dissident group with offices in Washington, London and
other cities. Supporters say the CIA initially promised to help the
group but backed out several years ago. Critics say the national
congress has been unable to effect change from outside Iraq and is
too dependent on US help.
</P>
<P>
   This year the administration has given no aid to the Iraqi
National Congress, said Laurie Mylroie, the editor of Iraq News,
who is close to the opposition group. ``They are going to do the
strike without being in touch without any significant members of
the Iraqi opposition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   MIT's Posen said no intelligence service has penetrated
Hussein's inner circle because he has managed to squelch the
opposition in the country. ``Every time he gets a whiff of a
conspiracy against him, he kills everyone even remotely associated
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The law also suggests that Clinton ask an international criminal
court to indict and prosecute ``Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi
officials who are responsible for crimes against humanity,
genocide, and other criminal violations of international law.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has been little public opposition in the United
States to the buildup. But administration officials say they are
keenly aware of the lessons of the US intervention in Somalia. The
public appeared apathetic _ until Marines were killed.
</P>
<P>
   A few academics, human rights groups and Arab-American leaders
have spoken out against an assault. ``It's completely
counterproductive,'' said Peter Pellett, a nutrition professor at
the University of Massachusetts who has led three research teams
from the Food and Agricultural Organization in Iraq since 1993.
``There's a great deal of macho feeling (in Washington) ... but
this is going to produce a great mess of people in the Arab world
who hate the United States.''

TOBACCO COMPANIES AND 8 STATES IN TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., N.Y., N.C., N.D., Okla., Pa., Wash.)   (bl)  
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States' four biggest cigarette makers and officials
of eight states have reached agreement on the outlines of a
settlement designed to resolve all remaining state claims over
health costs related to smoking, attorneys general and industry
lawyers involved in the talks said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, drafted to cover the 46 states that have not already
made individual settlements with the industry, would cost the
tobacco companies $206 billion over 25 years and would restrict
cigarette advertising and marketing. It would eliminate the
industry's most significant financial and legal threat: state suits
seeking to recover the Medicaid costs of treating people with
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would cost the industry far less than a $368.5 billion
agreement with state attorneys general last year that eventually
grew into a $516 billion bill in Congress under which the federal
government would also have gained regulatory authority over
nicotine. Unlike the earlier state proposal, however, this new plan
does not shield tobacco companies from personal and class-action
liability suits.
</P>
<P>
   If companies finance the plan's cost by raising cigarette
prices, the cost of a pack would increase 35 cents over the next
five years. Some makers, however, for competitive reasons, may
choose to raise prices less and absorb the cost themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which is expected to be completed Saturday and
announced as early as Monday, the producers have agreed to an array
of marketing restrictions such as a ban on billboard and transit
advertisements as well as the sale of clothing and merchandise with
brand logos.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for cigarette makers to pay $1.45
billion over the next five years to finance smoking-cessation
programs and advertisements to counter underage tobacco use.
Producers will pay an additional $25 million a year over the next
decade to underwrite a foundation that will research ways to reduce
youth smoking and legally pledge that they will not market to those
under 18.
</P>
<P>
   The producers participating in the plan are Philip Morris Cos.;
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.;
Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of Loews Corp., and Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC. The eight
states involved are California, Colorado, New York, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Washington.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have reached an agreement on all the issues,'' said
Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire said in a
telephone interview. ``We are in the final drafting stage and hope
to have a settlement sometime Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute disputes could delay or derail the settlement but
those involved said they did not consider such problems likely.
Once the eight states and the companies agree, the plan will be
sent to officials of the other 38 states that have lawsuits pending
or have yet to file one. Those states will have about one week to
join; under its current terms, the plan would take effect once
states representing about 80 percent of the nation's Medicaid
population sign on.
</P>
<P>
   Because the plan is designed to be a national settlement, the
tobacco companies could withdraw if not enough states join. If
enough states join for the plan to take effect, but some states do
not participate, the cost of the plan would be reduced
proportionately.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry was first struck by state lawsuits seeking
to recover Medicaid funds spent treating smoking-related illnesses
in 1994. As anticipation of a final settlement grew over recent
weeks, the stocks of cigarette makers have risen on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the $206 billion proposal would represent the
largest settlement of civil lawsuits in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, it would effectively codify on a national level
the marketing and advertising concessions made by the tobacco
industry over the past year in settling smoking-related lawsuits
brought by four states _ Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas.
The national counter-advertising campaign and the new foundation
would also expand on those agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry lawyers agreed Friday that the slow-moving
talks, which have covered five months, had reached a final stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties have finished their negotiations and they are
reviewing final versions of the papers,'' said Arthur Golden, a
lawyer representing RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   The plan does not contain legal protections for cigarette makers
and does not require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also does not contain restrictions on fees for
plaintiffs' lawyers who were hired by state attorneys general to
pursue those claims, which are to be paid by the industry in
addition to the plan's costs and are expected to total billions
more. But the industry would not have to pay more than $500 million
in fees in any one year, a cigarette company lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general of the eight states involved in the talks
are expected to announce the plan in Washington, D.C., on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the remaining 38 states who either have pending
smoking-related lawsuits or have not filed such claims will then
have about a week to decide whether to join the settlement plan or
proceed with legal actions.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of those states are expected to join. But some
states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan and
Wisconsin, have previously pressed for stronger public health
provisions in the plan. And in recent days, officials of some
states have been discussing the possibility of taking a unified
stand in order to wring greater concessions from producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of us are very definitely undecided,'' said
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking advocates did not participate in crafting the
proposal and their reactions Friday varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we know about the agreement, the we more know it is
not a comprehensive national plan,'' said Matthew Myers, a lawyer
for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Myers and other anti-smoking advocates, who were far more
critical of the plan, said they were particularly concerned that
the public would only have a week to review it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregoire said she understood that the plan would come under
attack but added that attorneys general had a legal duty to measure
would could be achieved both inside and outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role was to decide whether the settlement could get as
much as we could achieve in the courtroom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lawyers said they will not finalize the agreement until
a specified number of states agree to the accord. They have
declined to disclose that figure but a document posted Friday by
the Arizona Republic on its Internet site and described by the
newspaper as a draft summary of the plan states that participating
states must account for at least 80 percent of the total settlement
for it to become final.
</P>
<P>
   Under a formula developed by the attorneys general, each state
will receive a portion of the settlement based on factors like its
percentage of the nation's Medicaid population. The plan's value
would also be proportionally reduced if it goes forward but some
states do not join it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The settlement plan, which follow five months of drawn-out talks
and missed deadlines, comes as something as anti-climax to a
lengthy national debate over smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the industry and state attorneys agreed to a $368.5
billion settlement proposal under which cigarette makers agreed to
marketing restrictions, to federal regulation of nicotine and to
other measures in return for legal protections against
smoking-related lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal mushroomed earlier this year in that $516 billion
tobacco bill sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. But the bill,
which would have raised the price of cigarettes by $1.10 cents a
pack and stripped-away the legal protections sought by producers,
ran into a maelstrom of industry opposition and collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a new round of settlement talks began five months
ago between industry officials and state aimed at reaching a new
agreement that would not require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   If it resolves the state claims, the industry would erase its
biggest legal challenge. But it continues to face lawsuits from
others like individual smokers, trade unions and foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, the participating states would receive about
the same amount of money as their share the $368.5 billion accord
that failed. But the proposal is not as rich as the $6.1 billion
settlement won in May by Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that settlement, producers also increased their
payments to Florida, Mississippi and Florida, bring the total of
the payments to the four settling states over 25 years to some $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Along with bans on billboard and transit ads, producers also
agree to refrain from using cartoon figures in ads, to bans on
sponsorship of youth-orientated sporting events and concerts and to
refrain from lobbying against state initiatives that make it more
difficult for underage smokers to buy cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, producers would be able to continue to
sponsor one sporting event using the brand name of a cigarette and
there would be no limits on sponsorships that utilize a cigarette
company's corporate name.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also does not provide for restrictions on
cigarette advertising in retail stories or in magazines and other
print media.

INTERNET IPO CENTER OF BIDDING FRENZY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even by the crazy standards of the Internet, it was out of this
world.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's obsession with Internet stocks reached new heights
Friday when investors bid up newly offered shares of TheGlobe.com,
a money-losing New York startup whose technology allows users to
set up pages on the World Wide Web for free. It was the hottest
initial public offering of stock in US history and.
</P>
<P>
   TheGlobe.com's 3.1 million public shares were initially priced
at $9 apiece. The price quickly shot up to $97 in morning trading,
before closing at $63 1/2. The closing price was still more than
seven times their asking price, making TheGlobe.com the biggest
one-day percentage gainer among IPOs in US history. It was only the
latest in a series of off-the-charts debuts for Internet-related
companies. ``This is the only game in town if you want to make a
quick buck. It's this or the lottery,'' said Richard J. Peterson of
Securities Data Corp. in Newark, N.J.. Such valuations ``violate
every type of traditional benchmarket we've used to gauge the worth
of a stock based on earnings or revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Internet companies, TheGlobe.com seems years away from
turning a profit. Shares of the latest Internet darling could
easily plunge if investors become wary of its meager financial
results.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year-old company lost $5.8 million in the first six
months of this year on revenue of $1.17 million and doesn't expect
to turn a profit anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   But some on Wall Street are valuing on-line companies as smart
bets over the long term. Risk-lovers note Internet success stories
like America Online Inc. and Yahoo! Inc., which also began in the
red.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, investors snapped up the first offering of
shares in EarthWeb Inc., an Internet company that provides
technical advice on line. In September, EBay Inc., an online
auction company, saw its shares more than double their first day
out.
</P>
<P>
   International Data Corp. analyst Paris Burstyn said the prices
only show that investors ``are more interested in politics than
value'' in their rush to gain an Internet stake.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, TheGlobe.com seems more like a hobbyist venture than a
company that finished Friday with a market valuation of &UR;  &LR; $622
million. (The company has no relationship to The Boston Globe.)
</P>
<P>
   TheGlobe.com's online services allow users to create their own
pages on the Web, and to participate in discussion groups with
names like ``Hot Tub Chat Room'' and ``Harmless Flirts.'' Other
offerings including weather forecasts, movie and music reviews,
games, and personals ads.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Users like Vince Indelicato, Jr., who lives near Warrenton,
W.Va., have created pages that display photos, offer links to
friends' pages, and play samples of songs like ``Rock Around the
Clock.'' Such offerings are known as ``online communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors include Tripod and GeoCities Inc., based in Santa
Monica.
</P>
<P>
   TheGlobe.com, which boasts two million members and counts recent
advertisers like J.Crew, Coca-Cola and Sony, says profit will
eventually come from adding more advertisers and charging for some
of its services.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts wonder if it will ever pay off. ``I haven't seen
any indication that they've figured out a way to monetize all the
traffic they get,'' says Ken Cassar, new media analyst at Jupiter
Communications LLC in New York. ``Thousands of people walk by my
apartment every day, but that doesn't guarantee revenue if I put up
a lemonade stand.''
</P>
<P>
   In its Securities and Exchange Commission filings, TheGlobe.com
says it will expand its 93-member staff. It was founded in 1995 by
a pair of Cornell University students named Todd V. Krizelman and
Stephan J. Paternot, now both 24, and co-chief executives. More
recently the company gained financial backing from elders like
venture capitalist Michael S. Egan, the company's chairman, and
Republic Industries chairman Wayne Huizenga, who became a director
of TheGlobe.com in July.

WOODWARD LAWYERS CITE JUDGE'S RULING IN FIGHTING DAMAGES CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The recently hired lawyers for British former au pair
Louise Woodward argued Friday that a judge's ruling that reduced
her second-degree murder conviction in the death of 8-month-old
Matthew Eappen supports their claim that she did not engage in
``willful, wanton and reckless conduct'' when she shook the baby to
death.
</P>
<P>
   In their first detailed filing Friday in federal court _ where
the parents of Matthew Eappen are suing Woodward for their son's
wrongful death _ Woodward's lawyers rely on the words of Middlesex
Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel to make their case that the
Eappens are not entitled to punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   After a jury convicted Woodward in the February 1997 death of
Matthew, Zobel reduced the verdict to involuntary manslaughter and
sentenced Woodward to the time she had served awaiting trial _ 279
days. Zobel's action was upheld by the state Supreme Judicial Court
in June, the same day the Eappens filed their wrongful death suit
in US District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, who has returned to her native England, ignored the
lawsuit until this month when she hired Boston lawyers. They have
since asked US District Judge William G. Young to remove the
default that he entered in July and to allow them to challenge the
Eappens' right to collect punitive damages. Young has scheduled a
hearing for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In an 11-page memorandum filed late Friday in federal court, the
attorneys, John P. Ryan and Myles W. McDonough, say Zobel's finding
that Woodward's actions ``were characterized by confusion,
inexperience, frustration, immaturity and some anger, but not
malice,'' support their view that she did not engage in ``willful,
wanton or reckless'' conduct, the standard for awarding punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Zobel's view of the evidence in the criminal proceedings
is certainly sufficient to demonstrate that there is a genuine
issue as to whether Woodward's conduct constituted ordinary
negligence,'' her lawyers argue.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in Zobel's decision, they note, do the words ``willful,
wanton or reckless'' appear. ``To the contrary, the trial court's
analysis makes references to `confusion, fright, and bad judgment,
rather than rage or malice,''' they wrote.

   INTERNET-MUSIC (Undated) _ A specter is haunting the music
business: the prospect of listeners getting the music they want
directly from the Internet, free of charge. Right now, all it takes
to make a recording executive nervous is the mention of MP3, a
powerful piece of software that allows users to zap music all over
the Internet, unchecked and untithed. For utopians, MP3 is a way to
liberate music from the clutches of gatekeepers and profiteers, and
perhaps to return music to its intangible essence. But the
recording business sees MP3 as a Pandora's box of copyright
destruction, unleashing anarchy and piracy while robbing musicians
of royalties and record labels of capital. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).

After Arabia,'' more or less introduced the actor to the United
States. It's unlikely, however, that viewers also caught the
fleeting presence of a younger Fiennes, Joseph, playing Ralph's
onscreen brother. Six years, and many more substantial parts later,
Joseph Fiennes 28, is emerging as a name to reckon with on his own.
His role next month as Gwyneth Paltrow's Bardic suitor in
``Shakespeare in Love'' is expected to clinch him as a separate but
equal talent to that of his Tony-winning, Oscar-nominated brother.

   ZAILLIAN-SCREENWRITER (Hollywood) _ Ask a studio mogul, top
producer or agent for the names of the superior screenwriters in
Hollywood, and Steven Zaillian will be near the top of the list.
``He's one of the two or three best screenwriters in town, and I'm
being liberal when I say that,'' said Joe Roth, chairman of Walt
Disney Studios, which made ``A Civil Action,'' the newest film
written and directed by Zaillian. ``There's an economy and clarity
to his writing that's always entertaining.'' Zaillian, who won an
Academy Award for his adaptation of ``Schindler's List,'' is a
surprisingly diffident, almost modest and entirely un-Hollywood
figure. In contrast to other screenwriters, who may earn lavish
sums but complain all the way to the bank about their plight at the
hands of producers, stars and executives, Zaillian, 45, shrugs off
any problems he has faced over his 18-year career. By Bernard
Weinraub. (Moved).

   STUDIOS-HOLLYWOOD-FILMS (Hollywood) _ The holiday season is a
scary time in Hollywood. The season that begins just before
Thanksgiving and ends with the New Year is the busiest time of
moviegoing in the nation. It's also when studios and independent
companies roll the dice and release films whose box office tally
can spell the difference between success or failure for the year.
(The nearly 100 films released over the next six weeks will account
for as much as 20 percent of the 1998 box office). By Bernard
Weinraub. (Moved).

<P>
   HOME-VIDEO-THEATER (Undated) _ Hardcore videophiles are a
suffering lot. Determined to re-create in their homes an experience
akin to that of the local movie theater _ minus the sticky floor
and ringing cell phones _ these enthusiasts can spend $100,000 or
more pursuing cutting-edge equipment that promises to deliver the
nuance and impact of celluloid. They log endless hours on the World
Wide Web debating the merits of the latest wide-screen projector or
surround-sound processor, and they pay technicians hundreds of
dollars to calibrate their televisions so the image is just so. By
Rob Sabin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FLEMING-FILMS (Undated) _ In 1938, the director Victor Fleming
made a movie about a Kansas farm girl who gets swept into the air
and enters a dizzying world of excitement and heartbreak. It was
called ``Test Pilot,'' it starred Myrna Loy, Clark Gable and
Spencer Tracy, and it was an enormous hit. Later that year, he took
over a troubled production about another Kansas farm girl who gets
swept into the air and enters a dizzying world of excitement and
heartbreak. It was called ``The Wizard of Oz,'' it starred Judy
Garland, Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr, and it failed to recoup its
costs. Fleming's career is a study in the vagaries of movie
history. By Michael Sragow. (Moved).

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-FAMILY-FILMS (Hollywood) _ Like children elbowing one
another for their parents' attention, Hollywood studios are vying
for the holiday box office. The number of films targeting family
audiences has set off the most intense competition among studios in
years. The first wave _ two animated films, ``The Rugrats Movie''
and ``A Bug's Life,'' and the sequel ``Babe: Pig in the City'' _
will open around Thanksgiving. Even seasoned Hollywood veterans are
bracing for the worst. By Anita M. Busch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-ROMANCE-FILMS (Undated) _ People are falling in love
with strangers across a crowded chat room, and e-mail has woven
itself into the fabric of our day-to-day lives, an adult equivalent
of passing notes in grade school. ``You've Got Mail,'' the new
romantic comedy opening on Dec. 18 from Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan and
Nora Ephron, the trio who made ``Sleepless in Seattle,''
close-focuses its camera on the care and feeding of an e-mail
romance. By Erika Milvy. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   LAST-SUMMER-SEQUELS (Undated) _ Last year's teen slasher smash,
``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' proved that each generation of
adolescents is new to the genre's creaky conventions. The formula
calls for invincible, barely visible villains (Jason of ``Friday
the 13th,'' Michael Myers of ``Halloween,'' Freddy Krueger of
``Nightmare on Elm Street'') shrouded in malevolent headgear
(goalie mask, Halloween mask, felt brim fedora) and wielding sharp,
shiny implements (hunting knife, carving knife, razorlike Lee
press-on nails). The most important convention is the sequel, the
ceaseless serializing of serial killing. ``Friday,'' ``Halloween''
and ``Nightmare'' have spawned 20 unholy offspring. And last week,
the inevitable first sequel to ``Summer'' opened. By Franz Lidz.

   JANSSEN-FILM (Undated) _ In ``The Faculty,'' which opens on
Christmas Day, Famke Janssen plays a timid, bespectacled high
school teacher, a woman whose voice quavers when she urges a
promising but wayward student to apply himself. Since the movie is
a thriller directed by Robert Rodriguez (``Desperado'') and written
by Kevin Williamson (``Scream''), it is safe to expect that the shy
educator will undergo a radical shift in personality and appearance
before the final reel. By Justine Elias. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   INTERMEDIA-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ When ``Playing by Heart'' opens
on Dec. 18, audiences are meant to exit the theaters drying their
eyes. Here, after all, is a multi-generational, multi-character
drama depicting numerous love stories in various stages of peril.
But Hollywood will be keeping its eyes wide open. The film, which
managed to entice actors like Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Dennis
Quaid, Angelina Jolie, Ryan Phillipe, Madeleine Stowe, Anthony
Edwards and Gillian Anderson for $50,000 apiece, a fraction of
their usual fees, may represent something vaguely threatening to
studios yet potentially exciting for moviegoers: the
mini-mainstream movie. By Michele Willens. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-AWARDS (Undated) _ As every devout moviegoer knows, we
are now approaching the season of excess. These final weeks of the
year occasion a tidal wave of new pictures, followed soon after by
an avalanche of awards. We're not just talking Oscars here. Oscar,
of course, is the royal prince of prizes. Before that epic March 21
event seizes the world's attention, those who find eternal pleasure
in any awards ceremony can look forward to Golden Globes and Golden
Apples and Golden Satellites and Golden Popcorn Buckets, to name a
few of the honors awaiting the women and men judged the most
deserving talents of the big screen. By Helen Dudar. (Moved).

<P>
   SPIRITUAL-DANCES (Undated) _ This week, in theaters a few blocks
apart in Brooklyn, N.Y., two programs will address and seek to
incorporate and represent the spirit. The dance in those programs
is worlds apart in time, history and geography. The Madras-based
Chandralekha, whose new full-evening ``Raga: In Search of
Femininity'' is to open on Wednesday for four performances at the
Majestic Theater, presented by the Next Wave Festival of the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, comes from the East and a culture that
at least by Western standards is permeated with the spiritual. The
three choreographers whose work will be shown in ``Dance and
Spiritual Life,'' the second event, are a part of a long, though
largely unacknowledged, tradition in American modern dance.
Unusually, attention will be paid to the potential of dance to
connect the spirit and the body in the one-performance program on
Saturday, which features choreography by Dianne McIntyre, Bebe
Miller and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, three black choreographers who
have been prominent on the American modern-dance landscape during
the last several decades. By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).

   DEROSA-THEATER (New York) _ Six weeks after the revival of
``Irma Vep'' opened to gushing reviews and packed houses, Stephen
DeRosa is still adjusting ``to life in the theah-tah,'' he said,
with an Olivia De Havilland flourish. He already has a budding fan
club _ well, mostly retired teachers from his days at P.S. 193 in
Whitestone, Queens. And even though his performance thrusts him
into four disguises, strangers do occasionally recognize him on the
street. ``It must be the nose,'' said DeRosa, a slight, shamelessly
self-deprecating 30-year-old with thinning hair and basset-brown
eyes who seems to take great pleasure in talking about
psychotherapy, his mollycoddling mother and ``the dark years'' he
spent as an underemployed actor. By Andrew Jacobs. (Moved). Photo.

   AMERICAN-ARIAS (Undated) _ Arias from American operas, however,
have not found much of a home on record. Until recently, in fact,
American operas themselves have largely been ignored. Now the
release of two CDs by the sopranos Dawn Upshaw and Renee Fleming
suggests that the tide may be turning. The two albums, Ms. Upshaw's
``World So Wide'' (Nonesuch 79458-2) and Ms. Fleming's ``I Want
Magic'' (London 289 460 567-2), concentrate on repertory that most
listeners will find unfamiliar, though several of the composers _
Gershwin, Copland, Barber and Bernstein among them _ are household
names. By David Mermelstein. (Moved). Photo.

   MUSIC-VERSIONS (Undated) _ The profound and the worthy can be
tiring, and there is nothing like a little smallness to ease our
passage from one Bach B minor Mass to the next Elliott Carter
Double Concerto. Weakness of this sort applies also to the
performances we like: ones that we know are ``wrong'' but that are
irresistible nonetheless. Stokowski's Bach, jacked up for 100
musicians, makes the musicologist's hair curl but makes mine stand

   LENNON-IMAGE (Undated) _ At a glance, the just released four-CD
``John Lennon Anthology'' looks very much like an ambitious
collectors' trawl. Lavishly packaged and copiously annotated, this
``Anthology'' (Capitol) brims with studio outtakes, concert
performances, private composing tapes and assorted spoken bits _ 94
selections in all. But satisfying the quasi-musicological
obsessions of collectors is not the primary purpose of this set.
``Anthology,'' compiled by Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, is less a
freestanding record release than an installment in a continuing
multimedia biography. It joins a mountain of CDs, videotapes,
material for film documentaries and radio series, picture books,
collections of Lennon's writings and art works _ that Ms. Ono has
released, overseen or sanctioned since Lennon was murdered on Dec.

   EXHIBITION-BOW (Philadelphia) _ In the doorway of the room that
houses ``The Letter Writing Project,'' a graceful, meditative
installation by the 34-year-old Taiwan-born artist Lee Mingwei, you
duck under a noren curtain. The noren _ a common feature in
Japanese architecture _ is a translucent white scrim that lowers
the height of the doorway by about a foot. Your head nods, your
back bends, and suddenly you are bowing. Westerners don't expect to
bow at an exhibition. But throughout Buddhist Asia, bowing is more
than common courtesy. It signifies acceptance of the way of the
universe: the importance of setting aside ego, of acknowledging the
web that unites all beings, and of expressing gratitude for this
miraculous gift of life. Bowing, it turns out, is integral to Lee's
exhibition, on view here at the Fabric Workshop and Museum through
Saturday. By Kay Larson. (Moved).

   AMPHITHEATER-ARCH (Camden, Maine) _ Between 1929 and 1931,
Fletcher Steele, one of this country's most brilliant landscape
architects, designed the Bok Amphitheater here and the library
grounds; at the same time, Olmsted Brothers, the firm headed by the
son and stepson of Frederick Law Olmsted, laid out the harbor park.
Together, these are recognized as one of the great achievements of
landscape architecture in America. After 70 years, they badly need

emerge from Britain's latest television fad, fly-on-the-wall
documentaries that profess to show the unvarnished truth about

   ALICE-WONDERLAND-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ For years, Justin G.
Schiller, a New York dealer in children's books, was certain that
he knew most everything about the publishing history of ``Alice in
Wonderland.'' The story had intrigued him since childhood, and so
in 1960 when he became a bookseller while still in high school, he
began buying and selling early printings of the book. In 1980, he
bought a rare copy of the first edition of ``Alice,'' printed in
1865 by Clarendon Press at Oxford University, an edition that had
been suppressed when Carroll, the pseudonym used by Charles
Lutwidge Dodgson, and John Tenniel, the illustrator, found
imperfections in the printing. He had been willing to pay $200,000
_ his entire savings _ for the book, but he was luckily able to buy
it at an auction in Paris for $56,000. Of the original 48 copies of
the first edition, 23 survive, 16 of them in libraries. But none of
the other copies is as distinctive as the one Schiller bought: it
includes 10 of the work's original pencil drawings by Tenniel, each
of which is signed with his monogram. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

CLINTON AND SADDAM CLASH, BUT FAIL TO BREAK IMPASSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq Friday made clear the vastness of the differences between
them, publicly offering contradictory analyses of the current
crisis and incompatible solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the crisis was caused by Iraq's refusal to submit
to arms inspections; Saddam, speaking in Baghdad for the first time
since he ignited the crisis, insisted the problem was brought on by
unjust and lethal economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Saddam could avert punitive air and missile
strikes only by agreeing immediately and unconditionally to the
resumption of international inspections of Iraq's facilities for
production of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. But Saddam
responded that he would agree to inspections only in exchange for
an easing of the harsh economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   While calling Saddam's continued defiance of the United Nations
unacceptable, Clinton did not issue an ultimatum and offered at
least a small opening to Saddam to end the impasse. Officials said
that Clinton was prepared to order military action at any time, but
that as of Friday night he still intended to leave for Asia on
Saturday evening for a week of economic meetings in Malaysia, Japan
and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other nations would prefer a peaceful
resolution of the crisis, Clinton said at a White House ceremony on
Friday where he signed anti-crime legislation, but ``none of us can
tolerate an Iraq free to develop weapons of mass destruction with
impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton added, ``Saddam Hussein has it within his hands
to end this crisis now by resuming full cooperation with Unscom,''
the U.N. special commission for arms inspections. The choice facing
Saddam is his alone, Clinton said, as are the consequences of
failing to back down.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations Friday afternoon, representatives from
France, Russia and China urged Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
travel to Baghdad to try to persuade Saddam to back down. But Annan
refused, saying he would intervene only if such a mission were
likely to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, Saddam said his refusal over the past three months
to cooperate with the U.N. monitoring regime was intended to
dramatize his demands for an end to eight years of sanctions that
have brought suffering to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq's decisions of Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 are not aimed at
creating a crisis or not cooperating with the Security Council, but
at satisfying Iraq's just demands,'' Saddam said, according to the
official Iraqi News Agency. ``Iraq will accept positively any
initiative that meets these just and balanced demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam was responding to a letter from President Boris Yeltsin
of Russia, who opposes the use of force to compel Iraq to agree to
weapons inspections. Yeltsin told Saddam that Baghdad's decision to
end cooperation with the U.N. weapons commission ``dealt a serious
blow to the normalization process,'' according to a Kremlin
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been trying to avert an American strike, but Iraq's
uncompromising decision has put Moscow in a difficult position. To
encourage Iraq to back down, the Russians said they would try to
speed up the inspection process. But Russia has sought this before
without much success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is opposed to the use of force in any case,'' said
Viktor Posuvalyuk, Yeltsin's special envoy for the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   American officials believe that even if Saddam relents and
readmits the weapons inspectors, his pledges will have to be
swiftly tested and the Unscom program will have to be significantly
strengthened. ``We will have to make them more effective,'' the
official said of the weapons inspections. ``For the last year, the
inspectors have been simply political pawns and not a true
instrument of inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials continued to issue threats today as
ground and air forces moved toward the region in preparation for a
possible large-scale strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi opposition group reported that the government's
intelligence agencies evacuated their offices in Baghdad on Friday.
The Iraqi National Congress, based in London, also reported that
units of the Special Republican Guard, which protects Saddam, had
been redeployed to locations including Tikrit, the Iraqi leader's
home town.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned Saddam: ``Reverse
course, or face the consequences.'' Secretary of Defense William
Cohen said that the only way Saddam can forestall the attack is by
saying, ``Yes, we will comply.'' Cohen added: ``That's been his
obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official who advocates a sudden and
severe attack on Iraq's weapons programs and other targets dear to
Saddam said the costs of the United States' failing to act outweigh
the risks of a military strike.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the U.N. inspection program has effectively ended
and that American forbearance was not likely to lead to its
reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't act, the international community will have huffed
and puffed and walked away,'' this official said. ``No threat of
force by the president would be credible _ it is only hollow and
empty.''
</P>
<P>
   The official added, ``Saddam could believe that he has a green
light to threaten the region again. He certainly will rebuild his
weapons of mass destruction, and he will use them.''
</P>
<P>
   But this official said Clinton was withholding a decision to
order a strike, in part because of the dangers of any use of force
and in part to allow time for more ships, planes and troops to flow
into the region.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, briefing reporters before her departure for the
Asia-Pacific economic conference in Malaysia, said the United
States had pursued both military and diplomatic options on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' she said, ``one by one, the diplomatic
options have been rebuffed.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Saddam has blamed the United Nations, the United
States and others for the breakdown of the Unscom inspection
program. That, she said, ``is completely disingenuous and dishonest
and despicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued to consult with foreign leaders and members of
Congress to assure support for any military action, White House
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Friday telephoned Prince Sultan of Saudi Arabia, the
emir of Kuwait, and the U.N. secretary-general. He also planned to
talk with Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate
before ordering any use of force, said Joe Lockhart, the White
House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton believes that the American people and foreign leaders
will back him if he decides to unleash force on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president believes the public understands the
threat and will support whatever option he may choose to best
contain the threat,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Another administration official, who also demanded anonymity,
said that some Arab leaders would complain in the event of American
military force, but he said at least some of that criticism would
be intended for domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past few weeks, the communications going to Saddam
from a very wide range of people _ including those who would prefer
a deal to the use of force _ have been strong messages that he has
to comply,'' the official said. ``The Gulf Cooperation Council
countries, and Egypt and Syria, which is hardly a friend of the
United States, are all saying to Saddam, `This is in your hands.'
That is very helpful. It shows that this is not an American
vendetta against Iraq.''

COMPANIES DISLIKE MICROSOFT INTEGRATION STRATEGY, CONSULTANT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some of the nation's largest companies, including
Citibank and Federal Express, view Microsoft Corp.'s strategy of
integrating Internet software with the Windows operating system as
a costly inconvenience with few benefits, according to an
independent consultant serving as an expert witness in the
government's antitrust suit against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's decision to tie its Web browser to the operating
system lies at the core of the government's lawsuit. The company
argues that integrating software for browsing the World Wide Web is
a natural evolution for personal-computer operating systems _ and a
vital competitive step.
</P>
<P>
   But the government charges that it is a cynical and illegal
tactic chosen only to give Microsoft a lopsided advantage in its
competition with Netscape Communications Corp., maker of the
principal competing browser.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth, Glenn Weadock, president of Independent
Software Inc., and the next witness in the case, says many
corporations are not happy about Microsoft's strategy. Weadock is
scheduled to testify starting on Monday, the fifth week of the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In written testimony made public Friday evening, he said: ``No
corporate PC manager, in fact no one outside of Microsoft, has ever
described a Web browser to me as operating system software.
Organizations typically consider browser software as applications
software, like e-mail or word processing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many managers want all of the companies' computers to run the
same software, he adds, and do not appreciate the additional
trouble and expense of trying to remove access to Microsoft's
browser, if the company has decided to use another one.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Friday evening, Microsoft said,
``Weadock's testimony is a collection of opinions, not fact.''
Other companies such as Dell, Monsanto, Siemens, Nabisco and
Toyota, the statement said, have ``embraced the Windows platform''
and ``realize the benefits of integration every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Working for the Justice Department, Weadock _ an author,
teacher, consultant and speaker on the subject of personal computer
software since 1982 _ interviewed technology managers at 13 large
corporations, including J.C. Penney, Morgan Stanley/Dean Witter and
U.S. Steel Group. The companies were chosen by the Department of
Justice. Among them were some that had expressed interest in the
government's case, and others that were chosen randomly, Weadock's
testimony said.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the technology managers said they wanted the
ability to choose Web browsers on their own and therefore found it
inconvenient that Microsoft has tried to make the choice for them.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft often notes that computer users are free to install
Netscape's browser or any other if they choose. But Weadock said
the technology managers told him they did not like having two
browsers on their computers because duplicative software wasted
space on the computer systems and held the potential to create
``conflicts with other applications and with company developed''
software.
</P>
<P>
   Weadock found that the quandary had cost Microsoft some business
because ``some companies are resisting or electing not to use
Windows 98 largely or in part because it would force them to have a
two-browser desktop.'' He mentioned only one such company by name:
Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   But Weadock found that Microsoft's strategy is having the
company's desired effect in other cases. For example, he quotes an
unidentified Boeing executive as telling a Justice Department
investigator that the company decided to begin using Internet
Explorer principally because ``we do not have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The integration between Internet Explorer and the operating
system cannot be fully disabled,'' the Boeing executive was quoted
as saying. ``Our only choice is whether we install two browsers or
just install Internet Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Microsoft argued that ``the government has
handpicked companies and individuals which support its claim that
the integration of Internet Explorer technologies into Windows is
bad for customers.'' By choosing only these people, the statement
adds, ``the government handed Weadock a stacked deck.''

WOODWARD LAWYERS CITE JUDGE'S RULING IN FIGHTING DAMAGES CASE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ The recently hired lawyers for British former au pair
Louise Woodward argued Friday that a judge's ruling that reduced
her second-degree murder conviction in the death of 8-month-old
Matthew Eappen supports their claim that she did not engage in
``willful, wanton and reckless conduct'' when she shook the baby to
death.
</P>
<P>
   In their first detailed filing Friday in federal court _ where
the parents of Matthew Eappen are suing Woodward for their son's
wrongful death _ Woodward's lawyers rely on the words of Middlesex
Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel to make their case that the
Eappens are not entitled to punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   After a jury convicted Woodward in the February 1997 death of
Matthew, Zobel reduced the verdict to involuntary manslaughter and
sentenced Woodward to the time she had served awaiting trial _ 279
days. Zobel's action was upheld by the state Supreme Judicial Court
in June, the same day the Eappens filed their wrongful death suit
in US District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, who has returned to her native England, ignored the
lawsuit until this month when she hired Boston lawyers. They have
since asked US District Judge William G. Young to remove the
default that he entered in July and to allow them to challenge the
Eappens' right to collect punitive damages. Young has scheduled a
hearing for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In an 11-page memorandum filed late Friday in federal court, the
attorneys, John P. Ryan and Myles W. McDonough, say Zobel's finding
that Woodward's actions ``were characterized by confusion,
inexperience, frustration, immaturity and some anger, but not
malice,'' support their view that she did not engage in ``willful,
wanton or reckless'' conduct, the standard for awarding punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Zobel's view of the evidence in the criminal proceedings
is certainly sufficient to demonstrate that there is a genuine
issue as to whether Woodward's conduct constituted ordinary
negligence,'' her lawyers argue.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in Zobel's decision, they note, do the words ``willful,
wanton or reckless'' appear. ``To the contrary, the trial court's
analysis makes references to `confusion, fright, and bad judgment,
rather than rage or malice,''' they wrote.

MASSACHUSETTS FACES DECISION IN UPCOMING TOBACCO PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With negotiators about to unveil a new $200 billion
national tobacco settlement, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger
came under heavy pressure Friday from anti-smoking advocates to
reject the proposal and continue with plans to prosecute cigarette
makers in state court.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger earlier this year walked away from the tobacco talks
in New York, deciding instead to take his chances on winning an
even bigger individual settlement in Massachusetts courts.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed settlement with the remaining eight states,
which is expected to be announced Monday, could provide
Massachusetts with about $4 billion if Harshbarger exercises the
option of rejoining the agreement, according to individuals
familiar with the negotiations. Some of those close to the
discussions said state attorneys were urging Harshbarger to accept
the terms and rejoin the national settlement. He has seven days to
decide whether to accept the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the proposed agreement began leaking out Friday, and
national and local tobacco control activists immediately attacked
the provisions. The critics say that despite the $4 billion
Massachusetts could recover in smoking-related Medicare expenses,
the proposal fails to force a number of concessions from the
cigarette firms on public health issues, including marketing aimed
at teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marks a real significant retreat by the attorneys
general,'' said Stan Glantz, a professor of medicine at the
University of California and leading national anti-smoking
activist.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the total cost of the deal is considerably less
than the $368 billion the industry offered the states in a 1997
settlement that died in Congress last June and which was signed
onto by Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette firms had also struck a deal with Minnesota
earlier this year that projected on a national scale would have
cost them $470 billion. But since then, the industry has won some
key court decisions and has become more aggressive in its dealings
with the states.
</P>
<P>
   In their fight to kill the deal, Glantz and others say they are
looking to Harshbarger for help. The attorney general's decision
whether to pursue the companies in court or rejoin the settlement
is critical to the future of the national groundbreaking litigation
by the states that has forced the industry to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Harshbarger folds on this, everyone else folds,'' said
Richard Daynard, a professor at Northeastern University School of
Law and chairman of its Tobacco Products Liability Project.
</P>
<P>
   Daynard said that because Harshbarger has built a powerful case
and stands a good chance of winning, the rest of the country is
looking to him for leadership. ``If he were to throw in the towel,
the message to everyone else is that the dam has burst,'' Daynard
said.
</P>
<P>
   One advocate, Dr. Gregory Connolly, director the state's Tobacco
Control Program, said Harshbarger's decision will mark a watershed
in the anti-smoking movement. ``What Scott decides will ultimately
determine how America will deal with tobacco conrol over the next
25 years,'' Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, who has returned to his office after an
unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign, Friday declined to be
interviewed and his aides said he is witholding judgment until the
settlement is unveiled on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While he gave no hint Friday on which way he is leaning, others
close to the AG's office said Harshbarger is getting conflicting
advice within his own staff, although most are said to be strongly
urging him to buy into the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Those aides advocating a settlement are arguing that there is no
guarantee the state will prevail in its suit, scheduled for trial
in February, and that even in the best scenario, Massachusetts
would not see any money for years because of expected appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risky road,'' said one individual who is privy to
Harshbarger's decision-making. ``You have to look at what you're
going to end up with and what you can lose if you go to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Daynard said he suspects that the private attorneys are pushing
for the settlement because they will capture huge fees and are not
as concerned about stiff public health concessions from the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the public health provisions appear to be fool's
gold,'' Day-nard said. ``They have impressive titles but little
substance. They are fig leafs to cover up the huge fees the
attorney are getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Evjy, chairman of the Massachasetts Coalition for a
Healthy Future, which represents a host of health groups, said his
organization is urging Harshbarger to reject the settlement and
pursue the state's legal case, which he said is ``very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of seeing the details, we would rather have
Massachusetts go it alone,'' Evjy said.

WOMEN SEEKING HOUSE POSTS SEE THEIR GENDER AS SELLING POINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Wash., N.C, Fla., Ky., Ohio, Okla., Conn., Texas)  (mk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The post-election consensus that Republicans need a
nicer smile and a softer touch has left Rep. Peter Hoekstra,
R-Mich., feeling a little bit discriminated against in the race
against three women for a lower-level House leadership position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do hear it from some members, that you've got to have a
certain mix,'' a certain diversity in the lineup, he said, and
added that the real question of fitness for the relatively obscure
post was ``a performance issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP: party of quotas and affirmative action?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but congressional Republicans do seem to have got the
idea that the many female voters who have been snubbing them at the
polls might enjoy seeing more women in prominent positions.
</P>
<P>
   Five women are in leadership races in the House, where Rep.
Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., who is running for majority leader, is the
first woman in either party to pursue a top leadership job.
</P>
<P>
   All the other women are in races near the bottom of the
leadership ladder, running for posts that have been held by women
in the past _ in the view of some, as a way to put women in the
leadership team photo without giving them much to do.
</P>
<P>
   But the women competing for leadership positions clearly do see
their sex as a selling point. Right after they say that their being
women is wholly irrelevant, they go on to talk about why being
women makes them better at listening, communicating and working
well with others _ all areas in which there is general agreement
that their party could use some work.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sue Myrick, R-N.C., one of three women competing for Ms.
Dunn's old job as vice chairwoman of the House Republican
conference, essentially a spokeswoman's position and well down the
ladder of leadership posts, put it like this: ``I think there are a
lot of us that feel we bring a special _ let's not say special _ a
different way of working.'' Being in Congress, said Ms. Myrick,
former mayor of Charlotte, ``is like raising your kids. You're
always trying to get people to get along. And males don't always
... '' she said, trailing off for a moment. ``Well, we tend to be
less confrontational.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn, too, boasts of extra prowess as a result of her sex:
``Just little things that come from listening well and finding out
where the soft spots are, women are very good at that. And many men
are, too,'' added Ms. Dunn, a former party worker in her home
state, nodding to the overwhelming majority of voters in the
upcoming House leadership elections who are, after all, male.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're better at balancing because we've had to be,'' said Rep.
Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., who is also running for the vice
chairwoman's job. Ms. Fowler, a lawyer elected to Congress after
serving on the Jacksonville City Council, called herself a ``good
coalition builder.'' And she showed what might be considered a
traditionally female sense of collegiality: ``My opponents are
good, too,'' she said. ``We'll have a good strong team no matter
who gets elected.''
</P>
<P>
   The other female candidate for the vice chairwoman's post, Rep.
Anne Northup, R-Ky., a former state legislator, said nothing about
being a woman but talked up her ability to help broaden the party's
appeal to minority groups. In the recent election, she boasted in a
letter to colleagues, she increased her share of black voters to 18
percent, from 11 percent in the 1996 race, and promised to help do
the same for the party.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether that 18 percent left rather a lot of room for
improvement, she showed that non-confrontational consensus builders
can be snappish too: ``Yeah, but I doubled it, and 50 percent is
half, and for a traditional voting bloc that's so significantly
tied to one party, that's a lot of progress in two years.''
</P>
<P>
   (Ms. Northup does have some relevant experience; two of her six
children are black, adopted by her and her husband. ``We've
probably had every conversation around our table that you can
have,'' she said.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Barbara Sinclair, a professor of political science at the
University of California at Los Angeles who teaches courses on
Congress and women in American politics, notes that women have held
various low-level posts since the '60s without ever moving up the
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   She said the historical record of women in congressional
leadership is so scant that ``it's a good sign just that Jennifer
Dunn is running and people aren't laughing at her.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Way down the ticket, Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, is keeping her
job as conference secretary. And the race between Ms. Myrick, Ms.
Fowler, Ms. Northup and Hoekstra is so eclipsed by other races that
simply asking members, ``What do you hear about the vice chair's
race?'' is good for a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Ms. Dunn succeeds, the post may come to be considered
a good launching pad. And former Rep. Susan Molinari of New York,
who preceded Ms. Dunn in that job, said that any leadership
position was important because it came with a seat at the meetings
where all the important decisions were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're at the table, you can foresee a problem coming,''
Ms. Molinari said, recalling how, because she was in a leadership
meeting, she was able to extract from a pending bill an amendment
barring single people from adopting. ``I could throw out there,
while Newt's at the table, `Is this really the message we want to
send?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Molinari said the problem of women climbing the leadership
ladder in this particular Congress may have more to do with
ideology than sex: ``The women tend to be moderate and pro-choice,
so in a conservative, pro-life conference, that becomes somewhat
difficult.'' (Ms. Dunn has a mixed voting record on abortion-rights
issues, and for that reason is regarded with some suspicion by some
in the conference. Ms. Northup and Ms. Myrick oppose abortion
rights, while Ms. Fowler supports abortion rights but voted to ban
certain late-term abortions.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Molinari and others said that the position of women
in the House had already changed significantly in recent years.
``It used to be that none of us wanted to be seen as women's
candidates'' or as particularly involved in issues considered
women's issues, she said. ``But politics has changed so much that
now men want to be the women's candidate. They're asking, `Can I
get time to speak about breast cancer?'''
</P>
<P>
   One group that is not necessarily ready to applaud diversity in
the Republican leadership team is the Democratic caucus. Some feel
a little embarrassed that Republican leadership could include
several women and a black man, Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., who is
running against Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, as conference chairman _
while Democrats seem prepared to choose five white males.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., is considered an underdog in the
Democratic race for caucus chairwoman against Rep. Martin Frost,
D-Texas, who raised money for House races as head of the Democratic
Congressional Conference Committee and has enjoyed a share of the
credit for the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeLauro, too, was talking up her resume as a legislator, a
leader _ and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women deal with consensus,'' she said. ``It's important that
the Democratic leadership reflect the caucus _ and the people that
elected us.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Delivering its third-quarter results 10 days ago, the
management of CNA Financial, a large Chicago company that sells
life, property and casualty insurance, had bad news and good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad: ``Extremely competitive conditions'' in its commercial
property-casualty business caused a net loss of $14 million, or 9
cents a share, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news? CNA said its top executives, who had not been big
owners of its stock, had bought 1.2 million shares on Oct. 9 in a
new stock ownership plan for officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A higher level of ownership by senior officers strongly
reinforces our focus on accountability,'' said Dennis H.
Chookaszian, CNA's chairman, in a news release. CNA is controlled
by the Loews Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Investors bid the stock up almost 2 percent on the news. If
management was willing to put its own money into the stock, surely
good times were about to return.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But the news release did not note that the buys were
made with company loans, not with the insiders' own money. Each
loan is secured by the stock bought with it; the borrowers pay the
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Loan programs like CNA's are a sign of the times. Companies know
how closely investors watch insiders' trades. Now their buys are
becoming part of corporate spin; investors can no longer assume
that an insider's big buy is an unalloyed vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gabele, editor of Insiders' Chronicle, a newsletter in
Rockville, Md., tracks executives' transactions. ``In the 1980s you
could assume insiders were buying for one of two reasons,'' Gabele
said. ``Either it was a new insider buying for the first time, or
they were buying for direct investment.''
</P>
<P>
   But loan programs make reading the tea leaves trickier. ``We
sense in many more cases these days that insider purchases are
being made to paint the tape and make a situation look good,''
Gabele said.
</P>
<P>
   CNA did report the loan program in its quarterly statement filed
on Friday, and at least requires the executives to pay back the
loans. Some companies forgive these loans.
</P>
<P>
   Loans guaranteed or financed by the company to help insiders buy
shares, while still rare, are becoming more common. Gabele
estimates that 5 percent of companies have them, but reckons they
can account for up to 20 percent of insider buying. Companies as
varied as Conseco, Equifax, Navistar, the St. Paul Companies and
Cummins Engine offer them.
</P>
<P>
   Insider purchases are often trumpeted by companies, but the loan
programs are not always as publicized. Gabele says some loans do
not show up in company financial statements, though the Securities
and Exchange Commission requires that loans to executives exceeding
$60,000 be flagged there.
</P>
<P>
   Even in cases where loans are identified, details about them _
whether they will be forgiven, say _ are scarce, and often come
months after an insider has bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inadequate disclosure requirements regarding programs designed
to prompt insiders to buy their company's shares serve only to
mislead investors who rely on insider buying for investment
guidance,'' Gabele said. ``When not properly disclosed, these
programs defy the spirit of the rules intended to provide the
public with prompt and accurate information about the trades of
U.S. corporate insiders.'' Buyers beware.

ANALYSIS: GAMBLE FOR U.S. IN BAILOUT OF BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the announcement Friday of nearly $42 billion
in aid to stabilize Brazil, the United States is taking two
gambles: that its own part of the aid _ $5 billion in taxpayer
money _ is a safe investment in a country in need of rapid reform,
and a separate wager that its new strategy to calm the global
financial jitters will succeed where others failed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither one is a sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States committed $12 billion to Mexico in 1995,
it compelled the Mexican government to offer up collateral.
Virtually all Mexico's oil revenues were deposited through the New
York Federal Reserve Bank, until the loan was paid back. Brazil is
offering nothing but its word, and the assurance, Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin said at the White House on Friday, that it
``still has $40 billion in reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger risk, though, is a strategic one. Until now, the
International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury have stepped in
to help countries only after they were in full economic arrest, out
of money and on the brink of default.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the IMF and the Treasury slowly doled out money, one
payment at a time, as the Koreans, the Thais, the Indonesians and
finally the Russians imposed austerity measures and met a tough
regime of economic goals.
</P>
<P>
   Now Korea and Thailand are stable, but trapped in deep
recessions. Indonesia and Russia are still falling like stones,
their political chaos worsened by economic collapse, which in turn,
provokes deeper political troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is a totally different case, the administration says,
deserving of the new approach first outlined by President Clinton
last month to head off financial crises early, before they
overwhelm countries and spread elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's problems are only partly of its own making. Investors
fled after Russia's troubles caused convulsions in emerging markets
around the world. The solution offered Friday was a
``precautionary'' aid program, and the Brazilians will have access
to more than half of the $42 billion in the next few months, as
long as they are moving toward the reforms they have promised.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is to convince private investors around the world
that the Brazilian government has both the will to reform and the
cash to fight off speculators and nervous bankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a totally noncomparable situation to what happened in
Russia,'' Rubin insisted Friday, referring to a country that
embraced IMF reforms for all of three weeks in August, until the
currency was devalued, Parliament refused to pass an austerity
plan, and President Boris Yeltsin dismissed the reformers who had
negotiated the bailout deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are no certainties,'' Rubin said, ``we believe
that this is the right program both for the people of Brazil and
for the economic well-being of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a lesson from the last four bailout efforts, though,
it is that the best-negotiated plans can run afoul of domestic
politics and unpredictable economic winds. And the plan for Brazil
is fraught with similar risks.
</P>
<P>
   The first and smallest risk is that the Brazilians will not be
able to pay back its lenders _ the IMF, the World Bank, and the 20
countries that have contributed to the bailout, led by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The $40 billion in currency reserves still sitting in Brazil's
central bank reduces that risk in just the way a bank is more
comfortable lending to someone with money in the bank than to
someone without. But in the last few months Brazil saw $30 billion
in reserves washed away, as it tried to defend its currency. If its
reserves were a real solution, it would not need to borrow money in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin knows that his best protection is political. The
United States is Brazil's biggest trading partner and the architect
of the bailout plan. And one of the unspoken rules of the financial
markets is that powerful creditors get paid back first _ because
the borrower may need them again.
</P>
<P>
   The second risk is that the plan Brazil agreed to Friday could
stabilize its currency, but worsen its recession. ``The biggest
reason why this is a huge gamble is that we are knowingly sending
Brazil into recession,'' said Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economist
who has emerged as one of the IMF's harshest critics.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks in government spending, the high interest rates to
defend the currency and Brazil's refusal to devalue that currency _
which would make its exports less expensive _ ``show that the
policy has not responded to a year in which we've discovered the
downside of IMF bailouts,'' Sachs insists.
</P>
<P>
   The fund said Friday that it had learned plenty. Its plans for
Brazil, it insists, include the preservation of crucial programs to
help the poor. And it is already pressing private banks to keep
open their lines of credit to Brazil, rather than to use the
bailout to get their money out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every effort has been made to spare basic social programs from
the expenditure cuts that fiscal discipline requires,'' Michel
Camdessus, the managing director of the IMF, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest risk is that the plan will take the pressure
off the Brazilian Congress to act. For while the United States and
the IMF could threaten to hold up their aid money, the fact is that
any such move would signal to the markets that Washington had lost
confidence in Brazil's commitment to reform. And that, in turn,
could easily fuel the panic that Rubin, Camdessus and leaders
around the world have been trying to quell.
</P>
<P>
   In short, with the commitment to help Brazil, there is no easy
exit if things go bad.

MEXICO EXPECTS 3 PERCENT GROWTH NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a bid to outstrip the United States in economic
growth next year despite the uncertainties in global markets,
Mexico proposed one of the leanest federal budgets in its history
on Friday and said it would impose some unpopular taxes to keep the
deficit down.
</P>
<P>
   If the Congress accepts the basics of the 1999 budget announced
by Finance Minister Angel Gurria, Mexico will have cut $10 billion
in federal spending in five years. But officials said they were
betting on tight government finances to bring down inflation and
keep the investment environment stable so that the country, led by
a thriving export sector, will grow by 3 percent next year. That is
about twice the expansion they expect to see in the neighbor to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is one of the United States' largest trading partners.
Demand for goods from the United States this year in its
surprisingly resilient economy did much to make up for the plunge
in U.S. exports to ailing Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials believe their 1999 goal is realistic, because
despite world turmoil, the country will close out 1998 with 4.6
percent growth. They project that inflation will decline next year
to 13 percent, down from 17.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The stern fiscal discipline practiced by President Ernesto
Zedillo contrasts with the loose ways of Brazil, Latin America's
biggest economy, where a federal deficit of 7 percent generated
waves of financial instability that threatened in recent weeks to
radiate to all of the emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Gurria said he would try to hold Mexico's deficit to 1.25
percent of the gross domestic product next year even though federal
revenue will decline because of persisting record-low petroleum
prices. Mexico calculates that it will get no more than $11 a
barrel on average for its oil next year. Because of lost oil income
in 1998, the country will post a 1.42 percent deficit for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Though officials expect foreign investment to remain strong,
perhaps as much as $10 billion next year, they also foresee that
international credit will be severely limited, increasing the costs
of borrowing money and servicing the foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   The government plans $2.25 billion in spending cuts next year.
``We are down to the bone,'' Undersecretary of Finance Martin
Werner said Friday. In coming days officials will announce the
first increase since 1995 in gasoline and diesel prices, in order
to collect more taxes on fuel sales. Gurria also proposed a 15
percent tax on local and long-distance telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   To sweeten the package for wary opposition lawmakers, the
government wants to raise income taxes from 34 percent to 37
percent for the wealthiest Mexicans. Officials decided not to
eliminate subsidies on electricity, a move that was dreaded by
business.
</P>
<P>
   Gurria's $101.7 billion budget proposal, and the carefully
conciliatory speech he gave to present it, drew mildly favorable
initial responses in the lower house of Congress. But one item that
is certain to arouse opposition is the government's request to
double the funds next year, to $2.43 billion, for financing its
bailout of banks.
</P>
<P>
   The acrimonious congressional debate over the $65 billion
bailout, now in its eighth month, went into a full stall last week.
Opposition lawmakers have accused government officials of violating
the Constitution and squandering the treasury to rescue failed or
corrupt bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Werner said Friday that the prolonged feud over the bailout had
given investors doubts about the stability of Mexico's financial
system, resulting in an increase in interest rates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The discussion has wandered far away from the central issue of
lowering the cost to the government of the bailout,'' Werner said.
``We have seen a lot of magical formulas for solving the problem
which do nothing more than deceive people.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that the government had absorbed
losses of $11.5 billion over the last five years to save and revive
institutions left behind by just three failed Mexican bankers. The
three, Jorge Lankenau Rocha, Angel Isidoro Rodriguez Saez and
Carlos Cabal Peniche, bought banks from the government during its
privatization campaign in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Lankenau is in jail and Rodriguez is out on bail, both of them
facing multimillion-dollar fraud charges. Cabal, a fugitive for
four years, was arrested last week in Australia and is wanted in
Mexico on 21 counts of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Werner said he was confident that opposition lawmakers, who won
a majority in the lower house of Congress in 1997 and will approve
a federal budget for only the second time in Mexican history, would
understand that the government was offering the lowest possible
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been at this for 10 or 15 years,'' Werner said,
referring to government technocrats like him. Congressional
deputies, he added, ``don't have the kind of fresh experience that
we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, government officials, taking a lesson
from setbacks in the long debate over the bank bailout, took
``hours and hours'' to discuss the budget with key legislators
before presenting the final version.

   These days, when the bulls run, they really sprint. That's the
gist of the most recent data from Investors Intelligence, a
newsletter in New Rochelle, N.Y., that conducts a weekly poll of
the market sentiment of some 130 private investment newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   According to Investors Intelligence, 53.1 percent of the
newsletters expressed bullish sentiment in its most recent survey,
released last week, up from 47.8 percent the week before. Bearish
sentiment among the newsletters declined to 35.4 percent from 38.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bullish streak represents a remarkably sudden turnaround
from this year's trough of newsletter optimism on Sept. 18, when
bulls accounted for just 36.4 percent of those polled and bears
47.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen so quickly in this market,'' said Michael Burke,
the editor. ``What used to take months now takes weeks. We've gone
from being a bearish extreme to being a bullish extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the eighth consecutive week that optimism has risen.
``That's a streak that's very rare,'' Burke said, adding that the
last time optimism increased eight weeks in a row was in the fall
of 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Many technical analysts view rampant optimism as a bad portent
for the market, because it suggests that bulls have already spent
their spare cash, leaving none to fuel a further run-up.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the turn in sentiment is partly a function of the
Federal Reserve's rate-cutting and the market's recent good fortune
_ ``don't fight the Fed and don't fight the tape,'' as Burke puts
it. But he, for one, noting that there is still ample bearishness
in the numbers, is not ready to hoist a warning flag. ``We'd view
this as neutral to slightly positive,'' he said.  &QL;

   Investors kicking themselves for not being in on last week's
initial offerings of Earthweb and Theglobe.com _ which finished the
week up 378.6 percent and 605.6 percent, respectively _ may want to
keep this thought in mind: There's more where those two came from.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen Internet companies tracked by Commscan LLC, a New York
research firm, plan to tap the public market, hoping to raise a
total of $826.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the companies have already set tentative schedules.
Among them is Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch, an online provider of
event ticketing and local city guides. It hopes to raise $63 in an
offering planned for early December.
</P>
<P>
   Other big names on the list include Prodigy Communications, the
Internet access provider, which hopes to raise $86.3 million, and
Marketwatch.com, a Web-based news provider, which hopes to bring in
$34.5 million. Neither has set a specific time for its offering.
</P>
<P>
   Through Thursday, Commscan said, 30 Internet companies had
raised a total of $1.6 billion this year, returning an average of
74 percent.

   When William H. Miller III buys a stock, many investors take
notice, because it usually means he thinks a company is a good bet
for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Legg Mason Value Trust, the $5.7 billion fund that
Miller has watched over for 16 years, had a turnover rate of just
13 percent _ meaning that the fund still owns about seven of every
eight stocks that it held a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at an investment conference sponsored by Legg Mason
in New York, Miller revealed his latest bet: WPP Group, the
advertising and public relations firm based in London. Miller
bought 27 million shares, or roughly 6 percent of WPP's stock,
making him one of the company's three biggest shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that WPP's shares have run up nearly 50 percent in
little more than a month, Miller said; they still are trading at
``a giveaway'' valuation based on the company's ``huge cash flow.''
To make way for WPP in the Value Trust portfolio, Miller said he
sold 6.5 million shares of Columbia/HCA Healthcare, the troubled
hospital company. &QL;

INVESTING WITH CARL DORF: MANAGER OF PILGRIM AMERICA BANK AND
THRIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., Ohio, Tenn.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of Pilgrim America Bank &AMP; Thrift is being sent to
NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase
by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the summer, it seemed, bank stocks came a cropper.
Investors recoiled at the banks' emerging-markets exposure, their
hedge fund loans and the potential damage from an impending
recession. By Oct. 8, the sector had dropped 40.3 percent from its
high on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   After the Federal Reserve's one-two cut in the federal funds
rate last month, however, the question now is: How high will bank
stocks bounce?
</P>
<P>
   ``The decline was overdone,'' said Carl Dorf, portfolio manager
of Pilgrim America Bank and Thrift, a top-ranking financial
specialty fund, from his office in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rebound that started a couple of weeks ago, Dorf
said, ``we think the sector is still much cheaper than the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why industrial companies should trade at
20-plus times earnings, while my group trades at 13 times
earnings,'' he added. ``Decent regional banks should trade at
average market multiples.''
</P>
<P>
   His investing ideas have been, well, money in the bank for
shareholders. The fund returned an annual average of 33.1 percent
for the three years through Nov. 6, putting it in first place among
19 specialty financial funds tracked over that period, according to
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. The group
returned 25.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the fund has lost 2.6 percent through Nov.
6, compared with a positive, if measly, return of 1.8 percent for
the group, according to Morningstar. Dorf attributes that
underperformance, in part, to a big influx of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Bank and Thrift began in 1986 as a closed-end fund called
Pilgrim Regional Bank Shares; Dorf took over the fund in 1991. In
October 1997, with assets of $354.2 million, it converted into a
mutual fund and now has assets of $878.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the structural changes, Dorf's strategy has stayed
consistent. ``We try to be risk-averse,'' he said, avoiding
companies with high levels of bad loans. If he thinks financial
stocks are likely to underperform, he can raise the fund's cash
position to as high as 100 percent. However, he has never lifted it
above 10 percent and it is now 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking quality at cheap prices, he says he usually will not buy
a stock or add to a holding if its price-to-earnings multiple is
higher than the average for the portfolio, now 13.5.
</P>
<P>
   Dorf, 58, uses his own model to unearth value. He monitors a
fairly small, informal universe of about 200 banks, savings
institutions and financial services companies, from which he
selects the 90 held in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The model reviews some 30 pieces of financial information, among
the most important being asset quality, measured by, say, the
percentage of nonperforming assets and the size of the reserve for
losses.
</P>
<P>
   But he also pays heed to subjective factors, like management's
skill and commitment to shareholders; the loan portfolio mix, and
the various types of businesses it operates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he recently added to his position in Charter One
Financial, a savings institution based in Cleveland that is already
the fund's biggest holding. Management is shareholder oriented,
Dorf said, and the chief executive, Charles John Koch, held close
to 1 percent of the company as of last February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one-point move in the stock price means more to the
chief executive than his annual salary,'' Dorf said.
</P>
<P>
   Charter One has what Dorf calls excellent credit quality, yet
sells for just 12.8 times projected 1999 earnings. In addition,
management has shifted the portfolio mix from single-family
mortgages toward higher-yielding consumer assets like auto,
consumer and home equity loans, he said. He expects annual earnings
growth of 12 percent over three to five years. The stock now trades
at $28.46875.
</P>
<P>
   He also added recently to his position in the BankBoston Corp.,
which has a large presence in Argentina and Brazil. ``Shares
started to look very cheap because the market was reacting to fears
of a devaluation in Brazil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he usually avoided a bank with international exposure
unless it is dominant in a particular market. In this case,
``Argentina and Brazil think that Bank of Boston is a local
company, and that the United States is a subsidiary,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the company was hedged against any potential
devaluation. Dorf expects earnings to grow 9.8 percent in 1999; the
stock is now at $41.125.
</P>
<P>
   A recent buy is Sirrom Capital of Nashville, which lends money
to small companies. Dorf compares Sirrom's business to venture
capital lending, but Sirrom offsets the risk by taking warrants in
the companies, allowing it to acquire stock at a fixed price. ``A
decent number don't survive, but some of the ones that do tend to
be big winners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sirrom traded at more than $30 a share in the spring, but
several of its loans have since gone bad. Dorf bought shares at
prices ranging from $4.625 to $13. The fund is betting that the
market ``has made a mistake,'' he said, adding that the company's
stated book value per share is considerably greater than its stock
price, now $5.625.
</P>
<P>
   After Dorf buys a stock, he tends to hold on. The fund's
turnover rate was 22 percent last year, compared with an average of
84 percent for all United States stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike cheerleading sell-side analysts, Dorf is not a great fan
of the big-name mergers that have refashioned the financial
services industry. For example, he does not own the newly meshed
Citigroup, because of its high foreign and credit card exposure as
well as what he euphemistically called ``management risk'' _
evidenced by the departure of its former president, James E. Dimon.
</P>
<P>
   He holds some BankAmerica stock, originally bought as
Nationsbank shares, but sounds decidedly downbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the acquisition because it gave me international
exposure I didn't want,'' he said. ``Over all, it's a terrific
franchise, but the timing is not judicious.''

ANALYSIS: MORE AUTO MERGERS LIKELY TO RESULT FROM CAPACITY GLUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Further large mergers are likely among automakers
because of a worldwide excess of assembly plants and the
just-completed marriage of Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp.,
industry leaders said in interviews this week.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers around the globe have the ability to produce 70
million vehicles a year. But global demand has been around 50
million vehicles a year even in good times, and is eroding now with
economic slumps in East Asia and Latin America. This week's
creation of DaimlerChrysler AG, in an industry in which big
cross-border mergers have historically been hard to accomplish, has
forced every auto manufacturer to reassess its strategic options.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the world economy in the situation it is, and the fact
that only about 10 out of the 40 manufacturers in the world are
making money, there's going to be a dramatic restructuring,'' said
Robert Eaton, now one of the two co-chairmen of DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's talking to everybody in the auto industry,'' said
William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman-elect of Ford Motor Co. ``What
may come of it, I don't know, maybe nothing actually, but there are
a lot of people that are talking and it'll be very interesting _ I
think it'll be very interesting a year from now.''
</P>
<P>
   The two companies most talked about by industry executives as
potential acquirers are Ford Motor, which has $22 billion in cash
and will soon have a new management team, and Volkswagen AG, which
already bought Rolls-Royce this year. The three companies most
discussed as potential targets are Nissan Motor Co. of Japan, AB
Volvo of Sweden and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker attracting the most attention, particularly as a
potential merger partner for Ford, is Nissan. Japan's
second-largest automaker has lost money for six of the last seven
years and has had difficulty this year finding banks to lend it
money, particularly after its credit rating dropped again this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The government-run Japan Development Bank agreed this week to
lend 100 billion yen, or $817 million, to Nissan, a move with some
parallels to the government loan guarantees that helped rescue
Chrysler in 1980. Nissan's troubles have left many auto industry
leaders convinced that a merger or some other deal is likely for
Nissan, although Nissan officials insist that their company has a
plan for recovery and is better off than Chrysler was a generation
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Only five global automakers are likely to have the resources to
cope with Nissan's $35 billion debt: Ford, Volkswagen,
DaimlerChrysler, General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But GM and Toyota already work together closely, so a bid by
either of them for Nissan could raise antitrust problems. And top
executives of DaimlerChrysler have ruled out any further big
mergers until they work out the details of this week's transaction,
which could take years.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Volkswagen and Ford Motor. Volkswagen chairman
Ferdinand Piech has indicated an interest in Volvo and BMW. Volvo
has shown little enthusiasm, while the Quandt family, which owns
45.6 percent of BMW, moved most of its stake into holding companies
last month to improve defenses against any hostile takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Volkswagen has shown little interest in East Asia.
Volkswagen did not even participate in this autumn's auctions of
Kia Motors Corp. of Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor has been trying to expand in East Asia. It lost to
Hyundai Motor Co. in the final Kia auction, although Hyundai has
mentioned an interest in taking Ford Motor as a partner. Now, Ford
Motor is eyeing the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his company might do a deal with Nissan, Ford was
cautious. ``We would certainly look at anything, but given the
balance sheet and the off-balance sheet problems that exist in a
lot of the Japanese companies, you have to be very careful any time
you went into any kind of venture there,'' he said. ``We all
believe at Ford that it's going to emerge as a very important
market from their troubles, so we would like to have a stronger
Japanese presence, but what form it takes has yet to be
determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street analysts have criticized Ford Motor for holding
so much cash, but Ford said that he refused to be rushed. ``I'm not
going to let it burn a hole in our pocket,'' he said. ``I think
that we're not in any hurry to spend it. We're always looking at
things like buybacks and dividends and acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ford decides to do a deal in Asia, he will not have to look
far for investment banking expertise. John Thornton, the chairman
of Goldman Sachs Asia, joined Ford's 11-member board two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is trying hard now to turn around its troubled North
American operations, and will soon introduce a series of new cars
and sport utility vehicles. Jason Vines, a Nissan spokesman, said
the goal was improved operating results, not preparation by the
company for a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Renault and Peugeot are struggling in France, but French
nationalism has discouraged international automakers from seriously
considering them as takeover candidates. But Fiat SpA of Italy
persuaded Renault on Monday to agree to a merger of most of the two
companies' foundry operations, which cast heavy metal parts.
</P>
<P>
   Even as automakers study possible merger options, they are
looking at ways to profit from rivals' mergers. Ronald Zarrella,
the president of GM's North American operations, said the
difficulty of combining Chrysler and Daimler-Benz might be useful.
``I hope they're very distracted and we can take some market share
from them,'' he said.

been able to work together with even fewer difficulties than
anticipated when the merger was first announced last May.

   For tax reasons, investors are often advised to avoid buying a
mutual fund just before it distributes its dividends and capital
gains for the year. But what if you need to sell a fund? If your
fund's value has fallen this year, are there advantages in selling
it before the distribution date, which often falls in December?
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the answer is no. One exception, according to Joel
Dickson, a tax specialist at the Vanguard Group, is when you (a)
have a capital gain from the sale of a different asset, (b) the
loss in your mutual fund's value is not as large as that gain and
(c) your mutual fund will have a big payout of taxable income. In
that case, if you sell before the distribution date, you will be
taxed at lower capital-gains rates, instead of the higher rates on
earned income.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you have gains from other property that are equal to
or less than the loss on your mutual fund shares, the various forms
of taxable income cancel one another out, and it does not matter
whether you sell before or after the distribution date.

   Seizure of Benefits
</P>
<P>
   The courts have long interpreted federal law to prohibit seizure
of workers' compensation benefits to pay back taxes. But a federal
judge in Texas has ruled differently, allowing the IRS to keep
$10,000 seized from an elderly widow whose husband was murdered at
work.
</P>
<P>
   Federal District Judge Sim Lake in Houston ruled on Oct. 5 that
Congress protected ``only those workers' compensation benefits
payable to the delinquent taxpayer, not workers' compensation
benefits that have already been paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Glendon Adams, lawyer for the widow, Adeline Rudel Cathey, 69,
asked, ``What is the purpose of Congress passing a statute
exempting a benefit from seizure by the IRS if the IRS can take it
as soon as you get it?'' He has filed an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case began in March 1990 after James Rudel of Wallis, Texas,
filled in for a sick friend at a convenience store and was murdered
by a bandit. Rudel's own business, a flower shop, then failed,
leaving $5,000 in unpaid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   His widow received $172.58 a week in workers' compensation
benefits until late 1994, when she remarried and received $17,110
in a lump sum to close her claim. Two months later the IRS tapped
her bank account for $10,000 to cover the back taxes, penalties and
interest.

SUNTRUST BANK TO RESTATE EARNINGS DUE TO EXCESS LOAN RESERVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When federal regulators become concerned about how banks account
for loans, most often they worry that the institutions have not set
enough money aside to cover expected losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said that
Suntrust Bank Inc. had done just the reverse. The bank had set
aside too much money in its reserves, they said. In essence, the
bank had said in its financial statements that it would not collect
on some outstanding loans even though they will most likely be
paid.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with regulators, Suntrust agreed to decrease its
loan reserves by $100 million _ an adjustment that will force the
bank to restate earnings for 1994, 1995 and 1996. After the
corrections, earnings in those years will spring up by a total of
$61 million after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are concerned that companies of all types, enjoying
booming profits in recent years, have been improperly increasing
their reserves as a way of insulating themselves from shareholder
anger when business turns bad.
</P>
<P>
   By increasing their reserves, when the company later has a bad
quarter, the executives can reach into the reserves for some
dollars to tack on to actual earnings so that the stock market is
not disappointed. The result: the company's financial statements do
not accurately tell investors what happened.
</P>
<P>
   But James Armstrong, a spokesman at Suntrust, said the bank's
executives had no intention of using the loan reserves to enhance
future earnings. Instead, the bank has always been conservative in
accounting for loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said the bank and the regulators had simply used
different assumptions in estimating future losses. ``Two rational
people can take the same information,'' he added, ``and come to
very different conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators had been reviewing the financial statements of
Suntrust, a large southeastern bank based in Atlanta, because of
its proposed merger with Crestar Financial Corp. Suntrust agreed in
July to acquire Crestar for $9.5 billion in stock, creating the
nation's 10th largest banking company.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the SEC has become worried about what they say
is a growing number of companies playing games with their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In September, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. condemned the
``accounting hocus-pocus,'' saying that regulators planned to crack
down on more companies that were bending or breaking the nation's
accounting rules. One of the problems, he said, was companies
creating illusions on their books by using unrealistic assumptions
to estimate liabilities for loan losses, sales returns and warranty
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stash accruals in cookie jars during the good times,'' he
said, ``and reach into them when needed in the bad times.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States imposed trade restrictions on
more than 300 Indian and Pakistani government agencies and private
companies Friday as a result of the two countries' nuclear tests
last May, Commerce Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions affect Indian and Pakistani companies believed to
be involved in nuclear, missile and military programs. They will,
in most cases, bar U.S. companies from trading with them. Commerce
Department licenses will be required for any U.S. company wishing
to export goods to the companies, and most of those licenses will
be denied, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced last week that President Clinton would
lift most of the sanctions that were imposed after the nuclear
tests by India and Pakistan. This would allow U.S. loans,
investments and some joint military training to resume. It would
also revive U.S. support for an International Monetary Fund bailout
for Pakistan.

WESLEYAN FOOTBALL: BIG PLAYS FROM SMALL COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Conn. _ Jake Fay throws the passes. Matt Perceval
catches them. Fay-to-Perceval has accounted for 12 touchdowns this
season, seven of them in Wesleyan's 55-28 season-opening victory
over Middlebury, a Division III record.
</P>
<P>
   According to National Collegiate Athletic Association records,
only one player has caught more. Paul Zaeske of North Park
University in Chicago caught eight in a 1968 Division II game.
</P>
<P>
   Fay and Perceval are the best of friends, classmates, roommates,
economics majors and cogs on one of the better Wesleyan teams in
recent decades. Besides that, they are having a very good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like it here,'' Perceval said. ``I'm so glad I
came.''
</P>
<P>
   He came a long way, from Box Elder, S.D. ``Near Rapid City,'' he
said. Fay is from ``just up the road,'' he said, meaning
Glastonbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Football at Wesleyan, and at the nine other members of the New
England Small College Athletic Conference, is perhaps what Norman
Rockwell had in mind when he painted Saturday Evening Post covers
60 years ago depicting autumnal splendor. This is football full of
good cheer, empty of evil, on leafy campuses of reputable, old
liberal arts colleges.
</P>
<P>
   And it is good football. Wesleyan coach Frank Hauser has put
together an offense that has scored 240 points in seven games and
has all the devices of more celebrated teams at higher echelons.
Fay's passing game is supplemented by the seniors Tom Themistocles
and John Pascucci, described by Hauser as running backs as good as
``you'll find in small-college football.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After winning their first four games, and extending a winning
streak to seven, dating from last season, the Cardinals (5-2) lost
to Amherst in overtime, beat Bowdoin and then were routed by
unbeaten Williams (7-0) last Saturday, 57-19. The team's resiliency
will be tested, Hauser suspects, in its finale here this Saturday
against Trinity (2-5).
</P>
<P>
   Division III college football means no athletic scholarships
and, in the case of the 10 NESCAC members, no playoffs, no bowl
games, no spring practice, no league standings and no recruiting
off the campus. The league's credo is, ``The conference was created
in 1971 out of a concern for the direction of intercollegiate
programs, and it remains committed to keeping a proper perspective
on the role of sport in higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams coach Dick Farley once said: `'If you can't play here,
you can't play anywhere. There is no Division IV.''
</P>
<P>
   Fay and Perceval can play. That was established in their
freshman seasons, when Fay became the Cardinals' starting
quarterback following an injury to an upperclassman.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two had met that fall at their first football practice. They
connected right away, and have been throwing the football 10 months
out of the year ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never exactly quit,'' Fay said.
</P>
<P>
   As juniors they have nine games left before this euphoric life
concludes _ this fall's final game and eight next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are not supposed to be formal league standings,
everyone keeps track. Williams has been the dominant force under
Farley, whose teams since 1987 have won 80, lost 12 and tied 3. The
Ephs play at Amherst (5-2) today with the Little Three title at
stake. The Little Three _ Amherst, Wesleyan and Williams _ was put
together long ago when Harvard, Princeton and Yale were called
football's Big Three.
</P>
<P>
   As for crowds, Wesleyan had its largest in years, 6,290, for the
Amherst game, and 7,190 were at Weston Field in Williamstown,
Mass., for the Williams game last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hauser's Cardinals were 7-1 last year, their best record since
they were undefeated in 1969, and they beat Williams last year for
the first time since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Football began here in 1881, and Wesleyan's prowess has been
limited. (The 1886 team lost to Yale, 136-0.) Cardinal teams have
won the Little Three competition only 12 times, to 26 for Amherst
and 40 for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   These Little Three games are special, Fay said with a glint in
his eye. ``The intensity level, the emotion, they're really
something,'' he said. ``Beating Williams last year was so great.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What about this year? ``We got blown out,'' he said, after
completing 20 of 39 passes for 308 yards and a touchdown. The
scoring pass went to Perceval, who runs the 40-yard dash in 4.4
seconds and is the team's kick-return specialist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hauser said if he had a problem with Fay, it was keeping him
free of self-blame. Fay, for example, assumed the fault was his in
the overtime loss to Amherst. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now about Perceval's seven touchdown catches in the opening
game.
</P>
<P>
   Fay said he remembered the first and third ones but not the
others. Perceval, acting shy, recounted one or two, a slant here, a
fade there. Two were for 57 and 64 yards, and six of them came in
the first half. If they had only saved a few for the Williams game.

STARR INDICTS HUBBELL, OFFERS NEW EVIDENCE ON WILLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The impeachment case against President Clinton took
a dramatic twist Friday as the independent counsel, Kenneth W.
Starr, for the first time provided the House with evidence
involving former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey's allegation
that Clinton groped her near the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   On a second front, Starr indicted Clinton's friend Webster L.
Hubbell on 15 felony charges, including that he covered up his and
Hillary Rodham Clinton's roles in real-estate deals that stem from
the original Whitewater case. Mrs. Clinton faces no charges in the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Both developments altered the impeachment landscape and raised
suspicions among Clinton supporters that Starr is poised to unleash
more damaging material as he prepares to appear next week as the
only major witness in the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, whose office investigated Willey's allegations, did not
assert in the material sent to the Judiciary Committee that Clinton
committed an impeachable offense in the matter. The material was
not made public.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the independent counsel's earlier referral on Clinton's
sexual affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, which outlined 11 possible
impeachment charges, Starr left it to the Judiciary Committee to
decide what action, if any, to take on Willey's allegation.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the panel ultimately takes no action, the material
is expected to be highlighted by committee Republicans and used
against the president in next week's partisan proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Willey has alleged that Clinton tried to kiss her, fondled her
breasts, and put her hands on his genitals when she went to the
Oval Office in 1993 to ask him for a salaried job in the White
House. Clinton has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do any of that,'' Clinton told Starr and his deputies
during grand jury testimony in August.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hubbell case, the indictments refer to Mrs. Clinton only
as Hubbell's ``billing partner'' in Little Rock's Rose Law Firm,
where the two lawyers worked on real-estate transactions involving
the failed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments charge Hubbell with fraud, perjury, ``corruptly
impeding federal regulators,'' and lying to Congress in its 1995
Whitewater investigation. If convicted, Hubbell could face a
maximum of 110 years in prison and up to $4 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, a former Clinton golf partner and associate US attorney
general, went to prison in 1995 for 18 months in a case brought by
Starr. He was convicted of bilking his law partners and clients. A
federal court recently dismissed multiple tax-evasion charges that
Starr additionally brought against Hubbell and his wife, Suzy,
although Starr is appealing the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, coming just days before Starr's testimony before
the Judiciary Committee, lets his office show some results from its
long investigation and casts more negative light on the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell assailed the latest indictments as part of an ongoing to
attempt by Starr to coerce him to provide incriminating evidence
against the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped I could start my life anew again'' after prison,
Hubbell said outside his suburban Washington home. ``I'm now of the
belief that I may never be able to do so. I just do not know what
it is going to take to make this matter end.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell's lawyer, John Nields, asserted his client's innocence
and harshly criticized Starr. ``It is wrong for a prosecutor to
keep on indicting the same man over and over again in the hope that
he may one day tell him something about his real quarry,'' Nields
said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House issued a statement that said, ``The president
and first lady are saddened by today's events involving Webb
Hubbell and would like to express their concern for Webb and his
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the new Willey evidence, mostly transcripts of grand
jury testimony and FBI interviews, was picked up Friday at Starr's
office by House investigators and Capitol Police. Filling four
boxes, two each of identical material for the committee's
Republican and Democratic staffs, the evidence was locked under
armed guard in a congressional office building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigative materials have been received in executive
session by the committee,'' Judiciary Chairman Henry J. Hyde, an
Illinois Republican, said in a terse statement. ``Until such time
as the committee votes to release the materials from executive
session, House rules prohibit the disclosure of information
describing the contents of the materials.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Starr's deputy, Robert
J. Bittman, said the material was being made available in response
to the panel's request on Oct. 2 for ``any further information
gathered during our investigation'' of the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limited availability of these materials will not in our
judgment jeopardize any ongoing investigations,'' Bittman said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats questioned the timing of Starr's move, so
close to next week's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is public relations, not prosecution,'' said Jim Jordan,
spokesman for Democrats on the Judiciary Committee. ``The
independent counsel has chosen not to make a referral, not to issue
an indictment, but rather to attempt to influence public opinion
prior to his appearance before Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers said they suspected Starr provided the
material because he wants to discuss the Willey allegations in his
testimony next week. For Starr to do that, however, the committee
would need to first approve release of the material.
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats gave no indication they would try to block
releasing the evidence, they expressed little support for Starr's
decision to make the material available just before his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume he thinks it will reflect badly on the president,
even though he obviously doesn't see there is any basis in it for
action against the president,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat and senior member of the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat
who serves on the panel: ``The timing is really unfortunate. Part
of the reason the public has so little confidence in this
investigation is this kind of timing and political gamesmanship
that has been ongoing and has undermined its credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Willey and several of her friends testified before the Starr
grand jury. Starr also reportedly gathered evidence to support
Willey's allegation, including a videotape of Clinton asking a
Virginia politician about Willey and phone logs showing that
Clinton called her numerous times at home.

GAME MAKERS ARE TRYING TO TURN THE YEAR AROUND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the computer game industry envisions the holiday season, it
sees fighter aces, Al Capone and a bizarre Swamp Thing-like
creature called Abe.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few of the characters that the game companies
are counting on for a lift at the end of a year that has been only
slightly more rewarding than a player's computer freezing just as
the final goal is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that players have been deprived of new diversions this
year. But the picture has not been captivating for investors.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's midsized stalwarts, including Activision Inc.,
the GT Interactive Software Corp. and Eidos PLC of Britain, have
seen their stocks decline or post only meager gains since Jan. 1.
And many of the electronic game stocks that have risen, including
those of Acclaim Entertainment Inc. and the 3DO Co., have done so
from base prices of less than $5 a share.
</P>
<P>
   It has not helped that two of the industry's most important
developers _ Blizzard Entertainment and Sierra Online _ are owned
by the Cendant Corp., which has been roiled by disclosures of
accounting irregularities. The stock of Electronic Arts Inc., the
industry's dominant company, has returned 13.7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the problem has been that a game company's quarterly
performance can often ride on a single title, in much the same way
that a movie studio's fortunes wax and wane with each new film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Street is accustomed to asking for forecasts 12 to 14
months in advance, and that can be tough to provide, because there
is an intersection of the business with the creative process,''
said Ronald Chaimowitz, chairman of GT Interactive. Chaimowitz is
counting on Abe, the creature, to make a success of one of GT's
main titles, Abe's Exodus.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Kotick, Activision's chief executive, pointed out that
only as companies become large do they gain the ability to manage
their business effectively by shuffling projects. For instance,
when Sin, a highly anticipated Activision game, failed to
materialize last quarter, the company was able to rush out a
package of remakes of old Atari games to fill its place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, we would not have been able to do that, because you
don't have enough to work with,'' Kotick said. Now, Activision is
depending on Sin to jump-start its holiday sales.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have taken note. ``There's a flight to quality among
investors that's favoring companies with extremely good execution
and predictability,'' said Lawrence F. Marcus, an analyst for BT
Alex. Brown in San Francisco. ``This holiday season should be
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus predicts that the stock of Electronic Arts, now at $43,
will reach $51 in 6 to 12 months. His target for Activision, now
trading at $13.5625, is $18.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen S. Fleming, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson
Stephens, has a six-month target of $11 on Acclaim, which closed on
Friday at $8.6875.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday season will give each game company a chance to make
1998 a success. Last year, for instance, the fourth calendar
quarter provided about 81 percent of Electronic Arts' earnings for
its fiscal year, which ended in March.
</P>
<P>
   With less than two weeks until the start of the holiday shopping
season, many are cuddling up in the warmth of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all the returns are in and we look at the sell-through
results for the full calendar year,'' said Lawrence F. Probst III,
chairman of Electronic Arts, ``I think this will be the biggest
year in the history of the video game industry.''

RUSSIAN REQUEST ON SPACE STATION IS SET ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to
set aside a last-minute Russian request to launch an international
space station into an orbit closer to Mir, officials announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While putting the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir
station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies
from the old outpost to the new one, the request came too late to
be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program
manager.
</P>
<P>
   NASA was surprised last week when Russia's prime station
contractor proposed the orbital position change just two-and-a-half
weeks before launch of the first part of the new station.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying the Nov. 20 flight by 10 hours to match the orbits
would have forced similar shifts in the subsequent assembly
flights, and resulted in potentially unfavorable sun angles on the
solar-powered station, engineers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent to
make these changes,'' Brinkley said during a news conference held
at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. ``It added technical
complexity and risks to the mission that were not justified.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which followed ``frank and candid'' discussions
between the two partners, was not imposed by the United States, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusions were mutual,'' Brinkley said. ``Both sides
concluded that it did not make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, struggling to find money for their space program
with their nation in economic collapse, had said they wanted to
transfer thousands of pounds of newer equipment and scientific
instruments from Mir as an economy move.
</P>
<P>
   However, some critics questioned the Russians' motives,
wondering if the requested orbital change was part of plan to delay
the decommissioning and destruction of Mir, which the Russians have
agreed to do next summer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Russians have so little money that the United States and
other partners in the international station fear that money spent
on Mir will prevent Russia from meeting its obligations with the
new project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mir competes with the international space station for very
critical resources and for funding,'' Brinkley said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir's research equipment
to use on the international space station, he said, but only if it
does not interfere with assembling the new station.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and 15 other nations plan to begin building
the new station in orbit next week when the Russians launch a
module that will supply power and propulsion during the early
stages of the five-year construction period.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle Endeavor is to follow on Dec. 3 with the
second station part, a U.S.-built connecting passageway that
attaches to the first module.

<P>
   It should come as no surprise that investors out to shield
themselves from the recent market volatility would dive into the
stocks of drug makers. After all, people get sick regardless of
market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But what no one could have predicted was that some investors
would pass up such comet stocks as Warner-Lambert, up 76.5 percent
this year, and Schering-Plough, up 64 percent, for the likes of
Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what they have been doing.
</P>
<P>
   On the day last month when Schering-Plough reported a 22 percent
gain in third-quarter earnings, its stock actually dropped 1.9
percent, to $98.50. Bristol-Myers reported only a 13 percent gain
the same day, and its shares increased 68.75 cents, to $105.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson was also defying gravity. Despite the
company's report of an 11 percent gain in third-quarter earnings,
one of the worst performances in the pharmaceutical industry, its
shares are now at a record high of $84.625.
</P>
<P>
   Has the world gone mad?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. Investors who fear an economic downturn are snapping up
shares of Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Bristol-Myers, the drug industry's
two most consistent players. Aside from producing steady earnings
quarter after quarter, both are remarkably diversified and
inexpensive compared with most of their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bristol-Myers Squibb and Johnson &AMP; Johnson are strong growth
stocks for the long term,'' said David Saks, a managing director of
Gruntal &AMP; Co. who manages the company's four health care unit
investment trusts. ``I've included both stocks in our funds because
they deliver consistent earnings. And I'm like most investors: I
don't like surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have been so predictable in their businesses
over the years that some investors have dismissed them as dull.
While other drug makers have rushed to become so-called
life-sciences companies, with holdings in agribusiness,
biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, Johnson &AMP; Johnson and
Bristol-Myers have refused to abandon an operating strategy that
was popular in the 70s and 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, drug companies loaded up on disparate businesses as a
way to bolster revenues in case health maintenance organizations
forced a cut in drug prices. Before the end of the 80s, American
Home Products, for example, was selling not only Premarin, one of
the world's top hormone replacement drugs, but also a variety of
medical gadgets and Chef Boy-Ar-Dee spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, however, most drug companies have shed
their lower-profit-margin baggage; American Home sold 80 percent of
its food division to Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Bristol-Myers have held fast to the
strategy of diversification. Besides producing medical equipment
and prescription drugs, Johnson &AMP; Johnson makes household-brand
products like Tylenol and Band-Aid adhesive bandages, while
Bristol-Myers peddles Herbal Essences shampoo and other Clairol
hair-care products.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning is that diversity can be a big help in cushioning
earnings when the patents on popular drugs expire.
</P>
<P>
   These broad product mixes catch the eyes of conservative
investors. ``With Bristol-Myers Squibb, it's steady as she goes,''
said Dr. Kris Jenner, an analyst with T. Rowe Price. He said the
stock, which closed at $111.0625 on Friday, could hit $125 to $130
over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   But neither of these two drug giants is a slouch on the
pharmaceutical side. Thanks largely to Pravachol, a
cholesterol-reducing agent, and Taxol, an anti-cancer drug,
Bristol-Myers recorded $5.69 billion in United States
pharmaceutical sales last year, the most for any company, according
to IMS Health, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson finished a close second in that category, at
$5.66 billion. The company should have three drugs this year with
annual sales above $1 billion: Procrit, for anemia; Propulsid, the
gastrointestinal agent, and Risperdal, an antipsychotic.
</P>
<P>
   Only Merck and Pfizer should have more billion-dollar sellers.
(Saks said shares of Johnson &AMP; Johnson could hit $103 in 12 months,
compared with $84.625 today.)
</P>
<P>
   To an aggressive investor, the 28.5 percent gain in Johnson &AMP;
Johnson stock this year and the 17.4 percent increase for
Bristol-Myers might seem a sorry performance, considering that the
Standard &AMP; Poor's Drugs Index is up 38.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the stocks look attractive in other ways: Both have beaten
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which is up 16 percent this
year. And each has a price-to-earnings ratio near that of the
overall market _ a rare characteristic among drug stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The average large drug stock has a P/E of 39, compared with 28.5
for the S&AMP;P 500. Johnson &AMP; Johnson's ratio is 31.7, slightly lower
than Bristol's 31.3. That's a fire sale compared with
Warner-Lambert's ratio of 52.2 and Pfizer's 55.9.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely, meanwhile, that Johnson &AMP; Johnson or
Bristol-Myers shareholders will toss and turn at night, as
investors in Warner-Lambert might well have done last December,
when the company's shares tumbled 18.5 percent in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff was prompted by Glaxo Wellcome's announcement that
it was yanking Rezulin, a leading diabetes drug that Warner-Lambert
sold in the United States, from the British market because of
concerns about possible liver toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert's shares have more than recovered from the
losses, but that's clearly the type of surprise that conservative
shareholders can do without.

CLINTON AGREES TO PAY JONES $850,000 TO DROP SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BENNET and NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton agreed Friday to pay Paula Jones
$850,000 to drop her legal claim that he crudely propositioned her
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The payment settles a lawsuit that Clinton's advisers had once
mocked but that, by forcing his intimate life into public view, had
begun threatening his hold on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the agreement, Mrs. Jones dropped what she had once
called her most important demand: that Clinton apologize and admit
wrongdoing. She had wanted him to acknowledge that in 1991, when he
was governor of Arkansas and she a clerk employed by the state, he
had her summoned to a Little Rock hotel room and made a lewd
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Through his lawyer, Robert Bennett, the president continued
Friday to call Mrs. Jones' accusation baseless. But by settling, he
was able to eliminate the risk that an appeals court would prolong
the case, which was dismissed in April by a U.S. District Court
judge in Little Rock. Clinton's advisers had feared that Mrs. Jones
would win her appeal, and that her lawyers would be able to depose
the president once again.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials believe that the settlement will also help
congressional Democrats protect him from impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   It was in a deposition in the Jones case on Jan. 17 that Clinton
denied a sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. Out of the president's efforts to conceal that affair
from Mrs. Jones' lawyers, Independent Prosecutor Kenneth Starr
built a case for possible impeachment on perjury, witness-tampering
and obstruction-of-justice charges that the House Judiciary
Committee is now considering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has decided he is not prepared to spend one more
hour on this matter,'' Bennett said in announcing the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's busy schedule aside, even his allies had long viewed
the expense to him of not settling the case sooner _ in prestige,
political capital and perhaps his place in history _ as
incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the settlement was announced Friday, some Clinton
loyalists lamented the for-want-of-a-nail element. One adviser just
groaned when asked if he wished the president had settled earlier.
Another Clinton associate said that if the case had been settled
earlier, ``no one would know who Monica Lewinsky was.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John Whitehead, one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said, ``The
settlement brings to a conclusion four long years of seeking
justice for Paula.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The suit has raised a lot of important issues that the
American people and their leaders will have to deal with for years
to come,'' Whitehead added, ``such as the importance of protecting
powerless women from workplace harassment and the role of the rule
of law in our highest offices.''
</P>
<P>
   The terse, seven-point agreement, filed Friday with the Little
Rock judge, Susan Webber Wright, calls for Clinton to pay Mrs.
Jones within 60 days. Advisers to the president said that the money
will come from a legal defense fund established for the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate agreement that was not disclosed, Mrs. Jones'
lawyers said that she renounced any intention to accept money from
Abe Hirschfeld, a New York City real estate magnate.
</P>
<P>
   White House advisers said they hoped that the $850,000 could be
covered by Clinton's personal insurance policies. But if the two
companies who have insured the president declined to pay, the
advisers said, the money would come from the president's legal
defense fund, which now has a balance of more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is said by associates to be
particularly concerned about her family's mounting legal bills, had
been worried that a settlement might make too big a dent in the
defense fund. But the Clintons' fund-raisers assured her that they
could easily replenish any funds used toward a Jones settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had also been opposed to any settlement that
included an apology, aides said, since it would have carried an
acknowledgment of conduct the president denied. The agreement filed
Friday states: ``Nothing in this agreement shall by construed to be
an admission of liability or wrongdoing by any party.''

HEALTH EXPERTS FEAR EPIDEMICS WILL SWEEP CENTRAL AMERICA IN WAKE OF
MITCH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ Health experts fear that pestilence could
sweep Central America in the wake of one of the most deadly and
destructive hurricanes in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to be ready for now is the disaster of
consequences,'' said Yolanda Garcia, a physician at the Nicaraguan
government's health clinic in Posoltega, a small farm town near a
Mitch-triggered mudslide that killed as many as 2,000 people on
Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Just because epidemics haven't occurred yet, she warned, doesn't
mean they won't.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of thousands of people crammed into unsanitary
refugee camps, with water supplies contaminated and with the
region's traditional fevers and intestinal maladies still lurking,
experts say it's foolish to think a major health crisis couldn't
follow the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch killed as many as 10,000 people across Central America as
it scraped through the region two weeks ago. More than 1 million
were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia and other health workers say the real challenge will come
over the next few months, when the region's contaminated water,
poor living conditions and increased population of disease-carrying
insects could pose new threats of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Illnesses already reported in the storm-battered areas include
such traditional regional afflictions as acute respiratory
infections; conjunctivitis, sometimes called pink eye; and skin
funguses that thrive in damp conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Cholera, a bacterial infection that attacks the intestinal track
and kills through severe dehydration caused by diarrhea and
vomiting, has also made an appearance. The disease, which claimed
thousands of lives throughout Latin America in 1991 and 1992, never
disappeared from the region after that epidemic. Although it can
kill within hours, cholera is easily treatable with rehydration
salts and medicines, once it is diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua's Health Ministry has reported nearly 150 confirmed or
suspected cases of the intestinal ailment. Officials in Guatemala
say 20 cases of cholera have turned up there. Honduras' government
said two suspected cases of the disease proved to be merely severe
diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Medical teams in the region have also logged cases of two
diseases transmitted to humans by mosquitoes _ malaria, with its
nightmare chills and fevers, and dengue, which causes fever, rash
and severe pain in the joints and back.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Nicaraguan health officials announced a possible
outbreak of leptospirosis, a disease caused by water-borne bacteria
that attacks the eyes, liver and other organs. Health officials in
the town of Chinandega, near the site of the mudslide, suspect that
three people who died there Wednesday had the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in refugee shelters, who often must sleep with no
bedding on the floors of schools, warehouses and government
buildings, have caught colds and the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Some health experts also worry that a measles outbreak in
Argentina and Brazil could hit the area, carried in, perhaps, by
foreign aid workers coming to help in Mitch's aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts say many of the diseases that have already
appeared have long incubation periods and that the rate of
infection could increase dramatically in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no signs of epidemics yet,'' said one international
health expert working in Honduras. ``But we're very concerned that
things could turn for the worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people now living in refugee camps are peasants
whose concepts of hygiene in the wide-open countryside are at best
ill-suited to the crowded conditions of shelters, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``These conditions increase the risks of getting sick,'' said
Alvaro Ramirez, a Managua physician who served the first half of
the decade as a top epidemiologist in Nicaragua's Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The diseases now threatening Central America are no strangers to
the region. After all, these are the tropics _ the incubator of
many of the worst maladies to torment humanity.
</P>
<P>
   In all of 1995, for example, Nicaragua _ a country of 4.3
million people _ tallied 40,000 reports of malaria, up to 30,000
reports of dengue, 16,000 reports of cholera and as many as 1.2
million reports of respiratory infections, Ramirez said. Those
figures, however, could reflect patients' repeat visits to doctors
rather than the actual incidence of the diseases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks since Mitch clobbered the country, the
Nicaraguan Health Ministry has received more than 26,000 reports of
acute respiratory illnesses, about 14,000 reports of diarrhea, 327
reports of dengue and 266 reports of malaria in addition to the
cholera reports.
</P>
<P>
   Figures are sketchier in Honduras, but officials say that each
of those illnesses stalks the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the steps to try to prevent outbreaks,'' said Dr.
Elliethe Giron, the deputy minister of health.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to control any outbreaks will depend upon having
enough medicine and enough medical facilities on hand. Both were in
short supply before Mitch and now are even more limited.
</P>
<P>
   Nine hospitals and 59 health clinics were damaged by the storm
in Honduras, officials report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flooding left many hospitals without electricity or water
_ even without roofs in a couple of cases,'' Giron said.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras' health system was inadequate even before Mitch. In
recent years, only one in four Hondurans received treatment for
infectious diseases, according to a U.N. study.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, three hospitals and 24 health clinics were damaged
in the storm. Some hospitals in both Honduras and Nicaragua report
a shortage of medicine and clean water.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua already has channeled an additional $2.2 million,
almost all of it foreign money, toward the health threat posed by
Mitch. But the Health Ministry estimates that the country needs
about twice that amount to properly deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts in Nicaragua say a major challenge will come with
the end of the rainy season in coming weeks. As floodwaters settle
in stagnant pools, disease-bearing mosquitoes will begin breeding
with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to predict what will happen,'' said Eric
Pleignet, Nicaragua's director of Doctors Without Borders, the
international medical aid agency.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Mitch's rains stopped, Health Ministry teams in
Nicaragua began visiting villages near the catastrophic mudslide to
assess residents' health. After finding the water contaminated in
many communities, the teams passed out purification tablets and set
up portable water treatment equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not just waiting for something to happen,'' Garcia
said.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing, the physician added, is to have people in
communities watch for health problems.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Nicaragua is relying on a network of community
health workers and volunteers established by the socialist
Sandinista government, which took power in a bloody revolution and
was voted from office in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say, however, that eight years of free-market policies
and dwindling government spending has gutted much of that
grass-roots system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health network has been maintained, but we lack the active
promotion of community participation,'' Ramirez said. ``The problem
with the community health workers is they have to be constantly
trained.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio Ya, the Sandinistas' national radio network, has carried
constant criticism of the government's relief efforts and has aired
a long series of claims about illnesses ranging from cholera to
dengue in outlying areas. The government, the network claims, has
either ignored or downplayed reports of diseases.

STARR REBOUNDS, INDICTING CLINTON FRIEND HUBBELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his sex and lies case against President
Clinton losing momentum on Capitol Hill, Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, Friday returned to the Whitewater
investigation, his original mandate, and indicted Clinton's
longtime friend, Webster Hubbell, for his role in the real estate
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, a former chief justice of the state of Arkansas and
once the number three official in the Clinton Justice Department,
was charged with 15 counts of fraud, false statements and trying to
impede two federal regulatory agencies as well as perjury before a
Congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment Friday marked the third time Starr brought
charges against Hubbell in his five years of investigating the
president and his wife. Hubbell pleaded guilty and spent two years
in prison for bilking his law partners, but a later indictment, for
tax fraud, was dismissed by a federal judge earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters outside his Washington home, Hubbell
denied the charges leveled Friday and said they were part of what
he described as a continuing effort by Starr to force him to
provide evidence against Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton. He said that when he left prison two years ago after the
earlier conviction by Starr, he hoped to begin life anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now of the belief that I may never be able to do so. I
just do not know what it's going to take to make this matter end,''
Hubbell said. ``What I do know is that I don't know of any
wrongdoing on behalf of the first lady or the president, and
nothing the independent counsel can do to me is going to make me
lie about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment Friday demonstrated that Starr is continuing with
his work, despite the increasingly cool response both from the
nation and from Congress to his investigations of the president.
Public and political reaction has been particularly harsh in
response to his report to Congress suggesting that Clinton may have
committed impeachable offenses in trying to cover up his affair
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As he was indicting Hubbell, Starr also sent new material to
Congress Friday about his investigation into whether Clinton lied
under oath about whether he made unwanted sexual advances in 1993
to Kathleen Willey, a White House volunteer. Willey has alleged
that Clinton groped her just outside the Oval Office when she went
to him seeking a full-time job, a charge he has denied.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the report to Congress, delivered in September, in
which he asserted that Clinton may have committed impeachable
offenses to conceal his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a White
House intern, Starr Friday made no such claim in submitting the
material on the Willey matter. In effect, Starr appeared to
acknowledge that he was unable to determine who was telling the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Hubbell indictment and the apparent disposal of the
Willey matter came only days before Starr is expected to face a
withering partisan cross-fire when he appears as the principal
witness before the House Judiciary Committee. The committee, which
is considering whether to vote impeachment charges against Clinton,
is scheduled to question Starr Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell spent nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty
to bilking his partners in the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, Ark.,
where he had once practiced law with Mrs. Clinton. But Starr was
unable to obtain what it seemed he was really after from Hubbell _
incriminating evidence against the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Starr then brought a wide-ranging indictment for tax fraud,
which Hubbell again protested was an effort to get him to testify
against the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal judge dismissed the tax fraud case, adding a
stinging rebuke of Starr, accusing the prosecutor of overstepping
his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James Robertson said that the independent counsel's
pursuit of Hubbell was a ``quintessential fishing expedition.''
Earlier he called some of Starr's constitutional views ``scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said that the tax case was too far removed from
Starr's original mandate of 1994 to investigate the Clintons'
business dealings in Arkansas more than a decade ago.

 &HT;    Starr secures indictment of Clinton friend Hubbell
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than a week before independent counsel Kenneth
Starr takes the witness stand in the House impeachment inquiry of
President Clinton, he surprised Capitol Hill by securing a sweeping
indictment of one of the president's closest friends and sending
congressional investigators new evidence about alleged sexual
misconduct in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury convened by Starr accused Webster Hubbell,
a long-time friend of the Clintons, of 15 counts of fraud, perjury
and impeding an investigation of the Whitewater land deal in
Arkansas. At about the same time Friday, Starr forwarded evidence
about a sexual overture that former White House volunteer Kathleen
Willey said the president made toward her.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury indictment also mentions First Lady Hillary
Clinton, according to the Associated Press. While the indictment
doesn't identify the first lady by name, it refers to her three
dozen times as the Rose Law Firm's ``billing partner'' in 1985-86,
according to AP. She and Hubbell were partners at the Rose firm
where they were involved in some of the transactions cited in the
indictment that stems from the original Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   For Hubbell, the indictment marks the third time that Starr has
sought an indictment against him, leading his attorney, John
Nields, note that ``it is not normal for a prosecutor to keep
indicting the same person over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell denounced the indictment, saying ``I do not know of any
wrongdoing on behalf of the first lady and president and nothing
the independent counsel can do to me is going to make me lie about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats attacked the timing of Starr's actions, saying it was
a ``calculated and desperate'' attempt to bring new life to an
impeachment inquiry that appears to have lost support among House
Republicans following the GOP's election day losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of Ken Starr's vendetta, he's trying to
desperately pile on before the hearing next week,'' said New York
Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a member of the House Judiciary
Committee, the panel charged with handling the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has alleged that the president lied, obstructed justice
and tampered with witnesses to conceal his affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. He is slated to appear before the
Judiciary Committee on Thursday to answer questions about his
nine-month investigation into the Lewinsky affair as the panel
weighs whether to draft articles of impeachment. The hearing marks
the third time in the nation's history that an impeachment inquiry
has been convened against a president.
</P>
<P>
   The latest batch of evidence from Starr's office includes two
boxes of material that investigators say support Willey's
allegation that the president made made an unwanted sexual advance
toward her five years ago when she sought his confidence about her
former husband's business troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The material is not considered a formal referral accusing
Clinton of committing impeachable crimes as the Lewinsky report
was. Rather, it is considered additional information that the
committee can chose to include in its investigation into whether
the president has committed impeachable crimes.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats view the new evidence with suspicion, Illinois
Republican Henry Hyde, the chairman of the committee, noted that
the additional materials came following a bipartisan request for
additional materials from Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde placed the additional materials, which include grand jury
transcripts, depositions and witness interviews, under lock and key
at the Ford Office Building where other Starr's other material was
taken in September. The material will remain there until the
committee decides whether to release it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that Ken Starr is engaged in a rather desperate
public relations campagin in anticipation of his appearance before
Congress next week,'' said Jim Jordan, press secretary for the
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Republican Bob Barr, a member of the Judiciary
Committee, said he has not reviewed the new material, but if it
supports material already gathered by Starr and the committee, then
it will undoubtedly strengthen the case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see how it would not strengthen the case against
him,'' said Barr, who called for the president's ouster even before
the Lewinsky story broke. ``I can't see how it would help him to
have additional impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the GOP losses on election day had eroded support
for impeaching the president, Barr said that he hoped members would
wait for the the committee to do its job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in the final analysis there are a majority of members in
the House that don't that is up to them,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems rather irresponsible for Democrats or Republicans to
jump to a conclusion before we've even done what they've ordered us
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics does not seem to be the problem as much as members who
``either don't have the interest or the back bone to move forward
on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to both of Starr's reactions, Jim Kennedy, special
adviser to the White House counsel, said ``once again the
independent counsel has seen fit to send secret grand jury material
to the House. We have not been allowed to see the material and
therefore cannot comment on its contents.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kennedy said that the president and first lady ``are
saddened by today's events involving Webb Hubbell and would like to
express their concern for Webb and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time that Starr has brought charges against
Hubbell, the former high-ranking Justice Department official.
Hubbell already served prison time for defrauding and overbilling
clients at his former Arkansas law firm. Starr indicted him again
on tax charges, but a federal judge dismissed the case earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest indictment alleges that Hubbell ``devised and
participated in a scheme that corruptly endeavored to impede'' two
federal agencies who were investigating the failed Whitewater land
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, the indictment alleges, sought to hide the true nature
of his law firm's work on behalf of his father-in-law and a savings
and loan bank owned by one-time business partners of the Clintons,
James and Susan McDougal.

BIN LADEN WAS TARGET OF AIR STRIKES, U.S. ACKNOWLEDGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the clear but unstated objectives of last
August's raid on Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as
many of his lieutenants as possible, administration officials now
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officials, White House lawyers conducted a
secret review in the months before the attack and concluded that
such operations are legal under U.S. and international law.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the raid was timed so that more than 70
cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps at the moment when the
Central Intelligence Agency believed he would be meeting there with
his chief operatives.
</P>
<P>
   A 1976 executive order bars anyone working for the U.S.
government from plotting or carrying out assassinations. But
officials said the White House legal opinion drafted before the
Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority to target
the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A top U.S. counterterrorism official said this week that the
infrastructure of bin Laden's group is mostly ``human.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective
was to disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the
bin Laden terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C.
Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting infrastructure, officials acknowledged, can also mean
destroying the leadership of a terrorist group. ``Command and
control of an enemy is a justifiable target,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials said they never discussed
killing bin Laden in their planning sessions. His death, they said
in interviews after the attack, would simply have been a side
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that bin Laden
was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears to have
left unscathed before the missiles hit. Officials said there were
reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have died
in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were
between 50 and 100.
</P>
<P>
   Administration spokesmen have drawn a distinction between
attempting to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attacking a
group of people who command a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have denied since August that the raid
was intended to kill bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged
by federal prosecutors with leading a global war against U.S.
interests. He has been linked to the Aug. 7 bombing of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But a less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense
Secretary William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia
that the United States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't quite successful,'' Cohen continued, ``but we sent
a message.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said the secretary had
not retracted his statements.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times recently reported that the administration
believed that it had a legal right to use deadly force against
terrorist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's organization was a significant concern for the
Clinton administration even before the bombing of the U.S.
embassies in East Africa. Last spring, officials said, U.S.
intelligence considered a daring raid into Afghanistan to capture
the Saudi exile.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that at roughly the same time, the White House
drafted the legal justification for military attacks against a
terrorist leadership.
</P>
<P>
   That review, officials said, provided the legal basis in August
to fire cruise missiles into the meeting at which it was believed
bin Laden and his lieutenants would be gathered. The review, by the
National Security Council, was the basis for saying this operation
did not violate the presidential order banning assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   That ban was imposed by President Ford in 1975, after
congressional investigators uncovered evidence that the CIA had
plotted to assassinate Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, and others.
The order said: ``No person employed by, or acting on behalf of the
United States government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in,
assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is, on its face, a sweeping and unqualified ban, it has
been subject to interpretation and intense debate over the years.
In 1986, the Reagan administration responded to a terrorist attack
against U.S. soldiers in Germany with a bombing raid on Libya. The
targets included the residence of the Libyan leader, Moammar
Gadhafi. And in the Gulf War, U.S. forces used powerful bombs in an
attempt to kill Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The legal review conducted by the White House would appear to
provide a precedent for future operations in similar circumstances.

FOR BRAZIL, THE CHALLENGE IS ONLY BEGINNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With Brazil-Bailout) 
(mk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Ending nearly three months of
uncertainty here, the International Monetary Fund on Friday
announced a $41.5 billion rescue package for Brazil that will
require a level of sustained economic discipline that Latin
America's largest nation has never demonstrated in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials and economic experts responded with
restrained relief and confidently predicted that their country
would be equal to the tough challenge it will face over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the accord made public in Washington Friday,
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is obliged during that period
to carry out a combination of spending cuts and tax increases
adding up to a whopping $84 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One goal, which had not been spelled out before Friday, is to
bring the federal budget into a surplus next year equal to 2.6
percent of the economy. The program calls for the surplus to
increase to 2.8 percent and 3 percent of the economy by 2000 and
2001, respectively. The surpluses are determined before any
interest or debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the main elements of the plan are in line with
reports that had leaked out before the official announcement: The
IMF will provide $18 billion in funds, and $4.5 billion more will
come from the World Bank, with a similar contribution from the
Inter-American Development Bank. The United States and 19 other
countries will supply $14.5 billion, of which Washington kicks in
the largest amount, $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a definitive solution,'' Carlos Kawall, chief
economist for Citibank in Sao Paulo, Brazil, said Friday. ``But it
is a decisive step toward restoring credibility and reducing the
risk-aversion problem we have been having as a result of crises
elsewhere, especially in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   With 20 governments plus various international lending
organizations having done their part, the situation now ``has to be
resolved internally,'' he added. ``We have a difficult year ahead
of us, following a year that already has not been so good, but it
won't be a total waste if we can just reverse the negative
tendencies we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Geraldo Langoni, a former president of the Brazilian
central bank, said the package announced Friday ``pulls Brazil out
of the eye of the hurricane'' that descended on the country after
the collapse of the Russian economy in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are still important reforms that have to be
implemented,'' he said. ``Now Brazil has to overcome the
credibility gap and show it is able to put these austerity measures
into practice quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the success or failure of the bailout plan
will depend on Cardoso's ability to persuade a fractious Congress
to approve the tax, administrative and other reforms required by
the agreement. The president has been able to assemble a majority
in both houses, but only by making costly concessions to allies
that have slowed the pace of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem for the president is not the opposition _ it's his
friends,'' said Alexandre de Barros, a political analyst in
Brasilia. ``This coalition he has behind him charges a high price
for its support. Most of them will agree to do what has to be done,
on the theory they will get their reward later. But others are
going to demand their pork barrel now.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Brasilia Friday, Finance Minister Pedro
Malan opened the government's campaign with an appeal to the
patriotism and better instincts of legislators. ``I would like to
express my confidence that Congress will know how to rise to the
challenges of the present moment, having already demonstrated it
can do so in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in one clear indication of the difficulties Cardoso will
face, the governor-elect of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Anthony
Garotinho, is seeking a $250 million loan from the federal
government to pay an obligatory Christmas bonus to state employees.
Brazil's problem, Garotinho recently argued, ``is not that it has
too many civil servants, but that it has too few.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Brazil's complicated federal system, the governors of the
27 states often have more influence over legislators than the
president. The tax reforms Cardoso has pledged to carry out would
severely crimp both the power of and the flow of money to governors
and mayors, and in similar situations in the past, legislators have
tended to vote not along party lines, but in the interests of their
home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets are counting on a lot of things being passed with
reasonable majorities in the next four weeks or so, which is not
unreasonable,'' said Riordan Roett, director of the Latin American
Studies program at Johns Hopkins University. ``But it is slowly
dawning on people that state governors and mayors will have to be
whipped into shape, and that that is not easily done with the snap
of anyone's fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Cardoso's Cabinet there have been signs of resistance.
Health Minister Jose Serra last week prepared a study complaining
that spending on health has grown at a rate only one-third that of
the overall budget since 1994; the study was then carefully leaked
to the press.
</P>
<P>
   But economic and political experts here were quick to draw a
distinction between Cardoso's situation and that of his crippled
Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin. Elected to a second term last
month with a resounding majority, Cardoso will be inaugurated in
January with a high level of popular support after having reduced
inflation from annual rate of 941 percent in 1994 to a current
level of zero, dramatically increasing purchasing power for the
working class.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's success in vanquishing inflation, experts said, made
Brazil's 165 million people more willing to accept the economic
recession and increased levels of unemployment that are predicted
for the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably going to have record levels of unemployment in
the first half of next year,'' said Mailson da Nobrega, a former
minister of finance, but if Cardoso succeeds in reducing interest
rates and holding the exchange rate steady, complaints will be
relatively few.
</P>
<P>
   The Sao Paulo stock market reacted gratefully in anticipation of
lower interest rates _ now at more than 40 percent _ and an
improvement in foreign reserves, which have dropped by nearly half
since the collapse of the Russian economy in August. After
declining by more than 3 percent on Thursday, the Bovespa index
rose 2 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the first time Brazil confronts this type of
crisis,'' said Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, a former Cabinet
minister who is now president of the Brazilian Foreign Trade
Association. ``But it is the first time it is confronting this type
of crisis with a stable economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there were also voices warning that the country
should not feel too cocky about its prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason for Brazilians to exchange the pessimism of
the last two months for the excessive optimism of recent days,''
the newspaper Jornal do Brasil admonished in an editorial Friday.
``Above all, caution is necessary.''

HUNDREDS OF HOMES ON EVERGLADES ARE TO MAKE WAY FOR WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a move that officials and environmentalists hailed as
a significant step toward restoring the balance of water in the
Everglades, Florida officials have decided to buy out hundreds of
residents who live in an unincorporated area of west Miami-Dade
County.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which was approved Thursday by the South Florida
Water Management District, follows almost a decade of discussion
about how to restore the natural flow of water to the Everglades.
It also heightens the debate between supporters of the plan and
about 400 homeowners, some of whom have lived in the area of nine
and one-half square miles for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The area, which floods regularly despite a levee built to
protect it, is the gateway for fresh water that flows south from
Lake Okeechobee, feeding Everglades National Park and Florida Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision came months after a study commissioned by
the management district concluded that buying the land and
returning it to its natural state as wetlands was the most
cost-effective way to provide proper water flow to the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that it will cost $115 million to $120
million to buy the houses and lots. The U.S. Department of the
Interior will pay half; the state and the county will be
responsible for the other half.
</P>
<P>
   While some residents have already sold their land to the state,
others said the buyout was an ill-conceived substitute for federal
flood-prevention plans.
</P>
<P>
   One resident, Madeleine Fortin, 48, said she planned to appeal
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've asked me to sell my house,'' Ms. Fortin, a nurse and
anthropology student who has lived in the area for four years,
said. ``I told them I'd burn it down first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress gave us flood protection. What good is our democratic
system if the will of Congress is meaningless in Florida?''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Army Corps of Engineers unveiled an $8 billion
proposal to transform the supply of water through a system of
reservoirs and channels. The web of canals and levees completed by
the corps 20 years ago does not adequately regulate water flow to
the Everglades, sometimes flooding the area and at other times
leaving it parched.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, the best thing to do is have the area under
government control,'' said John Renfrow, the director of the
Miami-Dade County Department of Environmental Resources Management.
``It would be restored to a wetland area. We would try to mimic
natural conditions.''

AIR FORCE SCRAMBLES TO SEND MORE WARPLANES TO GULF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., N.D., N.M., Ga., N.Y., Texas)   (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Clinton administration again called on Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to back down, the U.S. Air Force scrambled
Friday to send dozens of additional warplanes to the Persian Gulf,
steadily building a force large enough to carry out what Pentagon
officials described as a sustained bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The first of 139 aircraft that President Clinton ordered to the
region Wednesday left the United States, while the bulk of the
fighters and bombers, including F-117 ``stealth'' attack fighters,
are now scheduled to leave on Saturday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   An ``air expeditionary wing'' _ comprising 42 F-15s, F-16s, B-1
bombers and other support aircraft and led by the 1st Fighter Wing
out of Langley Air Force Base in Virginia _ is headed to bases in
the gulf states of Qatar and Oman, two officials familiar with the
planning said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has refused to disclose the destination of most of
the jets ordered to the region, respecting the wariness of the gulf
states to be seen as openly supporting a U.S.-led strike. But the
willingness of those states to allow U.S. forces to use their
territory as bases for potential strikes underscored how isolated
Saddam has become compared with previous confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has agreed to accept additional aerial refuelers
for use in a strike, the officials said, but has refused to allow
attack jets based in Saudi Arabia to take part in any attack on
Iraq. The refuelers will join others based at Prince Sultan Air
Base, which the United States, Britain and France use to patrol the
``no flight'' zone over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear when strikes would begin, and officials at the
White House and the Pentagon refused to give any indication they
were imminent. But the buildup of forces suggested that a decision
to resort to force was simply a matter of waiting until all the
forces are in place, as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The new forces will bolster an already formidable force in the
gulf, which includes 170 aircraft and 14 warships, led by the
aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower and armed with 250 to 350
Tomahawk cruise missiles. The Pentagon has also ordered another
carrier, the Enterprise, to speed up its arrival in the gulf by
three days, to Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   When all the reinforcements arrive, U.S. forces in the region
will be nearly as large as they were during last winter's
confrontation with Iraq, when 44,000 troops, more than 400 aircraft
and 34 warships were in position to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Although Defense officials have said the options before Clinton
include an immediate quick strike with cruise missiles, the
Pentagon's planning appears to have shifted to a larger, more
sustained barrage against targets that would include military
bases, communication centers and factories involved in the making
or stockpiling of chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not talking about a strike,'' a Pentagon official said,
requesting anonymity. ``You're talking about a sustained
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why, this and other officials said, the new deployments
included the heavier bombers and strike aircraft. A senior
administration official said Friday that the United States was
prepared to follow up any strike with additional strikes to make
sure Saddam did not rebuild chemical or biological weapons or pose
new threats to his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Six B-52 bombers, loaded with air-launched cruise missiles with
2,000-pound warheads, prepared to leave Barksdale Air Force Base in
Louisiana. Along with six others from Minot Air Force Base in North
Dakota, they are expected to arrive at the British base on Diego
Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen F-117s, whose ``stealth'' technology allow them to evade
radar and attack with precision, are scheduled to leave Holloman
Air Force Base in New Mexico on Sunday, headed for Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, squadrons from 17 bases in the United States have
mobilized following Clinton's order Wednesday, the largest single
deployment to the Persian Gulf area since October 1994, when the
United States responded to the movement of Iraqi forces to the
Kuwait border.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 4,000 soldiers from three Army bases _ Fort Stewart in
Georgia, Fort Drum in New York and Fort Bliss in Texas _ have also
been ordered to the gulf. Gen. Anthony Zinni, the commander of U.S.
forces in the region, decided to send the forces, officials said,
as a reassurance to the Kuwaitis in the unlikely event Iraq invaded
Kuwait.

KPMG ENDS SUIT AGAINST RIVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting and consulting firm, has
dropped a lawsuit accusing a rival, Stern Stewart &AMP; Co., of
unfairly trying to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this past year, Stern Stewart has apparently ceased the
activities which forced KPMG to commence this lawsuit,'' KPMG said
in a statement. ``Since its goal has effectively been accomplished,
KPMG believes there is no reason for further processing of the
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern Stewart disputed the KPMG account Friday. ``Our position
from the beginning has been that KPMG's suit was utterly without
merit,'' the firm said in a statement. ``Stern Stewart never
engaged in unfair competitive practices, as KPMG originally
alleged. Nor have we modified our marketing or competitive
practices in any way, as KPMG now asserts.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern Stewart is a former audit client of KPMG. Last year, a New
York judge ruled that KPMG had violated obligations to Stern
Stewart when KPMG entered the same type of consulting business.
KPMG is appealing that decision.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 1 p.m. Thursday, cool melodies and shimmering
chords floated over midtown Manhattan. These were the sweetest
sounds to date from a deepening labor dispute between National
Basketball Association players and team owners. The unlikely source
of this music was the new NBA Store, on Fifth Avenue and 52nd
Street.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a player, the store is enemy territory; for the
owners, the store is one more golden goose. For a tourist, the
store is a cornucopia of NBA paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   For Wayman Tisdale, a recently retired NBA star, the store is
simply another stage on which to exhibit a new full-time career _
music. On Thursday waves of fans and tourists stopped in. Some
listened, some browsed, others watched a large screen showing
famous moments from NBA championship games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tisdale's quartet _ keyboards, drums, saxophone and Tisdale's
bass guitar _ provided background music from a simulated center
court stage on the ground floor of the three-story store. After his
set, Tisdale spoke about the NBA lockout. He had once served as a
player representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see both sides,'' he said. ``The players are a little
high, the owners are a little low. A couple more missed checks, a
couple more empty arenas, they'll both start to see the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see us players united. I still say us. Once a
player, always a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about performing with his band at the NBA Store, Tisdale
smiled. ``I guess they'll call me a scab,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These NBA labor wars are part of Tisdale's former life. His new
life features rhythm over movement; space and time over muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from full-time athlete to full-time musician has
been relatively painless. For most of his 12 NBA seasons, music and
basketball were ballasts in his life. If he wasn't practicing a new
shot, he was practicing a new lick on the bass. He could straddle
the fence, though basketball was his safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had two things,'' he said. ``Now I have only one.
That's an adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisdale, 34, sat out last season with injuries, and music became
a dominant part of his life. He realized the time had come to make
the break; all he needed was the nerve to break it.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tisdale's father, the Rev. Luis Tisdale, died
suddenly. Basketball helped Tisdale keep his head straight, but his
father's death shocked him into making the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that it was time for a new beginning,'' Tisdale
said. ``It was time to grow up, be a man. I couldn't lean on him
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Since being in this new world, Tisdale's view of
management-employee dynamics has shifted. Life as a full-time band
leader has broadened Tisdale's outlook on the realities of running
a business. In this view, players are like sidemen. Their priority
is showing up for the job, playing, getting paid and enjoying their
life. Owners are the bandleaders. Tisdale has to make sure
rehearsal space is guaranteed, transportation is arranged and the
sound system is right. He has to pay the musicians and establish
the value of his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the group's not getting the job done, I have to make some
changes,'' Tisdale said. ``If you're not on time, your life with me
is very short.'' Like an NBA owner, he understands the need to be
able to stick to a budget. ``When the group goes on a trip,'' he
said, ``I have to know what I will come home with. As I make money,
more money, the band should make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisdale said this was where the comparisons with NBA owners
ended, though. ``I'm going to be straight and lay it all out for
the band,'' he said, ``let them know what we're making. I'm not
going to hide things, push figures under the table. I lay it out
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   The band is all packed now, ready to go, waiting for their
leader to finish and lay out the plans for the rest of the day.
Tisdale stretches his 6-foot-9-inch frame and gives instructions:
book a rehearsal studio, load the van, solidify the guest list for
the gig. This will be his life for the next six months: Atlanta,
Washington, then out to California for a Christmas tour.
</P>
<P>
   A new life _ a hectic life but a full life. ``It feels good to
retire, go out, and have something else to do,'' Tisdale said as he
slung his bass guitar over his shoulder. ``The greatest fear, the
biggest question most players have is, What am I going to do when I
retire? You'd be surprised how many guys never really think of the
future. It's easy to get caught up in this life and think it's
never going to end, instead of realizing this is a five- or
six-year career. I was blessed: I always knew.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Wayman Lawrence Tisdale walked up the steps, out of
the NBA Store and into a new life, the rarest of breeds: he is a
former NBA player who is still playing.

ANGELOS SEES NO CONFLICT IN EFFORT TO BUY REDSKINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Angelos, who owns 60 percent of the Baltimore Orioles,
intends to bid on the Washington Redskins and is certain that if he
acquires the football team, he will meet the National Football
League's standards for dual ownership of sports franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in a telephone interview Friday if he would give up
ownership of the Orioles in order to acquire the Redskins, Angelos
said: ``No, I would not. But I don't think that question is even
applicable. The rule states that in order to own a team in another
sport, you have to be within the same market area as the football
franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, Angelos noted, operate within a 75-mile radius of
the Redskins franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins are owned by the estate of the late team owner,
Jack Kent Cooke, whose son John Kent Cooke is attempting to buy the
franchise. Reports have indicated others will bid as high as $450
million, and Angelos indicates his bid _ which will have the
backing of David Bernstein, an Orioles minority owner _ will exceed
$500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Angelos purchased the Orioles in August 1993, and since then the
franchise, benefiting from the lure of the scenic Camden Yards ball
park and Angelos' aggressive acquisition of players, has become one
of the most powerful franchises in baseball. After a 13-year
dormancy, the Orioles made the playoffs in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Angelos, a plaintiff lawyer, says he has taken ``not one
nickel'' out of the Orioles, reinvesting all earnings in the team.
He indicated he would do the same if he owned the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to buy the Redskins, he said, ``because anyone
interested in purchasing a sports franchise would have to be
interested in buying the Redskins.'' Angelos added, ``It's a
storied franchise, in the nation's capital _ it's one of the
premier franchises in the NFL, and that automatically would make it
attractive.''

LOYOLA MARYMOUNT TAKES A RUN AT TURNAROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Haywood Eaddy, along with six of his teammates,
ran excruciating workouts on the sand dunes. A guy from Baltimore
should understand there's a better way to spend summer beach time,
unless you're doing it with the thought of winter in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new style of basketball at Loyola Marymount.
Which also happens to be the old style of basketball at LMU. The
popular style of hoop. The fun way to play.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to improve from successive seven-win seasons, the Lions
are returning to their old, successful ways.
</P>
<P>
   It's basketball's version of the run-and-shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get back to playing exciting basketball,'' said
second-year coach Charles Bradley, who went 7-20 in his first
season. ``Last year we didn't have the personnel to do it, and now
we're moving in that direction. I think with a couple more years of
recruiting, we'll be sitting pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unconscionable, but the Lions haven't scored more than 100
points in a game since the 1993-94 season. Yes, the school which
once reached 130 with ease can't reach triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   It's the lasting curse of former coach John Olive, but it's
about to end. Perhaps as early as Tuesday when LMU opens the season
at home against Long Beach State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some long, rigorous practices, and we hate it
sometimes, but it gets us ready for the game,'' said Eaddy, LMU's
5-foot-4 point guard. ``The game, 40 minutes, is nothing after
three- and four-hour practices of running and running and running.
It's easier than practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the teams of the past, LMU will attempt to run teams into
exhaustion, and try to take over games in the final eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And the exhibition omens are good, and not because the Lions won
both times. It's the scoring LMU likes.
</P>
<P>
   Against the High Five Americans, the Lions scored 119 points and
put up 94 shots. Thursday against the California All-Stars, LMU
attempted 30 shots from 3-point range and won 103-93.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like open gym,'' said forward Tim Kennedy, one of four
seniors in the starting lineup. ``We have a lot of good athletes
and can get up and down the floor. We're a little smaller, so it's
(a good system) for us.''

EDITORIAL: LAWSUITS AGAINST HANDGUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has now joined New Orleans in a promising new legal
offensive against gun violence. On Thursday, Chicago's mayor,
Richard Daley, filed a $433 million lawsuit against 22 gun
manufacturers, four gun distributors, and 12 suburban stores. The
suit charged them them with creating a ``public nuisance'' by
knowingly flooding the city, which has some of the nation's
strictest gun control laws, with illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's lawsuit follows by just two weeks a related legal
action against the gun industry filed by New Orleans, based on
different legal grounds. The purpose of both suits, as well as
stepped-up litigation by individuals against gun makers, is to
force a recalcitrant industry to make its deadly product less
accessible to criminals and children.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the gun industry deny responsibility for gun
violence and deride the suits as a far-fetched attempt to duplicate
the success of the anti-tobacco litigation. They also threaten to
use their political muscle if, as expected, Philadelphia and other
big cities follow up with their own lawsuits _ overlooking the
strong support for gun control among voters. But as a legal matter,
the weapons makers have good reason to be worried.
</P>
<P>
   No one can say how the courts will respond to the central
premise of the Chicago case _ that gun manufacturers intentionally
saturate gun stores just outside city limits with more guns than
the lawful market could possible absorb, in order to supply a large
and profitable illegal market. But judges and juries are aware that
gun violence imposes heavy costs on urban America. They are also
likely to be impressed by evidence produced by undercover
operatives that criminals can easily buy guns at suburban stores
for criminal acts inside the Chicago city limits. Laurence Tribe, a
Harvard Law School professor who helped prepare some of the
successful litigation against the tobacco industry, suggests that
the manufacturers' argument that they are several steps removed
from the actual sale of guns may not be enough to escape liability.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed by the mayor of New Orleans, Marc Morial, takes a
different legal approach, using the traditional claim of product
liability to try to hold the gun industry accountable. By failing
to incorporate feasible safety devices, Morial argues, firearms
manufacturers have made their product ``unreasonably dangerous.''
The idea that a manufacturer's responsibility extends beyond the
gun's owner and intended users to unintended users, like children,
gives the case a certain novelty. But the principle that a
manufacturer can be held liable for damage caused by a product that
is ``unreasonably dangerous'' is solidly imbedded in Louisiana law.
</P>
<P>
   The technology exists to make guns safer and to ``personalize''
a weapon so that only its owner can fire it _ by, for instance,
installing a simple combination lock. It should not be necessary to
sue the industry to force it to meet its obligations. But so far
nothing else has worked.

   KEY WEST, Fla. _ All that remains of the cruise ship are two
life rafts, seven life jackets, part of a wooden staircase, crew
members' photographs clutched by mothers at a vigil and, eerily,
images of the ship in full sail posted on the Internet by its
passengers, as though they were flowers tossed on water to honor
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Fantome, the ship itself, once regal and filled with rum-spiced
laughter and steel-drum songs as it plied the Caribbean, lies on
the bottom of the sea off the coast of Honduras. The 30 West Indian
crew members, along with their 32-year-old British-born captain,
disappeared with it in one of the worst tropical storms in history.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's final hours as Hurricane Mitch slammed into Central
America with 180-mph winds, devastating four countries and killing
more than 11,000 people, is the subject of lawsuits filed this week
in Miami by families of crew members. The suits charge that the
ship's owner, Windjammer Barefoot Cruises of Miami, sent the
sailors on a suicide mission by ordering the ship out to sea in the
face of the storm to save the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials, who continue to search for crew members and
clues to the sinking, say their decision was correct at the time,
and was standard marine practice, but the storm changed course and
enveloped the ship as it was on the verge of safety. The standard
marine practice in such a case would be for a ship to go to sea to
avoid being battered against the dock, experts say, and in the
Caribbean trying to sail south of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever sailors gather now along the Eastern seaboard and in
maritime schools, the Fantome debate is raging, as participants try
to imagine being at the helm of a ship as long as a football field
in the strongest type of hurricane, category five, with waves 50
feet high and the ship rolling to 40 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   While questioning the decision of the company and the captain,
tall-ship captains and experts on hurricanes and sea safety agree
that no matter how good the ship and crew, sometimes storms win. In
the case of Fantome, they say, it is almost as if the hurricane
hunted it down.
</P>
<P>
   Fantome's regular six-day cruise from Omoa, Honduras, to Belize
and back was a normal milk run for Fantome. Passengers were
promised visits to rain forests and Belize's coral reef from the
282-foot steel-hulled four-mast schooner Fantome, built in 1927 for
the duke of Westminster. It had been owned by Guinness Brewing and
Aristotle Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Windjammer officials found the ship rusting in Kiel, Germany, in
1969 and after rebuilding it at a cost of $6 million, made it the
flagship for a small fleet of vessels carrying vacationers on
cruises in which formal wear was a clean T-shirt. The price of
Fantome's cabins ranged from $875 to $1,075 a week.
</P>
<P>
   The normal crew of 45 men and women were from Guyana, Grenada
and other East Caribbean countries. Their salaries of $300 to $700
a month made them affluent in their villages. Under Capt. Guyan
March, a boyish Cornwall native, the ship had a fun-loving crew,
former passengers say.
</P>
<P>
   But on the night of Oct. 25, a Sunday, as 97 passengers were
ferried out to Fantome in Omoa for what they thought would be the
start of their cruise, rain was coming down in sheets. Though
queasy, Karen Rutledge of West Chester, Pa., remembers the sight of
the ship. ``It was beautiful,'' Ms. Rutledge said, ``lit up in the
rain. Looking back, it is a haunting vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew members had drinks and dinner on the table. March told
the passengers that Hurricane Mitch, which had formed in the
Caribbean the previous Thursday, was moving northwest. Fantome
would go east, he said, to Honduras Bay Islands.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the ship set out at midnight, March and his
boss, Michael Burke, the president of Windjammer, who was at the
company's headquarters in Miami, had decided to cancel the cruise.
Burke, 42, said Friday that it had been decided that March would
sail north 12 hours to Belize City, where the passengers would get
off and board a charter flight for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   As the passengers went down the gangplank in Belize, Hurricane
Mitch became the fourth-fiercest storm in history, according to the
National Hurricane Center, and it was headed straight for Belize.
Ten crew members, including all the women, also disembarked.
</P>
<P>
   Fantome was cornered by the storm. If it stayed, Burke said, it
could have sunk or run aground. Burke said he and March decided to
go to sea and take what they thought were their best chances in
deep water.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, some experts say, the company chose the ship over
the crew. ``I could not have gotten under way in any direction
except to the airport and the hell out of there,'' said Andy Chase,
who teaches tall-ship captains at the Maine Maritime Academy.
</P>
<P>
   As Fantome cleared the Belize reef at 3 p.m. on that Monday,
Burke said he and March talked on satellite telephone, plotting the
storm's forecast track and their possible escape routes. They
decided to run 120 miles southeast to hide behind Roatan, a long
skinny Bay Island 25 miles off the Honduras coast. Forecasters had
said the storm would stay north and that Roatan would reduce its
force.
</P>
<P>
   Fantome arrived at 5 a.m. the next day, Oct. 27, and began
tacking back and forth. Seas were rough and the wind was gusting to
60 mph. The storm was 75 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But at 1 p.m. the storm turned southwest, confounding computer
models at the National Hurricane Center. ``That's when things
turned bad,'' Burke said. ``It was just not an option to stay in
the path of a storm with its power.'' The ship would have been
blown on shore, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:15, Burke said, he and March decided that their only hope
was to go east and thread a 25-mile reef-strewn passage between the
island of Guanaja, 10 miles away, and the Honduran shore. The waves
were 15 feet high and the winds 70 mph, and Fantome was rolling
heavily, Burke said. The storm was 45 miles away, with 180-mph
winds.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m., Fantome was south of Guanaja and heeling 40 degrees
in 100-mph winds. March talked to Burke on a satellite phone line
they were keeping open. The captain, Burke said, ``was in a battle
for his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm and Fantome were then on the same longitude, 85.4
degrees west, and the wind was shifting to the west. The ship, with
sails down, was entering what is called the navigable quadrant of a
storm, Burke said, with winds at its back that could have blown it
to safety.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 the telephone went dead.
</P>
<P>
   Not until 7 p.m., when the National Hurricane Center issued a
new storm position, did Burke find out that the hurricane had
jogged southeast and cut Fantome off. As dark fell, the storm had
been 10 miles in front of the ship. At 10 p.m. the eye reached
Guanaja.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the worst thing happened,'' Burke said. The storm stalled
for the next 30 hours.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There had been no mayday call from the ship or signals from an
emergency beacon that is supposed to go off automatically when a
ship capsizes.
</P>
<P>
   Fantome had been through two smaller hurricanes, one of them on
Guyan March's first cruise, when he was a mate under Capt. Paddy
Shrimpton.
</P>
<P>
   But Fantome was 71 years old when it encountered Hurricane
Mitch. Shrimpton said the ship leaked when he ran it 10 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The ship is registered in Equatorial Guinea, in Africa, in order
to avoid taxes, Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   This has also allowed it to avoid U.S. Coast Guard inspection.
But Burke said the ship had been remodeled in 1993, and last May
the ship was certified by an Equatorial Guinea agent as meeting the
standards of the Safety of Life at Sea Compact. Burke said he
believed the ship would have passed a Coast Guard test.
</P>
<P>
   But few ships have gone through what Fantome encountered,
experts said. ``It's one thing for a ship to take a hurricane for
six hours, but 36 hours?'' said Peg Brandon, a captain and marine
superintendent of the Sea Education Association of Woods Hole,
Mass. ``Clearly they did the very best they could. The storm
tracked them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke called families of the crew members. Eight families of
sailors began a prayer vigil. They have been holding photographs of
the men in their arms for three hours nightly in the vigil that is
to end on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Arthurlene Brusch, whose son, Vernon, was a Fantome electrician,
said, ``I think there is hope it is somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the Coast Guard searched fruitlessly, hope dimmed, and a
Coast Guard plane spotted objects from the ship on Nov. 1. They
were retrieved by a British ship. After determining that no person
could live in the water more than a week, the Coast Guard called
off its search on Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said the company had provided families of the crew members
with two months' pay until a long-term settlement could be reached.
But William Huggett, a Miami lawyer who represents mariners, filed
lawsuits for the families of five crew members, seeking $1 million
for each family. He said more suits would be filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't they just beach the ship and get the men off?''
Huggett asked. ``That's just putting the value of the vessel over
the lives of the men. It's incredibly greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke said he had hired jeeps, planes and skin divers to keep
looking for survivors or victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There remains a glimmer of hope that they are in the mud of a
village someplace, no phone booth, wandering around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Par, England, on Friday, March's mother, Jenny, 57, commodore
of the Porthpean Sailing Club where her son learned to sail, said
her hope was gone. ``It would be a miracle,'' Mrs. March said. She
said that she had no plans to sue Windjammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guyan wouldn't have sailed if he didn't think it was safe,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In West Chester, Pa., Ms. Rutledge, whose Fantome voyage was
canceled, called to make reservations for a replacement cruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``March was incredibly brave,'' she said. ``He saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But her next cruise, she said, would ``not be in hurricane
season.''

 &HT;    In Mathis, Falcons' upswing in attitude is apparent
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To measure the heartbeat of the Falcons, take a walk
with Terance Mathis. From the locker room at their Suwanee practice
site, across the parking lot of luxury vehicles, to the ramp that
leads to the film room. Over that space, a player with perspective
can gauge the pulse of the whole team.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis personifies the upstart Falcons. Just as with the team,
there's little fancy about him. He's talented, consistent,
rock-solid and underrated. And in this week of heightened
anticipation, with the San Francisco 49ers coming to the Georgia
Dome on Sunday, the team's top receiver has carried out business as
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The city is waiting for the vaunted Niners, yes. But it mostly
is waiting to see about the Falcons and their apparent ascent from
habitual doldrums. If there is a team in the past five years to
bring out the worst in Atlanta, it's San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And to that fact, Mathis added the team's attitude: ``It has to
stop,'' he said in the locker room this week.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't speaking of the media crush or the endless ticket
requests the Falcons have experienced. Rather, Mathis talked about
the Niners' recent domination of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And in doing so, he let it be known that the Falcons' usual
modus operandi of being passive against San Francisco is no longer
acceptable. The new operative phrase is ``attack, attack, attack.''
</P>
<P>
   And it starts with an attitude. Mathis' attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make them adjust to us,'' said Mathis,
approaching the stairs that lead to the parking lot. ``We're going
to be the aggressor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons rarely have been able to play that role against the
Niners. On Sept. 27, the Falcons mostly retreated, falling quickly
behind by 24 points, and the 31-20 final score did not reflect the
49ers' control.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, however, was brilliant, with seven catches for 130 yards
and two touchdowns. His play against the San Francisco secondary
showed the Niners could be attacked through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we protect Chris (Chandler), we are going to make plays,''
he said. It was not delivered in a boastful, arrogant fashion. It
was offered self-assuredly, by a player on a team with an attitude
adjustment. No more inferiority complex. Numbers don't matter. The
Niners' secondary has shown some vulnerability. At the least, its
lack of aggressiveness at times is a weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they're vulnerable, but they take chances,''
Mathis said, strolling past a Range Rover in the parking lot.
``They want to make plays. They challenge you.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenge that Mathis has accepted. Even he had to admit
that the 49ers elicit a different spark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's special because you know everybody's going to be
watching. It's the 49ers,'' he said, passing a convertible Jaguar.
``And it's really special because it's a big game. Both of us are
7-2. The Dome is sold out. I prepare the same way every week.
Sometimes you don't play as you want to. But you prepare the same
and hope that you can pull out one of those great games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I do. I work during the week to prepare myself for
one of those exceptional games that can carry a team to the next
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching that level against the 49ers would be especially
rewarding. Especially for Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have fun playing against them. I know every one of their
(secondary) guys,'' he said. ``They're friends of mine. So, it's
for bragging rights, too. I know they're going to take a shot at me
every chance they get. And they know I'm going to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis and the Falcons do not go into Sunday with the same
insecurities they usually carry when facing the 49ers. They know
what to do and how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not changing our plan,'' he said. ``We have to establish
things with a drive, keeping the clock moving, keeping their
offense off the field. But when we do all this, we have to score
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoring points with friends who want to attend Sunday's
blockbuster was not a concern for Mathis. On Wednesday, he said:
``I'm in the ticket business.'' By that night, he was he was out of
it. No distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope guys get all that ticket stuff out of the way and
focus on what's at hand,'' Mathis said. ``I told my wife, `As many
tickets as they give us, that's how many tickets we have.' I'm not
going to feel bad if someone can't go.''
</P>
<P>
   Going onto the field before the start of the game promises to
create a rush Mathis has not had in his five seasons with the
Falcons. ``Walking into that stadium and listening to the crowd, my
heart might be beating faster than usual. It's going to be
exciting. But the key is the fans. If they bring the energy, it's
going to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the ramp to the film room, Mathis said, ``We can't go out and
disappoint ourselves, for one. And we can't disappoint our fans _
and I don't feel like we will.

 &HT;    Trophy made 49ers hot
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons have made history with their first 7-2
start, and with the 49ers in town, some other history is worth
revisiting.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle is the only player left from the
Atlanta team of 1991, the year former coach Jerry Glanville
declared the Falcons California state champions after winning games
in San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and beating the 49ers,
L.A. Rams, and L.A. Raiders in Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. That
6-0 record against California teams prompted Glanville to get a
trophy made. Before the 1992 game in San Francisco, he held it
aloft in Candlestick Park, and players rallied around. San
Francisco then was merciless in thrashing the Falcons 56-17. When
the 49ers came to Atlanta two weeks later, they pounded the Falcons
41-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry wanted people to know,'' Tuggle said. ``Right before
kickoff, we had it up in the air. It probably set them off a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The only San Francisco players still on the roster from '91 are
WR Jerry Rice, QB Steve Young, S Merton Hanks and OT Harris Barton,
a Dunwoody native who is on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Inactives/injuries
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons de-activated S Chris Bayne (hamstring), WR Tim
Dwight (knee), C/G Dave Widell and LB Ben Talley. With Bayne out,
Devin Bush will be the only backup safety unless rookie Omar Brown
is active for the first time this season. Brown is the only Falcon
not to dress for a game yet.DTs Shane Dronett (foot) and Travis
Hall (knee) are expected to start, CB Ronnie Bradford (knee), who
missed the past two games, is questionable, and reserve OT Jose
Portilla (knee) is probable.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons defense's zone-blitz package has expanded each of
the past few weeks, but it's unclear whether Atlanta will blitz as
much as it did against New England last week. The Green Bay Packers
blitzed with reasonable success two weeks ago against the 49ers,
but several of their nine sacks of Young came from standard
pressure from the front four. ... Fans looking for pre-game fun can
attend a party with the Falcon Fan-atics fan club Saturday, noon-4
p.m., at Dronett's new art gallery, one of just three galleries in
the nation dedicated solely to sports art. Dwight will sign
autographs at ``The Sports Canvas,'' 10305 Medlock Bridge Road,
Duluth. Tickets to the game will be given away.
</P>
<P>
   Get loud
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves is looking forward to the first sellout crowd
in more than three years, but he's a little worried. ``We're
excited to have the sellout,'' he said. ``It's not only having a
crowd there, but having a knowledgeable crowd. If they can remember
not to do the wave when we're on offense, that would be good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets pretty loud in there when there's only 30,000,'' left
tackle Bob Whitfield said. ``Hopefully, they'll make a lot of
noise, and they can rattle (49er QB Steve) Young.''
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci warned Atlanta not to
count on tt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always put these mondo speakers around the practice
field,'' he said Wednesday, ``and we're not a team that audibilizes
much anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearing the mind
</P>
<P>
   This team is different from past Falcon squads, said right guard
Gene Williams, also known as ``Big Daddy Chocolate'' when he plays
lead guitar in the offseason for his band ``La Freda Boogie and the
Disco Dynamite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most important is that we've shown we can rebound from
losses. We know that when we totally blow everything and wreck a
game, we can come out the next week and play to win, and play to
dominate. We're on a pretty good roll, but confidence comes
bouncing back after a loss.

 &HT;    Top teams must validate bowl tickets
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some pundits are calling it ``Showdown Saturday.''
Others like ``Judgment Day.''
</P>
<P>
   But here, there's only one term for what will transpire in
college football in the next 24 hours _ ``Show-Me Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Today is for all you players and fans who say, ``We don't get no
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, show me.
</P>
<P>
   Show me, No. 2 Kansas State. You're good, but you're undefeated
against a dubious _ actually, awful _ schedule. You say you still
belong in the Fiesta Bowl. OK, fine. Nebraska comes to town today.
You haven't beaten the Cornhuskers since 1968. Show me.
</P>
<P>
   Show me, No. 10 Arkansas. You are having a wonderful (8-0)
season under first-year coach Houston Nutt, but some fans wonder
why you're not in the top four with Tennessee, Kansas State and
UCLA. Today you get your chance to run with the big dogs at No. 1
Tennessee. Show me.
</P>
<P>
   Show me, No. 3 UCLA. You're still undefeated, but you were lucky
to escape with close victories over Stanford and Oregon State.
People are starting to doubt you, and you say that's unfair. Today
you go to Washington. Show me.
</P>
<P>
   Show me, No. 8 Wisconsin (8-0). There is a reason you're ranked
below four teams that have a loss. You say that's wrong. I say,
enjoy your trip to Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   September is the time for talk. Come November, it's time to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The picks:
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 17 Georgia (6-2) at Auburn (3-6), 7:30 p.m. (ESPN): Two
years ago at Jordan-Hare Stadium, Jim Donnan won his first big
game. The Bulldogs can't win the SEC East, but a good bowl bid is
still out there. Auburn is good on defense, but the Tigers can't
score enough points. Georgia 21, Auburn 13.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 10 Arkansas (8-0) at No. 1 Tennessee (8-0), 3:30 p.m.,
CBS: Both teams are good at running the ball, and both teams are
good at stopping the run. That means the quarterbacks will decide
it. Tennessee's Tee Martin has completed 75 percent of his passes
in his past four games. Tennessee 24, Arkansas 17.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 11 Nebraska (8-2) at No. 2 Kansas State (9-0), 3:30 p.m.:
It is the biggest football game ever played in Manhattan, Kan., and
the Wildcats will rise to the occasion. Their 29-game losing streak
to the Cornhuskers ends today. Kansas State 24, Nebraska 14.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 3 UCLA (8-0) at Washington (5-4), 3:30 p.m.: The Bruins
can dodge only so many bullets, and Cade McNown can bail them out
only so many times. Both have bad defenses. The Huskies need
something to salvage a disappointing season. This will be it.
Washington 38, UCLA 35.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 13 Missouri (7-2) at No. 6 Texas A&AMP;M (9-1), 12:30 p.m.:
Missouri quarterback Corby Jones is finally healthy, but so is the
Aggies defense. A&AMP;M gets the edge at home. Texas A&AMP;M 24, Missouri
17.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 8 Wisconsin (9-0) at No. 22 Michigan (7-2), noon (ESPN): A
win by Wisconsin locks up a share of the Big Ten title and a spot
in the Rose Bowl. But Michigan, which started the season 0-2, can
capture the conference championship by winning today and next week
against Ohio State. We like the Wolverines defense. Michigan 17,
Wisconsin 14.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 16 Virginia Tech (7-1) at Syracuse (5-3), 8 p.m. (ESPN2):
Syracuse still can win the Big East title by beating Virginia Tech,
Temple and Miami. The Hokies play great defense (8.9 points per
game), but you have to go with Syracuse and quarterback Donovan
McNabb. Syracuse 21, Virginia Tech 17.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 18 Texas (7-2) at Texas Tech (6-3), 7 p.m.: Ricky Williams
needs 204 yards to break Tony Dorsett's all-time Division I rushing
record. He could get it tonight. Texas still has a shot at the Big
12 South if it can win today and beat Texas A&AMP;M. Texas 31, Texas
Tech 24.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 23 Air Force (8-1) at No. 25 Wyoming (8-1), 2 p.m.: The
winner of this one takes the lead in the WAC Mountain Division. Air
Force leads the WAC in total offense, scoring offense, and scoring
defense. That should be enough. Air Force 35, Wyoming 28.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 14 Tulane (8-0) at Army (2-6), 3:30 p.m.: Tulane doesn't
have a chance for the national championship because of its strength
of schedule (99 out of 112). But the Green Wave still has a chance
to go undefeated and send coach Tommy Bowden off to a nice job.
Tulane 42, Army 14.
</P>
<P>
   The rest
</P>
<P>
   _ ACC: Florida State 42, Wake Forest 3; Virginia 24, North
Carolina 14; Duke 31, Maryland 21.
</P>
<P>
   _ SEC: Mississippi State 17, Alabama 14; Florida 51, South
Carolina 6; Kentucky 35, Vanderbilt 21.
</P>
<P>
   _ Top 25: No. 7 Ohio State 31, Iowa 14; No. 9 Arizona 21,
California 20; No. 12 Notre Dame 34, Navy 17; No. 19 Penn State 31,
Northwestern 14.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last week: 17-3
</P>
<P>
   _ This season: 149-48 (75.6%).

 &HT;    Chasing 10 wins again will be the Dogs' life
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia can't win the SEC's Eastern Division, but the
Bulldogs still have a lot at stake when they travel to Auburn for a
nationally televised game tonight (7:30, ESPN).
</P>
<P>
   If they can win out against Auburn, Ole Miss, Georgia Tech and a
bowl opponent, the Bulldogs can post 10 victories for the second
year in a row. Georgia (6-2, 4-2 SEC) hasn't won 10 games in
consecutive seasons since 1982-83.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the number of people we had to replace, that would be
quite an achievement for this team,'' coach Jim Donnan said. ``I'm
like everybody else. I wish we had played better in our two losses
(to Tennessee and Florida). But this team still has a chance to
have a very good season.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan returns to the scene of his first memorable victory as
Georgia's coach. The Bulldogs were 3-5 in his first season two
years ago when they traveled to Auburn and beat the Tigers 56-49 in
four overtimes.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's teams probably won't score as much. Auburn has the
SEC's No.2 defense (279.8 ypg) and the No.11 scoring offense (14.7
ppg).
</P>
<P>
   But there is danger for the Dogs, as Auburn continues to play
well for interim coach Bill Oliver, 2-1 since he took the job Oct.
24.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't go to Auburn and have an easy game anytime,''
Donnan said. ``And when they are good on defense, like they are
now, you know it's going to be a battle. This will be a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule features a number of battles, with the nation's top
three teams playing strong opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In Knoxville, No.1 Tennessee (8-0) plays host to No.10 Arkansas
(8-0) in what could be a preview of the SEC championship game on
Dec.5 in the Georgia Dome. The Volunteers need to win to keep their
national title hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, Kan., No.2 Kansas State (9-0) plays host to No.11
Nebraska (8-2). The Cornhuskers have beaten the Wildcats 29 times
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, No.3 UCLA could be in trouble again at Washington
(5-4). The Bruins have had narrow escapes over Stanford and Oregon
State the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Another key showdown in the Top 10 finds No.8 Wisconsin (9-0)
going to No.22 Michigan (7-2). Wisconsin can wrap up the Big Ten's
spot in the Rose Bowl with a victory, but a Michigan win keeps the
Wolverines alive in the conference race.

 &HT;    K-State: Fired up for No. 1 nemesis Nebraska
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ The evidence is everywhere. There's the Fiesta
Bowl blimp hovering above the little house on the prairie. ESPN's
``Game Day'' set, erected inside KSU Stadium, capacity 42,000. The
``Judgment Day for the Children of the Corn!'' T-shirt, endorsed by
novelist Stephen King in exchange for two $12 shirts. And the
battered old Honda that K-State students Mike Scherer and Scott
Chartier bought for $260, just to paint purple for today.
</P>
<P>
   For once, this really is The Game of the Century. Kansas State
vs. Nebraska, the most significant moment in 103 years of K-State
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win or lose, it's the biggest game in Kansas State history,''
said Cory Ramsey, 28, Class of '93 and now a banker. ``It'll be the
first time we've ever lined up as the No. 1 team in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Kansas State _ 9-0, with a 17-game winning streak _ is
tied with Tennessee as No. 1 in the ESPN Coaches poll. The Wildcats
are No. 2 in the AP writers poll and third in the latest Bowl
Championship Series rankings. And today, the 'Cats are 11-point
favorites over Nebraska, a team they haven't beaten in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 10,962 days and 29 losses in a row since that snowy
day in Lincoln, Nov. 9, 1968, when Kansas State and quarterback
Lynn Dickey stunned the Huskers 12-0 to ruin Nebraska's homecoming.
In their most recent return to Lincoln, the 'Cats were humbled
56-26 last year, their lone loss in an 11-1 season that's the best
in K-State history. Until, perhaps, now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had this game in mind since last year,'' said Adam
Wilkey, a K-State senior who tends bar at the 12th St. Pub in
Aggieville, the student section just southeast of campus that
rocked and reigned purple by mid-afternoon Friday. ''This whole
football season meant nothing except for Nov. 14 and Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. But theprospect of finally beating Nebraska -- a
two-time loser under first-year coach Frank Solich -- that has this
campus, this town energized as never before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wait Is Over'' declared the student newspaper, the Kansas
State Collegian. One columnist, Jeremy Kelly, wrote, ``This is
where the 'Red Sea' parts and the 'Purple Reign' begins.'' Some 575
media credentials, more than double the usual, have been issued.
The New York Times, USA Today and Sports Illustrated have come
calling. ABC is televising the game. And to accommodate ESPN's
pre-game show, the stadium gates will open at 8:30 a.m. today to
permit thousands of fans to watch it live. Later, only the 42,000
lucky ticket-holders may return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a circus here,'' K-State sports information director
Kent Brown said. ``There's even a blimp.''
</P>
<P>
   There also were thousands of folks students, alumni and just
plain purple people jamming Aggieville for a 5 p.m. pep rally
Friday, followed by a long night of, uh, pre-game preparation. That
included Scherer and Chartier, who started painting their Honda
purple on Monday, finished it on Wednesday and drove it throughout
Aggieville on Friday. It featured a hood autographed by Michael
Bishop, K-State's spectacular quarterback and Heisman Trophy
candidate. Atop the trunk, autographed by linebacker Jeff Kelly,
little Wildcat in a rocking chair pulled a rope attached to a
gallows from which a bib-overalled Herbie the Husker Nebraska
mascot was hanging from a noose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a lot of older people really excited,'' Scherer said.
``I think they understand how terrible it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   People like Terry and Pat Schoenthaler, Class of '69. In their
first three seasons as undergraduates, K-State went 1-28-1. Even in
the early '80s, when the Schoenthalers first took their sons Chad
and John -- now alums, too -- to games here, a $10 family pass
included four tickets and parking right beside the stadium. ``There
was no tailgating,'' Terry said, ``because there were no cars.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Snyder arrived here in 1989, the school in this town
that calls itself The Little Apple was the perfect prairie
home-or-away companion, an ideally inept homecoming opponent and
the most gracious host in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder left Iowa, where he was Hayden Fry's offensive
coordinator, for a program that had gone to exactly one bowl in its
history. The 'Cats went 3-40-1 1985-88, Snyder inheriting a team on
a 27-game winless streak. But he dramatically upgraded facilities
and coaches' salaries, worked 20 hours a day and did what many
people call the best coaching job in college-football history.
</P>
<P>
   Since a 1-10 start, Snyder has gone 74-27-1 and to five bowls in
a row. ``What has taken place seven, 10, 20, 30 years ago has no
effect on our program,'' Snyder said. ``Our youngsters understand
(recent losses to the Huskers). But hardly a day, a week doesn't go
by that they don't accomplish something that hasn't been done
before. These youngsters here have (accomplished) a litany of
things that haven't been done before.'' Only this remains:
Nebraska.

You would think that the man who just won $25 million by suing the
nation's second largest bank would be quick to say a little guy can
indeed beat the system.
<P>
   But Pat Stull draws a much different conclusion from the
settlement announced Thursday in which BankAmerica Corp. agreed to
pay him and his fellow plaintiffs $187.5 million. Stull initiated
the whistle-blower lawsuit in 1995, charging the bank with cheating
municipal bond issuers.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his Parnassus Heights home yesterday, Stull
came across less the dragon slayer than a man sobered by how tough
it was to take on a powerful corporation.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the combined might of all the plaintiffs, including
the state of California, the city and county of San Francisco, and
nearly 300 other local government units, that brought BofA to its
knees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was naive to think this would be resolved based just on the
facts,'' said Stull, a former manager in BofA's municipal bond unit
who turned against the bank after leaving it in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small guy like me could not go after BofA unless he had the
state of California and the city attorney behind him. If it were
just me and (my lawyers), we'd have been crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   With the backing of his government allies, Stull was anything
but crushed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his financial windfall, some of which will pay
attorneys' fees and other costs, Stull was upheld on the central
claim that has animated him since he filed the suit.
</P>
<P>
   BofA now admits, as Stull maintained, that it improperly shifted
unclaimed bond payments to its own accounts instead of returning
them to issuers, which would have used the funds to pay for roads,
schools and other public facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The bank says its mishandling of funds was due to errors, not a
deliberate policy of cheating its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Said Stull: ``I'm pleased that I've been vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has all but consumed the 51-year-old Stull, who has
actively participated in setting strategy with his lawyers at the
San Francisco firm of Farella Braun &AMP; Martel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I've been working on it one way or another,'' he
explained. ``It's been my life for four years.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stull quit BofA to spend more time with his sick child, he
set up a business auditing bond accounts for municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
   His audits showed that BofA had improperly overcharged or kept
refunds from many of his clients.
</P>
<P>
   The trim, gray-haired Stull, an austere-looking Irish Catholic
who was schooled by Franciscan and Dominican priests, has a
stubborn and moralistic streak, according to people who know him.
</P>
<P>
   When some at BofA threatened him with legal action, the
consultant turned into a crusader, using whistle-blower laws to sue
his former employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people attack me and say things that aren't true, it just
makes me more committed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stull, who is already financially comfortable, didn't deny that
money was a consideration when he sued BofA. ``To &LR;   &LR; say I never
thought about financial rewards is absurd,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted he never would have pursued the case if
principles weren't at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stress something like this puts on your family, your kids
_ the damage it does to your reputation. ... People would come up
and shake their fingers at us in the street, chastising us for
taking on the Bank of America. But when you believe you're doing
the right thing, you just plow right through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stull now must put behind him one of the things that's given
meaning to his life.
</P>
<P>
   With no financial worries, he wants to travel, spend more time
with his family and do volunteer work, he said. But, he admits, ``I
still don't know exactly what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice for those who would be whistle-blowers is to find
lawyers they trust and think long and hard about the course they're
considering.
</P>
<P>
   Never forget, he said, if you threaten a powerful institution,
``they can destroy you so fast.''  &LR;

 New Schwab Move: IPO Co-Manager  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Charles Schwab Corp. is about raise its profile in the stock
underwriting business.
<P>
   The San Francisco discount broker will soon co-manage an initial
public offering by the Minnesota mattress-maker Select Comfort
Corp., people familiar with the matter said. The 4 million-share
stock offering will take place next month, pending regulatory
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Serving as an IPO co-manager, right behind lead manager
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, is a big step up for Schwab. The move could
boost the firm's profits from public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   A Schwab spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Since the firm got into the IPO business last year, it's taken
part in 36 transactions, but always as a junior member of the
underwriting syndicate with a small allocation of stock to sell.
Schwab has agreements with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, J.P. Morgan and
Credit Suisse First Boston to distribute shares in offerings they
manage.
</P>
<P>
   As co-manager for Select Comfort's offering, Schwab will get a
bigger allocation of shares and take on some responsibility for
administering the offering, sources said. In exchange, it will
collect higher fees than lower-ranking members of the underwriting
group.
</P>
<P>
   Several other discount brokers have IPO programs, though none of
the other firms have co-managed offerings. E-Trade Group, for
example, sells shares in IPOs managed by BancBoston Robertson
Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab got into the IPO businesses because many of its customers
were clamoring for access to such deals, which seemed to be open
only to big institutional investors and Wall Street insiders.
</P>
<P>
   As in its previous IPOs, Schwab will sell shares only to those
of its retail customers who have registered to take part in the
firm's IPO program and certified that they understand the risks of
buying such stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the co-manager slot is both more profitable and risky for
Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   The firm will have to use more of its capital to buy shares
before turning around and selling them. But the biggest risk is
that stocks it takes public could perform badly, angering
customers.

EDITORIAL: THE CASE OF JONATHAN POLLARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Common sense set in after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel urged clemency for Jonathan Pollard in the final hours of
the peace talks in Maryland last month. George Tenet, the director
of central intelligence, promptly threatened to resign if President
Clinton complied, bracing the president to reject the misplaced
plea. Then Republican congressional leaders made it clear to the
Israelis that clemency was unacceptable. Pollard gravely damaged
American interests during the 1980s by selling some of America's
most sensitive intelligence information to Israel. To release him
now would compound that harm and not greatly advance peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Pollard's crimes might appear less
reprehensible than other Cold War spying incidents. He gave
information to an American ally that was already receiving American
intelligence through official channels. But that argument, popular
in Israel and among many American Jews, misses several critical
points.
</P>
<P>
   American and Israeli national interests are not identical and
not all American intelligence is suitable for transfer to Israel.
While serving as a naval intelligence analyst in the mid-1980s,
Pollard delivered boxes full of highly sensitive documents to his
Israeli handlers. The material included secretly obtained details
of Soviet weapons designs, American encryption codes and manuals,
spy satellite photos and information gleaned from American
electronic eavesdropping stations. It also included material
gathered by covert American operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the material may later have fallen into Russian hands
through KGB operatives in Israel. Whoever saw these documents would
know what America had learned about Soviet and Arab military forces
and plans, and possibly how the information was gathered,
endangering informants.
</P>
<P>
   The full damage caused by Pollard remains unknown, in large part
because of Israel's inexplicable refusal to return the most
sensitive documents he gave them. For years the Israeli government
denied any association with Pollard's activities. For Netanyahu now
to seek his release as a condition for peace in the Middle East is
unreasonable. Justice was served by Pollard's conviction and
imprisonment and should not be upended to placate his sympathizers
in Israel.

EDITORIAL: BRAZIL GETS A LOAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 14:
</P>
<P>
   The $41.5 billion international package to support Brazil
announced Friday has several things going for it. It is larger than
had been expected, which makes it less likely that speculators will
bet against Brazil and therefore makes it less likely that the
money in the package will actually have to be used. It includes
commitments not only from the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank, but also from the United States and other major countries.
Finally, it is based on promises by the Brazilian government that
long-needed fiscal reforms will be put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the package is risky. Brazil's currency, the real,
remains overvalued, and nothing is being done directly to address
that problem. The hope is that the country's existing program of
gradual devaluation will eventually cure the problem. But in the
meantime, that overvaluation could discourage international
investment in the country. Only with such investment will it be
possible for Brazil to lower the very high interest rates it has
imposed to protect the real. Those high rates are very damaging to
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   A lot remains to be done on fiscal problems by both the
country's Congress and its state governments, and it is far from
certain that the needed reforms will be approved. If they are not,
the IMF and the other lenders will face difficult decisions
regarding continued lending.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, world financial markets are far less nervous than
they were even a month ago. As the largest economy in Latin
America, Brazil's fate is of great importance to the region, and
the economic health of the region could make the difference in
determining whether the Asian recession spreads to this country.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan made a last-ditch
appeal to Iraq on Friday night to make a ``wise decision'' and end
its defiance of international arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   His plea followed a five-hour meeting with the Security Council
that failed to agree on any other diplomatic steps that could or
should be taken to budge President Saddam Hussein from the
entrenched position that has put Iraq under the threat of U.S.
attack.
</P>
<P>
   There was an atmosphere of futility around the meeting, since
both the council and Annan have been delivering the same message to
the Iraqis for nearly two weeks, and there is a sense that military
action is probably inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``All stressed the desirability of a peaceful and diplomatic
solution, but events on the ground may be running away from us,''
Annan said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The council and the secretary-general agreed that he would write
a letter to the Iraqi leadership, restating his demand that Baghdad
rescind orders stopping cooperation with arms inspectors and
reminding the Iraqis that they would get a comprehensive review of
their relations with the United Nations in return.
</P>
<P>
   A visibly exhausted secretary-general emerged from the council
session to make his public appeal to Baghdad, before meeting Iraq's
representative at the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, who told
reporters later that he hoped the United States would ``give
diplomacy a real chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would use this opportunity once again to urge President
Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi leadership to take a wise decision of
resuming cooperation with UNSCOM and the atomic agency,'' Annan
said, referring to the U.N. Special Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency. ``I hope that this appeal will
be listened to by the Iraqis authorities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To encourage the Iraqis, Annan held out again the promise that a
comprehensive review could lead to a lifting of sanctions if Iraq
extended full cooperation to UNSCOM inspectors. Annan made no
mention of a trip to Baghdad, as the Iraqis are urging. The
secretary-general spoke with President Clinton by telephone Friday
morning, his aides said, and was apparently told then that the
United States was not in favor of a trip to Iraq by the
secretary-general, at least not at this point.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said that Annan would not go to Baghdad a second
time this year, with the Iraqis having broken the first agreement,
unless he had absolute assurance in advance that Saddam would
reverse decisions made Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 that shut down arms
inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Annan met Friday morning with the representatives of China,
France and Russia, who are pressing the secretary-general to take
some kind of diplomatic initiative, though diplomats said the
Russians did not suggest that there was anything to negotiate with
the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad on Friday, Russia's ambassador delivered two letters
to Saddam, one from President Boris Yeltsin and another from Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov. Both were critical of Iraq for raising
the present crisis to a dangerous level by stopping all cooperation
with arms inspectors, officials in Moscow said. Saddam was reported
to have responded ``positively,'' but British and U.S. officials
dismissed the gesture, saying he had merely repeated demands for a
lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials, looking beyond bombing raids, are concerned that
a range of programs in Iraq could be curtailed or ended by the
Iraqis in the wake of U.S. attacks. If the Iraqis decide to flout
sanctions, the ``oil for food'' plan under which Iraq is permitted
to sell limited amounts of oil to pay for civilian goods and
services could be the first victim.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has apparently never liked the program, which was
beginning to feed Iraqis and provide them with medicines, hospital
equipment and school materials, among other imports otherwise
denied them by an embargo. If Iraq circumvents the sanctions, there
would in theory be no need for outside help, since oil money would
be freely available to the Iraqis _ unless the United States was
willing to blockade Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The continuation of imports under the oil-sale program is
already in doubt. Friday the British contractor in charge of
stationing inspectors at Iraqi border points and ports to monitor
shipments of food and other goods suddenly withdrew its staff in
anticipation of U.S. attacks on Iraq. Benon Sevan, the director of
the Iraq program for the United Nations, said in a statement that
the contractor, Lloyd's Register, had pulled out 54 people without
warning.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Sevan said, is that shipments into Iraq cannot be
checked and shippers will not be paid, since certification by
border inspectors is required by the oil-sale plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sevan said his office was ``examining various options with a
view to restoring inspection services with the least possible delay
in order to maintain the flow of food, medicine and other essential
humanitarian supplies into Iraq.''

JUDICIARY COMMITTEE GETS STARR'S EVIDENCE ON WILLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel Kenneth Starr on Friday
sent evidence concerning the former White House volunteer Kathleen
Willey to the House Judiciary Committee, but he did not say the
material constituted grounds for impeaching President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, which was not made public, relates to Mrs.
Willey's accusation that the president groped her outside the Oval
Office in 1993 when she went to him seeking a full-time job.
Clinton has denied the assertion under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Starr's report to Congress in September, in which he said
the president might have committed 11 impeachable offenses to hide
his affair with Monica Lewinsky, the two boxes of witness testimony
and other information sent Friday did not contain a formal
accusation of wrongdoing against Clinton, said people who have
reviewed the material.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, James Kennedy, said: ``Once again, the
independent counsel has seen fit to send secret grand jury material
to the House. We have not been allowed to see this material and
therefore cannot comment on its contents.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats seized on Friday's developments as evidence that
Starr was trying to reinvigorate an inquiry that is losing
momentum, before his testimony next Thursday to the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's on a vendetta against the president,'' said Rep.
Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat on the committee. ``He's just
sending this up to light a fire under impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., said, ``I have to conclude that Ken
Starr does not believe the Willey information represents
substantial and credible evidence of impeachment offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Henry Hyde
of Illinois, declined to comment on the material, citing House
rules barring disclosure before the committee votes to release the
evidence from executive session.
</P>
<P>
   Starr withheld the evidence concerning Mrs. Willey from his
September referral, leading House investigators to conclude that he
was preparing a second referral or criminal indictments.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Starr did not return six telephone calls Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Friday night how the additional information would
influence the direction of the House inquiry. Democratic and
Republican aides were poring over the material late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the materials are reviewed thoroughly by the members, it
is impossible to know whether there will be any effect on the
committee's schedule,'' said Nicole Nason, a committee spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Willey's accusation is well known, but it has been
contradicted by various witnesses. Mrs. Willey and several of her
friends testified before Starr's grand jury. In essence, House
aides said, Starr is turning over his files on Mrs. Willey and
letting House investigators decide who is telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Republican committee aide said last week that if Starr
were to send over information about Mrs. Willey's accusations, it
could be readily ``plugged in'' to the investigation centering on
Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the committee's staff have boiled down Starr's
original 11 accusations to three categories: lying under oath,
witness tampering and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde and Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the committee's ranking
Democrat, wrote to Starr on Oct. 2, asking if he intended to submit
any additional ``investigative materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's submission responds to that request and may signal that
Starr has sent Congress all the material he has that is related to
the impeachment inquiry, House aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter faxed to the committee's Republican and
Democratic investigative counsels, one of Starr's deputies, Robert
Bittman, said, ``Limited availability of these materials will not
in our judgment jeopardize any ongoing investigation.'' This
suggests Starr might still seek indictments in the Willey matter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Willey has been a focus of Starr's inquiry because he is
investigating whether she received a White House job and other
favored assignments from the administration in return for keeping
silent about the supposed sexual encounter.
</P>
<P>
   She came to Starr's attention after being deposed in Paula
Jones' sexual misconduct case against the president. Mrs. Willey
went public with her story in an interview on ``60 Minutes'' in
March.
</P>
<P>
   But inconsistencies in Mrs. Willey's account quickly emerged.
One friend, Linda Tripp, testified to the grand jury that Mrs.
Willey was trying to promote ``an ongoing flirtation'' with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Another confidante, Julie Hiatt Steele, initially confirmed
aspects of Mrs. Willey's story, but then disavowed it and said in
an affidavit that Mrs. Willey had asked her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   A third friend, Harolyn Cardozo, a former White House volunteer
who is the daughter of the Democratic fund-raiser Nathan Landow,
has said Mrs. Willey called her several hours after meeting with
the president, sounding ``excited and pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Willey has said she discussed her encounter with Landow,
but has never publicly characterized those discussions. Landow has
denied that he tried to influence Mrs. Willey's testimony in the
Jones case.

   NEW YORK _ The ticker-tape parade planned for John Glenn on
Monday will be the third such celebration in a month, reviving a
tradition that had all but died in the years since 1962, when Glenn
first orbited the earth and New Yorkers showered him with
affection.
</P>
<P>
   That year, there were eight other ticker-tape parades in the
city, more than any previous year since the first parade in 1886.
In the first five years of the Giuliani administration, the city
had bestowed the honor only two other times (for the Rangers in
1994 and the Yankees in 1996).
</P>
<P>
   No one knows just how much it will cost for Glenn _ and the
astronauts who accompanied him on his return to space _ to travel
up Broadway in lower Manhattan from Hanover Square to City Hall,
the so-called Canyon of Heroes. But the mayor's office said Friday
that the Oct. 23 parade to celebrate the Yankees' victory in the
World Series cost about $800,000 for police and sanitation
services, about half of which was subsidized by corporate sponsors.
The city is also seeking private funds for Monday's parade.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the mayor, could not say how
much was spent to honor Sammy Sosa, the slugger for the Chicago
Cubs, with a ticker-tape parade on Oct. 17. But that event took
place on a Saturday, when fewer people are downtown, and presumably
cost less to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   A mayor can hold a ticker-tape parade whenever the mood strikes,
using money appropriated for the overtime expenses for police and
sanitation workers.
</P>
<P>
   But by staging three ticker-tape parades in quick succession,
the mayor is dipping into overtime funds that might be needed if a
severe snowstorm occurs this winter, Douglas Criscitello, director
of the city's Independent Budget Office, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly no conceivable way we planned for several
ticker-tape parades,'' Criscitello said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out, however, that the mayor can always seek
supplemental overtime money from the City Council, which is not
likely to turn him down. But, he said, ``it's not as if the city is
in such terrific fiscal condition that it can afford to throw money
out of windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending the expense as a minuscule part of a $34 billion
budget, Ms. Roche said the city was getting plenty in return. ``We
get to participate in history, particularly in this parade,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the parade was well worth the expense because of
the achievements of the astronauts, and particularly the example
that the 77-year-old Glenn has set. ``This is our way of honoring
them, showing them that the capital of the world appreciates what
they're doing for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A second ticker-tape parade is by no means a rarity. Other
repeat honorees, according to the Encyclopedia of New York City,
include the golfer Bobby Jones (1926 and 1930); Adm. Richard Byrd
(1927 and 1930); the aviators Amelia Earhart (1928 and 1932) and
Wiley Post (1931 and 1933); Dwight Eisenhower (1945 and 1960);
Haile Selassie, the Emperor of Ethiopia (1954 and 1963); the New
York Mets (1962, 1969 and 1986).
</P>
<P>
   The tradition began in 1886, when office workers spontaneously
threw ticker-tape during a parade commemorating the dedication of
the Statue of Liberty. Until 1965, it was routine to welcome
foreign heads of state to the city with a parade, usually at the
request of the State Department, but that practice was abandoned
when John Lindsay was mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Charles Lindbergh, aviators and astronauts _ who
have been given 14 and six parades, respectively _ have usually
attracted big crowds. But on Friday, a number of downtown office
workers expressed indifference about Monday's event, suggesting
that some people may be experiencing parade fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into space is routine,'' said Steven Boyajian, 36, an
analyst for Standard &AMP; Poors. ``The last parade was an absolute
nightmare. It took an hour for me to get to a meeting two blocks
away.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Angela Ziel, 26, an insurance underwriter, said
they were squirreling away paper so they would have ready access to
confetti. ``There's never enough parades,'' she said.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: BEFORE WINTER COMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I suppose that if I were a woolly bear caterpillar or a squirrel
storing hickory nuts or one of the other creatures said to know in
advance the severity of the winter ahead, I would be able to do
just the right amount of work to get ready for it. Instead, I have
to prepare for winter in the subjunctive, as if it were going to be
severe _ as if I were a doom-saying squirrel. Like most people, I'm
not a very good student of my own behavior, but I've noticed in
myself a striking urge these days to get ready for winter. I
noticed it because it led me down to the barn one morning and kept
me hard at work for several days, stacking hay in the loft,
preparing to heat the horses' water tank, making a place in the
barn aisle where the horseshoer could work under lights and out of
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm noon when sun strikes the hive, the bees still fly,
but it has been cold enough recently for them to form their winter
cluster, a tight, buzzing ball at the center of their store of
brood and honey. The flow of information into the hive _ and with
it nectar and pollen _ has dwindled to nothing. In fields and waste
places, the stands of goldenrod, the source of the late-summer
honey flow, have turned a nebulous silver, like wool caught on
barbed wire. I took a few frames of honey for the house but left
most of it for the bees because it's a new hive and, again, because
I have no way of knowing how bad this winter will get.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, I stand in the door of the hayloft and look out over
the place, at the ridgeline newly visible behind a copse of birches
to the west, at the row of denuded sugar maples that ring the
pasture. The moon has already risen into a bank of thin clouds that
looks tinged by firelight, clouds the color of the dogwood leaves.
The horses in the barnyard below me show the whites of their eyes
while dismantling a hay bale. They have been slow to hair up for
the season, but now their coats are coming on strong. On the way to
the house, I notice that the leaves on the peach trees haven't
turned. They are still the green of midsummer. Is this an omen?
Will this be a balmy winter, after all? Or does it mean I should
provision the larder _ a phrase with a satisfying sound _ for the
snowbound weeks ahead? I just don't know.

NBA SEASON CONTINUES TO GET SHORTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With no negotiations since last Friday, the National
Basketball Association on Friday canceled the week of Dec. 8-14. It
brings the total lost to six weeks and increases the possibility
that the season will not begin before Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kessler, the chief outside counsel for the players'
association, Friday telephoned Jeff Mishkin, the league's chief
attorney, to inform him that the union had no reason to meet or
schedule a bargaining session.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are at a stalemate over several economic issues,
including total revenue distribution and limiting high-end
salaries. The owners have offered a 50-50 split, while the players
have said they will install mechanisms to pay the owners back once
salaries reach 60 percent of basketball-related income.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether there'll be a meeting next week or not,''
Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Two officials with the federal mediation service met with union
officials on Thursday. The union last week had suggested using a
mediator to resolve the four-and-a-half-month-old labor dispute _ a
tool major-league baseball employed unsuccessfully in 1994. The NBA
rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is time to use a mediator yet, but it may
very well come into being,'' Hunter said. ``I think it's a bit
premature, but it's an option to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said the two officials were assigned by the Department of
Labor to monitor the NBA's labor impasse. He added that the
officials were rebuffed when they tried to meet with NBA officials.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15) 
(af) 
By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hemmed in by large windows overlooking St. Peter's
Lutheran Church in midtown Manhattan, the fourth-floor library
shared by the two men running the world's largest financial
services concern is a study in contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the library's design is coolly modern and restrained,
in keeping with the personality of one of Citigroup's co-chief
executives, John S. Reed. But it also reveals a certain baronial
excess _ in keeping with the urges of Reed's counterpart, Sanford
I. Weill _ such as a wall-sized fireplace painstakingly installed
for about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the sort of differences in style on which many a
megamerger has foundered, Reed and Weill have only grown closer in
the seven months since they announced the biggest merger in history
_ a tumultuous period that has included wrenching financial
upheaval and the departure two weeks ago of the executive
considered their heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never really know until you get married what it's going to
be like,'' said Weill, 65, seated on a plump leather sofa in his
private office abutting the library as he spoke of his partnership
with Reed. ``And I would say this marriage is off to a very good
start. And we lived in the engagement period through one of the
most volatile times in the history of financial markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, 59, whose office is on the other side of the library,
agrees. ``We are getting along fine,'' he said. ``Better probably
than each of us in the secret hideaways of our brains thought would
be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonhomie seems genuine _ a rarity when titans go into
business together, rarer still when their first act is to duck the
tough decision to put one person clearly in charge.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the personal warmth, Weill and Reed preside over a
company severely shaken by executive turmoil and struggling for
direction in corporate banking, one of its two main businesses. In
separate interviews, each acknowledged the problems _ indeed, Weill
promised that crucial decisions would be made within the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing now is horrible,'' he said of the corporate
banking operation, ``and we're going to end up losing the best of
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Others share his impatience. Employees complain that they get
conflicting marching orders from the company's senior executives.
Fundamental decisions about the future of the company remain
unmade, with the results of this month's congressional elections
threatening to upset a regulatory environment that seemed ready to
welcome Citigroup's blending of financial services.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts say they need more proof that Weill and Reed can
lead the behemoth they created into calmer times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation has forced them to be more engaged than they
probably wanted to be when this thing was announced,'' said David
Berry, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. ``They have to make
this thing get off the organizational charts and work in the real
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The vision presented when Reed's Citicorp and Weill's Travelers
Group merged in April remains grandiose _ that of a global
financial superstore selling everything from mortgages, credit
cards and automobile insurance in its consumer business to stocks,
bonds and loans to big companies in its corporate business.
</P>
<P>
   But unsettling events in the real world have trampled on part of
that vision. While the consumer business is off to a crisp start,
the forced resignation on Nov. 1 of James E. Dimon, Citigroup's
president and Weill's longtime protege, laid bare how little
progress has been made in bringing together strong-willed
executives and disparate product lines in Citigroup's corporate
banking business.
</P>
<P>
   Previous attempts by other companies to wed the relatively
staid, buttoned-down world of traditional commercial banking to the
more free-wheeling world of investment banking have also run into
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial bankers tend to work hard at building relationships
with clients, are accustomed to working within a corporate
bureaucracy and receive modest salaries by Wall Street standards.
Investment bankers work deal to deal, cultivate their independence
and are lushly compensated. All of this makes commercial and
investment bankers strange bedfellows in even the best of
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   And in Citigroup's case, the blending has been made tougher by
the fact that Travelers had only begun the job of digesting its
acquisition of Salomon Brothers, the bond-trading giant, when
merger discussions began with Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
   For Citigroup, the tension came to a head three weeks ago, when
tempers flared and complaints were loudly aired at a retreat at the
Greenbrier resort in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going there, we knew we didn't have our act together,'' Weill
said. ``We had made many more decisions on coming together on the
consumer side of the business _ people decisions, cost-cutting
decisions _ and we were not really at the same place on the
corporate side. So we knew that was an issue.''

INTERNET IPO FEVER REAPPEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES --There they go again.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-month lull, Internet companies are heating up Wall
Street again thanks to a spate of initial public offerings as
investors gobble up cyberspace equities like candy.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular showing this week came from theglobe.com, a
New York-based Internet company that offers free home pages. With
an initial offering price of $9 a share, the stock opened Friday at
$97 but drifted down to close at $63.50, up $54.50. About 15.6
million shares traded, the fourth-most active U.S. stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen this kind of frenzy,'' said Tom Taulli, market
analyst for IPO Monitor. ``Theglobe.com is the biggest IPO ever. It
just happened to do its IPO at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet IPOs all but disappeared after July, largely due to
market volatility, he said. Several IPOs were canceled because of
uncertainty over their reception by investors. But as the market
bounced back, the IPOs returned, Taulli said, and by this time
investors had a pent-up demand for Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an IPO drought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only two Internet IPOs surfaced in September and none in
October, with total proceeds of $74 million, according to
Securities Data Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This week, New York-based Earthweb also experienced a
spectacular welcome on Wall Street. With an initial offering price
of $14, Earthweb closed at $48.6875 on its first day of trading
Wednesday. On Friday, shares soared to $75.75. The company offers
technical reference information on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of go2net Inc. rose by 33 percent to $39.25 Friday after
it reported an operating profit of $130,545, or 2 cents a common
share. Revenues rose 530 percent to $2 million. But the company
lost money overall in the fourth quarter, if a $319,512 charge from
the merger with Hypermart is included.
</P>
<P>
   AvTel Communications, a Santa Barbara, Calif.-based broad-band
network services firm, didn't trade Friday because of its
stupendous performance Thursday. Its share price jumped from $2.25
to $31 in one day after the company said it will offer a high-speed
Internet access service that's as much as 50 times faster than
conventional modems.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the hyperinflation of a lightly regulated
company, Nasdaq halted AvTel trading Friday. It will resume Monday.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose, Calif.-based eBay Inc., an Internet firm that operates
an online auction community, rose almost $21 this week to close at
$123.9375 on Friday. Not bad for a company that offered its stock
at $18 in late September and closed at $47.375 on its first day of
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Geocities, which provides a Web-based community for Internet
users, was offered at $17 in August. It closed at $40.46875 on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet represents tremendous growth opportunity,'' said
Paul Merenbloom, a technology analyst at Prudential Securities in
New York. ``The high-growth, early stage environment is where a lot
of people want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not every Internet gem is a diamond. For example,
Broadcast.com, a Dallas company that operates Web sites and
develops software, closed at $51 on Friday, a far cry from $62.75
on its first day of trading in July. The IPO was priced at $8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volatility is at an all-time high,'' Merenbloom said. Internet
stocks are rising ``not because of a change in fundamentals. It's
happening at a rate inconsistent with the rate of development.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Internet stocks can fluctuate greatly: Last month, more
than half of Internet IPOs introduced this year were below their
offering price. Most have since recovered, Taulli said.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more coming, he said. Internet IPOs on the horizon
include Xoom, a company similar to theglobe.com;
Ticketmaster/Citysearch, an online combination of the ticket
brokerage and a community-based information provider; CBS
Marketwatch, the network's online financial Web site; Prodigy, the
poor cousin to America Online that has been revamped as an Internet
service provider; and Barnesandnoble.com, the online arm of the
mega-bookstore chain that's competing against one of the original
Internet superstars -- Amazon.com.

 NEW YORK: an issue.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One result of the confusion and conflict was the unceremonious
ouster of Dimon, 42, whose duties included helping make Citicorp's
and Travelers' corporate businesses work together. The ouster was
roundly criticized by analysts and Citigroup employees, primarily
former colleagues from Travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Of Dimon's departure, Weill would say only that ``this was a
unique relationship for more than 15 years,'' adding that ``it was
a week I would not want to relive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we shocked a lot of people a week ago,'' Weill said on
Tuesday. ``And I think we want to create stability and let people
get a feeling of where we're going and how we're going to handle
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, noting that he liked Dimon ``personally and
professionally,'' added that he nonetheless considered Dimon's
ouster ``the right business decision.'' He and Weill, he said, are
not making rash decisions as they try to move Citigroup forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy and I are pretty serious people,'' Reed said. ``We're
not cavalier, and if we did a reorganization, you've got to assume
we did it for semireasonable reasons, and it wasn't just, we got up
one morning and decided we'd sort of shoot people at random.''
</P>
<P>
   These two men, who elected to rope themselves together in an
attempt to scale a merger of Alpine proportions, are the most
unlikely of soul mates.
</P>
<P>
   Weill, a self-made billionaire, is the Brooklyn-born son of
immigrants from Poland. He began his career as a shy Wall Street
messenger, and after decades of voracious deal-making emerged as
the portly and jocular head of Travelers and a fixture in rarefied
Manhattan social circles.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who was raised in Argentina and Brazil, is by training a
cerebral and methodical engineer who spent his entire career at
Citicorp, ascending to chief executive in 1984. By nature as
reserved as Weill is effusive, Reed survived Citicorp's
near-collapse several years ago in part because he is abundantly
skilled in the sometimes vicious art of corporate politics.
</P>
<P>
   Weill is a homebody who has cultivated a coterie of loyal
executives, while Reed is a globe-trotter and, for the most part,
has operated as a loner. Yet the two men seem to authentically
enjoy each other's company. And they are clearly determined to make
their merger a success; among the goals they have set together is a
doubling of Citigroup's profits by the end of 2002, from $6.7
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's incredibly intelligent, and he has decades of
experience in this global marketplace that I do not, so I learn a
lot from him,'' Weill said. ``He doesn't take any of my space, and
I don't think I take any of his. He has a real interesting thought
process that he goes through to come to a decision. I'm maybe more
intuitive, but 99 percent of the time we come to the exact same
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed countered: ``He always says 99 percent. I haven't hit the 1
percent yet. One of these days I'll have to find out where we
differ.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Reed readily cites one clear difference: ``He gets
things done through a web of people relationships, which is very
different than the sort of process orientation that I've had.'' In
addition, Reed said, ``He's an instinctive manager, and I probably
hadn't fully appreciated that, so I've learned to listen to some of
his instincts, which are pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, other differences emerge from conversations with the two
men _ differences directly relevant to the problems that Citigroup
is having in getting its feet on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Weill does not share Reed's sense of urgency
about the importance of anointing and grooming a successor in the
wake of Dimon's departure. For another, Reed voiced a skepticism
about investment banking that Weill did not.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, of course, is layered on top of continuing unrest
on the corporate side of Citigroup's business.
</P>
<P>
   The co-chief executives have appointed Michael A. Carpenter and
Victor J. Menezes to run the corporate business, now that Dimon is
gone. Carpenter will oversee the investment banking operations
inherited from Travelers, as well as Citicorp's private banking and
foreign exchange operations and other capital markets activities.
Menezes will look after the company's emerging-markets operation
and commercial banking.
</P>
<P>
   Reed and Weill said they planned to let these business operate
somewhat independently in markets where Travelers and Citicorp each
had ``critical mass'' before the merger _ primarily North America.
They will be consolidated where such mass did not exist _ almost
everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   But Citigroup employees say they are getting conflicting signals
about exactly how all of this will proceed, and analysts remain
skeptical about where things are headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have to do something more profound,'' said Judah
Kraushaar, a Merrill Lynch analyst. ``They have to do something
about the pay structures and the egos and show a more rational
organizational structure. I'm still waiting to hear something new
and different.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed and Weill said they did not plan to adjust compensation to
reduce friction between commercial bankers and investment bankers.
But Weill acknowledged that because of Wall Street's troubles this
summer, bonuses would be much lower this year than last.

 NEW YORK: than last.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Friday, Citigroup announced that bonuses, typically awarded
in December, would be delayed until January. Some analysts
speculate that a flood of talent could leave Citigroup after those
lower bonuses were awarded.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear how big a role investment banking will
ultimately play in Citigroup. Weill sees the company becoming the
world's top investment bank over the next five years, eclipsing
rivals like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed's interests lie mainly in the consumer side of the
merged business, where he says Citigroup can outflank its
competitors by pursuing business through more ``channels'': credit
cards, branch offices, the Internet, insurance agents and
stockbrokers, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said recent conversations with overseas clients had
convinced him that many were now wary of dealing with investment
bankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think banks have a more healthy relationship on the
corporate side with their customers than do the traditional
investment banks,'' Reed said. Investment banking giants like
Merrill and Morgan Stanley, he said, ``sort of fly in and fly out''
of markets and ``are very fee-oriented and very
transactional-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: Investment banking has been the most
troublesome part of Citigroup's business. Reed noted that it was
problems in Salomon's free-wheeling bond-trading business, battered
by global financial upheaval, that first raised his and Weill's
concerns that third-quarter earnings were going to plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the matter in August at a home Weill owns on Upper
Saranac Lake in upstate New York, Reed recalled, ``We became aware
that our interest-rate-arbitrage business or whatever you call it
was hanging out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sort of relaxed and carefree,'' he added, ``but when
we saw the quarter deteriorating in front of us, I think it forced
us to concentrate.'' The Greenbrier retreat and the management
shake-up soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   So now what? In the next two weeks, Weill said, Citigroup will
focus on the best ways to expand and on fixing the problems on its
corporate side. Among other things, he said he intended to ``kill
this bureaucracy that doesn't give the people in the field the
authority to make decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other big strategic and tactical choices to make. One
is how to advance long-stalled legislation needed to keep
Citigroup's insurance and banking businesses under one roof, given
the ascension of Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican considered
unfriendly to the cause, to the chairmanship of the Senate Banking
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Another is how soon someone will be selected to take Dimon's
place as the company's likely future leader _ someone who will be
associated primarily with Citigroup, not Weill's Travelers or
Reed's Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important that somebody be groomed,'' said
Reed, who expects Citigroup's board to address the issue soon. ``I
was working on that with my board before the merger'' _ at
Citicorp, few apparent successors lasted long _ ``and I would think
the merger would simply accentuate it because neither Sandy nor I
are kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I think _ and here Sandy and I would have a slightly
different description, I think _ my own view is that it's quite
important to the evolution of this merger that at some point Sandy
and I step back and allow integrated management to take over.''
</P>
<P>
   With co-chief executives, Reed said, it can be hard for
employees to figure out who is really in charge, and to whom they
report.
</P>
<P>
   Weill is, indeed, of a different mind on the topic of
succession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less urgent because we have co-CEOs,'' he said. ``We have
an agreement that we're going to have this place running like a
finely tuned machine and doing incredibly well before we go.''
</P>
<P>
   So much is to be done, yet Weill, at least, can joke about how
the duties will be divvied up. Strolling through the library that
separates his office from Reed's, Weill points outside to a small
terrace where the wood for his fireplace will be stacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who will cut the wood?'' he is asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``John will,'' Weill responds with a grin.

FLORIDA CHARGES SCIENTOLOGY CHURCH IN MEMBER'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Florida prosecutors filed criminal charges
Friday against the Church of Scientology in connection with the
death of a church member while she was under the care of
Scientologists three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The church's Flag Service Organization, its chief operating arm
in Clearwater, Fla., was charged with abuse or neglect of a
disabled adult and with the unauthorized practice of medicine in
the death of the church member, Lisa McPherson, 36.
</P>
<P>
   The felony charges were filed in Clearwater, which is the
church's spiritual headquarters, by the state attorney for Pasco
and Pinellas Counties, Bernie McCabe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McPherson, who had spent half her life as a member of the
church, died on Dec. 5, 1995. She had spent the previous 17 days
under 24-hour watch in a church-owned hotel in Clearwater after
suffering an apparent nervous breakdown following a minor traffic
accident. Church records said she had suffered dementia and had to
be restrained at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinellas County Medical Examiner said Ms. McPherson had been
deprived of water for 5 to 10 days before her death and ruled that
she had died of a blood clot brought on by dehydration. Clearwater
police and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement conducted a
two-year investigation that led to the charges filed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McPherson's death has become a rallying point for critics of
Scientology and was the subject of a long article in The New York
Times last December. They contend that her death reflects the
coercive nature of the church, which has been a lightning rod for
criticism since it was founded 48 years ago by L. Ron Hubbard, the
late science fiction writer.
</P>
<P>
   Scientology has grown into a worldwide movement that boasts
eight million members, although critics say the number is much
smaller. The church was granted tax-exempt status in 1993 after a
bitter 25-year battle with the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials and organizations have faced charges in foreign
countries in recent years, but the charges in the McPherson case
are believed to be the first criminal allegations against a
Scientology entity in the United States since 11 of its leaders
were imprisoned 20 years ago for breaking into government offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Clearwater charges are similar to those brought against
nursing homes accused of providing inadequate treatment to elderly
patients who die in their care. The abuse or neglect charge accuses
the church of knowingly or negligently causing harm to Ms.
McPherson.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials and lawyers have maintained that Ms. McPherson
was cared for properly under Scientology's beliefs and that her
death was unrelated to her stay at the church's Fort Harrison
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Laura L. Vaughan, a lawyer for the church, said the charges did
not accuse the church or any of its members with intentionally
harming Ms. McPherson. ``There was no charge of manslaughter and no
charge that the church caused her death,'' Ms. Vaughan said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennan Dandar, a lawyer for the McPherson family in a civil
lawsuit against the church, said the family was pleased by the
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The family's wrongful-death suit against the church is scheduled
to go to trial next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Under Florida law, the maximum penalty is a $5,000 fine for each
charge, but courts may impose additional penalties, including
forfeiture of property. McCabe and Clearwater police officials
declined to comment on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   However, an 18-page affidavit by A.L. Strope, a special agent
with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which was released
with the charges, provided a chilling portrait of Ms. McPherson's
final days.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McPherson worked as a sales representative at a Clearwater
firm owned by other Scientologists. After the accident in which she
appeared to have been uninjured, she stripped off her clothes on
the street and began to mumble.
</P>
<P>
   She was taken to a local hospital and a physician there wanted
to provide psychiatric treatment. But several church members went
to the hospital and took Ms. McPherson to the church hotel. The
Church of Scientology prohibits psychiatric treatment for its
members.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 17 days, according to Strope's affidavit, Ms.
McPherson was hyperactive, delusional and hallucinating. He said
she tried to harm herself and others and was repeatedly restrained
and prevented from leaving her room.
</P>
<P>
   After the first week, she routinely urinated and defecated on
herself and rarely slept, Strope said. She had conversations with
people who were not there, claimed to be people she was not, sang
and danced around the room as if giving a performance, crawled
around on the floor, stood on the toilet, got in the shower fully
clothed, tried to walk out of the room in a state of undress and on
at least one occasion drank her own urine.
</P>
<P>
   Strope said Scientology staff members administered injections of
magnesium chloride in an effort to get her to sleep and gave her
numerous doses of vitamins, herbal sleep remedies and prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One staff member who treated Ms. McPherson, Dr. Janice Johnson,
had been a practicing anesthesiologist in Arizona before she ran
into disciplinary trouble and let her medical license lapse, Strope
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other people who cared for Ms. McPherson also had some
medical training, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Dec. 5, 1995, Ms. McPherson's condition had
deteriorated to the point where Dr. Johnson telephoned a
Scientologist working as an emergency room physician at a hospital
45 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   The physician, David I. Minkoff, told investigators that he
suggested Ms. McPherson be taken to the nearest hospital if she was
very ill.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going to Morton Plant Hospital, which was just a few
blocks away, Ms. McPherson was driven 45 minutes to the hospital
where Minkoff worked. She was pronounced dead shortly after
arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Minkoff said he was shocked by her horrific appearance. The
medical examiner later estimated that she had lost as much as 40
pounds and been without water for up to 10 days, allegations
disputed by church lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Strope said that the delay in seeking emergency care deprived
Ms. McPherson of her only opportunity for survival.

BOSTON PLANS GUN SUIT, MAYOR'S AIDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT   AND LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Following similar actions by New Orleans and Chicago,
the city of Boston plans to sue gun manufacturers, distributors,
and gun shops in a novel attempt to recover costs related to urban
violence, aides to Mayor Thomas M. Menino said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which would allege that gun makers produce a
defective product and violate public nuisance laws by putting guns
in the hands of criminals, is modeled after suits brought against
tobacco companies that have resulted in billion-dollar settlements
in several states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're riding a tide of interest on this in terms of consumer
protection and public health. We want to hold handgun manufacturers
responsible the way car manufacturers and tobacco companies are
held responsible,'' said Peter Welsh, a top aide to Menino. ``We
want to push the envelope on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, attorneys general from around the country sued
cigarette makers to reclaim billions of dollars in Medicaid outlays
to sick smokers. That has prompted several big-city mayors to
embrace a growing trend of holding gun manufacturers responsible
for health-care costs associated with their product.Philadelphia
and Los Angeles are mulling similar action.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the gun industry's perspective this is the beginning of
the avalanche,'' said Kirsten Rand, of the Violence Policy Center,
a Washington gun control group. ``It's very significant that a
major city like Boston follows on the heels of Chicago's suit
because it could mean serious financial problems for the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun lobby has condemned these attempts because it believes
they are intended to bring the manufacturers to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me like pure harassment,'' said Paul Blackman,
research coordinator for the National Rifle Association. ``What
they're hoping is that if they file enough lawsuits, industries
won't be able to defend themselves and will settle - even if the
lawsuits are totally without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun said the parallels with the tobacco-industry lawsuits
are misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the harm that comes from using a gun is contrary to the
advice of the manufacturer, who labels the gun with warnings about
how not to misuse the gun,'' said Blackman. ``The harm from smoking
comes from using the product as directed.''
</P>
<P>
   Menino was initially reluctant to file suit but was persuaded in
part to jump on the bandwagon after his friend, Richard Daley,
Mayor of Chicago, filed suit. City attorneys are now furiously
trying to calculate the costs that gun-related violence exacts on
the city and how much could be reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   John Auerbach, Boston public health commissioner, said the cost
of hospitalization alone stemming from handgun violence is $10
million a year in Boston. Adding in other related costs _ including
time expended by police and emergency medical technicians, and such
factors as lost income and tax revenue due to residents who have
been injured or killed _ and the figure goes much higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the stage of assessing the cost, to the public, of
the damage that is done. We have the basis for a suit, and it's a
matter of putting the lawsuit together,'' Auerbach said.
</P>
<P>
   An average of 34,000 Americans have been killed by guns every
year since 1989 and more than twice that number are shot, according
to Handgun Epidemic Lowering Plan, a new national medical network
with member organizations such as the American Medical Association.
The estimated cost in 1992 of firearm injuries in direct medical
expenses nationally was $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Firearms are only second to motor vehicles in causing injury
deaths, according to a study released two weeks ago by the
Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's lawsuit against gun manufacturers, distributors, and
stores seeks $433 million in damages, based on similar
calculations. Auerbach said the Boston lawsuit would be modeled
largely after the Chicago suit, which targeted 22 handgun
manufacturers and four local distributors plus several retail
outlets where guns were sold in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago lawsuit alleges gun manufacturers and dealers
knowingly market firearms so they wind up in the hands of criminals
on city streets, in violation of the city's public nuisance laws.
The New Orleans lawsuit focuses more on product liability and the
allegation that a handgun has inherent design defects that make it
unsafe. Welsh said the Boston lawsuit would attempt to blend both
themes.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston lawsuit would almost certainly target Smith &AMP; Wesson, a
leading handgun manufacturer with headquarters in Springfield,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Menino has consulted with Middlesex District Attorney Thomas
Reilly, who this month won election as the state's new attorney
general, about the feasibility of the idea. Reilly, whom Menino
supported during this fall's campaign, said he is scrutinizing the
legal tactics involved in suing gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor called and said he was contemplating taking this
action and asked for our help,'' Reilly said. ``I said if there was
anything we could do, we would. I, too, have a problem with guns
and if we can assist in this action, we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the cities that decide to sue may band together and
begin settlement negotiations with gun makers, just as the states
did with cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies were sufficiently threatened by the Medicaid
lawsuits brought by attorneys general that they came to the
bargaining table. Legal representatives of the gun industry,
however, have given no indication that a settlement is possible and
have said the lawsuits will not hold up in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The starting point for us is, thinking of this as a public
health issue, and not just a public safety issue,'' said Auerbach.
``Some would say it's a public health epidemic. So it makes sense
to think about the same interventions as you would with other
public health issues, like tobacco. And we can have a dramatic
impact on an industry that has enormous profits, and thinks more
about the bottom line than the public health.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The head of one struggling health plan is leaving
to assume control of another.
</P>
<P>
   Cora Tellez, until Friday president of Prudential HealthCare's
Western Division, was named the new chief executive of Foundation
Health System's largest plan, Health Net. Both companies are based
in Woodland Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Tellez will replace Arthur Southam, who earlier this week
resigned under pressure from Foundation management.
</P>
<P>
   In making the move, Tellez leaves an 800,000-member plan with an
uncertain future for the 2.3 million-member flagship of the
nation's fourth-largest publicly traded managed care company.
</P>
<P>
   Tellez was hired in 1997 by Prudential in part to straighten out
the financial and organizational house of Prudential's money-losing
health division. For more than a year, Prudential's parent company
has sought to sell its health division, and takeover talks
reportedly are continuing with health care giant Humana Inc. of
Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Southam, Foundation recently pushed out the head
of its Northeast Division. California, represented by Health Net,
and the Northeast are Foundation's most lucrative markets and are
considered key to the company's successful recovery from a yearlong
earnings slump.
</P>
<P>
   Though Health Net was profitable under Southam, Foundation
considers Tellez better equipped to institute the sort of cost
cutting that Foundation Chief Executive Jay Gellert has said is
necessary in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cora Tellez is the right person to lead Health Net to the next
stage of its growth,'' said Health Net Chairman Roger Greaves.
</P>
<P>
   Tellez will in turn be replaced at Prudential by Susan Hallett,
the division's vice president of provider relations. Hallett
herself only joined Prudential in April of this year after several
years with Blue Shield of Washington and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Hallett is ``thoroughly committed to continuing and enhancing
the division's positive momentum'' generated by Tellez, the company
said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation shares rose $0.1875 cents Friday to close at
$14.8125.

CLINTON TO SETTLE WITH JONES FOR $850,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton agreed Friday to pay Paula Corbin
Jones $850,000 to settle her sexual-harassment suit against him,
capping an embarrassing four-year legal battle that was the trigger
for current efforts to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement does not require Clinton to apologize or admit any
wrongdoing _ something Jones long demanded _ and it halts Jones's
efforts to have her lawsuit re-instated by an appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   The White House offered no reaction to the agreement, referring
calls to the president's private attorney, Robert S. Bennett. He
said Clinton ``remained certain'' that -Jones's claims ``are
baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has decided he is not prepared to spend one more
hour on this matter,'' Bennett said. ``It is clear that the
American people want their president and Congress to focus on the
problems that they were elected to solve. This is a step in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement requires Clinton to pay Jones the amount within
60 days ``in full satisfaction of all claims for damages, including
but not limited to any physical and personal injury, civil rights
violations, emotional distress, and any fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this litigation or the facts and circumstances
underlying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the settlement states that: ``Nothing in this
agreement shall be construed to be an admission or liability or
wrongdoing by any party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paula is very pleased that it's finally over,'' Bill McMillan,
a lawyer for Jones and the husband of her longtime friend and
spokeswoman Susan Carpenter McMillan, told the Associated Press.
Asked if Jones considered the payment a victory, he replied: ``You
bet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the impeachment hearings begin. We want out of it,''
Jones's husband, Steven, told reporters outside his Long Beach,
Calif., condominium.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the payment would come from Chubb Group
Insurance, a legal source familiar with the case told the
Associated Press. For a lump sum of roughly $400,000, Chubb was
buying out the president's personal liability policy, which had
been paying his Jones-related legal bills, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The balance could be drawn from Clinton's Legal Expense Trust,
which contains donations of at least $1 million. Trust
administrator Peter Lavallee said that as of Friday evening he had
not been contacted about any such request.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at McMillan's law office said he and Jones would
hold a news conference Monday outside his Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, a
Virginia foundation that provided financial backing for Jones,
said: ``This settlement brings to a conclusion four long years of
seeking justice for Paula.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The suit has raised a lot of important issues the American
people and their leaders will have to deal with for years to come,
such as the importance of protecting powerless women from workplace
harassment and the role of the rule of law in our highest
offices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement puts to rest a problem that has shadowed Clinton
and put his presidency in peril. It was Clinton's testimony in a
six-hour deposition in the Jones suit in January that led
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr to investigate the president's
relationship with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied under oath that he had sexual relations with
Lewinsky, a story he stuck to until August, when he acknowledged an
improper relationship with her.
</P>
<P>
   With Starr set to testify at impeachment hearings scheduled to
begin next week before the House Judiciary Committee, White House
aides said privately it was in the president's best interest for
the case to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cammarata, a former lawyer for Jones, said the agreement
worked to the benefit of Jones and Clinton. Jones needs the money,
and Clinton needs it off the table for political reasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president could use it as a springboard to say to the
American people `I made peace with Paula Jones,' and since the
impeachment inquiry had its genesis with the Paula Jones case, `Now
I want to make peace with you, the American people,''' Cammarata
said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came just as the on-again, off-again talks seemed
ready to collapse despite promising signs in September, when Jones'
lawyers dropped her demand for an apology. At the time they said
Jones felt vindicated by Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony, in
which he said he was not necessarily forthcoming in his January
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were complicated when New York real estate magnate Abe
Hirschfeld offered Jones $1 million to drop her suit, causing the
White House to distant Clinton from the offer. Last week, Jones
lawyers offered to accept $950,000 to settle the suit, without any
outside payment by Hirschfeld. Bennett rejected the figure. The two
sides reopened the talks this week.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, McMillan presented Bennett with a letter stating the
Hirschfeld offer was ``off the table.' The deal was signed by the
lawyers hours later, an Associated Press source said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McMillan, in New York with Jones for a television
interview, said Jones's husband called at 5 p.m. to say the
agreement had been reached. Jones cried and said, ``It's over, I'm
glad,'' Mrs. McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paula is tickled to death. She's ecstatic, as happy as any one
individual can be,'' Jones's husband said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement brings an end to the case that began when Jones
alleged that Clinton exposed himself and asked her to perform oral
sex in a Little Rock hotel in 1991, when he was governor of
Arkansas and she was a state employee attending a government
conference.
</P>
<P>
   In April, federal Judge Susan Webber Wright rejected Jones's
claim that she had suffered sexual harrassment or emotional
distress during the encounter at the Excelsior Hotel. She said
Jones was unable to prove that she was personally or professionally
injured by the incident, which the judge said at worst was
``boorish and offensive'' if it happened as Jones described it.
</P>
<P>
   Jones appealed the decision, which was being reviewed by the
Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.

OFFERMAN IN; IS BELLE NEXT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, who closed a deal
Friday in Los Angeles with free agent infielder Jose Offerman, was
flying home with possibly an even bigger prize, free agent
outfielder Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Belle had already agreed to come to terms with the Red
Sox was uncertain at Friday evening. But according to sources, he
and Duquette had first-class seats on an American Airlines flight
due to arrive at Logan Airport shortly before 10 p.m. It seemed
unlikely that Belle was coming to Boston just to take a
Duquette-guided tour.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Mo Vaughn rejected the Red Sox' final proposal,
Duquette accelerated contingency plans he'd made in the event the
All-Star first baseman did not come back, meeting Thursday with
Belle's agent, Arn Tellem, then quickly making a deal for Offerman,
who said he chose the Red Sox after considering the Indians and
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Sox have struck or are close to striking a deal with
Belle, it would explain in part why they were able to issue a
take-it-or-leave-it offer to Vaughn. Apparently, they had strong
indications that Belle would sign with them if Vaughn left.
</P>
<P>
   Both Duquette and CEO John Harrington have been effusive in
their praise of Belle, whom Duquette called a Hall of Fame-type
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But Belle told The Associated Press in a telephone interview
from his home in Tucson, Ariz., Friday that he expects to meet with
the New York Yankees next week.
</P>
<P>
   He was impressed with Duquette, saying the GM is ``letting it
all hang out to win. He's not going to be happy until he wins the
World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had a preference between the Red Sox and Yankees,
Belle told AP, ``That's hard to say because I haven't had a chance
to sit down and talk with the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Belle expects to become the highest-paid player in
baseball, meaning his deal would eclipse the seven-year, $91
million package catcher Mike Piazza signed with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, meanwhile, had yet to accept an offer from the Anaheim
Angels, and according to one source, had plans to meet with at
least one other team early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, who turned 30 six days ago, agreed to a four-year deal
for a guaranteed $26 million, with a club option for a fifth year.
The native of San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican Republic, who
hit .315, led the majors in triples with 13, and stole 45 bases
last season, figures to displace Darren Lewis and Jeff Frye as the
team's leadoff man, though where the Sox plan to play him afield
remains unclear, even to him.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, except for a handful of at-bats at DH, Offerman
played exclusively at second base. He broke into the majors for the
Dodgers as a shortstop, where he led the National League in errors
three times and openly warred with then manager Tom Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   Traded to Kansas City for pitcher Billy Brewer after the '95
season, Offerman played both first and second base for the first
time in his big league career before becoming a full-time second
baseman in each of the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to say,'' Offerman said when asked where he
thinks he'll play for the Sox. ``I haven't talked with (Duquette)
directly. I prefer playing one position, no question. But I'm ready
to play anywhere they want me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox gave a $1 million signing bonus to Offerman, who
last season was paid $2 million by the Royals, including $400,000
in incentives. The new contract calls for Offerman to be paid $4.5
million next year, $5.5 million in 2000, and $6.5 million in each
of the following two seasons. Boston has an $8 million option for
2003, with a $2 million buyout.
</P>
<P>
   With Frye, who missed last season because of knee surgery, plus
Donnie Sadler and Lou Merloni, the Red Sox already have a surplus
of second basemen. They have two first base-DH types in Mike
Stanley and Reggie Jefferson, and having hit just seven home runs
last season, Offerman doesn't provide the power production that
teams, especially in the American League, expect from players at
that position.
</P>
<P>
   What Offerman does give the Red Sox is a top-of-the-order
offensive force, one who had an on-base percentage of .403, which
ranked him fifth in the league, just ahead of Vaughn (.402).
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to the AL three seasons ago, Offerman has hit
consistently, batting .306 while averaging 82 runs a year for a
team that ranks among the weakest in the league. In that span, he
has hit lefties (.315) and righties (.301) almost equally well,
while batting .303 with runners in scoring position. With the
Royals, he batted in each of the first three spots in the order,
most successfully (.340) in the No. 3 hole.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a trade that would open up the second base job
full-time, it would appear that Offerman could be used as a Tony
Phillips utility type, logging time at several positions. In their
press release, the Sox mentioned that Offerman could play the
outfield, but he's appeared there only three times in his big
league career.
</P>
<P>
   One Sox player happy with the news of Offerman's signing was
countryman Pedro Martinez, who has known him since both were in the
Dodgers' academy in the Dominican Republic. They played together
for the Dodgers in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player,'' Martinez said. ``He can steal bases and
hit. He can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I are pretty close. I really appreciate that Offerman
is coming over to us. He's someone I can go out to eat with, spend
some time together.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who was not aware of Belle's pending visit to Boston,
said he wasn't surprised Vaughn had elected to reject the Sox'
offer and expressed disappointment that the first baseman would be
going elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But he also endorsed the idea of Belle joining the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Martinez said. ``He's a great offensive player. He
can help any team. I'm sure he can help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Belle's contract with the White Sox stipulates that he has a
30-day window to explore free agency if he no longer ranks among
the three highest-paid players in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, who has three years left on a contract paying him $10
million a year, has dropped out of the top three, and when the
White Sox rejected his request to increase his salary by $1.42
million a year, he entered the free agent market.

CLINTON AGREES TO PAY JONES $850,000 TO DROP SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for additional info and quotes throughout; story grows by
about 500 words)   (bl)  
 By JAMES BENNET and NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton agreed Friday to pay Paula Jones
$850,000 to drop her legal claim that he crudely propositioned her
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The payment settles a lawsuit that Clinton's advisers once
mocked but that, by forcing his intimate life into public view,
ultimately threatened his hold on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the agreement, Mrs. Jones dropped what she had once
called her most important demand: that Clinton apologize and admit
wrongdoing. She had wanted him to acknowledge that in 1991, when he
was governor of Arkansas and she a clerk employed by the state, he
had her summoned to a Little Rock hotel room and made a lewd
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Through Robert Bennett, his lawyer, the president continued
Friday to call Mrs. Jones' accusation baseless. But by settling, he
was able to eliminate the risk that an appeals court would prolong
the case, which was dismissed in April by a U.S. District Court
judge in Little Rock. Clinton's advisers had feared that Mrs. Jones
would win her appeal, and that her lawyers would be able to depose
the president once again.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials also believe that the settlement will help
protect him from impeachment by eliminating a source of possible
legal reversals and further embarrassing disclosures about his
private life.
</P>
<P>
   It was in a deposition in the Jones case on Jan. 17 that Clinton
denied a sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. Out of the president's efforts to conceal that affair
from Mrs. Jones' lawyers, independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr
built a case for possible impeachment on perjury, witness-tampering
and obstruction-of-justice charges that the House Judiciary
Committee is now considering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has decided he is not prepared to spend one more
hour on this matter,'' Bennett said in a statement announcing the
settlement. But Clinton's busy schedule aside, even his allies had
long viewed the expense to him of not settling the case sooner _ in
prestige, political capital and perhaps his place in history _ as
incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the settlement was announced Friday, some Clinton
loyalists lamented the for-want-of-a-nail element. One adviser just
groaned when asked if he wished the president had settled earlier.
Another Clinton associate said that if the case had been settled
earlier, ``no one would know who Monica Lewinsky was.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones cried upon receiving the news of the settlement,
Susan Carpenter-McMillan, a Jones adviser, told reporters gathered
outside a New York City hotel where her friend was doing a
television interview Friday. ``It's over and I'm glad,'' she quoted
Mrs. Jones as saying.
</P>
<P>
   John Whitehead, one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said, ``The
settlement brings to a conclusion four long years of seeking
justice for Paula.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The suit has raised a lot of important issues that the
American people and their leaders will have to deal with for years
to come,'' Whitehead added, ``such as the importance of protecting
powerless women from workplace harassment and the role of the rule
of law in our highest offices.''
</P>
<P>
   The terse eight-point agreement, filed Friday with Susan Webber
Wright, the judge who dismissed the suit in April, calls for
Clinton to pay Mrs. Jones within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement requires Judge Wright's approval, but that is
considered likely, since she had long urged a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Friday's agreement, Mrs. Jones also dropped her claim
against Clinton's co-defendant, Danny Ferguson, an Arkansas state
trooper who Mrs. Jones said escorted her to the governor's hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate agreement, which was not made part of the filing,
Mrs. Jones' lawyers said she renounced any intention to accept
money from Abe Hirschfeld, a New York City real estate magnate who
had said he would pay her $1 million to settle.
</P>
<P>
   White House advisers said they hoped that the $850,000 would be
covered by Clinton's personal insurance policies. But if the two
companies that have insured the president decline to pay, the
advisers said, the money will come from the president's legal
defense fund, which now has a balance of more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones has her own financial trouble to resolve. She has had
as many as six sets of lawyers, whose bills total nearly $3
million. Yet she is hoping to net $300,000 to 500,000 from the
agreement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is said by associates to be
particularly concerned about her family's mounting legal bills, had
been worried that a settlement might make too big a dent in the
defense fund. But the Clintons' fund-raisers assured her that they
could easily replenish any funds used toward a Jones settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had also been opposed to any settlement that
included an apology, aides said, since it would have carried an
acknowledgment of conduct the president denied. The agreement filed
Friday states, ``Nothing in this agreement shall by construed to be
an admission of liability or wrongdoing by any party.''
</P>
<P>
   But plainly, the settlement can only bolster public sentiment,
as demonstrated in opinion polls, that Mrs. Jones told the truth.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment she first made her accusation against the
president, in a televised news conference on Feb. 11, 1994, his
advisers dismissed her as a gold digger in league with his
conservative enemies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, but more quietly, his lawyers were trying to
settle the lawsuit. Their efforts initially foundered on Mrs.
Jones' demand for an apology; Clinton said he had nothing to
apologize for.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Mrs. Jones expanded her legal claims, arguing that
Clinton had harassed her, caused her emotional distress and damaged
her career. But in April, Judge Wright found that the plaintiff had
offered no ``tangible'' evidence of damage and dismissed the case,
saying it presented ``no genuine issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The ground shifted dramatically when Clinton admitted on Aug.
17, in grand jury testimony and in a brief televised address to the
nation, that he had had an intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
Mrs. Jones' advisers said she no longer required an apology, since,
they said, most people would now believe her.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Clinton's advisers now had more reason to settle. They
worried that the president's admission about Ms. Lewinsky might
strengthen Mrs. Jones' appeal. And with impeachment proceedings
pending, they believed that taking the Jones lawsuit off the table
would help reassure congressional Democrats that there would be no
further nasty disclosures or legal reversals for the president.
That would increase the Democrats' confidence in defending him.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Bennett reopened settlement talks, offering
$700,000. The Jones lawyers countered with a request for $1
million, and the two sides started haggling, slowly.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed tantalizingly close when the offer last month from
Hirschfeld, who said he believed that a settlement was in the
interests of the country, threw the negotiations into chaos. The
White House was concerned over any sense that Hirschfeld, who is
under indictment on tax fraud charges, was bailing out the
president.
</P>
<P>
   To seal the agreement, William McMillan, Ms.
Carpenter-McMillan's husband and Mrs. Jones' lead negotiator, wrote
in a letter to Bennett this week, ``I further represent to you that
the money from Abe Hirschfeld is no longer on the table, and that
there will be no payment from Hirschfeld as a part of the
settlement with Mr. Clinton.''

NEW YORK CONSIDERS HOW TO SPEND TOBACCO MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (With TOBACCO-SETTLE)  
(lb) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The deal has not been announced yet, but already
there is no shortage of competing proposals for spending New York's
$20 billion share of a reported $206 billion tobacco settlement:
things like health care for the uninsured, stop-smoking programs
and a cut in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, since the first, ill-fated multistate
tobacco settlement was announced, interest groups and elected
officials here have been making plans for the money, which would be
paid over 25 years. On Friday, with word that a settlement would be
made final on Saturday and announced on Monday, the lobbying began
anew.
</P>
<P>
   In his successful campaign to unseat Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, Rep.
Charles Schumer said New York's share of any settlement should be
used to reduce property taxes, an idea that has not caught on with
state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The most important player in deciding how the money would be
spent, Gov. George Pataki, has not indicated his views.
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver ``would want to see a
major effort to limit smoking by youngsters, and to see some of it
go to a pool for people without health insurance, and maybe some
for school infrastructure,'' his spokeswoman, Pat Lynch, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the state's business groups would probably push for
using some of the money to reduce employers' health insurance
premiums, officials of those groups said. Premiums now include more
than $2 billion a year in surcharges to support hospital care for
the uninsured and graduate medical education, expenses that the
officials said could be paid partly with tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition that includes the New York Medical Society, the New
York Public Interest Research Group and the state chapters of the
American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association and the
League of Women Voters held a news conference here Friday to ask
that $2.4 billion go into programs that help people stop smoking
and discourage young people from starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that all of the money should be funneled back into
the health-care system and into ways to keep kids from smoking,''
said Blair Horner, legislative director of the Public Interest
Research Group. ``We don't want to see it going into roads and
bridges and other unrelated things.''
</P>
<P>
   Several state legislators said they expected the number of
proposals for using the money to grow in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be pretty much a feeding frenzy,'' said one
legislator who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``I mean, it's
free money.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would not restrict the states' use of the money,
said aides to Attorney General Dennis Vacco, who was involved in
the negotiations with tobacco companies. But they said it was
back-loaded, so that the annual payments would start relatively
small and grow during the 25-year span of the settlement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vacco, a Republican, has changed from a reluctant and late
entrant into the litigation to a major participant. For a year he
resisted calls from Democrats and health-care advocates to join
other states in suing the tobacco industry, and he did so in
January 1997 only after 18 other states had. At the time, he said
he had offered the tobacco companies a $656 million settlement, a
tiny fraction of what New York now stands to gain.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats attacked Vacco's handling of the issue during his
recent re-election campaign. The Nov. 3 election was so close that
it is still unclear whether he won a second term or lost to his
Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer.

UCLA DEFENSIVE BOSS IS ON THE SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ UCLA defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti has coached in
the NCAA and NFL for 24 years and experienced every situation
imaginable _ or so he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Monday afternoon, Bob Toledo ripped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never had a head coach put my name in the papers and blast
me,'' Aliotti said.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo wasn't Aliotti's harshest critic after the Bruins
yielded 34 points and 491 yards last weekend to Oregon State's
mediocre offense.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is seventh in the Pacific-10 in scoring defense, ninth in
pass defense and ninth in total defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take a lot of pride in your work, you're your own
critic,'' Aliotti said. ``I don't need the papers or coach Toledo
or the talk shows to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was miserable after the (Oregon State) game. I wasn't
worried about what anyone else was thinking. I was upset. I was
embarrassed. I was angry. Any adjective you can think of, that was
me. It was a tough week.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get any easier today when the Bruins face a desperate
Washington team in the rain and cold of raucous Husky Stadium, the
most feared venue in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have lost two straight (to USC and Oregon), they
need one win to become bowl-eligible, and they have a dynamic
quarterback tandem in passer Brock Huard and runner Marques
Tuiasosopo. Washington uses the same spread formations _ three- and
four-receiver alignments _ that gave UCLA trouble against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the best team we've played in weeks,'' UCLA guard Andy
Meyers said, ``and everybody knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially Aliotti. He and Toledo worked together on the Oregon
staff in 1988 and remained friends despite disparate paths to
Westwood: Toledo stopped at Texas A&AMP;M, and Aliotti masterminded
Oregon's 1995 Rose Bowl defense and spent three years with the St.
Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti was Toledo's first choice to replace the popular Rocky
Long, who became head coach at New Mexico last winter. He abandoned
Long's unconventional system and installed a 3-4-4 alignment that
was more traditional _ and more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins slowly absorbed Aliotti's playbook through the summer
and fall. They played well in the second half of the breakthrough
win at Arizona, they held Oregon to 38 points _ 12 below its
average at the time _ and they shut down Cal's sputtering offense.
</P>
<P>
   That win may have created a false sense of progress. The
following week, to prepare for Stanford's passing attack, Aliotti
added a plethora of new plays and formations. With just two senior
starters, the young Bruins short-circuited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we did something well, we put more things in,'' Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reacting, the Bruins had to think about their new
assignments before, and during, each play. That split-second
hesitation allowed Stanford and Oregon State to move the ball at
will.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo did not hesitate to criticize the players _ especially
the defensive backs _ when he thought they played poorly in
September. But the latest mishaps were not their fault.
</P>
<P>
   He blasted Aliotti, simplified the system, stressed fundamentals
and ordered Aliotti, a proponent of man-to-man coverage, to play
more zone. The Bruins weren't generating enough pass rush to
support the cornerbacks in man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Aliotti has really focused on execution,'' cornerback
Ryan Roques said. ``We want to simplify and perfect. He told us
that if anyone says anything about the defense, he'll take the
blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Scaling back the system was simple compared to finding the
proper teaching tone. Aliotti had to make his point without
shattering shaky confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to deflect the heat and be positive,'' he said.
``It's been a little more tough love, but I'm not sure where their
confidence level is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll find out today.

   Leaders of the pilots' union at Federal Express Corp. said
Friday that the company had rebuffed its latest effort to restart
contract negotiations, greatly increasing the chances that the
pilots will strike during the peak holiday-package shipping season
next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to extend the olive branch,'' said union vice
president Byron Cobb. ``They grasped it and hit us over the head
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The union said it would ask Fedex to submit to binding
arbitration in a final attempt to avert a strike that could hurt
many businesses around the country, some severely.
</P>
<P>
   But the leading express delivery company said the union had
declined its offer of binding arbitration when talks began in July,
and that now it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arbitration at this time would be unfair to Fedex and its
other employees and inappropriate given the history of
negotiations,'' Fedex said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest developments put the union and company back on a road
toward confrontation, a day after many analysts and industry
executives were becoming optimistic that an agreement would be
reached before the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, after days of increasingly tough talk by the company
and the union, the pilots sent the company a new proposal in a bid
to restart negotiations. Talks have been stalled since Oct. 30,
when Fedex withdrew its last offer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pilots said they were willing to compromise their pay
demands, including a one-time retroactive payment that would raise
the base pay of each pilot before new wage increases would be
applied.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, they said, the company responded by demanding that
the union's governing board of directors send the new agreement to
the rank and file with their full endorsement. The board refused.
</P>
<P>
   A Fedex spokesman said the union had never submitted a a
comprehensive written contract proposal, as the company had
requested, and that Fedex had simply asked the union for
clarification of its offer.
</P>
<P>
   Since the talks broke down, the company has moved aggressively
to reconfigure its operations so that it is less reliant on the
pilots. It has leased outside airplanes and made plans to divert
more deliveries to trucking subsidiaries owned by FDX Corp., the
holding company that also owns Fedex.
</P>
<P>
   Two Wall Street analysts who follow Fedex said the company had
too many planes and might be taking advantage of the impasse with
the pilots to accelerate its plans to move more transport capacity
to the ground, which is much less expensive than air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really starting to think they want a strike now,'' said
one of the analysts who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Rossiter, a Fedex spokesman, disagreed. ``We would love to
have an agreement, but we have had to make contingency plans to
protect our customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots, too, said they were now convinced that the company
wanted a confrontation. Cobb predicted 80 percent of the pilots
would authorize a strike when the votes are counted Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots will not take a concessionary contract,'' he said.
``They will not take a contract that is considered lukewarm.''

   SETTLEMENT REACHED WITH FOUR TOBACCO GIANTS
</P>
<P>
   The United States' four biggest cigarette makers and officials
of eight states have reached agreement on a plan to resolve all
remaining state claims over health costs related to smoking, said
attorneys general and industry lawyers involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, expected to be made final Saturday, would cost the
tobacco companies $206 billion over 25 years and would restrict
cigarette advertising and marketing, but it would also eliminate
the industry's most significant financial and legal threat, state
suits seeking to recover the Medicaid costs of treating people with
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would also cost far less than the $516 billion estimate
for a proposal last year.
</P>
<P>
   OCTOBER PRODUCER PRICES UP 0.2 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Producer prices rose 0.2 percent in October, after rising 0.3
percent in September. Retail sales increased 1 percent last month,
too, leading some economists to predict that the Federal Reserve
Board's policy-makers may refrain from cutting interest rates when
they meet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   THE FALL OF A NOBEL PRIZE THEORY
</P>
<P>
   The credibility of Myron Scholes and Robert Merton, who won the
Nobel award in economics, helped attract heavyweight investors,
lenders and trading partners to Long-Term Capital Management. But
for all the brilliance of their economic theory, it was based on
the assumption that the future performance of bonds would mirror
their past movements. When Russia decided to stop paying its debts
in August, investors in many markets panicked in a way that a
mathematical model could not have anticipated. And for all their
prominence as architects of the theories on which traders placed
their bets, Scholes and Merton in fact were not directly involved
in the firm's trading.
</P>
<P>
   UPS AND DOWNS IN FEDEX DISPUTE
</P>
<P>
   Shares of FDX, the parent of Federal Express, rose $1.125, to
$54, on optimism by analysts and industry executives that the
pilots union could avoid a confrontation with management. But the
optimism dimmed when the union said the company had rebuffed its
offer to restart contract talks, greatly increasing the chances of
a pilot strike during the peak season for sending holiday packages.
</P>
<P>
   BANK HAD TOO MUCH IN RESERVES
</P>
<P>
   Suntrust Bank agreed to decrease its loan reserves by $100
million after regulators told the big Southeast bank that it had
set aside too much money. It must restate earnings for 1994, 1995
and 1996 as a result.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO PROPOSES BIG CUTS FOR 1999
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has proposed cutting $10 billion in spending over five
years and said it would levy new taxes to keep the deficit down,
part of an effort to bring down inflation and keep the investment
environment stable next year.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund announced a $41.5 billion rescue
package for Brazil. The terms will require a level of discipline
and sacrifice that Latin America's largest nation has historically
failed to sustain.
</P>
<P>
   KPMG PEAT MARWICK DROPS LAWSUIT
</P>
<P>
   The accounting and consulting firm KPMG Peat Marwick has dropped
a suit in which it had accused rival Stern Stewart &AMP; Co. of
unfairly trying to stifle competition.

   SALOMON TO DELAY BONUSES A MONTH

would have to wait a month longer than usual to collect their
annual bonus checks.
</P>
<P>
   KOHLBERG REDUCES SAFEWAY STAKE
</P>
<P>
   The leveraged-buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has trimmed
its stake in Safeway by selling 20 million of the supermarket
chain's common shares. The sale was meant to put more of the
company's shares into the public float as Safeway joins the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.

MARINES WILL NOT PUNISH AUTHOR OF ANTI-CLINTON COLUMN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Marine Corps decided Friday not to punish an
officer who wrote a newspaper column rebuking President Clinton as
an ``adulterous liar,'' in a case that focused attention on the
military's prohibitions on public criticisms of the commander in
chief.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Shane Sellers, a 41-year-old intelligence analyst,
received the military equivalent of a stern talking-to from his
commanding officer but otherwise was not punished for the column,
which appeared on Oct. 12 in The Navy Times, an independent weekly
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers' column was one voice in a small but vocal chorus of
officers and enlisted personnel grousing about Clinton's affair
with Monica Lewinsky. Although hardly a groundswell, the comments
raised enough concern within the Pentagon that the Marine Corps and
the Air Force each took the unusual step of reminding officers that
Article 88 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice explicitly
prohibits them from speaking ``contemptuous words'' about the
president or other civilian leaders of the military.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers, who is assigned to work at the Defense Intelligence
Agency, lamented in his column that Clinton was not being held to
the same standards as uniformed officers, who could face punishment
and even court-martial for having an adulterous relationship with
someone who worked for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about sex,'' Sellers wrote. ``It's tawdry and
titillating, to be sure. But for all its soap-opera quality, what
Clinton and Monica did as consenting adults boils down to adultery.
And one should call an adulterous liar exactly what he is _ a
criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps declined to discuss the findings of an
investigation into the matter except to announce that Brig. Gen.
Frances Wilson, commander of the Marine Corps base at Quantico,
Va., met Friday with Sellers and now considers the case closed,
with no formal punitive action having been taken.
</P>
<P>
   Under Article 88, Sellers could have received a letter of
reprimand or other administrative punishments that could have
harmed his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a private issue between a superior and a subordinate,''
Capt. Sean Clements, a spokesman at Quantico, said of what was
discussed at the meeting. ``She considers the issue closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellers, in a telephone interview, said he considered the
outcome ``in all honesty appropriate.'' Although he wrote bluntly
about Clinton's affair, he said he did not intend the remarks to be
``contemptuous'' and believed that Article 88 set necessary
guidelines for officers to respect civilian control of the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers said he would continue to write regularly for The Navy
Times, though probably on other topics. ``I have no intention of
writing any more about the president,'' he said. ``He gets enough
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutions under Article 88 are rare, new cases keep
arising. The Marine Corps has opened another inquiry into a Marine
Corps reservist, Maj. Daniel Rabil, who wrote an article in The
Washington Times on Monday. In it, he called Clinton ``integrity
impaired'' and ``perhaps the most selfish man ever to disgrace our
presidency.''

 &HT;    From death's doggie door to Utopia
 &HT;    EDs: WITH PHOTOS; embargoed until Sunday, Nov. 15.
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTOPIA, Texas _ Kinky Friedman is sitting on top of a picnic
table, and he's swarmed by dogs. He can't light his cigar because
Amigo and Fritz are licking his face. Happy is knocking off his
trademark black cowboy hat.
</P>
<P>
   It happens every time Friedman visits Utopia Animal Rescue
Ranch, a place where he feels a spirit of hope. ``I promise you,''
Friedman tells the dogs. ``You are going to good homes.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the desire of the Texas musician and mystery novelist to
save every dog on Earth. ``I say there are no bad dogs and there
are no good people,'' he says. He says people are to blame that
Happy, Fritz, Amigo and 40 other pound mutts don't have a home.
They are waiting to be adopted from the rescue group that he
founded this year in Uvalde County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the first guy to get disenchanted with people,'' he
says. ``Maybe there's a little Buddhist in the woodpile. Animals
were created by God, if there is a God. I just think we have our
priorities skewed.''
</P>
<P>
   To find the roots of the Utopia Animal Rescue Ranch, a good
place to start is New York City in 1979. Friedman was walking in
Chinatown when he came across a kitten in a shoe box. Cuddles
became his and served as a companion like no other. When she died
in 1993, he wrote in a eulogy: ``Dogs have a depth of loyalty that
often we seem unworthy of. But the love of a cat is a blessing, a
privilege in this world. They say when you die and go to heaven all
the dogs and cats you've ever had in your life come running to meet
you. Until that day, rest in peace, Cuddles.''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1996, destiny struck again. He was driving from
his parents' ranch to Medina when he noticed a kitten in the middle
of the road. ``A great white hunter had shot one of its front
legs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He rushed the kitten to veterinarian Bill Hoegemeyer who
operated on the animal twice and amputated its injured leg. Hence,
the kitten earned the name Lucky. Friedman took it in. Because he
traveled frequently, Friedman turned to friend Nancy Parker, who
already watched after his dog, Mr. McGoo, also rescued from a
pound. Lucky and Parker bonded. ``I had to give Lucky to Nancy,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Parker and companion Tony Simons have come to accept
that on any given day Friedman is likely to drive up with dogs that
need homes. ``These dogs are literally from death's door. That's
why they are so special,'' Friedman says.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Lucky. His toughness _ he's killed two rattlesnakes _
and determination to survive came to symbolize Friedman and
Parker's dream of starting a rescue ranch for abused and abandoned
animals.
</P>
<P>
   This May, Friedman approached Parker about starting a dog rescue
operation on her 7-acre plot. ``Hell, they already had a zoo
here,'' Friedman says of the 12 Barbados sheep, 10 dogs and a duck
named Kathy that is the meanest animal on the property.
</P>
<P>
   Parker didn't flinch. ``I love animals. What could I say? I just
asked how,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   He sent out letters to 5,000 people telling them about Utopia
Rescue Ranch. The letters started: ``Like Mark Twain and Winston
Churchill, the more I see of life the less I appreciate people and
the more I appreciate animals.'' Country singer Dwight Yoakam
donated money. Friedman convinced several friends, including former
Gov. Ann Richards, singer Willie Nelson, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith,
talk show host Sammy Allred and authors Sarah Bird and Bud Shrake,
to serve on the advisory board. Business executive John McCall, a
friend, paid for the fence and pens to contain the dogs. The pens
bear the names of Richards, Smith, Bird and Shrake on wooden
plaques. A ``Bone-efit'' concert with Willie and Yoakam is being
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every dream has to start somewhere. This may not be the
slickest operation, but these dogs are all loved and cared for,''
Friedman says.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 1, when the fence went up, Parker, Simons and Friedman
went to pounds in Kerrville and Hondo looking for dogs that were
going to be euthanized. ``You could see it in the dogs' eyes. They
knew they were going to die. They smelled it,'' says Parker. ``When
we got them in the truck they wouldn't stop licking us. You can't
tell me those dogs didn't know what was about to happen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   They are still rescuing dogs from pounds. The adoption process,
however, is slow. ``Just look at them,'' says Friedman. ``These
dogs don't want much. Amigo would be just as happy under a bridge
with a bum as being in a mansion eating caviar. All a dog needs is
someone to love it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Utopia Animal Rescue Ranch they get plenty of attention.
Parker knows each of their names. The property is a playground. The
dogs swim in a stock pond. The only grief they get is from the duck
who sneaks up behind them and snaps at their tails.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a cause for us,'' says Friedman. ``It's a way of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker has big plans. Some of the dogs could end up with an
organization that trains dogs to help people with disabilities. She
eventually wants to take in horses, livestock and exotic animals.
She's already found a friend, Adri Brown, to accept cats.
</P>
<P>
   It seems appropriate that Friedman's and Parker's dream of a
rescue group has come true in Utopia, a small town whose name
reflects its identity. It's peaceful here. People in cars greet you
with a wave. ``It's really what America should be,'' says Parker.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a place to find a dog that needs a home. Norma Kranz of
nearby Vanderpool was there the other day looking at dogs. Her
three dogs had died over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' she says, ``the best way to get over losing a dog
is to get another one.''

 &HT;    Happy birthday, 'Sesame Street'
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 15
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They may not look like much _ a bunch of yellow feathers, brown
fur and green felt. But Big Bird, Snuffleupagus and Kermit the Frog
are wild-eyed revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   They, and the rest of their Muppet colleagues, took the most
powerful medium in the world and turned it into a loving teacher
and friend. They've helped millions of children enter kindergarten
armed with letters, numbers, colors, shapes and an understanding of
certain complicated concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere I am is HERE. Anywhere I am not is THERE,'' fuzzy
blue Grover patiently explains in an oft-repeated segment of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   And they've helped millions of children understand conflict and
resolution, family and neighborhood, likenesses and differences.
They've dealt with courtship, marriage, birth, adoption and death.
They've slapped prejudice in the face. When Kermit sings ``It's Not
Easy Being Green,'' the message is loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   These humble Muppets are among the original stars of ``Sesame
Street,'' television's first educational series for preschoolers
and the most widely watched show in the world today. With stories,
songs and an abundance of lovable creatures, ``Sesame Street''
teaches basic education and strong values.
</P>
<P>
   As this wildly imaginative PBS program enters its 30th season
Monday (Nov. 16), we pay tribute and give thanks for its past,
present and future.
</P>
<P>
   Television is justifiably criticized for its violent dramas,
crude sitcoms, sexy (and sexist) situations and racist stereotypes.
But ``Sesame Street'' is hallowed ground, a refuge for three
decades for parents and children alike. Its positive impact has
been well-documented, and its sterling quality has been recognized
with numerous awards, including 71 Emmys, more than any other show.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some more impressive figures. It is estimated that
``Sesame Street'' has reached more than 120 million children in
more than 130 countries. The U.S. Department of Education says 77
percent of all preschool children watch ``Sesame Street'' at least
once a week. More than 90 percent of Anglo, Latino and African
American preschoolers living below the poverty line see it, too.
This is a show that crosses all cultural, ethnic, racial and
economic lines.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone under 30 grew up with ``Sesame Street,'' and
many children shared that experience with their parents. The joy of
``Sesame Street'' is that it can be enjoyed by toddlers, older
children and adults. There are movie, fine arts and pop culture
references that a 3-year-old would never get. ``Monsterpiece
Theatre,'' hosted by a smoking-jacket-clad Cookie Monster, spoofs
the classics with clever sketches such as ``The Old Man and the C''
and ``Me, Claudius.'' Kids probably don't have a clue who inspired
the Muppet characters Placido Flamingo and Meryl Sheep _ but
they'll get it later on.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's housed on public television, ``Sesame Street''
doesn't hawk cereal or toys. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have
commercials. Instead of products, it sells numbers and letters.
``Today's 'Sesame Street' is brought to you by the letter B.'' The
letter B, by the way, has sponsored the show 210 times and has
stood for bubble gum, banana, ballerina, broccoli and bathtub,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its success, ``Sesame Street'' remains one of a kind.
Oh, sure, Nickelodeon has some semieducational preschool fare, but
nothing that comes close to ``Sesame Street.'' When they made
``Sesame Street,'' they must have broken the mold.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing legacy of ``Sesame Street'' is that children watch
it and feel good about themselves and the world they live in. They
learn the joys of sharing, the stupidity of selfishness and the
folly of judging people by the way they look. And parents feel good
about this small but significant educational tool.
</P>
<P>
   Even though others aren't copying it, ``Sesame Street'' proves
that television can be good for kids. It can be mind-opening,
nurturing and oh-so-much-fun. It's the sweetest, smartest, hippest
30-year-old you'll ever meet.
</P>
<P>
   Trivia quiz
</P>
<P>
   Q: How tall is Big Bird?
</P>
<P>
   A: The big yellow fellow stands 8-feet-2-inches in his big
orange feet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Snuffleupagus' first name and why was his debut seen
by only one character on ``Sesame Street''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Aloysius Snuffleupagus spent the first 15 years of his life
in fictional oblivion. That's because he was conceived as Big
Bird's imaginary best friend. Viewers saw Snuffy, but none of the
other ``Sesame Street'' folks did. The writers decided to ``out''
him in 1985, because the educational consultants worried that
children might be afraid their parents wouldn't believe them if
they told them something out-of-the-ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who said, ``I can't hear you. I've got a banana in my ear.''
And why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ernie said the line to Bert many times in the ``Sesame
Street'' version of Abbott and Costello's classic comedy routine
``Who's on first?''
</P>
<P>
   Can you name five of Bert and Ernie's Top 10 songs?
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Rubber Duckie''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I Don't Want To Live on the Moon''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Doin' the Pigeon''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I Want To Hold Your Ear''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Honker Duckie Dinger Jamboree''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Put Down the Duckie''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Imagination''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``That's What Friends Are For''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Would You Like To Buy an O?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I'm Square''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Kermit's line of work and what was his salutation?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Hi, ho. Kermit the Frog here.'' Wrapped in a trench coat
and clutching a microphone, Kermit was the intrepid, international
reporter from ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Kermit, of course, is the only supposedly normal person on
``Sesame Street'' _ except that he's a frog. He first appeared on
Jim Henson's local Washington, D.C., TV show ``Sam and Friends'' in
1955. After his movie career took off in 1979 (he was a romantic
hero opposite the glamorous Miss Piggy), Kermit was a recurring
star on ``Sesame Street.'' Originally voiced by the late Jim
Henson, Kermit is now voiced by Steve Whitmire.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which wildly popular ``Sesame Street'' critter first appeared
on the show in 1979 but didn't click with the kiddies until 1984?
</P>
<P>
   A: Elmo, the innocent giggler who talks baby talk, arrived a
decade after the show's premiere. He gained popularity in the '80s
when Kevin Clash began writing and performing him. Now his fuzzy
red face is plastered all over the place, including on hip teens'
T-shirts. The Tickle-Me-Elmo doll was the biggest-selling toy in
1996, and a big-screen movie is said to be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   BONUS QUESTION:
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Krusee threatens to take away board's regulatory powers
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State Board of Education members, saying charter
schools are emerging faster than they can review them, voted Friday
to ask the Legislature to freeze authorization of any more,
prompting a local lawmaker's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their action represents an abdication of authority
over charter schools,'' said state Rep. Mike Krusee, a Round Rock
Republican. ``They're saying they don't want to consider any more
schools under any circumstance for at least four years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are unwilling to shoulder the responsibility . . . we
(lawmakers) will give it to someone else,'' said Krusee, who
carried a bill in 1997 that allowed the board to grant up to 100
charters and an unlimited number of charters for students
considered at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-3 vote, with two abstentions, to ask the Legislature to
cap the number of new charter schools at 100 was one of 15
recommendations to state lawmakers, who convene for their biennial
session in January.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Alma Allen of Houston dismissed Krusee's statements
as the opinion of one legislator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superintendents are saying they are feeling the crunch,
especially in the large districts,'' Allen said. ``I'm for stopping
the floodgates. So to put it off another two years would just be
giving those charters enough time to produce some test scores so
that we'll know where we're going.''
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools receive public money but are free from most
state regulation. While the state education board approves
charters, the state Legislature authorizes the total number of
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has 65 charter schools open, some of which are targeted to
at-risk students. The state board has approved proposals to open a
total of 144 of these charter schools. For schools not targeting
at-risk studnets, lawmakers have capped their authorization to only
open 120 charter schools. The vast majority of charter schools are
not designed for at-risk students, said Debbie Graves, a
spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's vote, Krusee had said he would file a bill that
would give the state education board unlimited authorization power
over charter schools. He said the vote is forcing him to rethink
that plan and consider creating a new governing body to regulate
the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the board voted 13-2 to approve 15 of 30 new
charter schools to be operated by Dallas-based Eagle Project, the
largest number of such schools to be run by one group.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Project is run by former fundamentalist preacher Don
Howard and two former Texas public school superintendents, Forrest
Watson and Linus Wright. Howard, who has run charter schools around
the world, said the Texas schools will target at-risk students,
dropouts and students with records of bad grades, poor attendance
among other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Project will operate schools, whose curriculum is computer
based, in Abilene, Beaumont, Brownsville, Bryan, Dallas, Del Rio,
Fort Worth, Laredo, Lubbock, Midland, McAllen, San Antonio,
Texarkana, Tyler and Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Board members eliminated half of the proposed schools _
including one in Austin because local public school administrators
said they feared the charter schools would siphon money from their
schools and be duplicative. ``Every high school, including the
Gonzalo Garza Independence High School, offers the DELTA program,
which is an open-entry, open-exit, alternative diploma program
designed for the student who has dropped out of school or is at
risk of dropping out,'' Kathy Rider, Austin schools board
president, and A.C. Gonzalez, interim Austin district
superintendent said in a statement. ``The curriculum is designed to
give students choices within courses for earning credits, including
practical experiences, and uses NovaNET, a computer-assisted
learning system as one of the resources,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Robert Offutt of San Antonio, who wanted all 30
schools approved, said the vote set a ``dangerous precedent.''
Board members previously had not considered the effect of a charter
school on a public school district in deciding whether to approve a
charter, he said.

<P>
   The United States' four biggest cigarette makers and officials
of eight states have reached agreement on the outlines of a
settlement designed to resolve all remaining state claims over
health costs related to smoking, attorneys general and industry
lawyers involved in the talks said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, drafted to cover the 46 states that have not already
made individual settlements with the industry, would cost the
tobacco companies $206 billion over 25 years and would restrict
cigarette advertising and marketing. It would eliminate the
industry's most significant financial and legal threat: state suits
seeking to recover the Medicaid costs of treating people with
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would cost the industry far less than a $368.5 billion
agreement with state attorneys general last year that eventually
grew into a $516 billion bill in Congress under which the federal
government would also have gained regulatory authority over
nicotine. Unlike the earlier state proposal, however, this new plan
does not shield tobacco companies from personal and class-action
liability suits.
</P>
<P>
   If companies finance the plan's cost by raising cigarette
prices, the cost of a pack would increase 35 cents over the next
five years. Some makers, however, for competitive reasons, may
choose to raise prices less and absorb the cost themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which is expected to be completed Saturday and
announced as early as Monday, the producers have agreed to an array
of marketing restrictions such as a ban on billboard and transit
advertisements as well as the sale of clothing and merchandise with
brand logos.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for cigarette makers to pay $1.45
billion over the next five years to finance smoking-cessation
programs and advertisements to counter underage tobacco use.
Producers will pay an additional $25 million a year over the next
decade to underwrite a foundation that will research ways to reduce
youth smoking and legally pledge that they will not market to those
under 18.
</P>
<P>
   The producers participating in the plan are Philip Morris Cos.;
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.;
Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of Loews Corp., and Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC. The eight
states involved are California, Colorado, New York, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Washington.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have reached an agreement on all the issues,'' said
Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire said in a
telephone interview. ``We are in the final drafting stage and hope
to have a settlement sometime Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute disputes could delay or derail the settlement but
those involved said they did not consider such problems likely.
Once the eight states and the companies agree, the plan will be
sent to officials of the other 38 states that have lawsuits pending
or have yet to file one. Those states will have about one week to
join; under its current terms, the plan would take effect once
states representing about 80 percent of the nation's Medicaid
population sign on.
</P>
<P>
   Because the plan is designed to be a national settlement, the
tobacco companies could withdraw if not enough states join. If
enough states join for the plan to take effect, but some states do
not participate, the cost of the plan would be reduced
proportionately.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry was first struck by state lawsuits seeking
to recover Medicaid funds spent treating smoking-related illnesses
in 1994. As anticipation of a final settlement grew over recent
weeks, the stocks of cigarette makers have risen on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the $206 billion proposal would represent the
largest settlement of civil lawsuits in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, it would effectively codify on a national level
the marketing and advertising concessions made by the tobacco
industry over the past year in settling smoking-related lawsuits
brought by four states _ Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas.
The national counter-advertising campaign and the new foundation
would also expand on those agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry lawyers agreed Friday that the slow-moving
talks, which have covered five months, had reached a final stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties have finished their negotiations and they are
reviewing final versions of the papers,'' said Arthur Golden, a
lawyer representing RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   The plan does not contain legal protections for cigarette makers
and does not require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also does not contain restrictions on fees for
plaintiffs' lawyers who were hired by state attorneys general to
pursue those claims, which are to be paid by the industry in
addition to the plan's costs and are expected to total billions
more. But the industry would not have to pay more than $500 million
in fees in any one year, a cigarette company lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general of the eight states involved in the talks
are expected to announce the plan in Washington, D.C., on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the remaining 38 states who either have pending
smoking-related lawsuits or have not filed such claims will then
have about a week to decide whether to join the settlement plan or
proceed with legal actions.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of those states are expected to join. But some
states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan and
Wisconsin, have previously pressed for stronger public health
provisions in the plan. And in recent days, officials of some
states have been discussing the possibility of taking a unified
stand in order to wring greater concessions from producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of us are very definitely undecided,'' said
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking advocates did not participate in crafting the
proposal and their reactions Friday varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we know about the agreement, the we more know it is
not a comprehensive national plan,'' said Matthew Myers, a lawyer
for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Myers and other anti-smoking advocates, who were far more
critical of the plan, said they were particularly concerned that
the public would only have a week to review it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregoire said she understood that the plan would come under
attack but added that attorneys general had a legal duty to measure
would could be achieved both inside and outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role was to decide whether the settlement could get as
much as we could achieve in the courtroom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lawyers said they will not finalize the agreement until
a specified number of states agree to the accord. They have
declined to disclose that figure but a document posted Friday by
the Arizona Republic on its Internet site and described by the
newspaper as a draft summary of the plan states that participating
states must account for at least 80 percent of the total settlement
for it to become final.
</P>
<P>
   Under a formula developed by the attorneys general, each state
will receive a portion of the settlement based on factors like its
percentage of the nation's Medicaid population. The plan's value
would also be proportionally reduced if it goes forward but some
states do not join it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The settlement plan, which follow five months of drawn-out talks
and missed deadlines, comes as something as anti-climax to a
lengthy national debate over smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the industry and state attorneys agreed to a $368.5
billion settlement proposal under which cigarette makers agreed to
marketing restrictions, to federal regulation of nicotine and to
other measures in return for legal protections against
smoking-related lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal mushroomed earlier this year in that $516 billion
tobacco bill sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. But the bill,
which would have raised the price of cigarettes by $1.10 cents a
pack and stripped-away the legal protections sought by producers,
ran into a maelstrom of industry opposition and collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a new round of settlement talks began five months
ago between industry officials and state aimed at reaching a new
agreement that would not require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   If it resolves the state claims, the industry would erase its
biggest legal challenge. But it continues to face lawsuits from
others like individual smokers, trade unions and foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, the participating states would receive about
the same amount of money as their share the $368.5 billion accord
that failed. But the proposal is not as rich as the $6.1 billion
settlement won in May by Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that settlement, producers also increased their
payments to Florida, Mississippi and Florida, bring the total of
the payments to the four settling states over 25 years to some $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Along with bans on billboard and transit ads, producers also
agree to refrain from using cartoon figures in ads, to bans on
sponsorship of youth-orientated sporting events and concerts and to
refrain from lobbying against state initiatives that make it more
difficult for underage smokers to buy cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, producers would be able to continue to
sponsor one sporting event using the brand name of a cigarette and
there would be no limits on sponsorships that utilize a cigarette
company's corporate name.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also does not provide for restrictions on
cigarette advertising in retail stories or in magazines and other
print media.

BRUINS' MITCHELL MIGHT RETURN FOR BOWL GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Injured UCLA receiver Freddie Mitchell has made a
breathtaking recovery and might play in the Bruins' bowl game, a
team source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His healing has been remarkable,'' said the source, a member
of UCLA's training medical staff. ``No one has ever seen anything
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell broke his left femur Sept.19 at Houston and had
emergency surgery to implant a stabilizing rod and two interlocking
screws, one on each side of the fracture.
</P>
<P>
   The initial prognosis called for a 6-8 month recovery, allowing
Mitchell, a redshirt freshman, to return for spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   But last month he had one of the screws removed, enabling the
separated bone to compress and strengthen. Mitchell undergoes
strenuous therapy each day and just as lifting weights builds
muscle, the stress of his workouts creates new bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, removing the screw really helped,'' the source
said. ``And Freddie's working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gerald Finerman, UCLA's team physician, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell usually undergoes treatment and workouts while the
Bruins practice, but he stopped by Spaulding Field earlier this
week to say hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he's doing a walking test and moving around and doing
things,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``He got a `B' in a class, and he
was elated. He's doing a good job in school, and that's what
worried me with him being injured.''

WASHINGTON AG OPTIMISTIC ABOUT NATIONAL TOBACCO SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE MILETICH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire said Friday
she will push for tough anti-smoking programs with the state's $4
billion share of a national tobacco settlement she anticipates to
be in place by next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If ratified, the $206 billion agreement would place broad
advertising bans on tobacco companies that would be virtually
impossible to win in a courtroom in light of free-speech
protections, Gregoire said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it will represent the most significant injunctive
relief that has ever been brought in any settlement that I know
about in any context, anywhere,'' Gregoire said in a telephone news
conference from New York, where she is leading the final stages of
tobacco negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire said no substantial issues remain unresolved, and that
she hopes to complete a tentative tobacco accord by Saturday to be
formally unveiled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will represent the largest financial settlement in the
history of the world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and seven other states that have participated for
months in the negotiations would jointly ratify the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal is announced, 36 other states that haven't
previously reached settlements with cigarette makers would have
until Friday to declare whether they want to be included in the
pact.
</P>
<P>
   The deal requires that most states participate before the
tobacco companies give final approval, but Gregoire said she
expects enough will join to satisfy the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire didn't specify how many states would be needed, but
noted that New York and California, both critical to the deal,
would be included in the eight states expected to complete an
accord Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma and
Pennsylvania also are involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   If a final deal emerges, Gregoire said she will go to the
Legislature next year and ask lawmakers to earmark a significant
portion of Washington's share of the money for anti-tobacco
advertising and smoking cessation programs.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was unclear exactly when Washington would begin
receiving payments, but that they would start no later than June
20, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Payments would be distributed over a 25-year period, averaging
about $160 million a year. But larger sums would be paid at the
outset, although a detailed payment structure hasn't been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond state efforts, Gregoire said she will push Congress to
place the tobacco industry under the regulatory authority of the
federal Food and Drug Administration and require cigarette makers
to print more explicit warnings about the dangers of smoking on
their products.
</P>
<P>
   Those measures, which require federal legislation, were part of
the June 1997 national tobacco deal that died early this year in
Congress. Tobacco companies would be free to fight efforts to
revive the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire called the new deal, which doesn't require
congressional approval, an important first step that would
eliminate many forms of tobacco advertising and bar cigarette
makers from targeting minors in their advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not perfect,'' she said, but would secure public-health
goals that go beyond what might be won monetarily in risky
courtroom battles. She said that is the message she is conveying to
her counterparts around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and more than 35 other states have brought lawsuits
against the nation's largest cigarette makers to recover
smoking-related Medicaid costs.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's case is the only one in trial, but it would end if
a final settlement is reached. The state is seeking up to $2.2
billion in Medicaid costs, plus other penalties that could more
than double the award.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire said she believes the state would win if the trial
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Four other states _ Minnesota, Mississippi, Florida and Texas _
have previously reached individual settlements with tobacco
companies totaling nearly $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette companies that would be part of a new national
deal are Phillip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson and
Lorillard.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire, long a crusader against teen smoking, played a lead
role in the previous national deal and she was one of the first
attorneys general to bring suit against the tobacco industry.
Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore, who led the previous
talks, hasn't been involved in the current negotiations because his
state has settled its case.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal would include a ban on billboard and transit
advertising, as well as the sale of merchandise with product logos.
It also would prohibit the use of cartoon characters such as Joe
Camel, and the sponsorship of sport events with a significant youth
audience, including basketball, baseball and football.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also would pay more than $1.4 billion for a
national foundation and public education program, which would seek
to counter teen smoking and educate consumers about tobacco-related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the earlier agreement, human figures such as the
Marlboro Man would be allowed, and advertising would be permitted
outside stores. Tobacco companies also would be allowed one
sponsorship of certain sports, such as professional car racing.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire said tobacco companies are in a stronger negotiating
position than in the previous talks. They spent $40 million to
defeat the earlier deal when it ballooned to $500 billion, and have
won a string of court victories, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the new deal includes two provisions vital to ensuring her
goals, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One would allow states to obtain a consent decree in their
individual courts, making the agreement legally enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   The other would bar cigarette company lobbyists from trying to
persuade lawmakers from diverting settlement away from anti-tobacco
and public-health measures.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Washington and other states that have taken lead
roles on the legal front also stand to split an additional $8.6
billion, on top of Washington's anticipated share of $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suspect of the $8.6 billion, we would get a good share
of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also would eliminate the Tobacco Institute, the
industry's public-relations arm, and the Council for Tobacco
Research, which has been accused of spreading misleading
information about the health risks of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   It also would likely require tobacco companies to pay for the
creation of an Internet web site, where all documents produced in
state and other smoking-related lawsuits would be posted for public
review.
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-smoking advocates around the country have already
attacked the proposed deal, saying it doesn't do enough to counter
teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregoire said the broad terms of the package would ensure
that cigarette makers don't engage in any advertising or activity
that promotes smoking among minors.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industries are withholding comment until a settlement is
formally announced.

LAW REQUIRING LOCKS ON HANDGUNS TAKES EFFECT IN NYC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new law intended to reduce injuries and deaths from
accidental shootings takes effect Saturday, requiring that all
handguns sold in New York City have a safety locking device.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani publicized the law Friday, he
criticized it as inadequate and demanded that the City Council
adopt additional restrictions that he has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   To promote the new rules, called Christopher's Law, the mayor
held a news conference at City Hall with Cathline and Pedro Murphy,
married city police officers whose 11-year-old son, Christopher,
was killed last December in an accidental shooting involving a
neighbor's gun. They were joined by leaders of three advocacy
groups, Parents of Murdered Children, New Yorkers Against Gun
Violence and Silent March. The leaders of the groups endorsed the
new law and the mayor's proposed additions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, many lives are lost as a result of gun-related
violence and accidental shootings,'' the mayor said. ``Negligence
in the use and storage of weapons can be avoided, and precautions
must be taken to prevent these tragedies from occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the mayor signed the legislation into law, he lost
little time in criticizing it. ``It doesn't go far enough it,'' he
said. ``It has more loopholes than answers.'' Specifically, he
said, the City Council should enact his bill to require that gun
owners not only buy locks but also use them; that locks be required
not only for newly purchased guns but also for the estimated
250,000 guns already owned in the city, and that the rules be
extended to rifles, shotguns, machine guns and assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Leffler, chairman of the Council's Public Safety
Committee, said that much of the mayor's proposal was impossible
for the Council to pass because of superseding state jurisdiction.
As for requiring locks at all times, Leffler said that witnesses at
Council hearings had testified that they wanted the security of
having their guns unlocked and ready when necessary. ``They said,
`If someone is coming through the window at night, I want to be
able to use the gun without having to take off the lock,''' Leffler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since most guns in the city are illegal, Leffler said, he
doubted that owners of such guns would obey a retroactive law
requiring them to add locks, as the mayor proposed. The locks cost
$25 to $125, city officials said, and Leffler estimated that the
law would affect thousands of guns sold each year. He said other
localities around the nation had similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said his administration had made its proposal six
months ago and that he was ``perplexed'' that the Council had not
acted by now. But Leffler said the proposals ``were not raised in
the hearings or the negotiations'' between the Council and
administration, ``nor has the mayor asked me or anyone else in the
Council, to my knowledge, since then.''
</P>
<P>
   A violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to $500 and
30 days in jail.

 BOY, MISSING 11 DAYS, IS FOUND SAFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 15-year-old autistic boy who was found wandering in
the Erie Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, N.J., on Tuesday but could
not identify himself was reunited with his mother Friday after she
saw a news report about him on television. He had been missing from
his Staten Island home for 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Leshawn Ware, was returned to his mother, Stephanie
Ware, at St. Mary Hospital in Hoboken, where he had been cared for
since being found in the waterfront terminal's main waiting room.
His mother had called New Jersey authorities after seeing his
picture Thursday night on WWOR-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Although developmentally disabled, the boy was said by doctors
to be unharmed and in good condition, was clean and did not even
seem hungry. Officials said it was unclear where he had been or
what he had done since he wandered away from his home in the Great
Kills section on Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But his mother told officials he had an affinity for mass
transit. ``She said that he has a love for the trains and the
buses, and she surmised that he must have gotten on a train or a
bus or the ferry and had been traveling the system before he wound
up in Hoboken,'' said Penny Bassett-Hackett, a spokeswoman for New
Jersey Transit.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ware, who has four other children, none of whom are
autistic, said that Leshawn, who attends special classes at an
annex of Public School 25 in Staten Island, was wearing a black and
white down jacket when he disappeared. She had called the New York
City police to report him missing.
</P>
<P>
   When found by Erie Lackawanna station employees, he had no money
and could not identify himself. But he was carrying five MetroCards
from the New York City transit system, and gave his address as 370
Jay St. in Brooklyn, which turned out to be the headquarters of the
New York City Transit Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The terminal where the boy was found is a hub for New Jersey
Transit trains and buses, the Port Authority Trans-Hudson system
and the New York Waterway Ferry from the World Financial Center in
Manhattan. He might have come from almost anywhere. Law enforcement
agencies, including New York police, were alerted, but no
connection was made immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The boy seemed unruffled by his experiences in any case. ``When
we got him, he was clean and not particularly hungry,'' said Joan
Quigley, a hospital spokeswoman. ``We suspect he was using the rest
rooms in the train stations to freshen up.'' She also said that
workers at a Burger King may have fed him, but she said she had no
details.

TOBACCO COMPANIES AND 8 STATES IN TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs last 2 grafs)  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., N.Y., N.C., N.D., Okla., Pa., Wash.)   (bl)  
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States' four biggest cigarette makers and officials
of eight states have reached agreement on the outlines of a
settlement designed to resolve all remaining state claims over
health costs related to smoking, attorneys general and industry
lawyers involved in the talks said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, drafted to cover the 46 states that have not already
made individual settlements with the industry, would cost the
tobacco companies $206 billion over 25 years and would restrict
cigarette advertising and marketing. It would eliminate the
industry's most significant financial and legal threat: state suits
seeking to recover the Medicaid costs of treating people with
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would cost the industry far less than a $368.5 billion
agreement with state attorneys general last year that eventually
grew into a $516 billion bill in Congress under which the federal
government would also have gained regulatory authority over
nicotine. Unlike the earlier state proposal, however, this new plan
does not shield tobacco companies from personal and class-action
liability suits.
</P>
<P>
   If companies finance the plan's cost by raising cigarette
prices, the cost of a pack would increase 35 cents over the next
five years. Some makers, however, for competitive reasons, may
choose to raise prices less and absorb the cost themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which is expected to be completed Saturday and
announced as early as Monday, the producers have agreed to an array
of marketing restrictions such as a ban on billboard and transit
advertisements as well as the sale of clothing and merchandise with
brand logos.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for cigarette makers to pay $1.45
billion over the next five years to finance smoking-cessation
programs and advertisements to counter underage tobacco use.
Producers will pay an additional $25 million a year over the next
decade to underwrite a foundation that will research ways to reduce
youth smoking and legally pledge that they will not market to those
under 18.
</P>
<P>
   The producers participating in the plan are Philip Morris Cos.;
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.;
Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of Loews Corp., and Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC. The eight
states involved are California, Colorado, New York, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Washington.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have reached an agreement on all the issues,'' said
Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire said in a
telephone interview. ``We are in the final drafting stage and hope
to have a settlement sometime Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute disputes could delay or derail the settlement but
those involved said they did not consider such problems likely.
Once the eight states and the companies agree, the plan will be
sent to officials of the other 38 states that have lawsuits pending
or have yet to file one. Those states will have about one week to
join; under its current terms, the plan would take effect once
states representing about 80 percent of the nation's Medicaid
population sign on.
</P>
<P>
   Because the plan is designed to be a national settlement, the
tobacco companies could withdraw if not enough states join. If
enough states join for the plan to take effect, but some states do
not participate, the cost of the plan would be reduced
proportionately.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry was first struck by state lawsuits seeking
to recover Medicaid funds spent treating smoking-related illnesses
in 1994. As anticipation of a final settlement grew over recent
weeks, the stocks of cigarette makers have risen on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the $206 billion proposal would represent the
largest settlement of civil lawsuits in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, it would effectively codify on a national level
the marketing and advertising concessions made by the tobacco
industry over the past year in settling smoking-related lawsuits
brought by four states _ Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas.
The national counter-advertising campaign and the new foundation
would also expand on those agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry lawyers agreed Friday that the slow-moving
talks, which have covered five months, had reached a final stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties have finished their negotiations and they are
reviewing final versions of the papers,'' said Arthur Golden, a
lawyer representing RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   The plan does not contain legal protections for cigarette makers
and does not require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also does not contain restrictions on fees for
plaintiffs' lawyers who were hired by state attorneys general to
pursue those claims, which are to be paid by the industry in
addition to the plan's costs and are expected to total billions
more. But the industry would not have to pay more than $500 million
in fees in any one year, a cigarette company lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general of the eight states involved in the talks
are expected to announce the plan in Washington, D.C., on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the remaining 38 states who either have pending
smoking-related lawsuits or have not filed such claims will then
have about a week to decide whether to join the settlement plan or
proceed with legal actions.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of those states are expected to join. But some
states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan and
Wisconsin, have previously pressed for stronger public health
provisions in the plan. And in recent days, officials of some
states have been discussing the possibility of taking a unified
stand in order to wring greater concessions from producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of us are very definitely undecided,'' said
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking advocates did not participate in crafting the
proposal and their reactions Friday varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we know about the agreement, the we more know it is
not a comprehensive national plan,'' said Matthew Myers, a lawyer
for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Myers and other anti-smoking advocates, who were far more
critical of the plan, said they were particularly concerned that
the public would only have a week to review it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregoire said she understood that the plan would come under
attack but added that attorneys general had a legal duty to measure
would could be achieved both inside and outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role was to decide whether the settlement could get as
much as we could achieve in the courtroom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lawyers said they will not finalize the agreement until
a specified number of states agree to the accord. They have
declined to disclose that figure but a document posted Friday by
the Arizona Republic on its Internet site and described by the
newspaper as a draft summary of the plan states that participating
states must account for at least 80 percent of the total settlement
for it to become final.
</P>
<P>
   Under a formula developed by the attorneys general, each state
will receive a portion of the settlement based on factors like its
percentage of the nation's Medicaid population. The plan's value
would also be proportionally reduced if it goes forward but some
states do not join it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The settlement plan, which follow five months of drawn-out talks
and missed deadlines, comes as something as anti-climax to a
lengthy national debate over smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the industry and state attorneys agreed to a $368.5
billion settlement proposal under which cigarette makers agreed to
marketing restrictions, to federal regulation of nicotine and to
other measures in return for legal protections against
smoking-related lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal mushroomed earlier this year in that $516 billion
tobacco bill sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. But the bill,
which would have raised the price of cigarettes by $1.10 cents a
pack and stripped-away the legal protections sought by producers,
ran into a maelstrom of industry opposition and collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a new round of settlement talks began five months
ago between industry officials and state aimed at reaching a new
agreement that would not require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   If it resolves the state claims, the industry would erase its
biggest legal challenge. But it continues to face lawsuits from
others like individual smokers, trade unions and foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, the participating states would receive about
the same amount of money as their share the $368.5 billion accord
that failed. But the proposal is not as rich as the $6.1 billion
settlement won in May by Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that settlement, producers also increased their
payments to Florida, Mississippi and Florida, bring the total of
the payments to the four settling states over 25 years to some $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Along with bans on billboard and transit ads, producers also
agree to refrain from using cartoon figures in ads, to bans on
sponsorship of youth-orientated sporting events and concerts and to
refrain from lobbying against state initiatives that make it more
difficult for underage smokers to buy cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, producers would be able to sponsor one sporting event
using the brand name of a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ms. Gregoire said she was holding settlement
discussions with the smokeless tobacco producer U.S. Tobacco, a
subsidiary of UST Inc., and expected them to conclude shortly. &QL;

N.J. GOVERNOR HAS APPENDECTOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman underwent surgery late
Friday at Morristown Memorial Hospital for the removal of her
appendix after experiencing abdominal pain for the last three days.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Edoga, one of two surgeons who performed the 90-minute
procedure, said that the surgery went well and that Whitman could
expect to be discharged from the hospital Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to return to work Monday morning, said her chief
spokesman, Pete McDonough. But he said she might scale back her
schedule, which includes a Republican Governors Association meeting
next week in New Orleans and an awards ceremony Monday night that
is expected to attract anti-abortion protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman was vacationing in Florida this week when she first
began to experience stomach pains Wednesday. She returned to New
Jersey on Thursday and attended a memorial service for a family
friend Friday morning before going to Morristown Memorial Hospital
to meet with Edoga.
</P>
<P>
   Although Whitman did have some pain on her right side, where the
appendix is located, Edoga said the physical findings were not
convincing, so he arranged for the governor to have a CAT scan.
``If she were 13 years old and a boy it would have been much easier
diagnosis,'' Edoga said. ``But with women, in particular, there are
many more things that you have to consider, and that is why she had
a CAT scan at the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman was admitted to the hospital at noon for the tests. The
surgery began at 4:30 p.m. and ended at 6 p.m. The procedure
involved making three small incisions in her abdomen to remove the
appendix, a sac-like appendage of the large intestine that doctors
say has no function. Edoga said Whitman's appendix was inflamed,
but it appeared that it had not ruptured. There were no other signs
of illness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her that she could go home in the morning,'' said
Edoga, who performed a similar procedure on the governor's son,
Taylor, two years ago. ``I believe that she will be on her feet
shortly. She is very well motivated and the patient's motivation is
all important.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, Whitman has undergone two other
surgical procedures at Morristown Memorial Hospital in Morristown,
N.J. In February, 1996, she underwent an hourlong surgical
procedure to repair her right shoulder's rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995, she also underwent surgery to have a benign
ovarian cyst removed.

in fees in any one year, a cigarette company lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general of the eight states involved in the talks
are expected to announce the plan in Washington, D.C., on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the remaining 38 states who either have pending
smoking-related lawsuits or have not filed such claims will then
have about a week to decide whether to join the settlement plan or
proceed with legal actions.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of those states are expected to join. But some
states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan and
Wisconsin, have previously pressed for stronger public health
provisions in the plan. And in recent days, officials of some
states have been discussing the possibility of taking a unified
stand in order to wring greater concessions from producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of us are very definitely undecided,'' said
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking advocates did not participate in crafting the
proposal and their reactions Friday varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we know about the agreement, the we more know it is
not a comprehensive national plan,'' said Matthew Myers, a lawyer
for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Myers and other anti-smoking advocates, who were far more
critical of the plan, said they were particularly concerned that
the public would only have a week to review it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregoire said she understood that the plan would come under
attack but added that attorneys general had a legal duty to measure
would could be achieved both inside and outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role was to decide whether the settlement could get as
much as we could achieve in the courtroom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lawyers said they will not finalize the agreement until
a specified number of states agree to the accord. They have
declined to disclose that figure but a document posted Friday by
the Arizona Republic on its Internet site and described by the
newspaper as a draft summary of the plan states that participating
states must account for at least 80 percent of the total settlement
for it to become final.
</P>
<P>
   Under a formula developed by the attorneys general, each state
will receive a portion of the settlement based on factors like its
percentage of the nation's Medicaid population. The plan's value
would also be proportionally reduced if it goes forward but some
states do not join it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The settlement plan, which follow five months of drawn-out talks
and missed deadlines, comes as something as anti-climax to a
lengthy national debate over smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the industry and state attorneys agreed to a $368.5
billion settlement proposal under which cigarette makers agreed to
marketing restrictions, to federal regulation of nicotine and to
other measures in return for legal protections against
smoking-related lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal mushroomed earlier this year in that $516 billion
tobacco bill sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. But the bill,
which would have raised the price of cigarettes by $1.10 cents a
pack and stripped-away the legal protections sought by producers,
ran into a maelstrom of industry opposition and collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a new round of settlement talks began five months
ago between industry officials and state aimed at reaching a new
agreement that would not require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   If it resolves the state claims, the industry would erase its
biggest legal challenge. But it continues to face lawsuits from
others like individual smokers, trade unions and foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, the participating states would receive about
the same amount of money as their share the $368.5 billion accord
that failed. But the proposal is not as rich as the $6.1 billion
settlement won in May by Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that settlement, producers also increased their
payments to Florida, Mississippi and Florida, bring the total of
the payments to the four settling states over 25 years to some $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Along with bans on billboard and transit ads, producers also
agree to refrain from using cartoon figures in ads, to bans on
sponsorship of youth-orientated sporting events and concerts and to
refrain from lobbying against state initiatives that make it more
difficult for underage smokers to buy cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, producers would be able to sponsor one sporting event
using the brand name of a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ms. Gregoire said she was holding settlement
discussions with the smokeless tobacco producer U.S. Tobacco, a
subsidiary of UST Inc., and expected them to conclude shortly. &QL;

MOTHER STRUGGLES TO MAKE SENSE OF HER SON'S MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She has listened to more than 70 witnesses describe
the most minute details of her son's murder. She has stared at the
man accused of the crime throughout his three-week trial. And she
has heard some of the city's best prosecutors and defense lawyers
lay out their explanations of why it happened. But Carol Levin is
still haunted by the question of why her son had to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally puzzling to me how somebody could do this to
someone who did represent a very unique figure in his life,'' she
said. ``Someone who cared.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after a jury found Corey Arthur guilty of second-degree
murder in the slaying of a former teacher, Jonathan Levin, Levin's
mother still wrestles with the simple question of why the
20-year-old turned on Levin.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday in her one-bedroom apartment on the
Upper West Side of Manhattan, Ms. Levin said she had hoped that the
trial might produce some sense of justice, some knowledge of what
her son endured in his final moments. And she had also hoped for a
token of contrition from Arthur. But she said she was disappointed
on all three counts, and angrily criticized defense lawyers for
suggesting that drugs played a role in her son's death.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin said crime victims or their families should have the
right to protect a victim's reputation during a trial, and defense
lawyers should not be allowed to pursue theories in court that are
not based on fact.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur's lawyers have defended their conduct, saying they had to
raise the drug issue to provide their client with the high-quality
defense that he deserved in a first-degree murder case. But they
said they had few answers as to why Arthur committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Ricco, one of Arthur's lawyers, said Thursday that in
the 18 months since the killing, Arthur had not given his lawyers a
consistent account of what occurred that night. Furthermore, Ricco
said, the defense team found no evidence during its 16-month
investigation of the murder that the teacher had somehow wronged
his former student before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levin showed an interest in him and I'm sure that Levin's
interest was only to help this kid,'' Ricco said. ``Corey has never
said the relationship turned bad.''
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour interview, Ms. Levin speculated on the
motives, including drug addiction and greed, that could have led
Arthur to kill her son on May 30, 1997, in his Upper West Side
apartment. She rejected the suggestion of defense lawyers during
the trial that one or two more people were involved in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am totally convinced that Corey Arthur's evil was
responsible for this,'' she said, ``from the conception of the plan
through its execution, both literally and figuratively.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin, a petite, soft-spoken woman with graying hair who
warmly greeted friends, relatives and former students of Levin who
attended the trial, shifted from joyous to angry to bereft while
discussing her son's childhood, adult life and murder. She said she
planned to follow in his footsteps and become a public school
teacher, consummating a goal she nearly pursued 20 years ago, one
that Levin encouraged before his death.
</P>
<P>
   She expressed disappointment with Tuesday's verdict in state
Supreme Court in Manhattan. Jurors acquitted Arthur of first-degree
murder but found him guilty of second-degree murder and two counts
of armed robbery. After the verdict, jurors said they chose the
lesser murder charge because they were not convinced that Arthur
had fired the fatal shot.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur could face 25 years to life in prison. If convicted of
first-degree murder, he would have been sentenced to life in prison
without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin said that while she was frustrated by the verdict, she
was not angry with the jurors and respected their decision. Her
regret, she said, is that no one person will be held accountable
for firing the shot that killed her son.
</P>
<P>
   Montoun Hart, 26, Arthur's co-defendant, is scheduled to be
tried in January on second-degree murder charges. Prosecutors have
said Hart assisted in the robbery but did not fire the fatal shot.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public comments on the case since the verdict, the
Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, said Friday that
prosecutors were not aware that their lead witness, Carlethia
Weeks, had had any psychiatric problems before she testified. He
said prosecutors did not notice any problems before her testimony
and did not want to turn Ms. Weeks against them by asking for
access to her medical records.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a fragile witness, fragile in the sense that
they could turn against you, you don't want to antagonize them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin said she would concentrate on writing a 10-minute
statement to read to Judge Marcy Kahn at Arthur's sentencing in
December. She says summing up her son's life so neatly will be
agonizing.

`RHINOCEROS': BEWARE MINDLESS CONFORMITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By WILBORN HAMPTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The spate of revivals of plays from the middle of the
century over the last couple of seasons has confirmed the enduring
merit of the innovative and imaginative work of playwrights like
Camus, Sartre, Beckett and Ionesco. But it has also shown that
civilization, as we optimistically call it, is just as absurd as
the 20th century draws to a close as it was four or five decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example is a worthwhile staging of Ionesco's
``Rhinoceros'' by the Jean Cocteau Repertory. Written in the 1950s
with another generation's fanaticism still in the playwright's
mind, ``Rhinoceros'' was first staged in 1960 and made a splash on
Broadway a year later with Zero Mostel in the role of Jean, the
hero Berenger's best friend, who metamorphoses from a human into a
rhinoceros before the audience's eyes. But the play is still a
caution against any stampede into a mindless conformity _ be it
collectivism, nationalism or fundamentalism _ and modern audiences
can choose their favorite -ism with which to draw comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   The play quite simply concerns the transformation of a quiet,
peaceful town into anarchy when one after another of its citizens
is transmuted into a lumbering, thick-skinned brute. Only Berenger,
a character in several Ionesco plays and a stand-in for the
playwright, holds out against the rush into rhinocerism. First, the
townspeople notice a stray rhinoceros rumbling down the street. But
no one takes a great deal of notice (``It made a lot of dust.''
``Stupid quadruped not worth talking about.''), although it does
trample one woman's cat. But before long the entire town is joining
the herd, and the ethical debates over the rhino way of life versus
the human way of life are muted into blind acceptance of the rhino
ethic. ``Why not just leave them alone,'' a friend advises
Berenger. ``You get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eve Adamson, the estimable director, mines the salient parts of
the play with her usual aplomb. But if parts of the Cocteau staging
seem to move slowly, the playwright must take his share of blame.
Ionesco was a master of the extended one-act like ``The Chairs''
and ``The Lesson,'' but as he turned to full-length plays some of
the dialogue began to sound forced and unnecessarily padded. A
wonderfully comic little scene in which a logician sets about
proving Socrates was a cat works well but goes on far too long, as
does much of the debate over whether it is the one-horned rhino or
the two-horned rhino that comes from Africa. Repetitions diminish
some of the humor and have the effect of underlining the message.
</P>
<P>
   Two Cocteau veterans take on the key roles of Berenger and Jean.
Harris Berlinsky delivers an understated yet credible reading of
the one-man resistance movement, and Craig Smith is ferocious as
Jean, his friend who changes into the rhino. Tracey Atkins,
Christopher Black and Patrick Hall all offer good turns in
supporting roles. Christopher Martin's sound design convincingly
simulates a herd of rhinos in the Cocteau lobby.
</P>

METEOR SHOWER COULD BE TROUBLE FOR SATELLITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earth is about to swoop through a trail of dust left by a
passing comet, creating a shower of shooting stars more intense
than any seen in three decades _ and a possible headaches for
people using pagers, phones, TVs and any other devices that rely on
satellites, scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For all its spectacle, the Leonid meteor shower, as the annual
event due Tuesday is called, could pose serious threats to the
hundreds of satellites put in orbit since this phenomenon last
produced a full-fledged meteor storm in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The dust particles are no bigger than a grain of sand but travel
100 times faster than a bullet shot from a high-powered rifle. They
can rupture a satellite's skin and short-circuit its electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some concern in the military that you could knock out
a spy satellite with a Leonid particle just prior to your planned
attack of Iraq,'' said Don Yeomans, a senior research scientist at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the same risk exists for satellites that carry
telephone, television, pager and other communications signals, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Precautions are being taken. The $2billion Hubble Space
Telescope is being turned away from the hail of particles so its
optics will not be damaged. Other satellites are being maneuvered
so their solar panels do not take the brunt of the shower straight
on. And astronauts on the Russian space station Mir will huddle in
their emergency escape pod for the hour or so when the shower is
most intense.
</P>
<P>
   The Earth-bound are in no danger as the tiny sand-like grains
encased in ice vaporize 60 miles up in the athmosphere, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Leonids have not yet taken out a satellite or space
craft, a Canadian communications satellite was disabled during the
Perseid meteor shower in 1993, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are hopeful that their delicate eyes, ears and
switching stations in the sky will survive the Leonids. By
estimate, the chances of a satellite being disabled this year are
less than 1 in 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt the shower will be intense this year, as it is
every 33 years when the comet that spawns the dust trail,
Tempel-Tuttle, makes its closest orbit to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   On most years when the Leonids come around in November, there
may be 15 to 20 shooting stars an hour. In 1966, during the last
storm, it produced some 140,000 tiny fireballs an hour, but
scientists say they cannot predict if it will rise to the level of
a storm this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Americans, the best viewing will be in east
Asia and will reach its peak at about 11:45 a.m. Pacific Standard
Time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people can expect to glimpse one to two shooting stars
every few minutes in the eastern sky during the pre-dawn hours
Tuesday. The shooting stars appear to emanate from the
constellation of Leo, hence the name.
</P>
<P>
   The meteor shower has sparked great interest among skywatchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have customers coming in everyday asking where is the best
place and time to watch it,'' said Tim Hicks of Scope City, an
optics and telescope retailer in Sherman Oaks. ``They're very
excited. We tell them it could be big but don't get your hopes up
for a storm, but it should be a good shower.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks and others say they key to viewing this spectacle is
getting as far from the city lights as possible, ideally to the
desert or mountains: ``Get a lawn chair, sit back, relax and keep
your eyes open,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A higher-than-usual number of shooting stars will also be
visible in the early morning Monday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy Leonid shower and possible storm is also expected next
year, although the best viewing then will be from Europe. After
that, the comet's orbit begins to move away from the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either this year or next or pack it in for the next two
millennia,'' Yeomans said.

STARR REBOUNDS, INDICTING CLINTON FRIEND HUBBELL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for rewriting throughout)  (htv) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his sex and lies case against President
Clinton losing momentum on Capitol Hill, Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, returned Friday to the Whitewater
investigation, his original mandate, and indicted Clinton's
longtime friend Webster Hubbell for his role in the real estate
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charged that Hubbell sought to conceal from
federal regulators the role he and Hillary Rodham Clinton played in
a complicated land transaction in Arkansas that helped lead to the
collapse of a savings and loan institution. It was not clear from
the indictment whether Starr was suggesting that Hillary Clinton,
who was not named but was described as ``the billing partner'' in
the Rose Law Firm, had done anything improper or illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, a former chief justice of the state of Arkansas and
once the No. 3 official in the Clinton Justice Department, was
charged with 15 counts of fraud, making false statements, and
trying to impede two federal regulatory agencies, as well as with
committing perjury before a congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment Friday was the third time Starr brought charges
against Hubbell in the five-year investigation of the president and
his wife. Hubbell pleaded guilty and spent two years in prison for
bilking his law partners, but a later indictment, for tax fraud,
was dismissed by a federal judge earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   As he was indicting Hubbell, Starr also sent new material to
Congress Friday about his investigation into whether Clinton lied
under oath about accusations that he made an unwanted sexual
advance in 1993 to Kathleen Willey, a White House volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters outside his Washington home Friday,
Hubbell denied the newest charges and said they were part of what
he described as a continuing effort by Starr to force him to
provide evidence against the Clintons. He said that when he left
prison two years ago after the earlier conviction by Starr, he
hoped to begin life anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now of the belief that I may never be able to do so. I
just do not know what it's going to take to make this matter end,''
Hubbell said. ``What I do know is that I don't know of any
wrongdoing on behalf of the first lady or the president, and
nothing the independent counsel can do to me is going to make me
lie about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment Friday demonstrated that the independent counsel
is continuing with his investigation, as he has said he would,
despite the increasingly cool response both from the nation and
from Congress to his investigations of the president and his
conclusion that Clinton may have committed impeachable offenses in
trying to cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Hubbell indictment and the apparent disposal of the
Willey matter came only days before Starr is expected to face a
withering partisan crossfire when he appears as the principal
witness before the House Judiciary Committee. The committee, which
is considering whether to vote impeachment charges against the
president, is scheduled to question Starr Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell spent nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty
to bilking his partners in the Rose law firm of Little Rock, where
he had once worked with Mrs. Clinton. But Starr was unable to
obtain what it seemed he was really after from Hubbell in the plea
agreement _ incriminating evidence against the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Starr then brought a wide-ranging indictment for tax fraud,
which Hubbell again protested was an effort to get him to testify
against the President and Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal judge dismissed the tax fraud case and added a
stinging rebuke of Starr, saying the prosecutor had overstepped his
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James Robertson said that the independent counsel's
pursuit of Hubbell was a ``quintessential fishing expedition.''
Earlier he called some of Starr's constitutional views ``scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robertson said that the tax case was too far removed from
Starr's original mandate of 1994 to investigate the Clintons'
business dealings in Arkansas more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment dismissed last July accused Hubbell, his wife,
Suzanna, and two advisers of scheming in the last four years to
avoid paying taxes and penalties of more than $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had contended that a large part of the taxes owed
stemmed from money Hubbell had embezzled and from hundreds of
thousands of dollars in income from jobs referred to him by friends
and supporters of the president. The indictment said those jobs
required little work from Hubbell and suggested they might have
been arranged to discourage him from cooperating with
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment Friday seemed intended to be insulated from
Robertson's charge.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, the newest charges are tied directly to the
original topic Starr was supposed to investigate _ the Clintons'
connection to a complicated and sprawling web of real estate
transactions in Arkansas before they occupied the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment concerns a real estate development known as
Castle Grande that was funded by Madison Guaranty, a savings and
loan owned at the time by James and Susan McDougal. Madison
Guaranty eventually failed, and federal regulators have attributed
part of the failure to its involvement in the Castle Grande
development.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment does not mention Hillary Clinton by name but
refers more than 20 times to the ``1985-86 billing partner'' on the
Madison Guaranty account, a description of Mrs. Clinton's role in
the transaction. Federal regulators had described the Castle Grande
transaction as a sham, and Hillary Clinton had for a time denied
any involvement with the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But when long-missing billing records from the Rose law firm
were discovered in the White House book room two years after they
had been subpoenaed by Starr, Mrs. Clinton said she remembered
having done legal work on the account but knew it by a different
name.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that Hubbell ``schemed to falsify,
conceal, and cover up the true nature'' of the role he and Mrs.
Clinton played in the Castle Grande transaction. The indictment
charges that what he was attempting to conceal was the effort to
defraud the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution
Trust Corp., the federal agency set up to coordinate the savings
and loan bailout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legal work performed on'' Castle Grande ``was performed by
defendant Webster L. Hubbell'' and other lawyers, including ``the
1985-1986 Rose billing attorney,'' the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment noted that regulators from the two federal
agencies concluded that Castle Grande involved ``insider dealing,
fictitious sales and land flips.'' Regulators estimate the failed
development cost taxpayers nearly $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said Hubbell took steps to assist his
father-in-law, businessman Seth Ward, in keeping hundreds of
thousands of dollars in loans that he obtained from Madison
Guaranty. Ward, according to regulators, was a ``straw'' buyer of
parts of the Castle Grande tract.

KYRA NIJINSKY, 84, DANCER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kyra Nijinsky, a dancer who was the daughter of Vaslav Nijinsky,
one of this century's greatest ballet dancers and choreographers,
died on Sept. 1 at the Pine Ridge Care Center in San Rafael, Calif.
She led a reclusive life in San Francisco and details of her death
become nationally known only recently. She was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Nijinsky identified artistically with her celebrated
father, whose career was curtailed by mental illness. With her high
cheekbones and muscular physique, she even resembled him. During
the 1930s she sometimes attended ballet classes dressed like the
male students in white shirt and tights rather than in the tunics
women then favored.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Vienna, she spent her childhood on tour with her parents
and at a school in Switzerland. She received early dance training
from her aunt, the choreographer Bronislava Nijinska, and at the
Paris Opera Ballet School.
</P>
<P>
   Never long associated with any company, Miss Nijinsky attracted
special attention in London in the 1930s. She impersonated her
father in ``Le Spectre de la Rose,'' one of his greatest roles, in
``Streamline'' a sophisticated revue of 1934. She then went into
the Ballet Rambert, where her parts included that of a nymph in a
revival of her father's ``Apres-Midi d'un Faune.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1934 she also created her most important role for the Rambert
troupe in Antony Tudor's astrological fantasy, ``The Planets.'' As
the Mortal Born Under Neptune, she portrayed a mystical longing to
unite with the infinite. Although admitting that Miss Nijinsky was
not a strong technician, the British critic Arnold Haskell called
her ``a dancer who understands, whether instinctively or otherwise,
how to use dancing to express her emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Nijinsky's stage career began fading after she married the
conductor Igor Markevitch in 1936; the marriage ended in divorce,
and Markevitch, who died in 1983, raised their son, Vaslav Nijinsky
Markevitch.
</P>
<P>
   While living in Italy during World War II, Miss Nijinsky was
briefly imprisoned by the Nazis, who accused her of spying. After
the war, she worked as an interpreter and managed a boutique.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to San Francisco in 1954, she became a painter and poet.
Deeply religious, she devoted herself to the expression of
spiritual themes.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her son; a sister, Tamara Nijinsky of
Phoenix, and four grandchildren.

TEX JOHNSTON, 84, LEGENDARY TEST PILOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Kan., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tex Johnston, a storied test pilot who ushered in the age of jet
travel with such a heart-stopping flourish that some people in
Seattle and the world of aviation are still shaking their heads,
died on Oct. 29 at a nursing home in Mount Vernon, Wash. He was 84
and was recalled as the man who blithely barrel-rolled the United
States' first jetliner into aviation history.
</P>
<P>
   His family said the cause was Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   With a quarter-million spectators gathered on Lake Washington
for the Gold Cup hydroplane races and air show at the 1955 Seattle
Seafair, no one was expecting anything special from Boeing Airplane
Co.'s chief test pilot that August afternoon, least of all the
Boeing executives clustered on a barge surrounded by the heads of
virtually every major airline in the world to watch a routine
flyover by a prototype of the company's new aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Johnston, or Alvin Melvin Johnston, as the
drawling test pilot was known to virtually no one, had already had
his brush with aviation glory.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years earlier as chief test pilot for Bell Aviation, the
lanky pilot in his signature custom-made cowboy boots had tested
the company's famous X-1 rocket plane, becoming the first to fly
the B-29-launched craft using all four rockets and taking it, he
later recalled, to Mach .99, a whisper shy of the sound barrier. He
held off because the Air Force, which owned the plane, had insisted
that a military pilot have the honor of being the first to fly at
supersonic speed, as indeed Capt. Chuck Yeager did in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   If he had been disappointed at missing out on that bit of
aviation history, Johnston didn't let on.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what had kept him in the air almost constantly since
he soloed at the age of 15 in an open cockpit Waco monoplane was
not the chance for glory but the sheer, exuberant joy he had first
tasted at 11 one summer afternoon in 1925. On that day a
barnstorming pilot landed a World War I Jenny in a cow pasture next
to the Johnston family farm in Admire, Kan., outside Emporia, and
took the youngster on a short hop that left him hooked on flying
forever.
</P>
<P>
   As he recalled in his 1991 book, ``Tex Johnston: Jet-Age Test
Pilot,'' he had been so smitten that he grabbed the pilot's hand
and blurted out: ``I love you. I'm going to be just like you.''
</P>
<P>
   It took some doing, but by the time he joined Boeing in 1949,
Johnston had long since won his aviation spurs, performing aerial
stunts for a flying circus at 19, training pilots and ferrying
airplanes from factories to military airfields in World War II, and
even earning a few footnotes to aviation history.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first pilot to fly the famous Bell XP-59A, the
first American jet, above 40,000 feet, and set a world closed
course speed record of 376.4 mph in winning the 1946 Thompson
Trophy race in Cleveland in a modified P-39.
</P>
<P>
   As Boeing's chief of test flights he had reached the pinnacle of
his profession, supervising a staff of 600, including 15 other
pilots, while continuing his personal achievements, among them
flying the first B-47 and the first B-52 on their maiden flights.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, 1955, the day Johnston was asked to fly over Lake
Washington in a giant four-engine Boeing jet prototype designated
367-80 and commonly known as the Dash 80, Boeing was host of the
annual meetings of the International Air Transport Association and
the American Society of Aeronautical Engineers, and virtually every
potential customer for its planes was represented.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives understandably wanted them to get a good look
at the plane on which the company had staked its future, investing
a quarter of its corporate net worth without a single advance
order.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they did. Johnston pulled on his cowboy boots, climbed
into the Dash 80 and roared in low across the lake. At 400 feet
above the water and at a speed of more than 400 mph, the Dash 80
suddenly started climbing and began rotating on its axis. Its long,
swept-back wings described a giant spiral around the body of the
speeding plane, which flew briefly upside down in its slow, languid
roll. Then, just in case no one had noticed, he did it again.
</P>
<P>
   On the barge, aviation executives gasped. The Boeing president,
William Allen, asked a friend with a heart ailment for his pills.
His distress was understandable. Barrel rolls performed by small
fighter planes and the like were common enough, but no one had ever
seen one executed by a 128-foot-long, 160,000-pound plane with four
heavy jet engines and a 130-foot wing span.
</P>
<P>
   But then, no one had ever seen a Boeing 707, as the Dash 80's
offspring would soon be known, a plane whose pilot had participated
in every facet of its design and construction and knew, as those
gasping below could not, that it could well withstand the
surprisingly minimal stresses caused by the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as an aviation friend reassuringly told Allen, ``Tex has
just sold your plane for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by the time Johnston set a transcontinental speed record
in 1957 of 612 miles an hour flying the Dash 80 from Seattle to
Baltimore in three hours, 48 minutes, the orders were pouring in,
as they continued to do over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston was inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton,
Ohio, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Gary, of Edmonds, Wash.; two daughters,
Judy Alexander of Bellevue, Wash., and Barbara Fowler of Lompoc,
Calif.; nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elvis J. Stahr Jr., an educator and
environmentalist who was a secretary of the Army in the Kennedy
administration and was later president of the National Audubon
Society, died on Wednesday at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was
82.
</P>
<P>
   Stahr's career spanned top jobs in the military, in higher
education and in the environmental movement. Stahr was named dean
of the University of Kentucky law school in 1956, became president
of West Virginia University in 1958 and was appointed president of
Indiana University in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Between academic jobs, he was Army Secretary, from 1961 through
1962. That period included the Berlin crisis, the Bay of Pigs
debacle and the federal deployment of the Alabama National Guard to
integrate the state university.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Hickman, Ky., in 1916, Stahr graduated from the
University of Kentucky in 1936 and in 1939, received a BA in law
from Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 Stahr assumed the presidency of the National Audubon
Society, where he led efforts to preserve the Everglades from
commercial and industrial development. He also worked to prevent
environmental harm from dam and water projects and to obtain
accords on international whaling. Under his direction, the Audubon
Society's membership increased nearly fourfold.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the society in 1981, he worked in his
private law practice in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Stahr is survived by his wife, Dorothy; two sons, Stuart, of
Wappingers Falls, N.Y., and Bradford, of Greenwich; a daughter,
Stephanie Stahr, of Vienna, Va., and two grandchildren.

TWO ACCUSED OFFICERS IN LOUIMA CASE IMPLICATE A THIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two of the four police officers facing federal civil
rights charges in the attack on a Haitian immigrant in Brooklyn
last year have incriminated one of the other officers in the most
brutal part of the assault, according to documents unsealed Friday
in federal district court in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the immigrant, Abner Louima, was beaten by the
four officers in a police car after his arrest in a street brawl on
Aug. 9, 1997. The officers who are quoted in the court papers,
Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder, are charged with taking part in the
beating in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   The officer they incriminated, Justin A. Volpe, is accused of
ramming a stick into Louima's rectum and then his mouth in a
bathroom at the 70th Precinct station house in Flatbush, causing
severe internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese is quoted in the court papers as saying that he went into
the bathroom after Volpe had entered with Louima, and saw Louima
lying face down on the floor, ``his pants and underpants down at
his ankles, and Volpe holding the stick full of feces.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiese is also quoted as saying that Volpe told him that night
that Louima had ``defecated on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiese's statement came in a memorandum written by two of
Louima's lawyers, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and Peter J. Neufeld. It
was originally written for their own files in November 1997, three
months after Louima was brutalized and just after the two lawyers
met with Wiese's lawyers, Joseph Tacopina and Russell M. Gioiella.
</P>
<P>
   According to papers filed by the officer's lawyers, they met
with Louima's lawyers in the hopes of persuading them to ``treat
Wiese as a witness'' for Louima in a civil suit that Louima has
filed against all four accused officers, the city and other
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese's lawyers also said that if there were a ``reconciliation
between'' the accounts of Wiese and Louima, this would ``greatly
increase the potential of Wiese avoiding an indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, denounced Wiese's statements
in the memorandum as unreliable. First, he said, it was double
hearsay because the statements were contained in an account written
by Louima's lawyers based on conversations they had had with
Wiese's lawyers, and were not based on conversations with the
officer himself.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Kornberg said, Wiese's account ``is the same story that
Wiese tried to sell'' to investigators shortly after Louima's
encounter with the police. ``It didn't fly'' then, he said, ``and
it won't fly now.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the fact that when Wiese's account
conflicted with that of an officer not charged in the case, the
investigators chose to believe the other officer, saying Wiese had
failed a lie detector test. Wiese's lawyers maintain that the test
was defective and say he passed a subsequent test.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese was indicted in February, along with the other accused
officers, by a federal grand jury that charged them with violating
Louima's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder was quoted in a November 1997 Federal Bureau of
Investigation report _ also part of the material unsealed Friday _
as telling agents that he had seen Volpe take Louima into the
station house bathroom. Bruder is also quoted as telling the agents
that Volpe later told him, `` `I whacked him in the ass with a mop
handle.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg said Bruder's statement could not be believed. He noted
that among the charges the grand jury brought against Bruder was
that in the same FBI interview, he lied to the agents about a
detail of Louima's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth officer charged with violating Louima's civil rights,
Charles Schwarz, is accused of holding him down while he was being
attacked with the stick. All four officers deny all the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum from Louima's lawyers and the FBI report were
part of a batch of documents in the case that the presiding judge,
Eugene H. Nickerson, ordered unsealed, saying, ``I don't like
sealed papers.''

Small kitchens are often efficient, but rarely airy. When Victoria
Koppel bought a co-op on Manhattan's Upper West Side, she was
unfazed by the 8-by-10-foot kitchen. It was enormous by her
standards. ``It's twice the size of my last kitchen.'' To renovate
the space, she hired Robert Young, a Manhattan architect. The final
budget was $19,000. (Fred R. Conrad/New York Times Photo)

DEVILS TOP PENGUINS AFTER LOSING 3-GOAL LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The game was for sole possession of
first place in the Atlantic Division and a tie for the lead in the
Eastern Conference, but the Pittsburgh Penguins approached it
rather lackadaisically until the third period Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   With the Penguins spending plenty of time watching during the
first 40 minutes, the New Jersey Devils scored the game's first
three goals and went on to a 4-3 triumph before a crowd of 17,452
at Continental Arena in a game that marked the popular referee Paul
Stewart after an absence due to colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inspired by the return of Stewart, a friend of coach
Robbie Ftorek _ the two lived together in Ftorek's house when they
both played for the Quebec Nordiques _ the Devils started with
gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rolston got the Devils on the right path with his second
goal of the season 2 minutes 30 seconds after Stewart dropped his
first puck this season to start a game. Rolston beat Tom Barrasso
from the right circle, converting Jay Pandolfo's pass from behind
the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Randy McKay scored his second goal of the season by jumping on a
rebound of a Scott Stevens shot at 9:23, before Jason Arnott gave
the Devils the three-goal cushion with his second goal of the
season, a blistering shot from the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott's goal, with 5:12 left in the first period, came on the
Devils' first manpower advantage of the game. The Penguins are
next-to-last in the league in penalty-killing efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins narrowed the gap with a second left in the first
period when Martin Straka deflected Kevin Hatcher's shot for his
sixth goal of the season. It was only the third shot in the game
against Chris Terreri, who made his third appearance of the season,
giving Martin Brodeur a rest because the Devils face the Flyers in
Philadelphia on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Terreri was busy in the early stages of the third period, when
the Penguins played with more enthusiasm and tied the score with
goals by Stu Barnes and Aleksei Morozov 45 seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes scored his fifth goal 3:03 into the period when he
converted a rebound from a shot by Jaromir Jagr while he was
standing in the low slot unattended. Morozov's goal beat Terreri
cleanly over the glove from near the bottom of the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devils came back strong and got their victory with 5:07
left, when McKay went around the net from right to left and beat
Barrasso from close range.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   _ DAVE ANDREYCHUK missed his third consecutive game with what
the Devils called a bruised sternum. Andreychuk will also miss
Saturday's game in Philadelphia, but he is probable for Thursday's
game against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   _ SHELDON SOURAY was the odd man out on defense, with BRAD
BOMBARDIR taking his place.
</P>
<P>
   _ KRZYSZTOF OLIWA was scratched for the first time this season. &QL;

DODGERS SIGN RELIEVER MILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers continued to stockpile
right-handed relief pitchers Friday, signing Baltimore free agent
Alan Mills to a three-year contract worth $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone already has Antonio Osuna and added
Mel Rojas during the recently completed GM meetings in Naples, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But Osuna is coming off elbow surgery and Rojas has pitched
poorly the past two seasons after saving 36 games in 1996 at
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Mills played with the Orioles when Malone was assistant general
manager and Davey Johnson, now with the Dodgers, was the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Mills will make $1.25 million this season, $2.25 million in 2000
and $3 million in 2001. Osuna, who could be traded in spring
training if he recovers from surgery to remove bone chips in his
right elbow, will make $1.05 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, acquired Wednesday from the New York Mets for Bobby
Bonilla, will make $4.6 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite trading and inquiring about big names at the GM
meetings, Malone says adding depth to the middle and setup relief
roles was a priority this winter.
</P>
<P>
   He does not want to see a repeat of the late-season meltdown by
closer Jeff Shaw because of overwork, especially after giving Shaw
an $18.5 million contract extension two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acquired one of the premier setup men in baseball with the
signing of Alan Mills,'' Malone said. ``He is a proven and
experienced reliever with quality pitches who thrives on situations
with the game on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, 32, is a nine-year veteran. He pitched 72 games for the
Orioles last season, going 3-4 with a 3.90 ERA and 13 saves.
</P>
<P>
   With the right-handers covered, the Dodgers front office, which
is meeting this weekend at their spring training base in Vero
Beach, Fla., now shifts its attention to getting left-handed
relief.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list is Baltimore's ageless Jesse Orosco, who
pitched for the Dodgers during their 1988 World Series championship
season.
</P>
<P>
   The club also is attempting to re-sign its own free agent
left-hander, Scott Radinsky, who was erratic this past season after
pitching brilliantly in 1996 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky was forced to move into the Dodgers' closer's role when
Osuna began the season poorly. Radinsky blew 11 save opportunities,
second worst in the National League, but went 3-2 with a save and
1.93 ERA after the club acquired Shaw from Cincinnati at the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky, who lives in Simi Valley, also is being courted by the
New York Yankees. He will be 31 on Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Reserve infielder Juan Castro avoided salary arbitration
by agreeing Thursday to a two-year contract worth $725,000. Castro,
who will earn $325,000 next season and $400,000 in 2000, was
mentioned this past week in trade talks with the Cincinnati Reds
involving the Dodgers' Raul Mondesi for shortstop Barry Larkin and
outfielder Reggie Sanders. Malone reaffirmed Friday that the trade
never went beyond the discussion stage.

   Actually, those ``Dummies'' books are a great place to start if

scanner simply takes a picture of the page. Character-recognition
software, which ought to come with the scanner, does its best to
recognize letters in that picture and turn them into text in a new

<P>
   DEAR SIZE: Those little Easter eggs only take up a fraction of

ridiculously large because they do about 700 times the number of

LOCKOUT LEAVES PACERS' ROOKIE IN LIMBO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., N.J.)   (bl)  
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ When Al Harrington drove to Bloomington, Ind.,
four months ago, he did not know that he was about to be rebuilt.
Harrington, the Indiana Pacers' first-round selection in last
summer's National Basketball Association draft, thought he was just
going to lift some weights, run some sprints and shoot some
jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Abunassar, Harrington's newly hired personal trainer,
had other plans. Having worked with many NBA players, Abunassar
knew that his client's soft, undeveloped, 18-year-old body would
have to be reshaped if he was to stand any chance of surviving the
pounding that an NBA forward takes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after months of six-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week workouts
that included everything from punching a heavy bag to changing his
eating habits, Harrington looks like a bona fide first-round draft
pick. The shoulders and arms on his 6-foot-8-inch, 238-pound frame
are toned and muscular, his once big and meaty thighs have been
trimmed and defined and the baby fat that used to hang around his
midsection has been replaced by ripples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al looks like a totally different person from the time I saw
him in July,'' Abunassar said. ``Proportionally he looks more like
an NBA perimeter guy rather than a high school big man.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro body and all, though, this question remains: Did Harrington
make the right decision when he elected to enter the NBA draft
directly out of St. Patrick's High School in Elizabeth, N.J.?
</P>
<P>
   When the Pacers made Harrington the relatively low 25th pick of
the draft _ and not a lottery pick like his successful prep-to-pros
predecessors Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant _ it suggested that his
mother, Mona Lawton, and high school coach, Kevin Boyle, were
correct in advising him to go to college. And seven days later when
the lockout was imposed, forbidding Harrington to have contact with
the Pacers' coaching staff, many onlookers saw it as even more
evidence that he had made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a high school kid puts one strike against you already,''
said Keith Van Horn, the Nets' second-year forward who worked
extensively with Coach John Calipari and his staff during the
summer before his rookie season. ``You're going to struggle enough
just because you're coming out of high school. And then not being
able to work out with anybody in the league before you start your
first game, that's real tough.''
</P>
<P>
   While Harrington was widely regarded as the nation's best high
school player a year ago, scouts are hesitant to put him in the
same class as Garnett and Bryant, both of whom became NBA All-Stars
in their second seasons. Each of those players has abilities or
backgrounds that sets him apart: Garnett is 7 feet tall with the
skills of a perimeter player, and Bryant, as the son of the former
NBA and European league player Joe Bryant, grew up traveling the
world and playing against older competition.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Harrington is not as physically gifted as
Garnett and Bryant. Garnett was a victim on an NBA lockout in the
summer of 1995, but he did not miss a training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington will be more a project than a prodigy. He jumps well
but is not a skywalker. He has great balance and coordination but
is not exceptionally quick. His jump shot and ball-handling skills
are solid, but as a power forward-center in high school, he has
never been a full-time perimeter player. Since he is projected as a
small forward for Indiana, the task ahead of him is even more
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big transition from being a high school guy that
steps out and makes two 3-pointers and a pull-up jump shot in a
game and people say, `Hey, the big kid can shoot,' to being a small
forward in the NBA,'' said Boyle, whose St. Patrick's team, led by
Harrington, won a state title last season. ``Al is a good athlete,
but at that level, he's not a great athlete, and he needs to be
extremely strong, extremely smart and extremely well-conditioned to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning how to run off screens is only one of the many
intricacies that experts say Harrington is missing by being locked
out from Indiana Coach Larry Bird and his staff. In the summer
leagues, minicamps and private workouts that a draft pick normally
goes through, he receives the opportunity to adjust to the NBA's
defensive rules, play with the 24-second shot clock, learn plays,
and play consistently with bigger, stronger and faster players.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is getting none of that, Harrington will be behind
whenever training camp begins. And since camp will be shortened
because of the urgency to start the regular season, coaches will
have to put game plans in quickly. If a rookie is slow in picking
things up, he will not have an exhibition season to settle in.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington is trying to make the best of his situation by
playing against as much NBA competition as possible. He has played
a week's worth of one-on-one games with Joe Smith, the No. 1 pick
in the 1995 draft. He has faced off against Garnett and Shareef
Abdur-Rahim in pickup games in Atlanta. He has joined his Pacers
teammates Reggie Miller, Mark Jackson, Antonio Davis and Austin
Croshere in informal workouts in Indianapolis. He also scored 14
points in an NBA charity game at Madison Square Garden in
September.
</P>
<P>
   While Harrington admits he needs to learn more, he is also
convinced that he made the right decision. ``NBA players are real
smart,'' he said. ``They're sneaky and stuff. They have little
tactics for rebounding and defense. It's hard for me to get through
screens, but they just slip through screens like it's nothing. But
I've definitely been holding my own. Nobody ever kills me. I've got
a great opportunity to play. If I come in and everything is
clicking, I can see myself getting 30 minutes a game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hubie Brown, the NBA coach and veteran analyst, says summer
games do not provide an accurate barometer of what a player can or
can't do. ``The veteran player is cruising in the summer,'' Brown
said. ``So when coaches look at guys in the summertime scoring a
lot of points, they never get excited. They just look at it and
say, `Yeah, the kid has potential.' But it tells them nothing else.
Because you are not watching him adjust to 20 different offensive
sets, the changing defenses, playing unselfishly within a five-man
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said he understood that he was missing out by missing
camp, so he had tried to compensate by watching videotapes of
Pacers games almost every night and discussing them the next day
with Davis, who has allowed Harrington to live with him during the
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 18, that's very impressive,'' Davis said. ``You would think
that he would just want to go and play and wouldn't care about
being a student of the game. But he really wants to know what's
going on. He wants to fit in with this team and understand what his
role can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Most commentators have considered it a blessing for Harrington
that he was drafted by a veteran team that is one of the league's
best. They say the Pacers will teach him about being a professional
and that he will get the chance to sit back and learn without being
thrust into an important role on the team.
</P>
<P>
   But Garnett benefited from going to Minnesota, a weak team at
the time, and being able to play nearly 30 minutes a night as a
rookie.
</P>
<P>
   And Jermaine O'Neal, another high school player in the 1996
draft, was hurt by going to a talented, albeit unprofessional,
Portland team. The word throughout the league is that O'Neal can
play but, unable to beat out the gifted veterans Brian Grant and
Rasheed Wallace, he has become lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can a high school kid who's used to being stroked adjust to no
minutes, no shots, no time, no notoriety?'' Brown said. ``If the
person is mature and he's not carrying baggage of an entourage,
fine. He'll understand his time is coming. But if you've got an
entourage, baggage and you're immature, you go right into the
tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Mona Lawton says her son will not have an entourage, and she
will make sure of it by moving to Indianapolis to live with him
once the season begins. And Harrington said he could handle being a
role player with the Pacers, even one who gets little playing time.
At Roselle High School, he was the sixth man on the freshman team.
It was not until his junior year, after he had transferred to St.
Patrick's, when he began to blossom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al's worked hard because he came from the bottom,'' Boyle
said. ``He knows what it was like to be a role guy as a sophomore,
while a lot of other guys have been the stars since sixth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how well he does as a rookie, Harrington will have
the security of knowing that he has time to develop. Under the
previous collective bargaining agreement, he would have received a
three-year guaranteed contract worth about $2 million. He is very
likely to sign a similar deal at the end of the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The two other high school stars who opted this year for the NBA
are not so fortunate. As second-round picks, Rashard Lewis, drafted
32d by Seattle, and Korleone Young, drafted 40th by Detroit, will
not have guaranteed contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless a high school kid has a guaranteed deal, it's nothing
more than a crap shoot,'' Brown said. ``And the odds are against
you, just like in a crap shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   For Harrington, at least the gamble is not that big.  &QL;

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Among the many computer books out there,
``Windows for Dummies'' has been recommended. I am keeping in mind
that this comes from my ex-boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wisdom Seeker
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SEEKER: Well, he was wrong about everything else, wasn't
he? No, wait! That's what my ex says about me. Your situation is
probably very different from the shrill, shrieking horror of my
life.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, those ``Dummies'' books are a great place to start if
you're totally in the dark. Just make sure they're not too
fundamental for you. Go to the bookstore, plop down with a latte
and a laptop and do some ``browsing.'' Or go to www.dummies.com and
read sample chapters before you shell out 20 bucks for something
you may not even need.
</P>
<P>
   You know, those people have a book for just about everything.
There's even ``Sex for Dummies.'' Hmmmm. I should have bought that
one for that shrew of a ... Sorry! Didn't mean to let my personal
life intrude. It won't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have some questions about your collum first
are you a hacker and if you are not how do you know so much about
it.i mean i know your a profeeser or something like that.but you
must know how to hack.By the way please send alot more info on the

<P>
   _ Word for Word
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WORD: In case some brain-dead salesclerk can't give you a
straight answer, just about any scanner you buy can do both. The
scanner simply takes a picture of the page. Character-recognition
software, which ought to come with the scanner, does its best to
recognize letters in that picture and turn them into text in a new
file. A blurry or smudged original means lots of typos, so try to
keep from spilling your tropical drink all over the page before
scanning.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Almost every week you tell us some new ``stupid
software trick'' the Microsoft engineers have put in their
products. Is this why their programs are so ridiculously large?
</P>
<P>
   _ Size Matters
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SIZE: Those little Easter eggs only take up a fraction of
the space in the programs. Microsoft applications are so
ridiculously large because they do about 700 times the number of
things most casual users need. For instance, Microsoft has been
adding on to Word since Bill Gates' acne cleared up, making it
bigger and bigger.
</P>
<P>
   In almost all Microsoft setup programs, there is an option for
``custom'' installation. Use that, and you can pick and choose
exactly how much stuff to install.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of software tricks, you guys aren't playing fair.
You're supposed to be sending me stuff. I'm tired of just giving
and giving and giving. But it was always about you, wasn't it? I
should have seen how selfish you were, but, no, I let you walk all
over me. Well, not anymore. You're not the boss of ... Whoops! Did
it again, didn't I?

TO MANY, JESUS IS THE MVP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He'll be back this weekend, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Back in all his glory.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the playing field and in the locker room. Back today in
Lubbock, College Station and Tulsa. Back on Sunday in Phoenix,
Minnesota, Carolina and even Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   He's everywhere you turn. On every TV station, every postgame
interview, there after virtually every touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   He's at wide receiver and quarterback, running back and
cornerback. He's running back punts and kicking field goals. It's
like there's nothing the man can't do.
</P>
<P>
   He has become, over the past few months, perhaps the most
prominent personality in sports, especially the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   This Jesus guy is some kind of player.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell me you haven't noticed. You can't be a Cowboys fan
without knowing what we're talking about here.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about Jesus Christ, the same guy you may have
heard about in Sunday school a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   He's the guy that Deion's pointing at through the hole in the
Texas Stadium roof. He's the one that Emmitt Smith is tapping
himself on the helmet and lifting a fist in the air to greet after
every TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just my way of saying to Jesus, `See you in heaven,' '' Emmitt
says.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think Deion and Emmitt and dozens, maybe hundreds
more like them around professional and amateur sports, ever get
tired of talking about this particular superstar, you'd better
think again.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first thing out of Deion's mouth at every postgame news
conference, the first thing Emmitt wants to get off his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praise Jesus. I just want to thank him for being with me
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The mass of reporters invariably shifts restlessly, a little
uncomfortable with the subject, ready to get on with the real
questions. And unless it's a live shot, you probably won't see that
on the 10 o'clock sports anyway. Editing cuts to the important
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Except to Deion and Emmitt and the others, that was the
important stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the notoriety for the things I accomplish,'' Smith says,
``but it's because of his grace. Jesus deserves the praise.''
</P>
<P>
   Got an e-mail from a minister friend the other day who expressed
concern that folks are going to start thinking that Jesus is only
for winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If God is always on the winners' side, then what does that say
about the losers?'' he wrote . ``Therein lies the problem for me. I
believe God is most of the time _ if not all of the time _ on the
side of the losers. Those were the ones Jesus hung out with, ate
with, partied with.
</P>
<P>
   ``God doesn't play favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the impression Smith wants to leave, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the Lord in bad times, too,'' he said. ``That's all I
could do last year when I was going through all the stuff I went
through. That's where I found my peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't find my peace in the locker room. I didn't find my
peace at home other than when I was praising God. He is a God that
you can go to at any time and he'll grant you peace. He's there
when you need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have a problem because they suspect that Deion, standing
alone in the middle of a field, pointing toward the sky, is really
just trying to call attention to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count coach Chan Gailey among those critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, religion is an individual thing, and God speaks to you
and to me and to Deion, and each relationship is unique,'' Gailey
said. ``He speaks to each of us in a different way, telling us what
he wants me to do and what he wants you to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because God doesn't have me do it like Deion, or Deion do
it like me, that doesn't make one of us right and the other wrong.
God's got different callings for everybody. Every Christian isn't
5-11, 180 pounds with blue eyes. That's just not the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like a recording you've heard before, listening to
Deion or Emmitt, or someone else, start off an interview by
praising God, but it comes from their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times guys want to make sure they give God the credit
in victory so that people will understand that `I' didn't do
this,'' Gailey said. ``We all tend to cry out to God when we're in
despair and in pain. It's easy at those times. Everybody does that,
even the nonreligious person says `Oh my God,' when they're in a
bind.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys want to make sure that they acknowledge God when
things are going well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people want to run from Jesus, but he's way too fast. At
least a 4.1 in the 40. Faster than Deion. Faster than fast.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, he'll be hanging around your favorite sporting
event again this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   I guarantee it.

CENTER KISELAK SET FOR FIRST NFL START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ With center Clay Shiver hobbled by a sprained
left toe, Mike Kiselak is set to make his first NFL start Sunday
against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody around here is making a big deal of it,'' Kiselak
said. ``But I started 121 games in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiselak, 31, spent the past five years in the Canadian Football
League, helping lead the Toronto Argonauts to the Grey Cup title
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Kiselak's experience, especially with the shotgun snaps in the
CFL, is one of the reasons the Cowboys signed him in March. Cowboys
coach Chan Gailey said Kiselak impressed coaches in training camp
and has continued to perform well in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a person like him to come in and compete,'' Gailey
said. ``When he got a chance to play \Rin training camp\S, he
continued to improve.''
Warren ready for returns
</P>
<P>
   As a nine-year NFL veteran, Cowboys running back Chris Warren
said he ``never thought about returning kickoffs again.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Warren, who was Seattle's main kickoff
returner in 1990, 1991 and 1992, signed with the Cowboys in the
off-season to back up Emmitt Smith. With Smith having a resurgent
season, Warren has seen little work as a running back except in
passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get more work and ``earn his paycheck,'' Warren
volunteered to return kickoffs again. He gets that chance Sunday,
when he replaces Kevin Mathis as the Cowboys' primary kickoff
returner. Mathis is expected to miss at least three games with a
broken right forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said the hardest part Sunday will be getting the timing
down with the return team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take me a few tries to time the blocks and hit
the wedge,'' Warren said. ``There is nothing you can do to simulate
that in practice.''

PAROLED RAPIST SAYS HE'S NOW A VICTIM, OF `MEGAN'S LAW' 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINDEN, N.J., _ When Frank Penna was torn awake from a deep
sleep on June 16 by gunfire thundering through his house, he knew
immediately, he said, that the shots were meant for him.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days earlier, because of ``Megan's Law,'' the authorities
had distributed fliers bearing his photograph and address to
everyone in the neighborhood, letting them know that 22 years
before, Penna had been convicted of kidnapping and raping two
girls, 13 and 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what it was; I knew they were after me,'' Penna, who is
now 56, said recently in an interview. ``You saw it coming. All the
kids had been yelling out at me, coming by and everything. It was
so loud. It was a .45-caliber military-style weapon. The bullets
went through four walls.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullets did not hit Penna, who lives in a basement apartment
of the two-story house where he grew up, and they barely missed his
neighbor upstairs, Joan Bazydlo, 66, who had been awake watching
television. But they sent an alarming message to Penna: Because of
the state law on sex offenders, he was no longer a free man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out of prison,'' he said, ``but it's like I'm in the big
prison now.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting was the worst case of violence against a paroled
sex offender since the 1994 passage of the law, which says the
residents of a community have a right to know when a high-risk sex
offender lives in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, James Johnson, 23, who lived around the corner from
Penna, admitted that he had fired the bullets into Penna's home, in
the hope of frightening him to move out of the neighborhood.
Johnson said he had feared for the safety of his 9-year-old sister,
who lived nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The law, named for Megan Kanka, 7, who was raped and murdered in
1994 by a convicted sex offender who lived next door, was entangled
in legal challenges for years. Only this year did prosecutors begin
using a refined version that is viewed as a model because it tries
to protect the rights of convicted sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The new version places tight limits on which offenders are
identified, who has access to the information and how it may be
passed on.
</P>
<P>
   But the shooting in the city of Linden illustrates how the law,
even in its revised form, cannot protect sex offenders from acts of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The notification law brought together two men of different
generations who had never met but who had grown up in the same
working-class community in Union County. It has also turned
everyone into uneasy neighbors. While many of Penna's neighbors
seem to have a live-and-let-live attitude toward Penna, many avoid
him, and others taunt him.
</P>
<P>
   Penna, who returned to his childhood home in 1992 after serving
16 years for his crime, lived a relatively quiet existence until
earlier this year. Now, he is consumed by bitterness and anger at
prosecutors and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the victim here,'' Penna said. ``My whole neighborhood is
too, and so is my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Penna says he spends his days mostly indoors, watching
television and collecting material for a book he wants to write,
not about his crime, but about the effects of the notification law
on his life. He fears walking the streets because he is still a
target of anger.
</P>
<P>
   About a week ago, when he was driving home, he stopped at a
traffic light to turn onto his street. ``A couple of kids were
standing on the corner drinking,'' he said. ``They yelled out,
`Child molester!' It hurts. Stupid kids. They're just wild. They
just want to start trouble. I just hope I don't get into more
trouble. I just play like I don't hear it and I go on my way. It's
not as bad as it was before.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, Penna acknowledges that his troubles began with
his original crime. ``The girls were hitchhiking,'' he said. ``We
picked them up, me and another fellow. They went home and told
their parents. They came home late and made up a story.'' He is
reminded that the girls were minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a lot younger then, too,'' he said. (He was in his early
30s.) ``I used to drink and do drugs, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not offer the explanation up as an excuse, necessarily,
and he is not adamant about denying any guilt. Mostly, he is just
weary of having to talk about it. ``It was a long time ago,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Penna knew earlier this year that the fliers were going to be
distributed. While he was convicted only once of rape charges _ he
also has a misdemeanor for lewdness on his record, he says _ he was
put on a list of high-risk sex offenders, arrived at through a
system that takes into account how close he lives to a school and
the age of the victims. He and a lawyer went to court to fight the
distribution of the flier, but they lost.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors who live near both Penna and Johnson, and the
parents of children who attend the school directly across the
street from Penna's house, say that although in general they
believe that the law is a good one, they think Penna has a right to
be left alone because he has never bothered anyone else, as far as
they know.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``To a point, a parent should know that he lives here,'' said
Susan Konig, who was picking up her son Stephen, 11, from the
school just in front of Penna's home. ``But it does not give
anybody the right to go to that person's house and try to kill
him.''
</P>
<P>
   One man, who refused to give his name, said he and his wife
would not let their son walk to school alone. ``I won't let him
walk because of that,'' referring to Penna's presence. ``Do I think
he'll molest again? No, I don't think so. But I still don't want my
son alone out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, people in this tidy neighborhood, where many have
religious icons or statues of animals on their lawns, are tired of
having to talk to strangers about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He served his time,'' said Luvada Hunter, who has lived down
the street from Penna for 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting in June made many neighbors aware, for the first
time, of what Penna had done. William Vargas lives next door, in a
house he bought from Penna's sister in May, not knowing that his
family would be living next door to a convicted rapist. Vargas has
three children, 1, 2 and 3 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas is friendly with Penna, and chats with him when they are
both outside in their small backyards, which are not separated by a
fence. ``It was so long ago,'' he said, wanting to defend his
neighbor. But he allows that before he leaves for work, ``I tell my
wife to watch our children carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of James Johnson's family, who is known as Jimmy, say
that Johnson, who shot at Penna's house only a few months after he
had finished serving time for an armed robbery, committed an
unconscionable act in a misguided effort to protect his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he should have did what he did,'' said Johnson's
grandfather, Luther Johnson, as he sat in a lawn chair on the
sidewalk outside James Johnson's house. ``He's just lacking
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a plea agreement, James Johnson pleaded guilty to two
second-degree weapons counts and to a fourth-degree count of
aggravated assault. Sentencing is scheduled for February, and under
the plea agreement, the Union County Prosecutor, Thomas V. Manahan,
will recommend that Johnson be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be out in a year and a half,'' Penna said bitterly.
``They were supposed to make an example out of him, and they're
doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Manahan said that because he had a previous conviction for
armed robbery, Johnson will be required to serve at least 85
percent of his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the parents and other residents wonder why Penna is
allowed to live so close to an elementary school. The law actually
has no power over where he lives, and Penna said he lives in the
house because it is the only place he can afford. His family still
owns it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm practically homeless,'' he said. ``My family helps me
out.'' He cannot get a job because of his criminal record, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is he a danger to the children at the school? ``No, that's no
problem,'' he said. ``I've been living here. It's never been a
problem. I even talk to the teachers _ well, I used to. Not now.
Now I avoid people. I'm living like a fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Penna is aware that many sociologists believe that child
molesters are not treatable and will go on to sexually abuse other
children. ``But that's not me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that a treatment center evaluated him when he was
in prison and concluded that he was not likely to commit such a
crime again. With that information, a prison board granted him
parole.
</P>
<P>
   Penna hopes that with time, the notoriety that the sex-offender
law brought him will die down to allow him to live a peaceful life.
For now, he said, he feels like a caged animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't move,'' he said. ``I'm trapped. I can't work. I have
no money and no income. I can't live. Maybe I should go back to
prison.''

 &HT;    Movies of the millennium reflect society's swing
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At age 25, Elizabeth Tudor has it all.
</P>
<P>
   A great job running a multinational operation. Statuesque good
looks and a wardrobe fit for a queen. Devoted staff. Cute
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   But when the boyfriend turns out to be married and one ally is
actually a backstabber, things suddenly don't seem quite so
perfect. Ultimately, Elizabeth decides, her personal life will have
to take a back seat to her professional responsibilities. She can't
have it all.
</P>
<P>
   Opening in theaters Friday, ``Elizabeth'' is the story of the
formidable woman who ruled Great Britain for 44 years, beginning in
1558. Yet it's probably more than a coincidence that the movie,
starring Cate Blanchett as Queen Elizabeth I, was made in 1998,
when films are focusing less on characters who have everything and
more on figures resigned to making _ and living with _ their
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the choices that we make,'' said Richard LaGravenese,
the Oscar-nominated screenwriter (``The Fisher King''), who wrote
and directed ``Living Out Loud,'' which opened last week. ``There
is great value in sacrifice, and when you want something and get
something, you have to give something else up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens to Judith (Holly Hunter) and Pat (Danny
DeVito), both of whom are personally lonely and professionally
adrift at the beginning of ``Living Out Loud.'' By the end of the
film, their lives are much fuller _ but not in the way riches have
been heaped on film characters in the past. Unlike Melanie Griffith
and Harrison Ford in the 1988 hit ``Working Girl,'' Hunter and
DeVito don't get to conquer Wall Street and find love with
impossibly good-looking, well-dressed mirror images of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the ultimate movie of this or almost any other
decade was actually the ultimate ``you can't have it all'' movie.
Few of the wealthy characters in ``Titanic'' ever lacked for
anything in life; but in the end, they must decide what or who is
important enough to go into the lifeboats with them. Some choose
not to go at all, including Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo
DiCaprio), for whom the certainty of love supersedes the
possibility of death.
</P>
<P>
   That Rose survives isn't all that surprising. This is Hollywood,
after all. Jack's death, much like Bruce Willis' at the end of
``Armageddon'' (unlike his late '80s ``Die Hard'' films, he can no
longer save both the planet and himself), is both tragic and highly
appealing to late '90s filmgoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something very sad and melancholy about our age,''
said Marshall Fishwick, a Virginia Tech professor who specializes
in popular culture and the topic of heroes, in partial explanation
of the phenomenal success of ``Titanic.'' ``I think we've
discovered that having it all isn't really having it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, close scrutiny of movies released over the past 18
months reveals just how far we've traveled from ``Wall Street'' or
any of the other places where ``Harry Met Sally'' or Ferris Bueller
took his day off in the go-go, self-absorbed late 1980s and early
1990s. In 1990, Julia Roberts could change from a hooker into
designer duds and a fairy-tale romance with the incredibly rich
Richard Gere in ``Pretty Woman.'' But in last year's ``My Best
Friend's Wedding,'' she couldn't have the man she thought she
loved, a man who would complement her great career and fabulously
supportive gay confidant (Rupert Everett).
</P>
<P>
   In 1987's ``Fatal Attraction,'' Michael Douglas got to keep his
glamorous publishing job and picture-perfect family following his
affair with Glenn Close, and even avoided jail for killing her. But
in last year's ``The Game,'' Douglas was a billionaire so bereft of
close relationships he accepted a rather bizarre birthday gift from
his estranged younger brother (Sean Penn) _ and nearly died as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990's ``Ghost,'' Patrick Swayze's angelic presence could
still love and protect his girlfriend (Demi Moore) after his death.
But last spring's surprise hit ``City of Angels'' told a much
different tale about an angel (Nicolas Cage) who comes to realize
he can't have it all. He must become human to experience love,
including love's pain when his girlfriend (Meg Ryan) dies.
</P>
<P>
   There's even an older movie back in theaters that focused on
people confronting _ and abandoning _ their fantasies of having it
all. First released in 1983, ``The Big Chill'' quickly became
synonymous with that self-absorbed decade. But in terms of
messages, it may fit in better with late-90s movies, according to
one of its stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a generation growing up and kind of having to come
to terms with its lost hopes and dreams,'' said Tom Berenger, who
was in his early 30s when he portrayed a ``Magnum P.I.''-esque TV
star spending a memorably soul-searching weekend with his college
friends. ``You have those when you are younger and then they sort
of get chipped away at. Every single one of those characters is
dealing with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what we're witnessing now onscreen may actually
represent a return to the more complex, character-driven themes
that preceded the late '80s school of filmmaking, which mostly
glorified big money and special effects. LaGravenese, 38, wrote the
script for the 1995 film ``The Bridges of Madison County,'' a book
some of his younger contemporaries despised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends of mine who had read it and were under 30 hated the
book because they didn't understand why she didn't go with him,''
LaGravenese said of the 1992 best seller in which an Iowa farm wife
who has an impassioned weekend affair with a photographer
ultimately decides not to run away with him. ``I said, `You have to
understand that in the mid-1960s (when the book takes place), you
weren't taught you can have it all (or) that whatever you feel,
whatever you want, you just go with it.' And personally, I don't
feel that kind of life works.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the kind of movie LaGravenese wrote does. ``The
Bridges of Madison County'' was a hit, earning Oscar nominations
for best picture and best actress (for Meryl Streep) and winning
much more critical acclaim than the rather treacly book.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech's Fishwick recently edited a book about pop
culture and the millennium, a milestone he says may contribute to
this need for soul-searching by filmmakers and audiences.
</P>
<P>
   While that's one possible explanation, there are others. One
theory holds that independent or smaller studios are more likely to
explore complex themes like ``you can't have it all'' than are the
big-budget, special-effects-laden productions of major Hollywood
studios. And, says Saul Zaentz, the producer whose multiple
Oscar-winning movies include ``The English Patient,'' ``Amadeus''
and ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' those smaller projects are
getting easier to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``The equipment is easier to get now, along with the financing,
and the work that results from it is excellent,'' said Zaentz,
adding that stars like Holly Hunter are increasingly willing to
make movies like ``Living Out Loud'' (which was produced by
DeVito's small Jersey Films) for the opportunity to play more
challenging and complex parts.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it just the people in front of the camera who gravitate
to such themes, according to LaGravenese.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a writer, dramatically, it's more interesting,''
LaGravenese explained. ``Writing about a character who has it all
and gets it all is just dull.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, like everything in Hollywood, this phase of filmmaking
will run its course quickly. Perhaps not. Berenger, for one,
suggests there is still more soul-searching and weighty work to
come _ particularly as baby boomer filmmakers continue to age and
accrue power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previous to `Big Chill,'' I thought the generational movie was
`The Graduate.' I remember thinking at the time (of making ``The
Big Chill''), maybe it sort of put bookends on that generation,''
Berenger said. ``It's possible there could be a third one coming
that would put `The Big Chill' in the middle. We might not be done
with all this yet.''

 &HT;    If the role doesn't scare him, Norton doesn't want it
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Norton doesn't take easy parts: An angelic choirboy with
a split personality in ``Primal Fear,'' or the hapless attorney
trying to represent the one-man porn circus in ``The People Vs.
Larry Flynt.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new film, ``American History X,'' which opened Friday,
Norton pulled a De Niro, gaining 25 pounds of muscle to play a Los
Angeles skinhead who learns the hard way that hatred is a no-exit.
``It was important for this guy to be, on many levels, larger than
life,'' Norton said recently by phone, taking a break from ``The
Fight Club,'' director David Fincher's (``Seven'') action-drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``What keeps this compulsion (to act) invigorating for me is
working on something that feels like an entirely new experience,''
he says of his decision to play a skinhead. ``If I find a script I
like but can think of five other people who could fill the part,
it's less interesting to me than if I find something that scares me
a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The script for ``American History X'' fit the bill. ``When I
read it, what struck me is that it functioned like a classic
tragedy, in the sense of its being a kind of drama that had a
lesson for the audience through the fall of a character,'' he says.
``You don't often see people write direct tragedies anymore. This
had the classic structure of a character who is seen heroically by
people around him, who lets a flaw dominate him _ in this case, his
rage _ and then comes to an understanding too late.''
</P>
<P>
   If the structure is classic, the subject of hate crimes is all
too contemporary. ``When we were doing it, but even more so since
we've done it, that has been such a disturbingly frequent part of
our landscape,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all this Matthew Shepard (the gay student killed in
Wyoming last month) stuff, it seems even more appropriate to try to
tackle some of the emotional dynamics and complexities that are
behind something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Norton doesn't want the movie to preach to the converted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck me that for those of us in that camp, the thing we
do is try to lazily dismiss the people who (commit hate crimes) as
aberrations,'' he says. ``It's more disturbing but also more
important to try to come to grips with the real, human complexities
of these people. Dismissing them as people who were born evil is
too easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said to me, `What's the solution to all this stuff?'
But I don't think that's what we're there to do. We're not
sociologists; we're dramatists. The storytellers' and actors'
capability is to just illuminate complexities and emotional
dynamics.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how deeply Norton seems to immerse himself in his
roles, he doesn't go home with the character. ``When you do
something like this, the tattoos come off at the end of the day,''
he says. ``You throw on a baseball cap and go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, we filmed in Los Angeles, and there's plenty of
people in the city with shaved heads who aren't skinheads.''

 &HT;    Age is no barrier to travel _ not when the pace is tranquil and
you have your two sons to help
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paris _ In the autumn of their years, my parents decided they
wanted to spend one more spring in this eternal city.
</P>
<P>
   It had been 13 years since they last visited. But, now in their
mid-70s, Arthur Sr. and Ophelia aren't the nimble golden-agers they
once were and didn't feel comfortable traveling so far by
themselves. They said they would go only if I went with them.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the invisible continuum that marks the passage
of our lives, my parents and I had traded places. Though they are
still self-sufficient and in control of their lives, the son now
would help watch over them. Lend a steadying hand when needed.
Offer fresher eyes, a stronger back and firmer legs. Just like they
had for me a long time ago. Just like my children, now 11 and 15
years old, have started to do for my wife, Leslie, and me. One
circle completed, and another begun.
</P>
<P>
   It was my parents who had shown me the world at an early age.
One of my warmest memories as a preschooler is waking up in the
back seat of our car late at night to the crunch of the stone
driveway as we pulled into my grandparents' cottage in the Cuban
countryside for long weekend retreats.
</P>
<P>
   After my younger brother, Alex, was born and we immigrated to
Ohio, we often traveled to New York, once visiting the 1964 World's
Fair. Twenty years ago, I took my first trip to Europe with my dad.
By then, though he was in charge, I helped him navigate the
labyrinthine subway system of Madrid, leading us back to our hotel
during one complicated sojourn. The circle was starting to take
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on this trip, I would reaffirm what my parents had known
all along and what my wife and I have subscribed to with our
children: Traveling with just about anyone is possible as long as
you remain flexible and tailor your schedule to the needs of those
with the greatest requirements. Don't feel bound to follow a set
timetable. Relish winging it.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the City of Light, I would learn some things that maybe
more tourists should try. Walk slowly. Wait at street corners. Take
pleasure from the quality of what you see, not the quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the tranquil pace, we also downsized. We picked one
major destination for each day, and enjoyed the getting there and
the coming back almost as much as the site itself.
</P>
<P>
   But these lessons are clear now in hindsight. Before the four of
us left _ my brother would be joining us as well _ I had no idea
what to expect. Could my mom's arthritic knees handle the stress?
Would my dad, who has had colon surgery twice and was hospitalized
last year for intestinal problems, be able to handle a strange
diet? What would I do if they fell ill or got injured?
</P>
<P>
   My parents had the right attitude, though. Life's too short not
to grab whatever you can while you're still able.
</P>
<P>
   So we found ourselves one day last spring waiting to catch a
flight from Miami, where my folks live, to a New York connection
and on to Paris. My aid came in handy almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   When we got to the security check-in point at the Miami airport,
the guard asked for our plane tickets. My dad couldn't find his. In
fact, he didn't have his travel bag. My mom, in a wheelchair, and
my brother were allowed to pass through a side gate. My father and
I jogged back to where my parents had been sitting. We were
relieved to find his bag leaning against a column, right where he
had set it down.
</P>
<P>
   The flight to Paris was uneventful, with nobody getting much
sleep. We left New York around 6 p.m. and watched the sun dropping
into the western horizon as we winged to the east. In a mere six
hours we would meet the sun again on the other side of the world.
</P>
<P>
   We encountered our next challenge shortly after arriving in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The moving sidewalk at Charles DeGaulle Airport, which takes
passengers from the airplanes directly to customs, proved
troublesome for my mom's weak knees and ankles swollen from hours
of sitting. In the States, she is accustomed to asking for a
wheelchair the minute she gets off the plane. In all the
excitement, we neglected to request one from the flight crew before
deboarding and couldn't find one afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Although I was toting her carry-on bag, she nearly fell when she
had to step off the escalator. The 45-minute wait in line to have
our passports validated also was a strain. I wished there was
something I could do but just stood there helplessly with her. Even
more so, I felt frustrated that the human body could betray so.
Just six years ago, she was navigating steps and stairs with ease.
</P>
<P>
   After collecting our luggage, we walked _ slowly _ to a bus that
would take us to Montparnasse, near our hotel. But climbing the bus
stairs proved more than my mother could handle, and she fell.
Nothing was hurt but her pride, but I remember thinking this could
turn out to be a long _ and maybe unpleasant or even dangerous _
six days for her. Fortunately, I was wrong. Climbing and descending
literally hundreds of steps atsubway stations and buses and
buildings, she stumbled a few times but never fell again.
</P>
<P>
   The bus dropped us off about five long blocks from the hotel,
and we decided to load all our luggage and my parents into a cab
while my brother and I hoofed it. There's no way that the four of
us and our suitcases could have fit into the small car.
</P>
<P>
   My parents were already at the quaint-but-modern Hotel Daguerre
by the time my brother and I arrived. The taxi driver was gone.
Luckily for us, he was honest. My father had left his video camera
on the back seat, and we weren't aware of it until the cabbie
returned it about an hour later. I made a mental note to try to
keep better track of our belongings.
</P>
<P>
   She told me she was happy
</P>
<P>
   That first day was mostly lost. After breakfast, the rest of my
family went to their rooms while I explored our new neighborhood.
When I got back, my mother and I sat in the lobby and she told me
how happy she was that the four of us were together again. It had
been 30 years since we had traveled as a foursome.
</P>
<P>
   I napped briefly that afternoon. Nobody felt guilty. Nobody felt
pressured. The rest of Paris would still be there tomorrow, and so
would we.
</P>
<P>
   After the bus incident, I tried to rent my mother a wheelchair,
but the hotel manager looked at me like I was fou _ crazy _ when I
asked her where I could obtain one. My mother, wanting to travel
light, also had left her cane (which she loathes) in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   We discovered a grocery store and a rotisserie chicken
restaurant about six blocks from our hotel, so my dad's meals, at
least for the first day, were taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   On our second day, feeling better rested despite the six-hour
time difference, we set out to see Paris. My parents decided that a
two-hour guided bus tour was the easiest way. Yes, it was touristy.
But for someone who has trouble walking, it was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   We obtained directions, walked the three blocks to the nearest
subway station, made a transfer at another Metro station and
arrived at the tour bus company in Paris' central district, across
the rue de Rivoli from the Louvre. My mother moved with some
difficulty, but we got there.
</P>
<P>
   After the tour, we ate at a nearby cafeteria, a good choice for
my father's picky stomach because he could see exactly what he was
ordering.
</P>
<P>
   Apres lunch, we did some souvenir shopping and retraced our
subway route back to the hotel. Then, my brother and I walked a few
blocks to a sidewalk cafe, where we ordered some libations and
whiled away the evening watching and observing and watching some
more.
</P>
<P>
   Upon our return, I found out my father had some minor intestinal
problems. I gave him some over-the-counter medicine, which seemed
to help. We had some anxious moments, but he was ready to go by
late the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerability of life
</P>
<P>
   We had seen a good slice of Paris by bus the day before, so my
parents decided we should see more by boat on the River Seine. Once
again, we took the subway, this time catching connections to the
Place de L'Alma.
</P>
<P>
   If the name sounds familiar, it's because the tunnel in which
Princess Diana crashed last year crosses under it. On a sidewalk at
the Place, within sight of the Seine and the Eiffel Tower, stands a
sculpture of a flame. The base of the sculpture was covered with
handwritten messages to Diana.
</P>
<P>
   My parents were touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a shame,'' my mother said, ``that someone so young and
beautiful had to die in such a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the skies threatened rain at any minute, we opted to
sit topside on the Bateaux Mouches for our 90-minute boat tour.
Halfway through the trip, though, we had to scurry inside to avoid
the drizzle and cold wind. The window-side heaters offered a
much-welcomed defrosting.
</P>
<P>
   After our ride and fortified by lunch, we felt adventurous
enough to walk quite a few blocks to the Eiffel Tower, on the other
side of the Seine. There were long lines to catch the elevators to
the top, so we decided to go see the Arc de Triomphe.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of subway rides later, we found ourselves at the Avenue
des Champs Elysees, one of the world's widest, wildest and busiest
streets. The traffic is so heavy that pedestrians must take tunnels
to cross the 11 streets that meet like spokes at the hub of the Arc
de Triomphe. It sits on an island _ solid and towering amid the
swirling confusion.
</P>
<P>
   I did not know until we got there that you can walk up to the
top of the arc for a fee. There are no elevators.
</P>
<P>
   ``You two go up,'' my dad said. ``We're too tired. We'll wait
for you on this bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they looked exhausted, and I felt for them.
</P>
<P>
   The monument offered a splendid 360-degree view of the city, and
we were rewarded with a small military parade that made its way
several blocks down the Champs Elysees, which had been blocked off,
to the base of the arc. It was the nightly ceremony for the French
unknown soldier, an unexpected treat.
</P>
<P>
   We were one exhausted platoon of four as we climbed back on the
subway a while later for the long ride back to our hotel. I was
impressed that my parents, particularly my mother, could handle so
much in one day. They're still troupers, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, a Sunday, we combined devotion with
sightseeing and attended Mass at Notre Dame. We picked up the No.
38 bus about five blocks from the hotel and it dropped us off a
couple of blocks from the cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The Mass was in French, and though I tried to follow along as
best I could, I still had plenty of time to let my mind and eyes
wander through the grand vastness of Notre Dame. It is easy to
understand how such an imposing structure _ with its huge stone
pillars and arches and its colorful stained-glass windows _
symbolized to a simple medieval society the majesty of God and the
power of the church as an institution.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, my parents drank $4 cups of coffee at a sidewalk cafe
across the street while my brother and I stood in line for an hour
so we could make the lung-busting climb up the well-worn stone
stairs to the cathedral towers.
</P>
<P>
   We caught our breath high above the city on the overview walkway
between the cathedral's two towers, guarded by the statues of
gargoyles and angels that are well-known to anyone who has seen the
classic ``Hunchback of Notre Dame'' movie. Below us snaked the
Seine, and the Eiffel Tower stood sentry in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, we climbed the second tower to the belfry,
where we saw the famous bell. I half expected to bump into
Quasimodo at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   Back on solid ground, we grabbed a quick lunch, then got down to
the serious business of buying souvenirs for family and friends
back home. A side street off the cathedral offered rows of stores,
and I discovered much too late that prices for the same items
dropped the farther we got from Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   A painful test of endurance
</P>
<P>
   We were all pretty tired and frazzled by Monday, our last full
day in Paris. My mother could barely walk by now, and a three-block
hike from a subway station to Les Invalides, where Napoleon is
buried, turned into a painful test of endurance.
</P>
<P>
   The return to the subway was even more agonizing. Then, it
started to sprinkle. I felt the now-familiar sense of helplessness.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, my parents and brother caught the No. 38 bus back
to the hotel. I set off on my own, visiting a few stores and
knocking about the Louvre gardens and palace.
</P>
<P>
   My legs felt as if I'd run a marathon by the time I returned to
the hotel. As I lay in bed and thought about the trip and what we'd
accomplished, a slight sense of sadness washed over me. I missed my
wife and kids. But I also missed the parents of my youth.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallway of our house in Canton, my wife has hung a couple
of photo montages of our children when they were babies. She and I
are in some of the pictures. So are her late mother and my parents.
I often stand there and study the photos in nostalgic disbelief,
not only because the kids have grown so quickly (did I really use
to hold them in one arm?), but also because of those
younger-looking people in whose house I once lived.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, while we're not looking, time catches us.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Rome?
</P>
<P>
   Our time in Paris caught up with us, too, and we were soon
riding a cab to the airport, where we were inexplicably made to
wait about 30 minutes for a wheelchair to take my mother to the
gate.
</P>
<P>
   Before boarding, I took inventory. My father had been suffering
from intestinal discomfort. My mother was in pain and appeared
weary. I asked them if they had enjoyed themselves nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' my mother said. ``Next year, let's go to Rome. We've
never been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, in my 46th summer, I'm bringing my son, 30 years my
junior. In addition to our regular family vacations, Trevor and I
have already spent considerable time alone on the road _ a handful
of trips to Miami, three days canoeing the Suwannee River, dozens
of miles backpacking in the North Georgia mountains.
</P>
<P>
   When he's gone off to college, my 11-year-old daughter, Alyson,
will have to pick up the slack. She's already accompanied me on a
solo trip to Miami and backpacking on the Appalachian Trail. But we
still have miles to go.
</P>
<P>
   Her circle has barely begun.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1998
 &HT;    On 60 acres of sand, America's history told in microcosm
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many white Americans, the central fact of the inner city is
that it is black. It might also be run-down and a place you don't
wish to be at night, but what defines it and determines our
perception of it is race.
</P>
<P>
   It's for that very reason that other Americans would define it
differently and perceive it differently, just as they would the
larger American experience. For many of these Americans, the inner
city might not, in fact, be black enough. It depends on whether
you're the stranger, set apart at a glance, or a part of the crowd,
secure in a skin-deep homogeneity. The white person who has walked
into a black bar gets the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Mutuality of color can be more imaginary than real, but
perception sometimes overrides all else. If it's true that some
white Americans would prefer to see a downtown empty of all blacks,
it's equally true _ perhaps more true _ that some blacks could live
happily if they never saw a white face again. There once were
places where they could do just that, places where blacks were not
only the majority but the entirety.
</P>
<P>
   `Recreation without humiliation'
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the handful of black townships in America tells an
untold story of our racial duality. Outside the South, most
Americans have no awareness of their existence; within the South,
they are forgotten enclaves. Eatonville, Fla., the oldest
incorporated black township in the country, is one such place, and
American Beach, Fla., another.
</P>
<P>
   American Beach was never incorporated and today exists as much
in the past as in the present. On its northern flank, Summer Beach,
with a Ritz-Carlton Hotel as anchor, grows with new condominiums
every year; on its southern flank is Amelia Island Plantation and
its million-dollar homes. It wasn't always so, as Russ Rymer
affectingly writes in ``American Beach: A Saga of Race, Wealth and
Memory'' (HarperCollins, $25), a book that is at once reportage and
personal pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in the 1930s by, among others, the country's first black
millionaire, a Jacksonville insurance man named Abraham Lincoln
Lewis, American Beach was 200 acres on Amelia Island where black
children built sand castles and their parents found seaside escape
during the days of segregation. Here, across a sleeve of
intracoastal waterway from Fernandina Beach, ``blacks could enjoy,
in the phrase in use in its advertisements ... `recreation and
relaxation without humiliation.'''
</P>
<P>
   In time, when beaches were integrated along with restaurants and
schools, American Beach became an anachronism _ no longer what it
was, more than half its original acreage sold to developers eager
to privatize every square inch of sand on Amelia Island. Today only
60 acres remain, and the full-time population has dwindled to about
150. But for those who remain, like MaVynee Betsch, Lewis'
great-grand-
</P>
<P>
   daughter and unofficial town mayor, it is a repository of black
culture and all the more precious for its tenuous hold on the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Rymer's rendering of this extravagant character known as the
Beach Lady _ ``a 6-foot-tall, sixtyish black woman dressed in
flip-flops and layers of felt, with 18-inch fingernails and an
eight-foot-long fall of hair festooned with political buttons,
trained down her back, carried in a ball at her waist, and coifed
into a foot-high cock's comb atop her head'' _ is a masterpiece of
portraiture. Yet, for all its brilliance, it is incidental to his
real concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Rymer, a Los Angeles writer and author of the acclaimed ``Genie:
A Scientific Tragedy,'' came upon American Beach 20 years ago while
on a magazine assignment and has returned there, psychologically
and physically, ever since. ``A nosy white journalist,'' as he
describes himself, he was drawn to Amelia Island and to the stretch
of sand that is American Beach because he saw there our common
history in microcosm: two races bound to each other and yet wanting
nothing more than to part ways. And, with this, he saw something
else: the memory of the past, the cultural groundwater that
sustains our knowledge of who we are as a people, continually at
risk of being buried by the bulldozers of economic Progress.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing private fault lines
</P>
<P>
   The three stories that make up this elegantly written book are
not always a comfortable assemblage. But at their heart is a
passion for delineating the fissures in American life. They are not
the public ones of politics, but the private and unseen ones. Being
private, as Rymer writes, they run deeper, the fault lines of ``an
America built by two races of people who imagined they were opposed
either over their differences or over the question of whether or
not they were different. They were opposed, though neither lived in
a culture the other had not helped to build, though they both were
fervent about the same dignity and liberty, and though they were
united in the danger their children would face in the world they
had helped to create.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexis de Tocqueville, more than a century and a half ago, wrote
of two peoples who could neither entirely separate nor fully
commingle. On Amelia Island, far from cities where most would say
the racial divide is clearest, Russ Rymer has traced the imprint of
our chancy, fitful togetherness. In doing so, he pays homage to a
sanctuary where one race sought not just relaxation but respite
from the other.

COMMENTARY: FROM STREETS, A DEFENDER OF METHADONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The bar wasn't on Felix Lopez's mind when he was at
Yale Law School. The kitchen was. He so loved cooking that he
traded torts for tarts in 1980. He left law school, enrolled in the
French Culinary Institute and became a chef at Manhattan
restaurants like Memphis and La Tulipe. By 1990, he was the chef to
a United Nations ambassador, whipping up budget-busting banquets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself feeding wonderfully refined food to people who
were too rich and overindulged,'' he said. ``I decided I had to do
something more useful with my life. So I returned to law school.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez got his degree and landed in 1992 at the Legal Action
Center, a public-interest group that represents recovering addicts,
people with HIV and former criminals. He has just been named the
director of the center's Arthur Liman Policy Institute, which will
analyze policy initiatives on addiction and criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   It also honors the memory of Liman, a legal strategist who not
only defended corporate scoundrels but also investigated events
like the Attica prison uprising and the Iran-Contra affair. From
the center's founding in 1972 until his death last year, he was its
hands-on chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy devoted a substantial part of his life to helping
individuals from almost a parallel universe,'' said Lopez, 49. ``He
didn't do it out of noblesse oblige. He looked at them and saw
people who were fellow citizens in need of help.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez comes from that parallel universe. He was born to a
teen-age mother and raised by his grandmother in El Barrio, where
he saw his friends get hooked on heroin. The deadly soup cooked up
in the bowl of a spoon was everywhere. Resentful of the fate he saw
creeping around him in the housing projects, he devised an escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I burned my girlfriend's father's car and three days later I
confessed to it,'' he said. ``That was the only way I could see to
get out of the block when I was 15 and living among that kind of
pathology and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a series of serendipitous events that kicked off a
legal career. He was sent to a juvenile home, which led to an Army
tour in Vietnam. He worked in a factory, and though he never
graduated from high school, he talked his way into the University
of Michigan. He went on to law school, his savory sabbatical and
his ultimate return to the law.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the last six years defending the rights of those
who lost jobs or housing because of AIDS or arrest records, Lopez
said he hoped to tackle the underlying policy issues that lawyers
in the trenches don't have the time to address. One of his early
goals is to defend the merits of methadone treatment in light of
recent criticisms by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Methadone is controversial all over the country,'' Lopez said.
``The mayor regards it as something immoral or unhealthy. But
that's not the way to approach it. And it's beside the point. When
talking about public policy, immorality should not be where we
start the discussion. What can we do to save a life? What is best
for all of us?''
</P>
<P>
   Some East Harlem street corners seemed like home to generations
of addicts, he said: ``When I visit my grandmother, I'm appalled by
the suffering I see on the street. They're not working. They're
addicted, latent prisoners. Just ready to go to jail. We have not
done the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Paul Samuels, the center's president, said that too many
policy-makers cast the debate on drug treatment in moralistic terms
that would never be applied to a discussion of a medical condition
like depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would they prefer that somebody like that tough it out?''
Samuels asked. ``We helped with Senate hearings earlier this year
and brought Buzz Aldrin,'' who talked about his alcoholism. ``He
said, `You know, I went to the moon. This is not about willpower,
courage or strength. I got plenty of that. This is about an
illness.'''
</P>
<P>
   The message that addiction spans even parallel universes is a
theme that Lopez hopes to emphasize as the policy institute is
inaugurated next Tuesday at a Manhattan benefit. The institute will
honor Bill Moyers and his family for producing a television
documentary showing the effects of addiction on his family.
</P>
<P>
   The meal should be enjoyable, too. Lopez was of counsel to the
chef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, they ran the menu by me,'' he said. ``Someone
suggested I cater the event. But I'm easier to get as a lawyer than
I am as a cook.''

PEPPERDINE SEES NCAA BID
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ There is an element of naivete in any coach
challenged with rebuilding a program. There's a belief the
resurrection will come quickly, move smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   When Lorenzo Romar left the comfort of the UCLA bench following
the 1995-96 season, he mapped out a three-year course to pull
Pepperdine from wretched, past respectability and into prominence
once again.
</P>
<P>
   The first two are complete.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves have another seven weeks before they open their West
Coast Conference schedule and begin what they hope will be a
journey back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   But today's season opener against Santa Barbara marks the start
of a different type of assault. They want a national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have,'' senior point guard Jelani Gardner said, ``the
potential to beat one of the top caliber teams in the country and
be one of the elite teams.''
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious nonconference schedule has Pepperdine hosting
Fresno State and Rhode Island, traveling to Wisconsin, playing
Kansas in Anaheim and meeting Michigan State at the Pearl Harbor
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   When Romar arrived on nature's most splendid campus, such a
schedule was ridiculous. In a year of going 6-21, Pepperdine wasn't
even safe against Weber State and Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   Integrating his system took time. Romar shunned immediate
gratification in the name of developing depth, so he redshirted a
few players.
</P>
<P>
   It translated into a 17-10 mark last season and a second-place
finish in the WCC, tempered by an overtime loss to last-place
Loyola Marymount. Pepperdine finished a game behind league-leader
Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with our progress,'' Romar said. ``We didn't
realize how far we had to come, and we have not reached it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but the Waves are close, and Romar points to three reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _He made sure there was discipline in the program;
</P>
<P>
   _He raised recruiting standards. Junior guard Tezale Archie is
the only player not recruited by Romar or his staff.
</P>
<P>
   _He made sure players understood the system. Not only the
offense and defense, but also what was expected during the
offseason _ conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The skeleton outline has turned around the fortunes of the WCC's
most dominant team since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAAs, that's the goal,'' Romar said. ``From where we've
come from in terms of where we need to go, a lot of things have to
come together in a hurry.''

ROMAN CYCOWSKI, 97, VOCAL SEXTET MEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roman Cycowski, the last surviving member of the Comedian
Harmonists, a legendary German vocal sextet that was forced to
break up by the Nazis because three of its members were Jewish,
died on Wednesday at his home in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Cycowski had been cantor at the Temple Isaiah in Palm Springs
for several decades and at the time of his death was still singing
there regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The Comedian Harmonists were formed in 1927 by Harry Frommerman
and aspired to be the German answer to a popular American singing
group called the Revelers.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, the group enjoyed enormous popularity, until
the Nazis forced them to disperse. The group sang everything from
German folk songs to ``Tea for Two'' to Duke Ellington to the work
of classical composers like Brahms and Rossini.
</P>
<P>
   One of their special skills was the ability to imitate musical
instruments so accurately that when they sang from behind a
curtain, audiences could easily mistake them for an actual chamber
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Cycowski, who was born in Lodz, Poland, was trained as a cantor
and moved to Germany in 1921 to become an opera singer. When he
joined the Comedian Harmonists six years later, he viewed it as a
temporary sidetrack to his operatic career.
</P>
<P>
   One of the group's three lead singers, he was the only one who
was operatically trained. His specialties included ``The Blue
Danube,'' a comic number from ``The Barber of Seville'' and a
number of folk songs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, when the group was forced to break up, he and its two
other Jewish members formed the Comedy Harmonists in Vienna. The
group toured all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually settled in San Francisco, where he served for 15
years as cantor at Beth Israel Temple before moving to Palm
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The Comedian Harmonists are the subject of an acclaimed
three-hour documentary by Eberhard Fechner, filmed in the mid-1970s
and first shown in the United States in 1991, that weaves together
first-person accounts of the group's then-surviving members and
their wives.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, their story has been made into a feature film,
``The Harmonists,'' to be released by Miramax early next year.
Barry Manilow has also written a musical, ``Harmony,'' based on the
group's story.
</P>
<P>
   A musical play, ``Band in Berlin,'' by Susan Feldman, based on
extensive interviews with Cykowski, is also expected to open on
Broadway early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Cycowski is survived by his wife, Mary, to whom he was married
for more than 60 years.

TIGER KILLS OWNER, SIX WEEKS AFTER KILLING TRAINER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ALACHUA, Fla. _ Six weeks after killing the trainer who raised
it from a cub, a 400-pound white Bengal tiger on Friday mauled and
killed one of its owners, a woman who had insisted that the tiger
wasn't vicious.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Guay was leading Jupiter, a 3-year-old tiger, back to its
pen Friday evening when the cat lunged unexpectedly and bit her in
the neck. She is believed to have died immediately. On Oct. 8, the
same cat killed its trainer, Charles Edward Lizza, 34, with a bite
to the neck. Authorities classified the October death as a ``freak
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The cat was gunned down Friday night by sheriff's deputies 15
feet from where it killed Lizza.
</P>
<P>
   Lizza had been described by Ms. Guay's husband, Ron Guay, as the
son he never had. Ron Guay was steps away during both attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Doris and Ron Guay, who had been childhood friends, began
performing as Ron and Joy Holiday in the 1950s. They traveled
around the world exhibiting their exotic cats, but always returned
to their Cat Dancers Ranch, in north-central Florida between
Alachua and Newberry, to rehearse and train.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, at about 5:45 p.m., the couple were moving their big
cats from outdoor day cages into a trailer used as a night kennel
and as transportation to shows. Five of the six cats had been put
into their individual cages in the trailer; Jupiter was next.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Guay began to hand-feed chicken necks to the tiger when,
without warning, it lunged and bit into her neck, according to the
account given by Ron Guay. The attack was a total surprise, said
Guay, who immediately called 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a completely unprovoked attack,'' said Alachua County
Sheriff's Office Sgt. Jim Troiano. ``It was an accident. These were
isolated incidents. Isolated to this residence.''
</P>
<P>
   When paramedics and sheriff's deputies arrived, the tiger was
pacing between the back of the trailer and its day cage, preventing
emergency workers from reaching Doris Guay's body. It was then that
Ron Guay gave deputies permission to kill the animal, which was
spared after the first attack following reassurances by some
members of Lizza's family.
</P>
<P>
   After that attack, Capt. B.L. Cook of the Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission advised deputies that if they ever needed to
destroy a big cat, they should use multiple shots from a .308 rifle
and a .223 rifle.
</P>
<P>
   From outside the 8-foot chain-link that surrounds the animals'
quarters, marksmen from the Alachua County Sheriff's Office SWAT
Team approached the compound and fired three shots, two at the
tiger's head and one at the neck. The animal dropped lifeless on
its right side after the first shot, but to ensure the safety of
deputies and paramedics entering the compound, two more rounds were
fired into the animal, Troiano said.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics said Doris Guay probably died instantly. Her body was
taken to the medical examiner's office in Gainesville for an
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter's body was turned over to the Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission, and was taken to the University of Florida by Alachua
County Animal Control. A necropsy could be performed Monday.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shannon Robinson, who lives a couple of houses down the street
from the Guays, remembers first meeting them two years ago.
Robinson had just moved in and the Guays came over to introduce
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really nice people. ... I'm really shocked that this
happened,'' Robinson said late Friday. Robinson also said he is not
concerned for his own safety after the recent incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fenced up,'' he said, adding that stray dogs in the
area bother him more than the tigers. ``Before these past couple
months there's never been any problems that we've heard.''
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Troiano, two members of the Trauma Team of the
Crisis Stabilization Unit went into the house to help Ron Guay cope
with this tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Guays began training exotic animals about 25 years ago. In
an interview with The Sun last month, the pair described their
decision to start working with big cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had never trained anything other than a toy poodle by
then,'' Doris Guay said. But Ron had a vivid dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dreamed that I was a trainer,'' he said last month, ``and
she was a black panther and we would dance and then in the cage
would be a real panther.''

YANKEES SEE THE CENTER-FIELD POOL SHRINK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Within two days last week, the Los Angeles Dodgers, Boston Red
Sox and Colorado Rockies all signed center fielders, and the New
York Yankees were well aware of the implication of the spree: There
are very few quality center fielders available.
</P>
<P>
   Like a team that is losing in a game of musical chairs, the
Yankees find themselves standing without a center fielder. They
have few attractive options.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which determined two days ago that re-signing Mo Vaughn
is highly unlikely, spent big money elsewhere Friday, signing the
free-agent second baseman Jose Offerman to a four-year, $26 million
deal. Offerman presumably will bat leadoff, ahead of John Valentin
and Nomar Garciaparra and perhaps Albert Belle, who is being wooed
by the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In the strongest indication to date of how valuable pitching is
in this era, the Dodgers signed the free-agent middle reliever Alan
Mills to a three-year, $6.5 million contract, a sum that shocked
executives with other teams. Cleveland traded the right-handed
pitcher Chad Ogea to Philadelphia for pitcher Jerry Spradlin.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, met with the owner
George Steinbrenner, and they may have reviewed their center-field
options.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees could give Bernie Williams, now a free agent, the
long and lucrative contract that he is looking for _ Williams'
agent, Scott Boras, has mentioned the figure of $100 million. But
to do so, the Yankees may have to pay Williams anywhere from 40
percent to 50 percent more than they would like to, and so far they
have not seemed inclined to do that.
</P>
<P>
   It could be, too, that the Yankees are waiting for the market on
Williams to settle. In the last week, it appears the number of
teams interested in acquiring Williams is dwindling: The Dodgers
and Rockies each acquired a center fielder, and the Texas Rangers
have made it known that they do not want to pay big bucks to anyone
until they agree to a new deal with the slugger Juan Gonzalez, who
can be a free agent after next season.
</P>
<P>
   Williams met with officials from the Arizona Diamondbacks on
Wednesday and will meet with the Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles next
week. But if the Red Sox sign Belle instead _ and they are
currently negotiating with the petulant All-Star _ their offer to
Williams could be diminished, and in any event, it seems unlikely
they would offer more to Williams than they did to Mo Vaughn (five
years, $63 million), the Boston first baseman who seems to be
headed to the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles need Williams, but in the recent past, the Baltimore
owner Peter Angelos has said he does not want to pay eight-figure
salaries to anyone. Meeting Williams' demands would require Angelos
to pay the center fielder approximately twice as much as Mike
Mussina, the team's highest-paid player. It may be that if Williams
cannot get the type of deal he wants from another team _ for
example, Arizona _ the Yankees will be in the running.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will play host to the free-agent center fielder
Brian Jordan next Wednesday at Yankee Stadium. Jordan is coming off
a good year in which he batted .316 with 25 home runs and 91 RBIs
for the St. Louis Cardinals. But he is drawing strong interest from
the Atlanta Braves, as well as interest from the Orioles and the
Mets, and it may be that the Yankees would have to pay Jordan
something in the range of $8 million to $9 million per season, or
about as much as they paid Williams ($8.25 million) this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 31, is not a pure center fielder, either, mostly playing
in right in recent years because of the presence of Ray Lankford.
And Jordan, a former National Football League player, has a history
of injuries that could make a four- or five-year deal somewhat
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees could sign Steve Finley, a free agent who has played
with San Diego the past four years. Finley, however, is a
left-handed hitter _ the Yankees' lineup is already loaded with
left-handed hitters _ and his performance has been erratic. When
the Yankees started Andy Pettitte in Game 4 of the World Series,
San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy opted to start the young outfielder
Ruben Rivera in place of Finley. The Yankees have been in contact
with Finley's agent, Tommy Tanzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees might attempt to trade for Rondell White of the
Montreal Expos, a right-handed hitter who has asked the Expos to
deal him to the Yankees; he is signed through the 2000 season, with
a modest $4 million option for 2001. He is a perfect fit. But the
Expos would have to be ready to trade him, and there is no sign
that that is about to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman, who would not comment on any of these players on
Friday, is most likely exploring other trade possibilities as well,
for Lankford or Rivera. In desperation, the Yankees could decide to
start Ricky Ledee in center field and then try to acquire a center
fielder before the July 31 trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman acknowledged that he was in contact with the agent for
pitcher Randy Johnson and spoke with Belle's agent Thursday.
``We're talking,'' Cashman said. ``We're doing a lot of talking.
We're being aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell if aggressiveness will yield the type of center
fielder they need, or if the Yankees will be left standing, without
a serviceable center fielder to lean on.

 &HT;    Remembering Mitch's real price
 &HT;    EDs: Optional trim included for non-Florida/Texas newspapers
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The cost of fresh produce prompts lots
of comments as shoppers circle the fruit and vegetable bins in the
supermarket. Last week, a female customer groused that because of
Hurricane Mitch, we can expect food from Central America to cost
even more. She jokingly asked whether anyone knew how to store ripe
bananas for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a year won't be long enough to restore the normal
flow of products that make our lives so comfortable. These
countries lagged behind the rest of the world before Mitch struck.
Now, they face problems that will set them decades further back.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit were Nicaragua and Honduras, after Haiti the two
poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. At least five
Nicaraguan villages were destroyed when Mitch's torrential rain
caused a lake in the crater of the Casita volcano to burst through
the wall of the cone, sending an avalanche of mud down on the
people below. Believing the worst had passed, villagers mistakenly
thought the roar of the mudslide _ that would cover 30 square miles
_ was the sound of helicopters bringing aid.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate in Nicaragua: 2,300 people dead, nearly 1,000
missing, 420,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch hovered over Honduras, dumping rain for more than 24
hours. Floods were the worst in 200 years. The rapidly rising and
swiftly flowing waters left people stranded in trees, clinging to
rooftops, isolated on small islands.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate in Honduras: 7,000 dead, 10,000 missing, 550,000
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Costa Rica were hit less
hard. Still, 500 are estimated dead. We do not know the exact
number of people missing or homeless because so many of the areas
in those poor countries are remote. We do know, however, that
crops, from bananas to coffee, were ruined, and it is not certain
when new planting can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch's killing fields are more devastating than all the civil
wars in the region. The people who survived are not much better off
than the dead whose bodies litter the landscape. The people there
are not allowed the solace of mourning for their loved ones, as
rotting corpses must be buried without ceremony or burned quickly
to prevent disease. The survivors, many with critical injuries or
life-threatening infections, remain stunned and confused by the
enormity of chaos everywhere, with no recognizable signs of past
order.
</P>
<P>
   We Americans, whatever our plight, are fortunate that we can go
to the rescue of others as a nation and as individuals. Last week,
the United States sent $70 million to the region for food, water,
sanitation and aircraft support. This week, Tipper Gore, the vice
president's wife, visited the area and promised $10 million more.
Time reports that Honduras and Nicaragua have enough food. The
problem is getting it to those who need it most.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOR NON-FLORIDA/TEXAS NEWSPAPERS)
</P>
<P>
   Floridians and Texans who watched the weather reports with
initial apprehension and, ultimately, with relief are blessed. But
even if Mitch had hit either state, the blow would not have been as
devastating. American roads, utilities and emergency support system
are less vulnerable to total collapse.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, we gladly acknowledge our good fortune. In
the same store where customers were complaining about produce
prices, a large container was stationed near the door for donations
of food. Later in the day, I saw similar containers for clothes
donations at the entrances of other stores.
</P>
<P>
   Still, American security often causes us to focus on ourselves
more than we should when others are in crisis. Former President
Bush pragmatically pointed out that we must help the Central
Americans because if they begin to believe their situation is
totally hopeless, they will head north. More illegal immigrants
would be a serious problem. In some quarters, that motivation for
humanitarian aid is called compassionate conservatism. We're
capable of much more.

CSUN NEEDS SECOND-HALF COUNTERPUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Advance scouting gets more advanced by the year.
Videotape piles teeter to near collapse as they stretch from floor
to ceiling in coaches' offices.
</P>
<P>
   It's all in the name of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, no matter how much planning goes into a game, the 20
minutes' worth of adjustments coaches make at halftime does far
more.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Cal State Northridge offensive coordinator Rob
Phenicie is wracking his brain as the 24th-ranked Matadors travel
to Southwest Missouri State today as they continue a run toward the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Defenses are adjusting to the CSUN's offense at halftime, and
the Matadors aren't countering it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about it. I hate it,'' Phenicie said. ``It's
frustrating as hell. You're hanging on for your life.''
</P>
<P>
   The easy point of reference comes from last week's 32-28 win
against Portland State. CSUN scored 26 points in the second quarter
and led the Vikings 32-14 at the half, only to see the offense
become nonexistent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest in a dangerous trend.
</P>
<P>
   After averaging 17.7 points in the second half during its first
six games, CSUN's offense scored two touchdowns in the second half
of the past three games. Just 16 points in the second half after
scoring 62 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense is comprised of families of plays, and each family
is designed to attack a defense,'' Phenicie said. ``When one family
of plays dries up, you run another family of plays to bring the
other family back to life. So everything has to build off something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much head coach Ron Ponciano wants to run, CSUN is
first a passing team. Phenicie said he's moved away from the game
plan too quickly in some instances and become conservative at other
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to stop running a lot of things that were successful in
the first half because they game-planned them during the half,''
CSUN center Julio Alcala said. ``It screwed up our game plan and we
had to do other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, it's the execution of plays that dictates
success, and the Matadors haven't been executing.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Marcus Brady, despite completing 66 percent of his
passes for 2,196 yards, hasn't been as sharp in recent weeks. Also,
receivers have dropped balls and the running game, even with a
strong commitment, remains mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things where we're not getting it done
in the second half, but I'm sure we're going to,'' Ponciano said.
``I know at this time of the year the concentration level drops on
catching the ball, and those kind of things. My past experience is
the teams that win are the ones who remain sharp and still can
execute. Hopefully, we'll be one of those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Youth is another factor. The Matadors led at the half of the
last three games only to have malaise take over.
</P>
<P>
   Among the regulars on the offense, only senior left guard David
San Vicente and junior wide receiver Aaron Arnold have more than
two years of experience at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we came out too confident,'' senior wide receiver Mike
Ogas said. ``We study defenses real hard. I know the offense does
as a whole, so they don't run anything we're not expecting, and if
they do our offense is one of adjustments.''

The Purple People await Children of the Corn 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ You wanna find out what's going on somewhere,
you stop by the barbershop. Campus Hair Styling, Walk-ins Welcome
was the perfect place.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a pep rally was in progress. Aggieville _ the Sixth
Street, French Quarter and Times Square of this Little Apple _ was
hopping. Inside, as he cut another head, Roger the Barber assessed
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most enthusiasm I've seen around here,'' said
Roger Allerheiligen, who has lived here for 34 years. ``It started
at 10 a.m. It's very obvious this is a different type of day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the day before the biggest game in Kansas State history.
Today, the second-ranked Wildcats play No. 11 Nebraska. A victory
would be Kansas State's 18th in a row and would boost it toward the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The nation knows. Six bowl games have sent representatives:
Cotton, Holiday, Orange, Sugar, Rose and Fiesta. ABC's No. 1 team,
headed by Keith Jackson, is in town. As is ESPN's ``GameDay'' crew.
A record number of 630 media folks received credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Kami Lindenmuth will open the Cats Closet just outside KSU
Stadium at 6 a.m. today. She expects to sell lots of T-shirts
emblazoned with these words: ``Nov. 14, 1998 _ Judgment Day for the
Children of the Corn _ Approved by Stephen King.'' (The school got
permission from the author to use the title of his book. He agreed
if he got two of the shirts.)
</P>
<P>
   The last time anyone can remember this kind of excitement was
when President Nixon spoke here in 1970. But this, is a Big
Football Game, dang it. Much more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the biggest game in the history of the
school,'' said Cory Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey and friends Lee Parker and Mark Ewing are Kansas State
alums. They live in Amarillo. In August, they bought an old school
bus for $5,000, painted it purple and silver, remodeled the
interior. In October, they drove it here for the Oklahoma State
game. Gets eight miles to the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, it was a featured attraction in Aggieville. Well,
next to the guy in the purple Santa Claus suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already figured it out, it's 762 miles to Tempe,''
Ramsey said. Tempe is the site of the Fiesta Bowl and the national
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   A local sporting goods store is selling T-shirts with the score:
Kansas State 38, Nebraska 17. The ``Manhattan Mercury'' published
media predictions; all 13 predicted a Kansas State victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cautiously optimistic,'' said Lynn Beier as she and her
husband, Steve, watched 11-year-old son Brett try to get in the
background of some live television shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time against Nebraska, we feel we've got a
chance,'' Steve said as his wife pointed out that the Huskers have
won 70 of 82 games in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Beier's face was painted purple, his hair spiked, purple
and silver. He carried a pole topped by a Fiesta Bowl poster.
Hanging from it were mascots of the Wildcats' eight Big 12
opponents. He said he has never been so excited as he hopped from
one foot to the other.
</P>
<P>
   So, Brett, what's your prediction: ``Well, I think Michael
Bishop will complete most of his passes, Nebraska's quarterback
will get taken out by the Lynch Mob and Martin Gramatica will kick
three field goals. Uh, I guess, 37-28.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone imitating ESPN's Lee Corso predicted a 48-17 victory
from the pep-rally stage. Yes, everyone here is a little ``too''
excited. A defeat is just, well, unimaginable. Kansas State fans,
who for so long suffered so much, might be a little spoiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sort of a naive quality to all of this; they've never
experienced this before,'' Roger the Barber said as he surveyed the
scene and clipped away. ``It would be kind of cruel if we don't
win.''

SUTTON: ONCE AND FUTURE STAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ Hal Sutton came bolting out of Louisiana
in the era when the PGA Tour was a weekly parade of young blond
golfers so colorless, their biggest imaginable sin was that none of
them was Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was as blond as an anchorwoman and as stone-faced as the
next guy, but he was different. He was going to be Jack Nicklaus,
or so everybody thought when he set an earnings record for rookies,
and set an earnings record for second-year players, and won the
1983 PGA Championship in Los Angeles by holding off a Sunday charge
by a certain Golden Bear.
</P>
<P>
   He was 25 years old that summer day, ruggedly handsome and built
like a long-hitter, and he was going to be the star golf craved. As
they walked off the 18th green at Riviera Country Club, where
Sutton had just two-putted to secure a one-stroke victory, Nicklaus
congratulated him by saying, ``That'll be the first of many for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 40 years old now, and as he sits before you in the
clubhouse at Sherwood Country Club, Hal Sutton is still waiting for
his second major championship.
</P>
<P>
   The past 15 years included eight without a victory (1987-94), a
bottoming-out season in which his earnings dropped to $39,000
('92), and only recently a resurgence that brought Sutton wins at
the Westin Texas Open in September and the Tour Championship two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing is, he might be closer to that second major now
than he was in '83. His swing is back to where it was, and his head
is screwed on tighter than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, it seemed like a nightmare,'' Sutton said of the
eight-year drought as he wolfed down a lunch of chicken and iced
tea Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He and Shark Shootout partner Glen Day has just shot a
4-under-par 68 to join a four-way tie for fourth in the
alternate-shot first round of the Greg Norman-hosted tournament.
``Looking back, it was an extended learning experience that I feel
like I gained a lot from.... I think I'm a better golfer now than I
was (in '83).''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he said, he wishes success hadn't come so early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been more mature to handle it,'' he said. ``It
came so easy, I thought, `This doesn't require as much work as I
thought it did.' I became too complacent. I probably didn't take
care of my game as much as I should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I paid a terrible price for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The season after his '92 low, his 10-year exemption for winning
the '83 Tournament Players Championship ran out, and he stayed on
tour in '94 only by using a one-time exemption for being in the top
50 in career earnings.
</P>
<P>
   That year he began to bounce back, but wasn't sure he'd make it
all the way.
</P>
<P>
   He hired David Leadbetter, the famous golf teacher, to try to
get his swing back. It didn't work because Leadbetter hadn't paid
attention to Sutton's swing when it was right.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Floyd Horgen, his coach in his college days at
Centenary, and they figured out what was wrong. Something about his
forearms and ``rerouting.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he learned not to listen to golf writers who thought
they knew what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what comes from maturity,'' Sutton said. ``It's
to quit reading what's written about you, because 90 percent of the
time it's written by somebody who doesn't know what they're talking
about in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees a lesson in this for Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is starving for a star, and Tiger has filled that
bill to a large degree. But when he fails, which is inevitable
(because) everybody does, everybody will point out !ital!why!off!
he fails. He reads it, he starts working on all those things, and
he gets off track,'' Sutton said, and then paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about myself in my early days.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be this hard for a rich oil-man's son,
pushed to ``never be satisfied'' by a father who'd hoped young Hal
would become an Arkansas football player. It wasn't supposed to be
this hard for a guy who won seven tournaments in his first five
seasons on tour.
</P>
<P>
   But he's worked _ hard _ to get back to where he was, if not
quite to what he was, the next Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Off the course, he and his fourth wife, Ashley, have a
soon-to-be 2-year-old daughter and twins on the way and are
building a house in his native Shreveport.
</P>
<P>
   On the course, he's just as settled, happy to trade driving
distance for accuracy and improving his short game. Sutton finished
fifth in tour earnings ($1.8 million) this season after playing in
more tournaments (30) than anybody else in the top 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how easily it can get away from you and how lonely you
feel when it gets away,'' Sutton said. ``I'll tell you this: I'm
not going to take my game for granted like I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Could be a major breakthrough.
