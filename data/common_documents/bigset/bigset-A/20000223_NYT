 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
CARLSBAD, Calif. _ While the rest of the world is left to wonder
whether that flash-in-the-pan fellow Tiger Woods will ever win
again, Jeff Maggert is trying to avoid the temptation to think the
same thing of himself.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a year now since Maggert ended a six-year drought
between PGA Tour victories. He won the Andersen Consulting Match
Play Championship at La Costa Resort in '99, beating Woods, among
others, in the five-day survival test that is match play. Though
the weather could intervene, the second rendition of the Match Play
begins this morning at La Costa Resort.
</P>
<P>
   After his success last year, Maggert felt like he could exhale.
He had finished second 11 times between wins, and each time the
questions about his victory-phobia got worse.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a soft flip of his sand wedge last year on the second
playoff hole, Maggert had his second title.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's patiently waiting for No. 3. Actually, he's just
waiting. Nobody is patient for success on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   At age 36 after his birthday Sunday, Maggert thought for sure he
had kicked the door in with his win last year. Now? Well, he's
still confident he won't have another long wait between wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure don't want to wait until the Senior Tour to win
again,'' Maggert says. ``I feel like if I could win again this
year, or maybe get a couple of wins, and play well in the majors,
then I'll be where I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maggert is well aware of the pressures that come when the
sweet taste of victory hasn't been enjoyed lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go a few years and don't win, it gets harder,'' he
says. ``Ask Tom Lehman and Paul Azinger. You know you can win. But
if you go awhile without doing it, it starts to wear on you
psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, winning the Match Play was important for my own peace
of mind. I don't consider it a pinnacle. But I'm glad I won that
first one. And to win that one twice in a row might be almost
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending this week is going to be no easy chore. In fact, it
will be tougher than defending a regular 72-hole medal event on
tour. Match play boils the game down to a one-on-one battle.
</P>
<P>
   It's similar to an amateur playing against Jack Nicklaus. Given
a choice, the amateur would take his chances on one hole against
Nicklaus rather than over 18.
</P>
<P>
   In match play, you have to be good and lucky. Even if you shoot
a 68, your opponent might have one more birdie than you, or one
fewer bogey, and you're history.
</P>
<P>
   But Maggert, for now, has match-play history on his side. He has
been a good player in the Ryder and Presidents cups of the past
half-dozen years. And he feels like his game is in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, his mental approach is solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just turned 36, and I really feel like my best golf might be
coming over the next five or six years,'' he said. ``I'm really
enjoying what I'm doing, and I'm in better shape than I was when I
was a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a great win for me. To win the way I did, with
the chip-in, and to win a million dollars, it was great.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this year's going to be every bit as tough. Whether it's
Michael Campbell or Tiger Woods, all these guys know how to play
golf, and if you let up for one second they're going to beat you.
To win six matches in a row, it's tough. You can say all you have
to do is beat those six guys, but one bad day and you're catching a
flight home.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert may be biased after winning the inaugural Match Play
Championship, but he believes the tournament is headed for a bright
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think over the next 15 or 20 years, it's going to become one
of the favorite tournaments on tour,'' he said. ``It's different
because we don't get to play match play all the time. It's a lot of
fun, and I think the majority of players really like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when you are defending the championship.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ If you're taking bets on Astros players with the
best chance for a turnaround in 2000, Chris Holt would be a good
place to start.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could his luck possibly be any worse than it was a year ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure hope not,'' the 28-year-old righthander said. ``I pray
that it can't get any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it appears Holt had a bad season. He was 5-13 in 32
appearances, including 26 starts. But to accurately evaluate Holt's
performance requires looking beyond his won-lost record.
</P>
<P>
   While his 4.66 ERA might have seemed mediocre, it was almost
identical to the National League average. By most accounts, Holt
easily could have been at least a .500 pitcher in 1999 with a break
here or there.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' offense averaged 5.1 runs a game last season but
only 4.3 runs when it was Holt's day to start. It was the worst run
support for any starter on the staff and more than two runs less
than 22-game winner Mike Hampton received.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Holt and Hampton isn't totally fair. Holt has pitched
only two full seasons in the big leagues, and Hampton was the NL's
Cy Young Award runner-up in 1999. But there are similarities. The
early part of Hampton's career was marked by some of the same
inconsistencies Holt has experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Once Hampton learned to use both sides of the plate and to
change speeds rather than try to challenge every hitter in the
opposing team's lineup, he started getting better results.
</P>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker and pitching coach Vern Ruhle were
instrumental in changing Hampton's approach, and they hope to
implement some of the same strategies with Holt, who is preparing
for his first back-to-back big-league seasons after missing all of
1998 while recovering from rotator-cuff surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Having traded Hampton to the Mets during the offseason, the
Astros almost certainly will need one of their remaining starters
to take his game to another level, and Holt is as good a candidate
as any.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year Mike Hampton had is almost impossible to consider
replacing,'' Ruhle said. ``But you look for guys to improve, and I
think Chris Holt is at a point where he's ready to step up and
become a winning major-league pitcher. As long as your tools are
there, and you're physically fine, you pretty much have to know how
to use them, and I think that's where Chris can really make some
strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I think Chris was just happy to be able to throw
again. His mind was freed up in that respect. Now he has to start
locating and getting a combination of pitches that he can throw to
locations better than he did last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Location in the strike zone is probably the biggest key. To
have late movement and to be able to throw more than one pitch over
the plate and change velocity. Sometimes he got into a groove where
everything was too much the same speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt has five quality pitches: a 92-93 mph fastball, a sinker, a
changeup, a slider and a curveball. Last season he relied on his
slider more than the Astros would have liked and didn't use his
curveball enough.
</P>
<P>
   A mechanical glitch, which Ruhle has been working with Holt to
repair, caused his sinker to be too high in the hitting zone at
times, and it also took Holt out of position to field grounders at
the completion of his delivery. By Holt's estimation, he would have
fielded 15 to 20 additional balls hit up the middle last season had
his mechanics been more sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never doubted his stuff,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker
said. ``His stuff was always good. But in the first part of the
season, I think he got away from what made him successful in the
minor leagues, what got him to the big leagues, and that was his
curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curveball was a very important pitch for him, and a lot of
his other pitches work off his curveball. We've talked to him a
little about changing his strategy and maybe using his curveball
earlier in games.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Holt makes the necessary adjustments to become a more
complete pitcher, he'll still need some help from his friends who
make their living swinging a bat.
</P>
<P>
   Such help was rare last season. Holt didn't win his first game
until June 5 despite allowing no more than three runs in five of
his first eight starts. In fact, he allowed three runs or fewer in
10 starting assignments during which he got a loss or no decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of 162 games, most of the time things even
out,'' Hunsicker said. ``But there are always a handful of players
that seem to have a year where things don't even out. Last year was
one of those years for Chris. He had a couple bad outings early,
and things started to steamroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, it becomes a mental problem. You wonder if
you're ever going to get a break, because everything seems to be
collapsing around you. That's what happened to Chris. To his
credit, I don't think he ever really let it overwhelm him. He
battled through it and gave us an honest effort every time out.''
</P>
<P>
   Also to Holt's credit was the fact he never made excuses about
the paltry run support, and he never attributed his failures to the
fact he was coming off major arm surgery. That was mainly because
his arm never became an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be more sore than usual, but I couldn't be
more pleased with how my arm felt,'' he said. ``I was strong all
year, and I actually felt like I had a little more velocity than
before. I built on some things last year, and hopefully I'll see
some better results this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds are they can't get much worse.

`SENIOR' ADULTS TOO FIT FOR LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Every day, Margaret Corbellini runs a mile, swims laps
and climbs stairs. At 62, she also qualifies for Denny's senior
special, a $3.75 movie and AARP membership.
</P>
<P>
   Although Corbellini may be an overachiever, she and her less
active friends over 60 share a concern: They don't feel old.
</P>
<P>
   As people live longer and stay active, many find that the
``senior citizen'' label doesn't fit. It often suggests frail,
elderly people hitting early-bird dinners and passing time in
rocking chairs.
</P>
<P>
   So, many older people, from church group leaders to Sun City
residents, are searching for a new way to define themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gerlich, 68, found that many people weren't joining the
``senior'' activities at his Phoenix church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like it's for your grandma or grandpa,'' says
Gerlich, a retired corporate trainer. ``I think people would get
more involved in activities if they didn't think, `Oh, it's a bunch
of old people.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He tried to create new names, including ``west of 60'' _ but
that sounded like directions off the Superstition Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Other names have been suggested but haven't caught on, either.
Third Age is the name of a group devoted to issues for older
people.
</P>
<P>
   Many dismiss ``golden'' as sounding too Disneyesque. And
psychologists have coined the term ``explorers'' for people in
their 70s and 80s at full steam and in good health.
</P>
<P>
   One gym calls its seniors ``the silver sneakers.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 survey of journalists who cover aging found older readers
disliked ``senior citizens'' and ``elderly.'' The most preferred
term was senior, followed by older Americans, adults or people.
</P>
<P>
   And MatureConnections.com, an Internet magazine, is taking a
poll, asking people over 50 to vote for ``senior citizen'' or
``mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some experts on aging would prefer not to label people,
reality calls for it. And often, coming together as a group brings
power, such as senior lobbying organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are living so much longer that these terms are losing
their utility,'' says James Birren, associate director for the
Center on Aging at UCLA. ``That's the question: `When is old, old?'
When we live to be 150, will senior life begin at 85? Will 60 be
middle age if people live to be 120?''
</P>
<P>
   The average life span now is 76, and some scientists say it
could double by the end of the 21st century. Already, an estimated
70,000 Americans are 100 years old or older, triple the number in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   And in the next 20 years, an expected 40 million baby boomers
will retire and become seniors, or whatever they will be called.
</P>
<P>
   Birren says he tries not to say senior or senior citizen when he
talks to his autobiography class, where most students are over 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``When referring to myself, I just say I'm 81,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Zuckerman, founder of one of the nation's best-known spas,
Tucson's Canyon Ranch, is trying to create a community for those
over 55, focusing on health and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'll call it, maybe optimal living,'' says
Zuckerman, 71. ``But it won't have the name senior in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketers have gotten involved, calling AARP's magazine, Modern
Maturity, and gently referring to restricted-age communities like
Sun City as ``active adult'' communities.
</P>
<P>
   Corbellini, who lives in Sun City Grand, says she feels younger
now since she's retired from work.
</P>
<P>
   Corbellini says although she doesn't think of herself as a
senior citizen and would prefer a different label, it's not that
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I still look good in a bikini,'' she says, after
finishing her morning exercise routine. ``That's what matters.'' &QL;

CLASH EXPECTED OVER RUNAWAY PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MARLA MATZER ROSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - A yearly trade show for film commissioners, coming
to the Los Angeles Convention Center this weekend, is shaping up as
a showdown between boosters for filming in Canada and other foreign
countries and local forces fighting ``runaway production.''
</P>
<P>
   The Studio City-based Film and Television Action Committee
(FTAC) vows to rally outside the show and distribute materials over
the weekend, while the Los Angeles-based Entertainment Industry
Development Corp. will skip the event yet again.
</P>
<P>
   The group's president, Cody Cluff, called the event ``a
glorified junket for film commissioners.''
</P>
<P>
   Film commissions that attend pay for booth space and the chance
to make a pitch to industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it's productive to subsidize a show that
encourages filmmakers to leave L.A.,'' said EIDC spokesman Morrie
Goldman. He added that the Association of Film Commissioners
International, which stages the event, ``trains foreign film
offices to lure away film business (from Los Angeles).''
</P>
<P>
   The EIDC encourages and facilitates filming in the Los Angeles
area and has not attended the expo for the last couple of years. It
apparently decided to go public with its reasoning this year after
being criticized for not participating in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The group has been working with the recently formed national
Film U.S. coalition, which includes the Screen Actors Guild and the
Directors Guild of America, to develop state and national
legislation to stem runaway production.
</P>
<P>
   The Locations Expo, which organizers estimate brings in more
than $250,000 in revenue to the city, has always been a colorful
event.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, live bears and Elvis impersonators have been
employed to encourage filming in places like Idaho and Memphis.
This year - as several Midwestern states hand out free beer and the
Austrians don lederhosen - the more serious issue of runaway
production may play a more prominent role during the
Friday-through-Sunday gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Emling, president of the film commissioners group and also
director of the Mississippi Film Office, refuted Cluff's statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a trade show where business gets done. Ninety percent
of our members attend each year, as do producers, production
managers, writers and others who decide where films get made,''
Emling said.
</P>
<P>
   Some other U.S. film commissioners seem to agree with Cluff,
though. ``Trade shows are a very antiquated form of marketing; the
decision-makers don't come,'' said Dawn Keezer, director of the
Pittsburgh Film Office and chair of Film U.S. Keezer said U.S. film
commissioners should focus on keeping business in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're one of the only industrialized nations that doesn't have
a national film office. We're trying to get this industry
competitive again in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said other U.S. cities, such as Chicago, Dallas and
Miami, have actually been losing a greater percentage of film and
TV production than Los Angeles, which has the advantage of being in
the studios' back yard. Still, EIDC figures showed the number of
production days in L.A. down 4 percent from 1998 to 1999, and 8
percent from 1997 to 1998, representing substantial lost revenue
and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman cautioned that these figures don't reflect breakdowns of
types of work and the reasons behind lost production, such as a
shift to game shows. And music video and commercial filming is up
in Los Angeles, not down, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential snag for organizers of the expo is the rally
planned outside the Convention Center for noon Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters in trucks and other film workers endangered by runaway
production plan to stage their event outside after being told they
could not have a presence inside the building or distribute printed
materials there, according to an FTAC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Emling denied that FTAC was being singled out in being told it
cannot distribute materials in the convention hall. ``That's our
policy with any organization: They have to have a booth to hand out
materials,'' he said.

GARRETT LEAVES COWBOYS FOR GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys can only hope that bad news happens
in threes, and no more.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jason Garrett signed a three-year, $2.94 million
contract yesterday to be Kerry Collins' backup for the NFC East
rival New York Giants after seven seasons as Troy Aikman's backup
in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, who turns 33 next month, becomes the third unrestricted
free agent to defect Valley Ranch since the NFL free-agent signing
period began 12 days ago. He joins middle linebacker Randall
Godfrey (Tennessee Titans) and defensive end Kavika Pittman (Denver
Broncos) as ex-Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike either Godfrey or Pittman, Garrett heard directly
from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who spent close to an hour on the
phone yesterday, trying to talk Garrett into staying. All along,
Jones has wanted Garrett to retire and become the team's
quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   These duties will be absorbed by new offensive coordinator Jack
Reilly. The Cowboys are in the market now for a No. 2 quarterback
with starting NFL experience. Mike Quinn, a three-year player with
no NFL starts, is considered to be no more than the team's No. 3
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Also unlike Godfrey or Pittman, both starters with the Cowboys,
Garrett didn't receive a seven-figure signing bonus. Instead, he
receives from the Giants a modest $250,000 signing bonus and the
NFL veteran's minimum of $440,000 in 2000. His salaries then
escalate to $750,000 and $1.5 million for '01 and '02,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett can make as much as $1 million this coming season with
playing-time incentives, but that would mean Collins would miss a
considerable number of starts. Garrett's NFL career record as a
starter, all with the Cowboys, is 6-3, including 1-1 last season
when Aikman missed two starts in November (Arizona and Green Bay)
with back-to-back concussions the previous two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with the Giants has been a positive at every turn,''
Garrett said yesterday. Questions about Garrett's lack of arm
strength in Dallas apparently was not a factor in New Jersey
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, a former Princeton quarterback who grew up watching the
Giants, for whom his father was an assistant coach, never warmed up
to Jones' proposition to retire and become a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a very positive relationship with Jerry Jones,'' said
Garrett. ``Obviously, for him to be as successful as he is, he's a
free-thinker. This \RGarrett becoming a coach\S is something Jerry
has talked to me about for the past five years. It was very
flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, whose father, Jim, is now a scout for the Cowboys, and
whose older brother, John, is quarterbacks coach for the Arizona
Cardinals, considers coaching to be in his future.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett visited the Cardinals last week, but his chances of
going there were dashed yesterday when Dave Brown was re-signed as
Jake Plummer's backup yesterday. \Nsubheds:Briefly Running back
Robert Chancey, a restricted free agent, has received an offer
sheet from the San Diego Chargers. The Cowboys have until Monday to
either match the Chargers' undisclosed offer and retain Chancey, or
lose him with no compensation since he came into the NFL (with the
Chargers in 1997) as an undrafted player.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ryan McNeil, an unrestricted free agent of the
Cleveland Browns, has not yet visited Valley Ranch. McNeil, who led
the NFL with nine interceptions while playing for the St. Louis
Rams in 1997 (but has had only one pick since), is thought to be
the best of the available free-agent cornerbacks. ``There are a few
guys out there,'' Cowboys coach Dave Campo said, ``but not a lot.''

<P>
   ROMULUS, Mich. _ Aides to Sen. John McCain acknowledged Tuesday
night that the campaign placed thousands of phone calls to Roman
Catholics in Michigan telling them about Gov. George W. Bush's
appearance at Bob Jones University earlier this month and
describing Jones as someone with a history of anti-Catholic
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply pointed out a fact,'' Rick Davis, manager of the
McCain campaign, said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis acknowledged that the campaign made the calls late in the
day as polls were closing in the Michigan primary, which McCain won
by 6 percentage points. Earlier in the day, after Bush had
complained about the calls, a spokesman for McCain, Howard Opinsky,
denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Opinsky's earlier denial, Davis said the
spokesman had not been told of the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the phone calls did not conflict with McCain's pledge
to refrain from running negative advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This I don't believe to be outside the realm of a positive
campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The call to Catholic voters prompted Bush on Tuesday to try to
assure the state's Roman Catholics that he was a friend who
deserved their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you,'' he said, ``John McCain, he's a man who's
called me an anti-Catholic bigot, and I don't appreciate it,'' Bush
said during a visit to a restaurant in nearby Royal Oak on Tuesday
morning. ``That's shameful politics.''
</P>
<P>
   To pound home the governor's message, the Bush campaign
electronically mailed, in the span of just 42 minutes after 1 p.m.,
nine news releases containing statements from nine Republican
governors, all of whom denounced the telephone calls. Many of the
governors are Catholic, and many assumed that the McCain campaign
was to blame for the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah called McCain's tactics
``shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts labeled McCain a ``typical
Washington politician who says one thing then does another,''
echoing some of Bush's attack ads, and said, ``He should be
ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also released a similar statement from Tom
Monaghan, the founder of Domino's Pizza and an active benefactor of
Catholic causes in the Detroit area.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Roman Catholic,'' Monaghan said, ``I am offended that my
faith is being used as a negative smear tactic to divide people in
a political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a script of the telephone call that the Bush
campaign released Tuesday, a recorded message notes that Bush
visited Bob Jones University, whose officers have in the past made
anti-Catholic statements. Bush has said repeatedly over the last
few days that he does not agree with those statements and has noted
that his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The script provided by the Bush campaign reads: ``Gov. George
Bush has campaigned against Senator John McCain by seeking the
support of Southern fundamentalists who have expressed
anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Jones has made strong anti-Catholic statements, including
calling the pope anti-Christ, the Catholic church a satanic cult,''
according to the script. ``Governor Bush has stayed silent.''
</P>
<P>
   By releasing the script and the blizzard of statements, the Bush
campaign was perhaps doing more than assuring Catholics that they
had nothing to fear from the governor.
</P>
<P>
   It may also have been diverting attention from reports that the
evangelist Pat Robertson, a supporter of Bush, had recorded and
sent an incendiary telephone message branding McCain a foe of
conservative Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Several political analysts said that the Robertson call,
emblematic of the tough politics that Bush's allies on the
religious right used to guarantee Bush's victory in the South
Carolina primary, could hurt Bush with moderate voters if he does
not quickly establish some distance from Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be put back into the bottle,'' Scott Reed, who ran
Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, said of Robertson.
``Somebody should pick up the phone and tell him to stop. He is way
over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Tuesday that Robertson had made the calls
independently of his campaign, an assertion that Robertson
confirmed.

MICHIGAN GOVERNOR BLAMES DEMOCRATS FOR BUSH'S DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHFIELD, Mich. _ This was not exactly what Gov. John Engler
had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Engler was supposed to be celebrating the victory
that his vaunted political machine had handed Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the man he had endorsed so early and so eagerly for
president, the man whose entire family affectionately calls him
Engy. As Bush's campaign chairman, he had pronounced Michigan
``asbestos,'' protection against any challenger's dangerous blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, even as he declared the race too close to call, he
found himself loyally falling on his sword in interview after
interview and in a brief speech here Tuesday night, amid ferns and
palms in a hotel atrium before about 200 Republican loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll accept responsibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And: ``My strategy may not have been very good.''
</P>
<P>
   And: ``Where am I looking?'' (This in reference to which
camera's gaze he should return.)
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, Engler said he regretted not advising Bush
to advertise here that Sen. John McCain was appealing to Democrats
for support. ``We could have gone right at the fact that Senator
McCain ing such an explicit pitch, reaching over to the most
partisan Democrats, and therefore the least likely ever to become
Republicans,'' he said. ``You could have gone to the Republicans in
the Republican areas of the state and sort of exposed that
directly.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, after raising the notion of broadcasting such
commercials, he advised against it: ``I actually thought we could
get the turnout up to compensate for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Engler said Tuesday's results said ``nothing whatsoever'' about
McCain's ability to attract Democrats. Instead, he argued that
Democrats, glimpsing an opportunity after McCain won in New
Hampshire, worked to make mischief in the Michigan primary.
Engler's aides said their evidence of Democratic efforts for McCain
was anecdotal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Michigan Democrat chairman, Mark Brewer, said Bush's
defeat was the fault of neither the Democrats nor Engler but of the
candidate, and he denied encouraging Democrats to vote in Tuesday's
primary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Engler stared fixedly at the bright side, repeatedly noting that
Bush had won the Republican vote overwhelmingly in Michigan.
``George Bush probably got more Republican votes today than any
other candidate in any other primary in history,'' he told the
cheering if disappointed crowd, as his wife, Michelle, stood
beaming beside him.
</P>
<P>
   There was evidence in the polls of voters as they left the
ballot booth that Engler's endorsement hurt Bush as much as it
helped him. Of the 15 percent of voters who said that Engler's
endorsement had influenced them a great deal, fully seven in ten
voted for McCain. Of the 15 percent who said Engler's endorsement
had influenced them ``somewhat,'' 65 percent voted for Bush and 33
percent for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Engler is extremely popular among Republicans, having served all
of the 1990s as governor and most of the 1980s as president of the
state senate. But he suggested that the very idea he once promoted
_ that he would assure Bush victory _ had backfired with voters,
though he seemed to lay the blame with the news media. ``They're
very independent,'' he said of voters here, ``and they don't like
to be told what you all were telling them, that somehow there was a
coronation underway, and there was a machine going to get their
votes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that there's a machine,'' Engler said derisively
Tuesday night. ``There's nobody left that can tell people how to
vote.'' Indeed, in New Hampshire Bush was supposed to have been
propelled to victory by the political machine of Sen. Judd Gregg.
Instead, he was blindsided at the polls by McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday night, Engler had a history of pulling Bushes
through here. He helped Bush's father, who also calls him Engy, win
the Michigan primary in 1980, even as Ronald Reagan locked up the
Republican nomination, and he helped the elder Bush again in 1988.
He led Michigan's Republicans to move up their primary for this
year partly because he believed he could help assure the younger
Bush's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But asked if he had any regrets about that move, he looked at
the reporters surrounding him and shook his head. ``Look at all of
the attention,'' he cracked.

ASHCROFT CRITICIZED FOR APPEARANCE AT BOB JONES UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: As George W. Bush faced continuing questions about his
appearance at Bob Jones University, Democrats on Tuesday spread the
word that Republican Sen. John Ashcroft last year accepted an
honorary degree from the South Carolina school.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, who is being challenged by Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan
in this year's Senate race, also spoke at the university during his
May visit.
</P>
<P>
   The school has been criticized for its ban on interracial dating
and because its former president once said all popes are
``demon-possessed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe Senator Ashcroft is a bigot,'' said Carnahan
aide Marc Farinella. ``But we do believe he exercised very poor
judgment in going to Bob Jones University and soliciting their
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's campaign responded: ``In this instance, Senator
Ashcroft accepted an opportunity to speak to the student body, and
did not then, and does not now, have knowledge of their specific
teachings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft spokesman Steve Hilton said the senator ``totally
repudiates'' attacks on religious denominations and embraces the
``equality of all people....''
</P>
<P>
   Criticized for making Bob Jones his first stop in the
hard-fought South Carolina primary contest, where religious
conservatives form an important voting bloc, Bush said his speech
there did not mean he embraced all of the university's policies.
</P>
<P>
   But New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Bush supporter and a
Catholic, said later that Bush ``made a mistake'' by speaking at
the school. On Sunday, another New York Republican and Catholic,
Rep. Peter King, switched his support to Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, citing the Bob Jones episode for his action.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans, however, have noted that many other
politicians, from Ronald Reagan to the Democratic governor of South
Carolina, have appeared there.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton said a civility agreement Carnahan signed requires him to
repudiate this attempt to inject bigotry into the race. He blamed
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for spreading the word
about Ashcroft's appearance at Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not accusing Senator Ashcroft of anything,'' Farinella
responded, ``but frankly, we understand why people at the DSCC and
elsewhere are reacting strongly to his accepting a degree from this
questionable institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Bob Jones did not return telephone calls Tuesday.

legend Rush Limbaugh _ are on the march, and man, those folks can
 &UR; march! &LR;
<P>
   Very impressive, guys, but try bending your knees!
</P>
<P>
   Hey, that was just a little totalitarian humor to break the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Rush's people call themselves Dittoheads because someone beat
them to the copyright on ``Lemmings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dittoheads, being a well-regulated militia protected by the
Constitution, are up in arms over my plea (not a demand, but a
humble request) to radio station KNBR to remove Limbaugh's face
from the billboard that greets motorists arriving in San Francisco
on the Bay Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying Rush is a bad-looking guy. But Dittoheads, isn't
the oil painting of Limbaugh that hangs over your fireplace
sufficient?
</P>
<P>
   Dittoheads shriek that I'm preaching liberal tolerance while
trying to ``squelch free speech'' by silencing their master
blaster.
</P>
<P>
   Au contraire (which is French for ``Shut up!''). I'm not trying
to squelch Rush's voice. I would need a nuclear squelcher. I am
trying to squelch his billboard mug shot from dominating San
Francisco's skyline.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like my car has a TV-type remote control that allows me
to change Rush's billboard picture to something more pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   I understand that conservatives are edgy these days, and I
sympathize. I simply want a little billboard relief. Until then, as
George Orwell said, ``Big Bluster is watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   IN THE Republican primaries, one big question is: When will
neo-GOP Willie Brown come out with his endorsement?
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans backed Willie in his mayoral election battle and
surely there is an unspoken quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Da Mayor will soon be out stumping for his fellow Texan,
GWB. You know Soft Money Willie would never back John McCain's
campaign finance reforms.
</P>
<P>
   THIS IS WET, but not wet wet, yet.
</P>
<P>
   The wettest year for San Francisco was the 1861-62 season, with
49.27 inches. Since July, we've had just over 17 inches, so this is
no big deal, unless your house is cliffside in Daly City.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cliffside living, Mother Nature eventually
gives everyone a shot at it, on a rotating basis. Be patient,
she'll get to you.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners insurance, it turns out, doesn't cover sliding
cliffs, or earthquakes, or floods. How about plagues of
stucco-eating locusts? Don't those insurance people read the Bible?
Stuff happens.
</P>
<P>
   WE'RE ALWAYS looking for a good home for the Doggie Diner head,
if and when the time comes for the head to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   Karrin Kain says she found the perfect spot _ at the Bank of
America at Market and Van Ness, south side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lighted sign says `Bark of America,''' Karrin reports.
``If we get the head installed there, the bank won't have to fix
the light. And some lower-level employee can `volunteer' to adopt
the doggie head and keep it clean, saving money for the S.F.
landmarks board.''
</P>
<P>
   I hear rumors that the Dittoheads are quietly lobbying for
landmark status for the Rush Limbaugh billboard.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERMARKETS are speeding into the 21st century. I saw a news
report of new checkout technology, available in a few test stores,
that eliminates the checker.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds great. Human interaction is way overrated.
</P>
<P>
   The people who came up with the robo checkout system say it will
free up the checkers to perform other duties in the store, like
working in the produce department.
</P>
<P>
   One: I don't need any more help in the produce department.
</P>
<P>
   Two: Bull. Markets will simply hire fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets are advanced enough. They require of the shopper
exercise, and thinking, and self-control, and imagination, and
decision-making under pressure. Paper or plastic? Credit or debit?
Cash back? Help to your car?
</P>
<P>
   I  &UR; would  &LR; like to see an express line for people with fast
reflexes. Is that guy in front of me writing out a check, or his
memoirs?
</P>
<P>
   The scientists are also working on technology that will allow
your refrigerator to order food directly from the market, via
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from what junk my refrigerator decides to keeps around
for months, that's the last appliance I would trust to order my
food.
</P>
<P>
   BY THE WAY, Dittoheads (and thank you for reading this far!),
I'm not supporting Gore or Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   My man Ralph Nader just declared his candidacy, and I'm a Raider
all the way. He's got no chance, but then neither does planet
Earth, and we don't give up on her.
</P>
<P>
   I've been a big fan of Nader's since back in the '60s when he
blew the whistle on death-trap Chevy Corvairs, and I was able to
pick up a sweet little Corvair Monza for a song.
</P>
<P>
   Safest car on the road. Thanks to Nader, other drivers were
scared to get within a block of me. As for the Corvair's tendency
to roll, I walked mine around corners. Style has its price.

REQUESTS FOR ABSENTEE BALLOTS UP 10 PERCENT FROM 1996 IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Requests for absentee ballots for the March 7
primary are up nearly 10 percent from the last presidential primary
in 1996, the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder said Tuesday, a
week before the application deadline.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers are up since the most recent presidential
primary, they are down from the 1998 gubernatorial primary, when Al
Checchi launched a massive absentee voter campaign to boost his
chances of securing the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Conny McCormack, the county registrar-recorder and county clerk,
said that typically 18 percent to 20 percent of voters in Los
Angeles County use absentee ballots. Although other counties have
absentee voting rates of higher than 30 percent, McCormack said she
believes the number is leveling out.
</P>
<P>
   Many absentee voters make a habit of the practice, McCormack
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know people get addicted to that behavior. It becomes their
standard for voting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Checchi effort dominated the absentee spike in 1998,
McCormack said no single candidate is pushing up the numbers this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more the political parties, but you don't know which
candidates they are doing it for,'' McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Hoffenblum, a Republican political consultant based in Los
Angeles, said he believes excitement about the California
presidential primary is driving the numbers up. Since the state
moved its primary to an earlier date, Californians will now have
real influence on the ultimate choice of nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, everybody knew (before the California primary) that
Bob Dole was going to be the Republican and that Bill Clinton would
be the Democrat,'' Hoffenblum said.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in absentee voting is part of a 20-year trend in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It continues to go up every cycle,'' said Bob Mulholland,
campaign adviser for the California Democratic Party. ``In some
counties it's up to well over 30 to 35 percent of the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gray-Barkan, a campaign consultant to local candidates for
the state Legislature and Congress, said several clients have sent
out absentee voter applications as part of their campaign mail but
have not launched overly aggressive efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you figure out where you have a natural early
advantage, it doesn't make sense,'' said Gray-Barkan, citing the
costs of mailing out absentee applications.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Paul Krekorian, a lawyer seeking the 43rd District
Assembly seat in the Burbank-Glendale area, said he has launched an
aggressive absentee voter campaign. Krekorian said it's an
important part of his efforts to reach out to new Armenian-American
voters. Many new voters are more comfortable voting by mail rather
than visiting a polling place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially important within the Armenian community. A lot
of people who want to vote for me are inexperienced voters,''
Krekorian said. ``It's important to make the voting process as easy
as possible for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Glendale, Councilman Rafi Manoukian ran a very
successful absentee voter campaign to win in his first try for
elected office. Manoukian, a Democrat, also targeted the Armenian
community. Manoukian is now leading what organizers bill as a
nonpartisan voter registration drive in the Armenian community.
</P>
<P>
   Dario Frommer, who is competing with Krekorian for the
Democratic nomination in the 43rd District, has also been mailing
out absentee voter applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters in the district who have voted absentee in the past
have all received an application from us,'' said David Rolf, a
consultant for Frommer. ``We're competing for every segment of the
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters can request an absentee ballot in one of three ways:
</P>
<P>
   - By filling out a vote-by-mail application on the cover of the
sample ballot booklet sent to each registered voter;
</P>
<P>
   - By sending a letter to the Office of the Registrar/Recorder-
County Clerk, Absent Voter Section, P.O. Box 30450, Los Angeles,
CA. 90030-0450.
</P>
<P>
   - By going in person to the registrar's office in Norwalk, 12400
Imperial Highway, in Room 3002 on the third floor.
</P>
<P>
   Absentee ballots cannot be requested by phone because a
signature is required to validate the request.
</P>
<P>
   While Tuesday will be the regular deadline for an absentee
ballot request, voters who cite emergency circumstances can make
requests from March 1 through Election Day. Information is
available from the Absent Voter Section at (562) 466-1323. Those
requiring assistance in another language should call (800)
481-8683.
</P>
<P>
   If voters have not received their absentee ballot a week after
sending in an application, they should call (800) 815-2666.
</P>
<P>
   To be counted in the election, ballots must be received at the
registrar's office or taken to a polling place no later than March
7.

BRADLEY: MILD MESSENGER, BOLD MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MIKE WEISS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley has done something very few
white Americans have _ he has worked in a job where African
Americans are the majority. Playing professional basketball with
the New York Knicks in the 1970s, he says, has given him a special
sensitivity.
<P>
   ``I had the chance to see the world through the eyes of my
African American teammates at countless points along the road,'' he
told an audience of black ministers in Los Angeles recently. ``I
want people to see that discrimination the way I did. ... I
understand you feel every day the sting of discrimination and that
it snuffs something out in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Give the tall man with the small, humorous brown eyes credit.
It's audacious for him to have made a call for better race
relations, greater justice and what he calls ``goodness'' the
themes of his presidential campaign. Not since Jimmy Carter came
out of Georgia preaching love has anyone tried something so, well,
uplifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be president of the United States,'' he says again
and again, ``to use the power of that office to do good.''
</P>
<P>
   A commitment to racial and economic justice hasn't gotten
anybody elected president recently, but from the moment he declared
that he was thinking about running, using a child-care center as
his setting, Bradley has insisted that is what his campaign is
about.
</P>
<P>
   In his stump speech, he argues for repairing the American house
while times are flush and the money is there. In San Francisco a
few weeks ago, it drew the loudest applause of anything he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of this presidency,'' he declares, ``is to eliminate
child poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley carries about him the air of a small-town banker, which
is what his father was in Crystal City, Mo., of someone who might
be president of the Rotary. His father once told him, he says, that
what he was proudest of was never foreclosing on a mortgage during
the Great Depression. Clearly, Bradley is proud of it, too.
</P>
<P>
   He is himself inspired, he says, by a lifetime of being on the
road asking people to tell him their stories. Talking about this,
as he does often, he becomes almost lyrical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for a president is to give people a story and
how to fit into it,'' he says. ``A story in our own lives that's
deeper than just our possession of material things.''
</P>
<P>
   In an admiring story, Time magazine observed: ``What's most
fascinating about Bradley is the tension between his ambition and
his reserve, between where he wants to go and what it takes to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new. As a basketball player, he was famous for
practicing longer and harder than anybody. Yet he once wrote about
the game at which he so excelled: ``My problem is that my
aspirations demand that I create something that I cannot control
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   When Vice President Al Gore attacked Bradley in New Hampshire on
a number of issues, including his ambitious health care plan,
Bradley hesitated to strike back. When he did counterattack, it was
with obvious reluctance. Naturally, those who had criticized him
for running a bloodless campaign now ridiculed him for his
negativity, abandonment of principle and hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the nature of public life: you are damned if you do and
damned if you don't.
</P>
<P>
   In an empty banquet room in the San Jose Hilton, I asked Bradley
about this whipsaw. His initial response was mild: ``It is
consistent to have deeply held values, and to want to run a
campaign a certain way, and then fight for those values when they
are maligned and attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, though, a clearly rankled Bradley returned
to this question without bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he said. ``Nobody can be 100 percent consistent. It's
ludicrous. You can't get caught up in that kind of Hobson's choice.
You've got to find a way in a difficult environment to communicate
the essence of who you are and why you're doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not often you can identify the precise moment when a
campaign lost its zip.
</P>
<P>
   There was Ed Muskie crying in the snow, Gary Hart caught aboard
the yacht called Monkey Business with Donna Rice. For Bradley that
moment arrived last  &LR; December 10 at the Berkeley marina.
</P>
<P>
   His pursuit of the presidency had always been a longshot, but
last fall was the best of times for Bradley. His numbers were solid
and rising, his press adulatory. Time magazine put him on its
cover, calling him ``The Man Who Could Beat Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   In a year when every candidate is all of a sudden an outsider _
even the incumbent vice president and the son of a former president
_ Bradley seemed the real deal, the man who had given up a Senate
seat because, as he famously said, politics is broken.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred supporters were waiting that Friday in Berkeley
under a bright blue sky for him to arrive. Bradley's appealing
candidacy was reaching people who did not normally participate,
such as Ed Getka, a 38-year-old nurse from San Francisco who had
shown up with his 1-year-old strapped to his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first person I felt I wanted to support,'' said
Getka. Ginny Coffre, an Oakland lawyer, felt the same way: ``This
is the first time I got involved in a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley never showed up. About 90 minutes after he was due, his
press secretary told reporters that he was in a hospital being
treated for an irregular heartbeat, an atrial fibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most common heart rhythm disorder; 2 million people
suffer from it, including many who work full schedules. The problem
was that Bradley had not disclosed that he had experienced repeated
episodes. It would be six more weeks before he acknowledged that he
been put under an anesthetic several times for a procedure known as
cardioversion, during which he had briefly been unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was no more than a nuisance. But if he were president
and that happened, he said, he might have to invoke the 25th
Amendment, temporarily turning over executive power to his vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that followed, his health became a huge
distraction. Until then, he had been leading Gore in the polls in
New Hampshire. But he lost there, as he had in Iowa. He is far
behind in the polls in California. Bradley has not had a really
good day, politically speaking, since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is,'' he says with an unexpected poignancy, ``a big
country.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing New Hampshire, Bradley could have quit the chase.
Or he could have changed tactics and gone on the attack against
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he continues to call Americans to a higher moral plane.
He is still saying politics is broken, but he is saying it in this
campaign with a positive, programmatic set of solutions for fixing
it.
</P>
<P>
   The two issues attracting the most attention in America today
are our perpetual racial divide and campaign finance reform _
because cynicism about the process and the candidates will never be
changed until we believe politicians aren't being bought and sold.
Alone among the candidates, Bradley has made both issues his own,
and his remedies go further than any of his rivals'.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the stories of so many Americans over a lifetime on
the road as an athlete and a politician, he says, has made him want
to lead people toward a commonality in which we would all be ``less
lonely, less fearful and less isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   But that message coming from this particular messenger is not
working.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is not an effective speaker, his anecdotes don't connect
clearly to his points, and his style and voice are both dry despite
many years of speech coaching.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said when I asked him if he were disappointed,
is that the people he wants to inspire haven't heard his message.
He knows he is to blame. He has failed to get his message across.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks back, just after the state's Democratic convention
in San Jose had given him a reception that was no better than
polite, Bradley acknowledged that his campaign is still struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people have heard clearly enough the deeper
message of what's possible,'' he said. ``That's probably my fault,
that I haven't been able to get those things through.''
</P>
<P>
   His anti-charisma can make him seem removed, even aloof, and his
preachiness strikes some people as sanctimonious. Columnist Maureen
Dowd mocked him as ``William the Good.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is someone whose college basketball teammates at
Princeton called Mr. President, who has spent a lifetime preparing
himself for this moment. Someone who has campaigned relentlessly
for the past year. Who has raised and spent tens of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And still the connection, that mysterious spark between pol and
people that is the essence of leadership, that lightning John
McCain has caught, eludes Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons probably lie deep in his past. A star since high
school, he has been in the limelight forever. Everybody on whom
fame descends in America has to figure out how to cope. The writer
John McPhee, who wrote a book about Bradley when he was still in
college and has remained his friend, says that ``detachment became
his protection.''
</P>
<P>
   In a book of his own, Bradley acknowledged his need for
aloneness: ``Loneliness can be full of existential angst, but it
can also provide room to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Bradley was seeking the Sunday after the state
Democratic convention. He wanted to ride to a place he loved when
he was teaching at Stanford a couple of years ago _ Crystal Springs
Reservoir in San Mateo County.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to get away by himself and drive by the reservoir at
sunset. ``Just to relax,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it poured rain all day long. Bill Bradley didn't get his
wish.
</P>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In a brash comeback that threw the Republican
presidential race into turmoil, Sen. John McCain on Tuesday
trounced Gov. George W. Bush in Michigan, the biggest electoral
prize thus far, and in the senator's home state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush had long overshadowed the contest with his vast
endorsements and colossal treasury, his double-barreled defeats
left Republicans debating who would make it to their party's
convention in Philadelphia in July. The voting also set the stage
for what has quickly transformed into the most contentious and
perhaps belligerent Republican primary battle since Ronald Reagan
came close to toppling President Gerald R. Ford in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   With 76 percent of the precincts reporting in Michigan, McCain
had 50 percent of the vote, Bush had 44 percent and Alan Keyes had
5 percent. In Arizona, with 59 percent of the precincts reporting,
McCain had 60 percent, Bush had 36 percent and Keyes had 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers had conceded that a loss here would have
effectively ended the contest for them. And Bush's advisers,
confident of victory in Michigan, had hoped to finally rid
themselves of the senator as a threatening rival.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McCain's victory quashed any notion among Republicans
that Bush is now their invincible nominee. The outcome assured that
what McCain called ``a wonderful, wonderful ride'' after his defeat
in South Carolina would not be over. It means that a Republican
nominee would probably not emerge at least until after the
candidates sprint through 16 primaries and caucuses over the next
14 days.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who had been painted by Bush supporters as caring more
about Democrats and independents than Republicans, recast himself
as a Reagan conservative. He made a ``special plea'' to members of
his own party, who have overwhelming sided with Mr. Bush: ``Don't
fear this campaign my fellow Republicans. Join it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also took an unvarnished dig at his rival: ``Today
Michigan sent a powerful message across America _ a message that
our party wants real reform from the real reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned his attention to the coming races. ``Now we move
ahead, our crusade is spreading from state after state, attracting
new people to our great party.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made a pointed appeal to members of his own party, who
have overwhelming sided with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make a special plea tonight to my fellow
Republicans,'' he said. ``There are those who rule the
establishment, who want more than anything to defend Washington's
big money, big spending status quo. They want to fool you about me.
Well, here's some more straight talk. I am a proud Reagan
conservative. I love the Republican Party. It is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   At a brief news conference in Kansas City, Mo., on Tuesday
evening, shortly after the polls closed in Michigan, Bush said:
``Republicans overwhelmingly supported my candidacy. It seems I'm
getting stronger and stronger with Republicans as the primaries go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   And he seemed to recognize the possibility that McCain would
continue to impede what many had once considered an inevitable
march to the nomination. ``This is a long process,'' he said.
``This is a marathon. And I'm going to be in it all the way to the
end. And some primaries you win, and sometimes, you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The two contests on Tuesday were especially critical for McCain
because after Bush's 11-point victory in South Carolina, he has
sought to demonstrate that he is not a one-state wonder who could
only win a primary in a tiny state like New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Bush's advisers had hoped that they could
effectively knock off McCain after Tuesday. And even McCain's aides
had acknowledged that a lopsided defeat in Michigan would have
shattered the chances for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the outcome on Tuesday will intensify the focus on
the races next week in Virginia, Washington state and North Dakota.
But the most important voting will be on March 7, which is
something of a national primary, with voters going to the polls in
New York, California, Ohio, Missouri, Georgia, Connecticut and
several other states.
</P>
<P>
   After South Carolina, Bush and McCain rushed to concentrate on
Michigan because the outcome here is far more important. There are
58 delegates at stake in Michigan; 30 in Arizona. McCain was also
widely expected to win in Arizona because he is the favorite son
there who has served three terms in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush's defeat in Arizona, according to the polls,
underscores how the primary season has been far rockier than he or
his advisers had anticipated. Bush enjoyed the energetic backing of
the Republican governor, Jane Dee Hull. And for a time last year,
surveys in Arizona showed Bush ahead of McCain. That led some of
the Bush's advisers to happily predict that they would humiliate
McCain in his own state.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush advisers now insist they never intended to win in
Arizona, they poured as much as $2 million into smothering the
state in television commercials and direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   The see-saw nature of the Republican competition _ while McCain
has won New Hampshire, Bush was victorious in South Carolina and
Delaware _ leaves Bush appearing far less invincible than he seemed
for much of last year when polls showed, month after month, that he
towered over the Republican field and could easily defeat a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the McCain campaign has fastened onto the theme that Bush
is such a weak candidate that he could lose a general election.
</P>
<P>
   But the voting in Michigan pointed to larger difficulties for
both Bush and McCain. Bush's constituency is predominately from his
party's conservative wing, according to surveys of voters,
conducted by a consortium of the television networks and The
Associated Press. Those so-called exit polls showed McCain with a
slight edge over Bush; McCain also held a narrow leade with with
about a third of the actual votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls also showed that if Bush is the Republican
nominee, it might be difficult for him to attract Republican
moderates, independents and Democrats in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for McCain, the surveys showed, is that he
encountered difficulty attracting members of his own party. That
could be perilous because many of the coming contests are in states
like New York, where, unlike Michigan, only registered Republicans
can participate.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In one of the many indications that McCain and Bush appeal to
opposite ends of the philosophical spectrum, Bush attracted the
majority of voters who want to see abortion made illegal to some
degree, and McCain drew the majority of voters who favored keeping
abortion legal.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive race here was something of an embarrassment for
Gov. John M. Engler, who had promised that his organization would
deliver for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Engler is a controversial figure in this state, and the
surveys showed that his endorsement was a mixed blessing for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan is far more representative of the nation than the
earlier states that have voted because of its large population,
heavy industry, unions and blend of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the electorate in this state on Tuesday was far different
than four years ago. The number of Democrats voting nearly doubled
to 20 percent of the electorate, while the number of Republicans
diminished to about 50 percent, and independents to about 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Democrats accounted for 10 percent of the voters;
Republicans, 62 percent and independents, 28 percent. Nearly half
the voters said they were conservative, and they backed Bush over
cCain by nearly 3 to 1. But nearly 4 in 10 voters described
themselves as moderates; 6 in 10 of them backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While religious conservatives were credited for delivering huge
support to Bush in South Carolina, they were not as much a factor
in Michigan. Fewer than 3 in 10 voters said they considered
themselves to be part of the religious right movement; those who
did voted overwhelmingly for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigning here had been dominated by often harsh exchanges
over which campaign was most negative, which each side accusing the
other of planting unsavory information about the candidates through
phone banks and mailings.
</P>
<P>
   But while voters in South Carolina concluded that McCain was
behind a more negative campaign, voters here said Bush was slightly
more negative. Nearly 4 in 10 said Bush had been attacking McCain
unfairly; while more than a third said McCain had been attacking
Bush unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the verbal assaults, voters here and in Arizona said
they were most concerned with the candidates' personal character _
not their stands on issues. That was one of McCain's great
strengths in the voting on Tuesday. He had the wide backing of
voters who said a candidates' personal qualities matters more than
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Michigan, 3 in 10 voters said they were looking for a
candidate who stands up for what he believes in; McCain won nearly
6 in 10 of their votes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also was said to be more honest about his beliefs than
Bush. And half the voters said McCain says what he believes rather
than what people want to hear; only 4 in 10 said the same of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a contrast to South Carolina, where Bush successful
appropriated Mr. McCain's mantle of reform, the senator regained
his reform image in Michigan. Asked who the real reformer was,
voters were more likely to say McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ran advertisements emphasizing his ``reformer with
results'' mantra, but McCain repeatedly declared that if his rival
was a reformer he was ``an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, McCain overwhelmed Bush in virtually every
demographic group _ except among voters who consider themselves
very conservative and those who want to make abortion illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The voters in Arizona are staunchly Republican and
overwhelmingly conservative, fitting closely to the profile of
Bush's backers. But McCain appeared to win them over because of his
deep roots in the state.

CITY COUNCIL PUTS OFF PANEL PLAN: RAMPART INVESTIGATION STAYS IN
POLICE HANDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A sharply divided Los Angeles City Council
rebuffed a proposal to create a new independent panel to look at
the Rampart Division scandal, saying it wanted to wait to see what
is developed by the Los Angeles Police Department and what steps
are taken by the Police Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-6 vote against the proposal from Councilman Joel Wachs,
however, did not not kill it outright. Instead it was sent to the
council's Public Safety Committee - on which Wachs serves - for
review at a later time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't surprise me,'' Wachs said Tuesday after the
council vote. ``I know the establishment doesn't want this
investigation. But, believe me, it will still happen, sooner or
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachs, a candidate for mayor in 2001, wanted a report in 30 days
on how an independent panel of jurists, academicians and community
activists could be formed to review the LAPD's Board of Inquiry
report scheduled to be released by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to restore public confidence and I don't think anyone
believes that can be done by an agency investigating itself,''
Wachs said. ``Chief (Bernard C.) Parks has done a good job, but we
need an outside eye to look at this report to see if more needs to
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rampart Division controversy centers around accusations from
former Officer Rafael Perez that he and other members of the
station's anti-gang CRASH unit, Community Resources Against Street
Hoodlums, routinely assaulted gang members up to the point of
shooting them, planted evidence and gave false testimony to place
them in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD has a criminal investigation under way, and a Board of
Inquiry is to release an administrative review by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Wachs wants the independent group to look at the Board of
Inquiry report.
</P>
<P>
   Voting to delay creating the panel were council members Hal
Bernson, Mike Feuer, Ruth Galanter, Mike Hernandez, Nate Holden,
Cindy Miscikowski, Nick Pachecho and Alex Padilla.
</P>
<P>
   Voting to create it were Wachs, Laura Chick, Jackie Goldberg,
Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rudy Svorinich Jr. and Rita Walters. Council
President John Ferraro, who is undergoing daily chemotherapy
treatment, was absent.
</P>
<P>
   Several council members objected to Wachs' proposal, saying it
was premature and would not allow the Police Commission and
Inspector General's Office to do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a covenant with the voters in 1992 when they adopted
the reforms of the Christopher Commission,'' said Miscikowski, who
chairs the Public Safety Committee. ``We should let those reforms
work. I don't think we ought to prejudge what they do. To create
another independent panel will create confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer also said the council should delay creating an independent
panel and that the Police Commission proved its independence last
week in ruling against Parks on the shooting of a homeless woman,
Margaret Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have voted to give the commission the resources it needs to
handle this properly,'' Feuer said. ``I don't know what they're
going to do, but it would be premature at this juncture to say it
cannot do the review. We live in a city where there's no question
the confidence of the people in the Police Department and in
government has been shaken to the core.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there will be a day where we need an independent review,
but it is premature to say that day is now,'' Feuer said.
``Otherwise, we will be serving to undermine our own Police
Commission.''
</P>
<P>
   That drew a sharp protest from Chick.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say we are undermining the ability of the Police Commission
to assert independent oversight is hogwash,'' Chick said. ``I have
been sitting here for 6 years, waiting and watching and hoping and
pleading for the Police Commission to play the role the voters gave
it. I haven't given up hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, I have to say, to me, this is the line in the sand. This
is the litmus test of whether our charter amendment works or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Chick complained that the commission has failed to issue many
key recommendations from the Christopher Commission, such as
developing a computerized tracking system of complaints against
officers.
</P>
<P>
   She also offered a rebuke of Mayor Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a mayor who was not concerned with reform, but only
with growth of the Police Department,'' Chick said.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan spokeswoman Jessica Copen said the mayor had supported
reforms, but also had confidence in the Police Commission's ability
to perform its role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor gave his backing to provide them with the resources
they need and he is confident they will do their job,'' Copen said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg also voiced concern about the need for an independent
review.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a credibility gap,'' Goldberg said. ``We have to
provide an answer to the question of whether we believe a report
that comes entirely from the Police Department
</P>
<P>
   even if the commission is a civilian group can we believe that
they have looked at everything?
</P>
<P>
   ``As I walk precincts, and it doesn't matter where people live,
they ask me how we can have a real investigation without having an
independent eye. People want an outside look at the department.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Protective League, which represents
uniformed officers in the LAPD, has asked University of Southern
California law professor Erwin Chemerinsky to conduct his own
review of the Board of Inquiry report. Chemerinsky also was
president of the elected Charter Reform Commission that reviewed
the role of the Police Commission and Inspector General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   League President Ted Hunt said the union wanted to be able to
satisfy itself that the report receives a thorough review.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California renewed its call to have a fully independent civilian
commission oversee the Police Department.

 EDITORIAL: McCAIN'S MICHIGAN SURPRISE  
 (Eds.: Subs for rewriting throughout) 
(bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, feb. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain's victories Tuesday in Michigan and his home
state of Arizona once again scramble the Republican presidential
race, and portend more blistering battles to come with Gov. George
W. Bush. Stunned by a new defeat so soon after winning in South
Carolina on Saturday, Bush took solace Tuesday night in his strong
showing among Republicans. The results in Michigan do indeed show
that McCain won because of independents and Democrats, with the
Texas governor the undisputed choice of the GOP faithful. In future
primaries, where crossover voting is barred, Bush may well have an
easier time. At some point, McCain will have to show that he can
draw majority support among members of his own party and also
convert a reluctant party leadership if he hopes to roll to the
nomination. And if Bush hopes to rebound, he sooner or later must
show that he has the ability to win without being propped up by
local bosses.
</P>
<P>
   As this ever-surprising Republican contest heads for more
battles across the country, one of its most striking aspects is the
increasingly nasty and personal nature of the combat. A new tone of
religious animosity has crept in, especially as several spokesmen
for the Christian conservative movement in the South have rallied
to Bush's cause. Supporters of McCain said Michigan had been
swamped with recorded telephone messages from the religious
broadcaster Pat Robertson, singling out former Sen. Warren Rudman
of New Hampshire, who happens to be Jewish, as ``a vicious bigot''
for criticizing the Christian Coalition. Bush supporters, for their
part, accused the McCain campaign of condoning other calls
suggesting that the governor is anti-Catholic because he launched
his South Carolina campaign at Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   All primary campaigns expose internal differences within
political parties that the eventual nominee must paper over before
the general election. But the warfare between Bush and McCain has
an especially rough edge, and it could open wounds that will not be
easily healed. An orgy of religious-based accusations in a
heartland state like Michigan harks back to a kind of bigotry that
most Americans have long ago rejected as unacceptable in
presidential politics. At their best moments, both candidates have
appealed to the idealistic and, in Bush's term, compassionate side
of the American electorate. But Bush failed in South Carolina and
again in Michigan to criticize those who used the politics of
bigotry in his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   McCain declared Tuesday night that the Michigan results
represented the emergence of a new ``McCain majority'' that he
hopes will bring more independents, Democrats and Republicans
together for victories in the future. Bush's supporters, on the
other hand, vowed to play to their candidate's strength within the
traditional conservative base of his party. That means, of course,
that McCain had better brace for attacks depicting him as the
Democrats' favorite Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact is that Bush has yet to prove he has a comparable
gift for inclusiveness on a national scale. Last year, in launching
his candidacy, he boasted that he had won Democratic votes in Texas
and could do so around the country. Now he and his supporters are
in the odd position of belittling McCain for accomplishing the very
same feat.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has once again shaken up the Republican contest, but he
also has much work to do. The next big mountain for both candidates
to climb _ and also for Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley _ will be the nationwide ``Super Tuesday'' primaries of
March 7, with special focus on California and New York. With his
Michigan upset, McCain has a shot at even more striking surprises
on that day. By the end of it, either Bush or McCain will begin to
look like their party's nominee, ready to take on the task of
overcoming both ideological and religious divisions brought out in
an unusually brutal contest. &QL;

LAKERS BRING REALITY TO NETS' FANTASY LEAGUE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Nets talked that professional
basketball talk before Tuesday night's game against the Los Angeles
Lakers. They spoke of being able to beat any team on any given
night, of being on top of their game after consecutive victories
over playoff-bound Miami and Minnesota, of protecting their home
court.
</P>
<P>
   But the pregame chatter was either a fantasy or just what an
overmatched team is trained to say before embarking on a nearly
hopeless task. Beating the Lakers of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant was not impossible, just incredibly unlikely. In reality, if
the Nets stayed close and made it somewhat competitive, they
deserved applause.
</P>
<P>
   So to the surprise of probably no one in the Nets' third sellout
crowd of the season, the Lakers defeated New Jersey, 97-89, at
Continental Arena. The Lakers, perhaps weary after four straight
games on the road, did not bring their best game, but Tuesday
night's mediocre performance was enough for the team with the
league's second-best record (42-11) to extend its winning streak to
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had his way against the Nets' tag team of Jim McIlvaine
and Evan Eschmeyer, scoring 35 points, grabbing 13 rebounds and
blocking three shots. And while Bryant did not wow the crowd with
an onslaught of aerial acrobatics, he supported O'Neal with 21
points. Glen Rice, who despite many trade rumors is expected to
stay in Los Angeles, added 15.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets countered with Stephon Marbury and Kendall Gill. After
a poor start, Marbury scored 27 of his 33 points in the second half
to keep the Nets from getting completely blasted off the floor, and
Gill scored 18. Keith Van Horn, with 10 points and 16 rebounds, was
the only other Nets player to score in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Nets, who visit Miami on Wednesday, were
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't conceding victory,'' Gill said, ``but we had to have
everybody playing their best to have a chance. We had to have
everybody clicking on all cylinders. If you don't have that, with
Shaq there, you can forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Nets led by 4 points in the first quarter before
falling behind by 11 at the half and cutting the lead to 7 points
early in the fourth, they never seemed capable of winning. The Nets
have defeated some of the league's other top teams and played
strongly against others, but because of O'Neal, they never really
had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The league's leading most valuable player candidate, O'Neal all
but nullified any penetration into the middle. Only Marbury dared
challenge him, while the rest of the Nets, not as adept at getting
off contested shots, settled for jumpers. And offensively, whenever
the Nets hinted at rallying, the Lakers went to O'Neal, who powered
his way to a dunk or layup.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn and Gill said O'Neal is the league's legitimate MVP.
``He's the biggest guy in the league, the most dominating big man
in the league and now that Jordan's gone, the most dominating
player in the league,'' said Van Horn, who made just four of 13
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant wasn't bad either. His graceful moves and indomitable
court presence contrasted dramatically with the tentativeness of
the struggling Kerry Kittles, who scored just 6 points, marking the
third time in the last four games he has scored 7 or fewer points.
Many of those in the Meadowlands _ including Bryant _ remembered
that the Nets selected Kittles over Bryant in the 1996 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had drafted me, John Calipari would still be here and
we would have beaten the Lakers tonight,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' chances will be much better against Miami; they are
2-0 against the Heat this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a dogfight,'' Marbury said, ``because we've
beaten them twice, and I know they'll be ready to play.''

AMES, Iowa _ So, who is the Player of the Year in the Big 12
Conference?
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the Iowa caucuses we go.
</P>
<P>
   That's him taking off outside the dotted line for a high-flying
slam. That's him pulling up from 22 feet for a 3-pointer. That's
him working his way inside for an offensive rebound and follow
basket.
</P>
<P>
   That's him power-dunking over a 7-foot challenger for the
league's top honor, then quieting the crowd of 13,731 when it
starts into a negative chant about the stunned foe.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Marcus Fizer did everything but kiss babies Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa State junior undressed Texas _ inside and out _ scoring
a career-high 35 points in the Cyclones' stirring 89-77 win at the
Hilton Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Five Longhorns scored in double figures, led by point guard Ivan
Wagner's career-best 17 points, but the Longhorns were merely
invited guests at Fizer's campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a fantastic game,'' said Texas center Chris Mihm,
who matched Wagner's 17 points and blocked three shots. ``He did a
little bit of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer, who had a game-high nine rebounds, a career-high five
assists, two blocked shots and two steals and was 2-of-2 on
3-pointers, even hung around after the game, schmoozing with fans
by tossing basketballs into the crowd after all the other players
had left the floor.
</P>
<P>
   One game does not a Player of the Year make usually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he gave us 35 tonight,'' Texas forward Chris Owens said
of Fizer's claim to the prize. ``He's a great player. This was a
big game, and Players of the Year are going to step up in big
games, and as you can see he definitely did that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer got plenty of help, with Michael Nurse adding a
career-high 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting (5-of-7 on 3-pointers)
and Stevie Johnson sneaking free inside for 12 points while going
5-for-6 from the floor. But there was no question that the show
belonged to Fizer.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, 17th-ranked Iowa State (23-4, 11-2 in the Big 12)
moved into a first-place tie with No. 10 Oklahoma State, which
comes to Ames on Saturday. No. 14 Texas (19-7, 10-3), which falls
to third place, lost its third road game of the conference season.
</P>
<P>
   Texas appeared to have the edge early in the game as it ran out
to a 12-3 lead with Owens controlling Fizer down low.
</P>
<P>
   The first five times Iowa State went to Fizer against Owens, he
missed twice and traveled once and Owens picked up two steals. But
Owens got into early foul trouble and played just eight minutes in
the first half and 20 in the game, though he never fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   Texas upped its lead to 26-12 and quieted the crowd on a jumper
by Will Clay (10 points) with 8:05 remaining in the first half, but
by then Fizer had warmed up, and his fellow Cyclones followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State ran off eight consecutive points _ none by Fizer.
After a runner from Darren Kelly (15 points) slowed the push, Fizer
joined the fray, connecting twice, the second a long 3-pointer from
the top of the key. The crowd was again alive, as were the
Cyclones, trailing just 31-30 with two minutes left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Treading water down the stretch, Texas held on to a slim
advantage and looked as if it would lead at the break after Kelly's
jumper with seven seconds left on the clock. But Jamaal Tinsley,
who was only 2-for-12, drained a 3-pointer at the buzzer for Iowa
State's first lead of the game at 38-37.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns, who had 11 turnovers in the first half, would not
see the lead again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We allowed them to get back into the game in the first half
with poor execution on offense,'' Wagner said. ``We had six or
seven possessions without scoring, and most of those ended in
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on someone's home court, you know they're going to
make a run at you _ make a game of it. But I thought we kind of
took their heart for a minute, but it's a 40-minute game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Cyclones did what a home team is
supposed to do to protect a lead. They shot 53.3 percent from the
floor (16-for-30) and committed only two turnovers in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State scored the first seven points of the second half, and
though the lead was reduced to four at the 17-minute mark, Texas
never seriously threatened again, eventually falling behind by as
many as 14 with just over two minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   By then Fizer was busy working the crowd with a finger to his
lips, asking fans to be kind to Mihm and the Longhorns and
preparing for his exit to chants of ``one more year!'' and a
standing ovation in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to come out and do what I had to do to come out
with a win,'' Fizer said. ``I wasn't trying to be the best player
in the conference. I was just trying to win.''
</P>

MCCAIN RECLAIMS VIABILITY WITH WINS OVER BUSH IN MICHIGAN, 
 ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  DETROIT, Mich. _ Sen. John McCain's insurgent bid for the
Republican presidential nomination sprang back to life Tuesday as
Democrats and Independents provided him a narrow win in Michigan
and Republicans gave him a resounding triumph in his home state of
Arizona.
<P>
   The twin victories give McCain the momentum going into a two
week period in which 16 states will hold primaries or caucuses _
including California on March 7 _ and more than 60 percent of the
Republican delegates will be selected.
</P>
<P>
   It also delivered a humiliating blow to Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, who had won a convincing victory in South Carolina three days
ago, and who had appeared for more than a year to be the party's
anointed nominee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won in Michigan despite capturing only one in three
Republican voters, according to exit polls. The victory was won by
cobbling together a coalition of Democrats and Independents _ who
overwhelmingly supported McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Republican reformers ... We are creating a new
majority, my friends, a McCain majority,'' McCain said to cheers
last night from his hometown of Phoenix. ``And we are Al Gore's
worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on his way to an appearance last night in Burbank, tried
to put a positive spin on defeats which now raise sobering
questions about his ability to win the nomination and ultimately
capture the White House in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank all the Republicans who supported me,'' Bush
said after a rally en route from Michigan to California. ``I won
overwhelmingly amongst the Republicans in Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a marathon, and I am going to be in it all the way to
the very end,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush supporters asserted that McCain's success amounted to
a hostile takeover of the Republican party, and argued that he will
not fare so well in upcoming GOP primary states where Democrats and
Independents are not allowed to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain isn't party building, he's party-borrowing,'' said
Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Bush supporter, who complained that
the Arizona senator was ``renting Democrats'' for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain pointedly addressed the criticism in remarks that are
likely to be heard frequently over the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a proud Reagan conservative. I love the Republican Party.
It is my home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His aides say that with every victory, McCain reinforces the
perception that he is the most qualified Republican to win in
November, despite Bush's overwhelming edge in money and
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator racked up a 6 percent margin of victory in
Michigan, 50-44 percent over Bush, where Engler had promised a
``firewall'' to protect the Texas governor's support.
</P>
<P>
   But just 47 percent of Michigan's voters identified themselves
as Republicans; McCain won over the majority of veterans, union
members, and first-time GOP primary voters, even as Bush took three
quarters of the Republican vote there.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, his home state, McCain racked up 60 percent of the
vote, compared to 36 percent for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won all 30 delegates from Arizona and at least 31 of the
58 at stake in Michigan _ enough to assume the lead in the race for
national delegates, according to a count by the Associated Press.
Although Bush picked up at least three delegates Tuesday, he only
had 64 delegates to McCain's 75.
</P>
<P>
   With 14 primaries ahead on so-called ``Titanic Tuesday,'' March
7, the McCain camp immediately signalled that California would be
the line in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's victories increased the possibility that McCain
could win the popular vote in California on March 7, even as Bush
wins the GOP vote _ and 164 GOP delegates at stake here. That's
because while all registered California voters are eligible to
participate in the open primary _ only the Republican votes will be
counted in the winner-take-all rewarding of the GOP presidential
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, more than ever, it's become clear that the GOP
presidential nomination is going to be decided by the people of
California,'' said McCain's communications consultant Dan Schnur
last night. He noted that while McCain will compete hard in the
Washington and Virginia primaries next Thursday, ``we'll be
spending more than half of that time in Calfiornia.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is scheduled to arrive in California Wednesday night and
has a Thursday morning rally in Sacramento, an noon stop at Diablo
Valley College in Pleasant Hill, and a 5 p.m. rally at Justin
Herman Plaza in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   California Secretary of State Bill Jones, who defected from the
Bush campaign to support of McCain this month, last night raised
the question of Bush's strength in a general election, saying that
McCain has shown his appeal to crossover voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be well received in California,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's GOP primary rules, which permitted Democrats and
Independents to vote, were designed last year by Engler and his
supporters, who figured an open primary would bring new voters to
the party.
</P>
<P>
   They never imagined that such votes would actually outnumber GOP
votes, or that they would go so overwhelmingly against Bush, who
embarked on his campaign as a candidate who could reach across
party lines.
</P>
<P>
   There was scattered evidence that some Democrats voted for
McCain specifically to punish Engler, who is unpopular among public
teachers and Democrats in the Detroit area. Some Detroit area
preachers urged Democratic members of their congregations to vote
for McCain in order to embarrass Engler.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, McCain did better among veterans and first time
voters, and had greater success among those who said he was the
real reformer and the straight talker in the race. Bush voters were
more conservative, more religious, younger, more affluent, and more
opposed to legal abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But the Michigan contest was particularly marked with bitter
warfare between McCain and Bush, as campaign traded charges and
counter-charges of negative ``push-polling'' and barrages of
telephone attacks on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign accused Bush's effort of standing by while
voters received calls from Pat Robertson, attacking his stands on
abortion and his conservatism. But nine GOP governors released
statements saying they were ``outraged'' about calls that
reportedly attacked Bush as being anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   And while McCain was the favorite son in Arizona, he faced an
unusually tough challenge in a must-win race. Arizona Gov. Jane Dee
Hull endorsed Bush early on, early polls showed a tight race, and
Bush spent more than $2 million in television advertising on
Arizona's airwaves _ while McCain spent none.

BRAHMAS' SITES LEAVE FEW STONES UNTURNED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Brahmas primary owner Stuart Fraser calls up the team's Web
site from his New York office, he normally likes what he sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the first of the year he wanted the \Rsite\S to be as close
to perfect as possible,'' said Brian Kessack, who works in the
Brahmas' front office. ``He'd say he liked this ... and this ...
and this. Then, he'd say he wanted to change just a couple of
things, but he'd have a list of 15 to 20 changes.''
</P>
<P>
   That same commitment to detail goes for Cameron Thompson, a
hard-core, minor-league hockey fan from Mesquite who came up with
the idea of a Brahmas site in the middle of the night and sold it
to the Brahmas' booster club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put roughly 30 to 40 hours into it over the summer, which
helped get me through the hockey withdrawals,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brahmas might be minor-league hockey, but they have a solid
presence on the Internet. Like most sports teams, it's the standard
for minor-league hockey teams to have an official site and one or
more fan-authored sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Brahmas' two known sites _ Brahmas.com (www.brahmas.com),
the official site, and Brahmazone (www.brahmazone.com), the
booster-club site _ take different approaches. While the official
site has lots of content, the booster-club site has the fancy
graphics, interactivity and independent comment. ``Between our site
and their site, not too many stones go unturned,'' Kessack said.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Lafrado, who edits the Western Professional Hockey League
section for Inthecrease.com and researches minor-league hockey
sites for hours, said each Brahmas site has its merits.
</P>
<P>
   For Brahmas.com, Lafrado said content is not the problem:
``There's an incredible amount of information'' _ but ``no
consistency to the presentation format is a killer.'' Lafrado
prefers Brahmazone.com. ``It's very busy but well laid out with
enough text to get you involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In promoting the Brahmas, Fraser said it's not simply about
``exciting hockey ... but the event surrounding the entire game
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Brahmas.com reflects that experience. It has the standard
media-guide offering of news, rosters, schedules and ticket
information, but it also includes merchandise and multimedia
features, such as an image gallery and audio of Brahmas goals in
key WPHL games.
</P>
<P>
   Brahmazone.com doesn't have the corporate backing, but it has
more flash. Brahmazone.com has a user-friendly design and features
high-tech gizmos such as a scrolling scoreboard and e-cards. It
also has a reader's poll, message boards and a guest columnist
called Amy's Edition.
</P>
<P>
   Brahmazone.com has in-depth fan-friendly features, including a
WPHL teams section where visitors can access images of league
arenas and directions to each. It also has archived game reviews
and summaries.
</P>
<P>
   Making it even more Net savvy is the Winamp ``skins'' section.
Winamp is a downloadable audio program that plays MP3s, sound files
and compact discs. Users can customize the interface on their
Winamp program, and at Brahmazone.com, they can configure a Brahmas
logo on the facade of their on-screen audio player with ``skins''
from every WPHL team and some NHL teams.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of creative energy that has helped make the
Brahmas a presence on the Internet. It has also helped develop a
new fan in Thompson, a Web designer who maintained the Central
Texas Stampede's official site last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't really pledged an allegiance to any particular team
up until this year, but now my wife and I go to Brahmas games
exclusively,'' he said. \Nsubheds:Bytes A Rose by any other vote:
If the results of a Sportscut.com poll are to be believed, Pete
Rose appears to be a lock for baseball's Hall of Fame. Of 230,906
votes, 91.7 percent voted to make Rose eligible for election to
baseball's shrine in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Sportscut.com, a New York-based e-zine that bills itself as a
site that gives fans access to sports' biggest celebrities,
announced the results yesterday and plans to present Rose the
results of the online petition.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig has said as late as Monday that nothing
will sway him into allowing Rose back into baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Another point to remember: Online polls have flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, People magazine's online edition asked readers to
select the 50 most beautiful people in the award. The runaway
winner: Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf, a regular on Howard Stern's
radio show. \Ntagtop:Tommy Cummings, (817) 390-7397

WINS SET UP GOP FIGHT IN CALIF., N.Y.  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JEFF BARKER AND KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - John McCain confounded the GOP establishment with a
stunning triumph Tuesday, Feb. 22, over George W. Bush in
Michigan's presidential primary and an easy Arizona win, setting up
epic battles in California and New York on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   With his double victory, McCain created a quandary for a party
that has invested heavily in Bush and now must decide if it's too
late to turn back, or if it even wants to.
</P>
<P>
   As he had in New Hampshire, McCain rode a wave of Independents
and Democrats to victory in Michigan. He had trailed by as many as
34 points in a Michigan poll at the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls indicated that an unexpectedly high number of
non-Republicans voted - about half of the total turnout. McCain
also had a well of support from people who had never before cast a
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain pocketed an easy victory in Arizona, where
Bush had once sought to mount a serious threat with the aid of Gov.
Jane Hull. Bush is supported by the vast majority of Republican
governors and GOP members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, McCain's twin victories ensure that he will
survive into next Tuesday's, Feb. 29, Virginia, Washington and
North Dakota primaries and, more importantly, into the giant
California and New York contests on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   With each succeeding win, the Arizonan further bewilders a GOP
establishment threatened by McCain's reliance on supporters whose
philosophies may differ from those of traditional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the Republicans are choking on their own open
primaries,'' Dennis Goldford, a Drake University political
scientist, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican establishment, as it were, has basically
painted itself into a corner. They're heavily invested in Bush, and
they don't trust McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that McCain may be the party's most electable
candidate against the Democratic nominee in November, but he has
yet to prove he can draw a majority of his own party in the
primaries. With the exception of Arizona, McCain has fared best in
``open primaries'' that allow non-Republicans to participate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain soon will be tested in California, where Democratic
ballots don't count in the allocation of 162 convention delegates,
more than 15 percent of the total needed for nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In victory, McCain seemed both to reach out to Bush Republicans
and to continue his open defiance of those in his party most
worried by his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fear this campaign, my fellow Republicans. Join it, join
it,'' he told supporters in Phoenix. ``This is where you belong, in
the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. We are creating a
new majority, my friends - a McCain majority.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCain appeared to chide party insiders by
telling the crowd, ``Many said that the establishment would carry
the day. Instead, you, the people, did.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, heading to California, warned, ``There are going to be
people who come in our primary - just be aware of it - who come in
with one intention: to vote against somebody, so they can go back
and vote for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bush's defeats, the race seems as wide open as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fickle electorate,'' said GOP consultant Frank
Luntz. ``You can't count on the polls to remain constant even 24
hours. There are a lot of undecideds out there.''
</P>
<P>
   About four in 10 Michigan voters made their minds up within the
past week, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Of the next round of primaries on Feb. 29, Washington and
Virginia allow Independents and Democrats to vote, though in
Washington only the votes of registered Republicans count toward
delegate allocation. North Dakota, meanwhile, has a caucus system
that will attempt to screen out Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What John McCain has to do is . . . make a better argument
that he is the more electable of the two candidates,` said Sherry
Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at Claremont University in
California. `That's what will begin to move dyed-in-the wool
Republicans.`
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Michigan supporters said they are hopeful the Texas
governor will be able to recoup his strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to pray him in,'' said Pastor Wayne Kurtycz, a Bush
supporter from Plymouth, Michigan. `And, hopefully, this will
solidify his position and other states will take a deeper look at
him.` &QL;

SMU'S KENNEDY HOPING HISTORY CAN REPEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the SMU women roll down the stretch toward a possible repeat
Western Athletic Conference title and NCAA Tournament berth, things
appear to be in good hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs are led by a 6-foot-1 former hog farmer with a Led
Zeppelin tattoo on one shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, would be senior forward Karlin Kennedy _ who
this year has become SMU's career scoring leader while making a
strong bid to become the program's second All-America selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like a good idea to me,'' said coach Rhonda Rompola,
currently the only All-America selection (1982) the Mustangs have
had. ``I could use some company.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's drawn a lot of double and triple coverage this year, but
she's done a good job of fighting her way through it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy, who arrived at SMU four years ago from Mena, Ark.,
said she has never given much thought to records or awards. With
three games remaining, the Mustangs (17-6, 10-1) _ who face TCU on
Sunday at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum _ need one victory to become the
top seed in the WAC tournament, which they won last year en route
to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's important to me _ to all of us,'' Kennedy said.
``We want to go back to the NCAA Tournament, and that's what
everyone is focused on. The only thing I can say about my records
is that pretty soon, they'll be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice All-WAC and the MVP of last year's conference tournament,
Kennedy is SMU's career leader in points (1,678), blocked shots
(137), field goals (678) and shooting percentage (53.4). She is
second in rebounds (874). This year, she is shooting 54 percent
while averaging 15.4 points and 8.5 rebounds, and has 28 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been OK, but I'm not completely satisfied with the way
I've played this year,'' she said. ``It's been a challenge all year
to adjust to the way teams have played me, and I think sometimes I
could have done a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy's unique value to the Mustangs was demonstrated last
week, when Fresno State, 0-8 on the road this season, managed to
shove a game into overtime at Moody Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just had a \R12-game\S winning streak broken in a
really bad game in Hawaii,'' she said, ``and then this happens. I
remember looking up at the scoreboard and thinking, `Omigosh, we
could lose this one.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So she fixed it, scoring 10 points _ SMU's winning margin _ in
the overtime period. It has become a familiar surge in the clutch
from Kennedy _ who scored 23 in SMU's upset of fourth-ranked
Colorado State in the finals of last year's WAC tournament and
ended the season with 22 in a loss in the NCAA Regionals to
Georgia, a Final Four team.
</P>
<P>
   Another adjustment for Kennedy this year has been playing
without departed mainstays Claudia Brassard and Karen Blair (now an
SMU assistant), who, she said, ``kind of raised me. But now we have
\R6-2\S Katie Remke playing great defense inside and D-dra Rucker
scoring outside, and this team is much faster than the ones we've
had before. And as far as senior leadership goes, Nici Johnson
probably does more of that than I do, so I'm not feeling much
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   But the adjustment that has most benefited the Mustangs was the
original one, from Mena _ where the family once owned a hog farm _
to Dallas, where Kennedy, an English major, now feels comfortably
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had the farm, I liked living out in the country, away
from everything,'' she said. ``But raising hogs is something I do
/not'' want to do again. I guess I would play pro ball if God just
dropped it in my lap, but I'm really more interested in teaching
and raising a family.''
</P>
<P>
   And occasionally cranking up a sedate Zeppelin session. In the
absence of sound, there is always the comforting presence of the
Swan tattoo _ a reproduction of the record label _ on her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love that band,'' she said.

ANALYSIS: BUSH HITS A POTHOLE IN MICHIGAN
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: subs 3rd graf to recharacterize size and impact of McCain's
win; subs 6th graf to change `front-runner' to `man to beat') 
 (With REPUBS-PRIMARIES)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   DETROIT _ This road is nothing but bumps.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire knocked Gov. George W. Bush's bandwagon off the
highway. Then, last Saturday, South Carolina derailed Sen. John
McCain's Straight Talk Express. Tuesday, after a meager two-day
campaign, Bush hit a sizable pothole in Michigan, right in the
middle of his turnpike to victory.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's electrifying and ever-so-vital victory here was
reinforced by an overwhelming victory in his home state of Arizona,
where Bush had once hoped to make inroads.
</P>
<P>
   So McCain lives to fight another day, and Bush, with his cloak
of inevitability further frayed, must find somewhere else to drive
the Arizonan from the contest. Bush tried to look past McCain in
his speeches here, concentrating his fire on President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore, the most likely Democratic nominee. That
proved premature.
</P>
<P>
   Although it sounded at the time like wishful thinking, McCain
prophesied on Sunday that Michigan would differ from South
Carolina. In South Carolina, he said, ``it was very clear that we
were wiped out by the so-called Christian right, and that's where a
lot of this hate stuff was directed'' _ implying that Republican
conservatives would count for less on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has more money, more prominent backers and two
powerful geographic bases _ Florida, where his brother Jeb is
governor, and his own state of Texas _ Bush must still be counted
the man to beat. He also demonstrated again Tuesday his ability to
beat McCain handily among Republicans, and in many of the primaries
ahead they are the only ones who get to vote.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, McCain can now entertain legitimate hopes of
rekindling the widespread enthusiasm he generated in the campaign's
early weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The results in Michigan, much the most representative state to
vote so far this year, also contained dire warnings for both of the
candidates. This is the eighth-most-populous state, with a highly
competitive two-party system, a downsizing government, prosperous
farms and a growing, highly innovative economy: the kind of state
all presidential candidates shoot for.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was outpolled 60 to 40 by McCain among moderate voters
here. Such voters usually hold the key to presidential elections.
Having allied himself firmly with the far right in South Carolina,
he apparently suffered for that in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the poll of voters conducted by the television networks
and The Associated Press contained no denominational questions,
many politicians suggested that the governor's visit two weeks ago
to Bob Jones University, which is often accused of
anti-Catholicism, had hurt him among Roman Catholic voters in the
blue-collar suburbs of Detroit and other big cities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, George Bush, lost centrist voters to Bill
Clinton, and with them the election of 1992, and then Bob Dole did
the same thing in 1996. This year, the Republican leaders who
flocked to the Texas governor did so in large part because they
thought he would have broader appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Delighted though he was to do so well here, McCain must worry
about the uncomfortable degree to which his advantage depended upon
Democrats and independents. Bush took two-thirds of the Republican
vote, and only the astounding fact that Democrats and independents
accounted for more than 50 percent of Tuesday's electorate pulled
the Arizona senator through.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that the non-Republican turnout reached record
proportions for a Republican primary, partly because of local
ballot issues in some places. There were hints that at least a few
Democrats deliberately voted in the Republican primary to foul up
the other party's process.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael Flashner, 31, a Democratic sales representative in the
Detroit suburbs, backed McCain. Asked why, he replied: ``To tell
the truth, I'd like to see the process go on as long as it can,
because the more they beat each other up, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John M. Engler, who had put his political prestige on the
line for Bush, confessed Tuesday night that he may have
miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if we could just get the Republican vote out,'' he
said, ``we could withstand whatever Democrats and independents came
out for McCain. I didn't see any need to go up on television and
warn about this wave of Democratic and independent voters. Maybe
that was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to attract voters across party lines augurs well for
McCain's chances this fall, should he be nominated, but it will not
help him in many of the primaries that take place soon. Virginia's
voting next Tuesday and Georgia's and Ohio's on March 7 are open to
all registered voters, but only registered Republicans can vote in
primaries in Washington State next Tuesday and in New York on March
7. In California, also on March 7, non-Republicans can cast
ballots, but their votes will not count in awarding delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the electorate was much more balanced than in South
Carolina, from a number of points of view. Half the voters here
described themselves as conservatives; 60 percent did so in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, 34 percent called themselves Christian
conservatives. Fewer than 3 voters in 10 here said they identified
with the religious right, a decline from 1988, when Pat Robertson
ran strongly here, and 1996, when Patrick J. Buchanan took 34
percent of the total in giving Dole a tough fight.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson recorded telephone messages to Michigan voters this
year urging them to turn out in support of Bush, accusing McCain of
having chosen, in former Sen. Warren E. Rudman of New Hampshire, a
``vicious bigot'' as national chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Because the voting here followed almost immediately on the heels
of that in South Carolina, the results there may not have had time
to sink in and generate a surge for Bush. Not until election day
itself, the exit poll indicated, did a small swing to the Texas
governor get under way.
</P>
<P>
   Michiganders, subjected for a much shorter period to bombardment
by the artillery of radio and television advertisements, took a
different view of the candidates on important points. There, McCain
was seen as the less fair of the two contenders; here, Bush was,
although McCain took a more caustic tone in his personal
appearances. There, Bush and McCain were seen as equally likely to
say what they believed rather than what people wanted to hear;
here, McCain had an advantage on that score.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Breadon, a United Auto Workers member who works on a
Chrysler production line, said in explaining his vote for McCain:
``I really don't care for George Bush. He seems like a daddy's boy.
He seems like a weasel.'' An independent, Breadon voted in Royal
Oak, north of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the voters said they belonged to a union, and McCain
took 6 of every 10 votes in that group. But that margin lent little
credibility to the argument, voiced by some Bush backers, that the
state's big trade unions had set out to disrupt Engler's pro-Bush
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McCain seemed to have gone some way toward
reclaiming his identity as a reformer, for which Bush successfully
challenged in the last few weeks with the slogan proclaiming
himself a ``reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, McCain did less well than he had hoped among two
groups he has targeted. A Vietnam veteran who spent years as a
prisoner of war, he got the votes of only slightly more veterans
than Bush. And he did less well than his rival among young voters,
especially under 30.

THIS 30-YEAR-OLD `CUB' IS OUT ON HIS OWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the risk of offering trite advice gleaned from watching too
many vintage television sitcoms, sometimes ``Father Knows Best.''
Especially if you're a 30-year-old rookie on the PGA Tour, and dad
is the greatest player the game has known.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Gary Nicklaus will spend this week in Tucson, Ariz.,
seeking to boost his position on the money list, rather than follow
his instincts and stay in Florida to prepare for four consecutive
events in his home state. While plotting his schedule, the younger
Nicklaus initially planned to skip the Tucson Open, which begins
tomorrow, after playing six consecutive events on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Jack, looked at the dates of the Tucson event _
which overlap this week's Match Play Championship _ and pointed out
that 64 of the world's best golfers will be in Carlsbad, Calif.
Their collective absence, he noted, should create plenty of room on
the Tucson leader board for rookies in need of large paychecks to
extend their playing privileges on the PGA Tour beyond this season.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, the cub took the Golden Bear's advice. He skipped last
week's event in Los Angeles in order to compete in Tucson. Of all
the tips he has been given by his famous father, Gary Nicklaus
considers the scheduling advice some of the most useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really helped me out with playing in certain tournaments,
where I should and where I shouldn't. And this is one I should play
in,'' said Nicklaus, who has earned two paychecks and $17,308 in
five starts as a tour rookie.
</P>
<P>
   What they never discuss is dealing with the sizable shadow cast
by his famous father, winner of a tour-record 18 major
championships as a professional golfer. After nine trips to PGA
Tour qualifying schools, as well as stints on the European,
Australian, Asian and Nike tours, the two figure Gary has come to
grips with being the ``Next Nicklaus'' in professional golf
circles. By now, he has had a decade to weigh the repercussions,
although this will be the first season PGA Tour galleries can watch
him strut his stuff on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My last name is a big last name. It brings interest because of
my dad,'' Gary Nicklaus said. ``If I play well, there will continue
to be attention. If I don't, it will go away. Dad knows I have
spent enough time around the world and should be able to handle
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dad agrees. As the third of four golfing Nicklaus sons, Gary
watched the attention envelop older brothers Jackie and Steve as
junior players before his first competitive round. He willingly
accepted the challenges of being the only Nicklaus son to play golf
at Ohio State, dad's alma mater, and to pursue a PGA Tour career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary is realistic,'' Jack Nicklaus said. ``His work is in
front of him, and he has to believe in himself. He was good enough
to get on the PGA Tour because of his own abilities. Now, he has to
convince himself he can play with these guys and beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure on him is enormous. But he knows there will
always be pressure, and he welcomes it. He doesn't expect to be
Jack Nicklaus. He expects to be Gary Nicklaus. All he wants to do
is see what Gary Nicklaus can do with his ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the results are unclear. Nicklaus' best finish was
46th at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. He ranks among the top half
of tour participants in driving distance (267.6 yards) but is in
the bottom 10 percent in driving accuracy (59 percent). His scoring
average (72.13) ranks 144th among tour participants and his
final-round scoring average (75.5) is downright atrocious.
</P>
<P>
   But the season is young. One event could jump-start a
turnaround, and Tucson, with its watered-down field, could be the
place.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, whose best finish as a professional was a tie for
third at last year's Wichita Open on the Nike Tour (now the Buy.com
Tour), said he's optimistic about his chances. After spending a
decade trying to become a regular on the PGA Tour, he's beginning
to feel as if he belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest improvement I've made over the past few years is
in my course management. I don't make as many mistakes as I used
to. And my putting has improved dramatically,'' said Nicklaus, who
ranks among the middle of the pack among tour putters (29.7 putts
per round). ``I never put a timetable on myself in terms of getting
out here. It seems like every time I started thinking about not
playing, I started playing well. Now, here I come in my first year.
It's definitely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Gary's presence has spurred his father to enter more
PGA Tour events than normal during early stages of the 2000 season.
That trend will not continue over the long haul, said Jack
Nicklaus, but he does plan to attend future events as a fan. And
he's always available for consultations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the ropes, and he can point me in the right
direction,'' Gary Nicklaus said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he has pointed Gary toward Tucson. We'll soon learn
if it proves to be sage advice in a rookie's quest to make his own
name on the PGA Tour.
 &LR; 84tb:The Perfect Match? NBC hopes match-play tournament yields
big-name final
That sigh of relief you heard from the television tower above the
18th green came from NBC officials, who are assured that Sunday's
finals of the Match Play Championship will not include a rematch of
last year's Jeff Maggert-Andrew Magee shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the M&AMP;M boys put on quite a show, extending themselves to
38 holes before Maggert prevailed. It made for great drama. But it
failed to pull the kind of ratings that a Sunday matchup between
two higher-profile players would generate.
</P>
<P>
   So there were no tears shed in the NBC production truck when
this year's bracket showed Maggert and Magee would meet in
Saturday's quarterfinals if they advance that far in the 64-player
event.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern to NBC is the fact that top seed Tiger Woods'
path to the final could be blocked by brushes with Justin Leonard,
Phil Mickelson, Jose Maria Olazabal or Nick Price. That is assuming
that Woods survives today's first-round matchup with Michael
Campbell, the No. 64 seed who has won four times since October on
the European and Australian tours.
</P>
<P>
   Included was Campbell's victory in November's Johnnie Walker
Classic in Thailand, with Woods in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always more difficult to win a match-play event because
it's a one-day deal,'' Woods said. ``Even if you shoot a great
round, somebody out-boat-races you and you're done. That's just the
way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, fresh off his victory at the Buick Invitational that
ended Woods' six-event winning streak, said answering Woods' Sunday
charge with four birdies over his final six holes has boosted his
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go against he best player in the world and come out on top
means a lot to me,'' said Mickelson, who skipped last week's Nissan
Open to practice for the match-play event. ``It gives me confidence
that I can play against the best and I can win. I feel like I'm
playing well right now, and I think I'm going to be able to give
\Ranyone\S a pretty good match.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the bracket, a Mickelson-Woods match could unfold in
Saturday's quarterfinals. If the top seeds prevail until Saturday
(don't hold your breath), the semifinal matches would be
Woods-Davis Love III and David Duval-Colin Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert, the defending champ, is the No. 20 seed this time.
Magee, the 1999 runner-up, is seeded 53rd.
\Nsubheds:Colonial adds pro-am MasterCard Colonial officials are
adding another pro-am event for the 2000 tournament, but with a
different twist. In fact, it will be played at a different course.
</P>
<P>
   The competition will unfold on Saturday of tournament week, as
part of the PGA Tour's ``Saturday Series'' that allows pros who
miss the 36-hole cut another opportunity to cover travel expenses.
The brainchild of longtime tour participant Gary Hallberg, the
Saturday events team pros who miss the cut with amateurs partners
in a one-day competition.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial's inaugural venture into the ``Saturday Series'' is
scheduled for May 20 at the north course of Ridglea Country Club.
The 8 a.m. shotgun start would leave amateurs free to catch the
afternoon action at Colonial. Cost for the Saturday pro-am package,
dubbed the ``Champion's Club Package,'' is $3,600 and includes the
Saturday tee time as well as tournament badges.
</P>
<P>
   Purchasers of the Saturday pro-am package receive priority for
future openings in the tournament's Monday and Wednesday pro-ams,
which come with a steeper price tag ($6,000) but have a waiting
list for participants.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials already are selling the Saturday pro-am
packages. They plan to begin taking orders for daily passes and
tournament badges March 1. For information, call (817) 927-4280.
\Nsubheds:Lofty goal Brandie Burton has yet to be a significant
leader-board presence since returning to the LPGA Tour after
missing the 1999 season because of shoulder surgery. But that does
not stop Burton, a two-time major champion (du Maurier Classic,
1993 and 1998), from focusing on extending her streak of four
consecutive appearances at the Solheim Cup, the LPGA's equivalent
of the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, 28, has been a member of every Solheim Cup team for
which she has been eligible since joining the tour in 1991. She
does not plan to end that streak in 2000, despite spotting peers a
one-year head start in accumulating points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the ultimate goal of mine. Every year I've played on
tour, I have played in the Solheim Cup, and I want to keep that
going,'' Burton said. ``I know I have a lot of work to do. But with
double points this year \Rfor victories and top-10 finishes\S, that
might help.'' \Nsubheds:Upon further review PGA of America
officials have amended a controversial rule that determines the
eligibility of U.S. participants in the Ryder Cup. By a vote of
20-0, the PGA board of directors altered a 1927 rule mandating that
U.S. participants must be born on American soil. The new rule,
approved last week and put in effect for the 2001 Ryder Cup,
requires that participants become naturalized U.S. citizens by age
18.
</P>
<P>
   The old rule drew criticism last year, when Canadian-born Brian
Watts was not allowed to accrue Ryder Cup points even though he
moved to the United States as an infant and became a U.S. citizen
as a teen-ager. If he qualifies, Watts now would be eligible to
play for the Unites States.
</P>
<P>
   Will Mann, PGA of America president, said the change was made to
``avoid unfairly penalizing American citizens who otherwise would
be eligible for the U.S. Ryder Cup team.''
\Nsubheds:Breaking the bank Tiger Woods, in only his fifth season
on the PGA Tour, already holds the tour record for career earnings
and added distance between himself and runner-up Davis Love III.

\Nsubheds:LPGA golden moment ``To commemorate the LPGA Tour's 50th
anniversary, the ''Star-Telegram'' will feature a significant
moment in tour history each week this season.'' July 8, 1962
</P>
<P>
   During the final round of the Kelly Girl Open in Ellicott City,
Md., a fifth-year pro from Texas picked up her first career
victory. Kathy Whitworth, a native of Monahans, finished with a
3-under-par total to defeat another young Texan, Fort Worth native
Sandra Haynie, who had recorded her first career victory June 10 in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Few in 1962 realized the significance of Whitworth's initial
triumph. But it became the first of 88 career victories for the
Trophy Club resident, setting a record for all professional
golfers. Her 88 victories is seven more than the PGA Tour record,
held by Sam Snead. Appropriately, the first victory in Whitworth's
record-setting collection involved a battle of future Hall of
Famers. Haynie, the runner-up, went on to win 42 titles.
</P>
<P>
   Whitworth, a seven-time LPGA Player of the Year, won her last
event at the 1985 United Virginia Bank Classic. From 1962-78,
Whitworth won at least one tournament each season and led the tour
in earnings eight times.
\Nsubheds:Tips from the pros ``Each week, the ''Star-Telegram
``will feature a tip from a professional golf instructor based in
Tarrant County. Today's tip is from John Rhodes, a Fort Worth-based
teacher selected as one of the ``100 Best Instructors in America''
by ''Golf ``magazine. A former assistant pro at Colonial Country
Club, Rhodes tutors several players on the PGA, LPGA and Buy.com
tours. He is director of instruction for Progressive Golf
Institute.'' \Nsubheds:Understanding the swing plane Through the
years, much has been written about the golf swing plane. Yet many
students struggle to understand how to apply this principle to
their game.
</P>
<P>
   A simple way to understand the swing plane is through the ``law
of parallel.'' This law states that, when the golf club is ``on
plane'' to the target, the club will be parallel or pointing to the
base of the swing plane, or intended target line.
</P>
<P>
   A practical way to practice this concept is to set up a training
station. Take two yardsticks or clubs. Place one, which we'll call
the outer rail, aimed at the target. Place the other, which we'll
call the inner rail, on your toe line parallel to the target line.
This setup gives the appearance of railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Place your feet along the inner rail, with the ball along the
outer rail. Then take a nine-step walk through the law of parallel:
</P>
<P>
   1. From a normal stance, take back the club until the shaft is
parallel with the ground and the railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   2. Fold your right elbow and cock your wrist so the club is on
approximately a 45-degree angle to the target line and the butt of
your club is pointing at the outer rail.
</P>
<P>
   3. As you reach the top of the backswing, the club will be
parallel with the ground and the railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   4. From the top of the backswing, allow the arms to begin
descending in the same 45-degree angle as in Step 2, with the butt
of the club pointing at the outer rail.
</P>
<P>
   5. Return through Step 1, with the club parallel with the ground
and railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   6. At impact, the club is pointing at the base of the swing
plane: the outer rail.
</P>
<P>
   7. After impact, swing the club to parallel with the ground and
the railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   8. Fold the left elbow and recock your wrist so the club is on
approximately a 45-degree angle and the butt end of your grip is
pointing at the outer rail.
</P>
<P>
   9. Finish with the club over your left shoulder parallel to the
ground and railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   After walking through the steps of the ``law of parallel,'' make
slow-motion swings hitting a 7-iron only 100 yards. After some
success with these drills, start hitting full shots trusting your
aim and plane.

BANK ROBBER WANTED TO DIE, JURY TOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A former Los Angeles police officer accused of
letting North Hollywood bank robber Emil Matasareanu bleed to death
testified Tuesday that the wounded gunman wanted to die.
</P>
<P>
   As an ambulance left the shooting scene with a wounded civilian,
retired Los Angeles Police Department Detective James Vojtecky said
he ran after it, arms waving, to demand that the crew call another
ambulance specifically for Matasareanu, who lay bleeding from 29
gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see him in court,'' said Vojtecky, who testified
Matasareanu tried to roll around repeatedly to speed the flow of
blood from his wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Matasareanu, and his accomplice, Larry Phillips Jr., wounded 17
people with machine-gun fire in the nationally televised shootout
nearly three years ago before they were killed. Matasareanu's
family has sued the city in federal court, claiming he was allowed
to bleed to death without medical attention, violating his civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Vojtecky strongly challenged the central
contention of the defense - that in the aftermath of the ferocious
Feb. 28, 1997, shootout between police and the robbers it was too
dangerous to treat Matasareanu in the hour he lay bleeding before
dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it was too dangerous for an ambulance to come
in,'' said Vojtecky. ``I never directed anyone to stay away from
that suspect, especially medical aid. I directed them to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Firefighter Allen Skier testified that he went to
the Matasareanu scene, where he hoped to rescue an injured police
officer, in defiance of an order from the Fire Department to stay
out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   After treating a wounded civilian, Skier said, he went to treat
Matasareanu - ``to give him a fair shot'' - and a plain-clothes
officer yelled, ``Get out of here, there's other suspects in the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Skier, an emergency medical technician, told the jury he could
not identify the officer who said that and cannot now remember
telling attorneys for the city of Los Angeles, also a defendant in
the case, that it was Vojtecky.
</P>
<P>
   Vojtecky denied making the statement, although he acknowledged
he might have said something similar to the ambulance crew.
</P>
<P>
   Skier said he did not believe the officer's intent was to
deprive Matasareanu of medical aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the officer was actually trying to save me and my
partner by asking us to leave,'' said Skier.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighter said he had heard dispatch reports of up to
eight gunmen and said he heard more gunfire even after Matasareanu
lay handcuffed and accomplice Phillips was dead. That reinforces a
claim by attorneys on both sides that more than two robbers were
involved, which the LAPD has steadfastly denied.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the officer's warning, Skier said he walked to within
two feet of Matasareanu, who was unresponsive, gasping, ashen from
blood loss and ``riddled with bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he was at death's door,'' Skier said.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing for his own life and given Matasareanu's apparent
condition, Skier said he decided not to treat him, which he said
would have required far more than his basic first-aid training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was better to leave with the civilian in the back of
my ambulance and possibly save his life,'' Skier said.
</P>
<P>
   Vojtecky said Matasareanu was bleeding ``profusely'' for a
period he described as ``entirely too long'' while lying face-down
and handcuffed on Archwood Street until a second ambulance arrived,
by which time Matasareanu had died.
</P>
<P>
   Vojtecky, who was in charge of the scene around Matasareanu,
said that when no ambulance was available he considered taking the
robber to the hospital in a police cruiser, but decided against it
out of concern for worsening Matasareanu's injuries and exposing
himself to civil liability.
</P>
<P>
   Vojtecky said he believed Matasareanu wanted to commit suicide
by rolling over on his back, a move the U.S. District Court jury
saw in a series of short video clips played during questioning by
plaintiffs' attorney Stephen Yagman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more he moved, the more he bled,'' Vojtecky said,
describing the reasons he instructed co-defendant John Futrell, a
former LAPD officer, to keep Matasareanu from writhing around. ``I
whispered in (Futrell's) ear, Don't let this man move. He wants to
bleed out on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vojtecky said he handcuffed Matasareanu and tried twice to
engage him in a conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey listen, pal, it's all over with,'' Vojtecky recalled
saying, as well as asking the robber his name.
</P>
<P>
   Matasareanu's only reply was to curse at him, Vojtecky said, and
repeatedly say, ``Shoot me in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Vojtecky said he did not hear the robber cry out for help three
times, as testified to by an Archwood Street resident Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When the ambulance began backing away to leave with the injured
civilian, Vojtecky said he ran after it and stopped it.

them,'' Vojtecky said. ``I said in no uncertain terms to send
another ambulance to this location.''

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The Rockets did not lose Tuesday night's game
Tuesday. They lost it in October, in Fayetteville, N.C., of all
places.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hornets coach Paul Silas might have made the move eventually.
But that night, playing the Rockets in an otherwise meaningless
exhibition, he gave in to using the lineup he had hoped to avoid.
He played his three big men _ Derrick Coleman, Anthony Mason and
Elden Campbell _ together, and the combination worked so well
against the Rockets that night, he etched it in stone.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rockets returned to North Carolina on Tuesday, it was
still too much for them to handle. Coleman and Mason led the
Hornets to a 102-97 win as the Rockets' frustration multiplied
beyond the torment of a painful three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we played them 10 times, we'd spank them nine,'' Rockets
guard Steve Francis lamented.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hornets, who presently would be seeded fourth in the
Eastern Conference playoffs, did not seem a one-night fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman made 14 of 22 shots, pairing a season-high 32 points
with a game-high 12 rebounds. The 14 field goals were one shy of
his career high. Mason had his first triple double of the season,
amassing 12 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick is a horse right now,'' Silas said. ``Every night he's
coming with it. He's tough to stop down low. He's our go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mase had a triple double. He's loving life. He's playing well.
He's defending. We put him on (Cuttino) Mobley, and he probably did
the best of anyone. He does whatever I ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets said the Hornets could not expect Coleman to have a
``career night'' _ as Francis labeled it _ every night. But they
also caught Eddie Jones on one of his worst nights. The All-Star
starter made just three of 13 shots, finishing with nine points,
his fewest in 26 games.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Rockets eventually slowed Coleman enough inside to
erase a 12-point deficit and take a four-point lead of their own in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But then the other benefit of the Hornets' big frontcourt _ born
in a hockey arena on the other side of the state _ eventually beat
the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Because Charlotte has such an imposing frontcourt to defend the
basket like palace guards, teams typically fire up 3-pointers in
bunches against the Hornets. Only Milwaukee allows a higher
percentage of bombs to go in than does Charlotte. But no team had
tried as many as the 28 the Rockets shot Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After 1-of-11 second-half 3-point shooting doomed them against
the Spurs on Sunday, the Rockets put up another 1-of-11 in the
first half Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They stayed in the game when Francis (24 points, eight assists)
chewed up backup guard Baron Davis, the player chosen right after
him in the draft, and Kenny Thomas (20 points, eight rebounds)
began getting loose inside. They finally began hitting from the
outside in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But in a seven-minute stretch in the fourth quarter, the Rockets
missed seven consecutive treys as their four-point lead evaporated
into a five-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Francis had hit a 3-pointer with 8:55 left for an 83-81 lead.
And when Mobley took a pass from Carlos Rogers to the basket, the
Rockets were up 85-81, their largest lead of the night. But in the
next six minutes, they managed just four points _ on a Hakeem
Olajuwon post move and a Mobley drive past Jones to the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't grab it,'' Francis said. ``We had the lead. We
just didn't take advantage of it. We had turnovers, missed easy
layups. I missed easy 3-point shots. We took a lot of outside
shots. A lot of my shots were in and out, in and out, in and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were definitely double- and triple-teaming Dream
(Olajuwon). It was relatively hard to get the ball to him. But we
had a lot of open outside shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The last missed 3-pointer became the Rockets' latest complaint
with the officiating. Coach Rudy Tomjanovich closely watched tape
of several plays, leaving his description of what he was examining
as ``just basketball plays.''
</P>
<P>
   But Matt Bullard said his miss with 3{ minutes left was another
in a series of shots in which he was hit on the arm with no foul
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it impossible to make a 3-point shot with my arm
knocked away in the middle of my release,'' Bullard said. ``I've
been fouled like that quite a bit. I almost never get a call. When
Dr. Naismith invented the game, getting hit on the arm while
shooting had to be the first foul he wrote down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said he did not have a problem with the number of
3-pointers the Rockets launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never put a number on it,'' he said. ``A couple of
possessions we didn't do what we needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   His greater problem was with the 3-pointer that might have been
the biggest. Francis missed a trey before David Wesley scored with
3:49 left to regain the lead for Charlotte at 91-89. Then, after
Bullard's missed 3, Wesley made a step as if he were heading down
the lane, Thomas moved to help defensively, and Coleman was left to
nail his third 3-pointer for a 94-89 Hornets lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left a guy wide-open who was the hottest man on the floor
at crunch time,'' Tomjanovich said. ``You don't deserve to win if
you leave somebody that wide-open.''
</P>
<P>
   A Francis jumper put the Rockets within range. But with one
minute left, he tried one more 3. It clanged around the rim and
bounced out, and the Hornets went up by seven before the Rockets
found their 3-point range in the last 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   By then it was too late. The Rockets didn't know, however, that
their fate might have been sealed four months earlier.

WINNING STREAK, PART II
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Five games into an arduous six-game road
trip, the only thing the Los Angeles Lakers seem to have lost is
their sense of drama.
</P>
<P>
   There were no fourth-quarter comebacks Tuesday, no swatted shots
at the buzzer, no theatric, game-saving steals and certainly no
shreds of suspense as they matter-of-factly dispensed with the New
Jersey Nets 97-89 at Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Just another night, just another victory, their eighth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The best the overmatched Nets could do was ride a 17-point,
third-quarter spurt from Stephon Marbury (33 points), but they
never got closer than seven points in the second half, and the
Lakers avoided a potential letdown as they near the end of this
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them this is a night that you can come out and feel
really flat about the game,'' coach Phil Jackson said, ``but you
have to go out and establish the momentum early and play the
defense you have to play. And once we got the lead, I thought we
kind of let up a little bit. We had to get back into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant struggled early, and Glen Rice
struggled late, but one or another was always clicking, and O'Neal
quietly marched to 35 points and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in six games, O'Neal actually dipped below 50
percent at the foul line, hitting 5 of 12 free throws, and he
struggled early from the field _ 2 for 8 in the first quarter. But
he was 9 for 13 in the second half and finished 15 of 26.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the lack of practice time on this road trip has
hurt O'Neal slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he shot poorly. He shot poorly to start the game and
he didn't get going on the kind of roll we expected him to have,''
Jackson said. ``He didn't shoot his free throws well tonight and
yet you come out and look at the box, it looks great. And he had a
wonderful game, all in all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers (42-11) have played five games in five cities in
eight days, and the previous four all involved tight fourth
quarters. It's taken at least a little bit out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably,'' O'Neal said. ``I think we played down to the level
of our competition. We had a couple spurts there where we played,
but we just let them get back in it. Marbury got them back in it,
single-handedly. He made a lot of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   After shutting down small and speedy Allen Iverson at
Philadelphia on Sunday, Bryant had a tougher time containing small
and speedy Marbury. After a six-point first half, Marbury exploded
in the third and scored 27 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're totally different players,'' Bryant said. ``Marbury,
I've only played against maybe once since I've been in the league,
so to tell the truth, I really haven't had a feel for how he plays.
. . . Our rotations were a little slow (in the third quarter). We
let him get off. He started hitting some jump shots, going behind
the screen-roll and he got going.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Bryant, who scored 13 of his 21 points in the second
half, though it took a lot of shots to get there. He finished 9 for
20 and admitted his sprained right index finger is bothering him.
</P>
<P>
   Rice added 15 points and six rebounds and the Lakers got a nice
boost from the bench _ 17 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists.
O'Neal even got a rare five-minute breather in the second quarter,
and Travis Knight responded with four points.
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers' winning streak continued _ they've lost just once
this month _ but they remain a half-game behind the Portland Trail
Blazers, with their last head-to-head matchup looming next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gained any ground on Portland,'' Jackson said,
``But that doesn't matter, we're keeping the pressure on them, and
right now we have to play the second fiddle. And to do that we have
to stay really solid and play hard and keep the pressure on them.
Then we'll be OK.''

BRUINS TRY CURING TURNOVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA Bruins watched a short-subject video
Monday afternoon in their Pauley Pavilion locker room. It was a
comedy, but no one laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The video showed many of UCLA's 45 turnovers in losses at
Arizona State and Arizona last weekend. It showed stupid passes,
bad catches and mental lapses. It showed the Bruins botching simple
plays and repeating mistakes that should have been corrected in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The coaches) kept rewinding it, so it seemed a lot longer
than 10 minutes,'' UCLA guard Billy Knight said. ``They wanted to
engrave in our heads that we need to protect the ball. We're too
loosey-goosey.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are last in the Pac-10 in turnovers (17.8 per game)
and ninth in turnover margin (minus-three per game). Because many
are live-ball mistakes _ there's no stoppage of play to set the
defense _ they lead directly to opponent layups.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame? It starts at the top and trickles down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I've done a poor job of getting this team to where
it needs to be in terms of passing and catching,'' Bruins coach
Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, UCLA devoted Monday's practice to the basics:
passing and catching with two hands, passing into the low post,
passing against pressure defense, protecting the ball, maintaining
balance, reading defenses, moving without the ball. Tuesday's
workout was more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a new drill: the 60-point game,'' Knight said. ``You
get one point for every pass and no points for turnovers. The
losing team has to run and no one wants to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have been doing it the whole season, but coach Lavin
forgot about it. He just remembered. I guess they did it two years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rush update: The NCAA's five-member appeals committee will
hear JaRon Rush's case on Friday by conference call. UCLA will
present the case in conjunction with Rush and his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping (for a ruling) that day,'' UCLA athletic director
Peter Dalis said. ``According to people I've talked to, (the
appeals committee) gives you a response later that day. Sometimes,
they deliberate more and you hear the next day. We wouldn't,
because it's a Saturday, so it would be Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has appealed Rush's 29-game suspension (12 this season, 17
next) for accepting $6,125 from his former AAU coach, Myron Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rush is in Kansas City giving his second grand-jury
testimony about Piggie, who's reportedly being investigated by
federal authorities for for tax evasion and fraud. During his first
grand-jury appearance, in November, Rush said he had taken money
from Piggie. The FBI notified UCLA, which suspended Rush on Dec.
10.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Guard Ray Young (bruised tailbone) and forward
Jason Kapono (tendinitis, left knee) missed Monday's practice but
returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had tendinitis since (Artesia High) coach (Wayne) Merino
busted my butt in summer workouts,'' Kapono said. ``It's nothing
big, just a flare-up. It will never bother me in a game. I'll play
with a broken leg.''

KINGS LOOKING FOR VETERAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Unlike the Los Angeles Kings season, there
are few bumps on the road to Swift Current, Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long and flat drive, about five hours east of here.
Plenty of time to think for general manager Dave Taylor, who made
the trip Tuesday to scout a junior hockey tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, however, said he did not read too much into Monday's 6-3
loss to Edmonton, when the Kings had a hard time containing Oilers
tough guy Georges Laraque (three goals).
</P>
<P>
   Taylor thinks the team has played well in physical situations.
He likes the makeup of captain Rob Blake, Sean O'Donnell, Ian
Laperriere and Steve McKenna and applauded the way the Kings
refused to be baited into fighting during last Friday's 3-2 victory
at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't see it as that rough a game,'' said Taylor,
who will be back for tonight's game against the Calgary Flames.
``There were only two fights. Guys like Mike Grier and Laraque like
to take the body, but I don't think I can remember the last time
Laraque had a hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to retaliate is to go on the power play and
score.''
</P>
<P>
   With three weeks to the March 14 trading deadline, teams will be
looking to gear themselves toward the more physical style that
takes over during the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Taylor did not dismiss the possibility of adding a big
forward before the deadline. Montreal forward Shayne Corson, who
has been to the postseason nine times during his 13-year career,
has been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   At 33, Corson is on the downside of his career, but he fits the
Kings in several areas. He has playoff experience, and most of the
Kings have very little. Leading scorer Ziggy Palffy never has been
to the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   His $2.25 million salary is reasonable, especially since there
isn't much time left in the season. He also would give his new team
some flexibility since he is not signed beyond this season.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor would not speak of specific players, but the one he is
looking for certainly sounded like he could have helped against the
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to improve our team like a lot of teams, but at
what cost,'' he said. ``If we could get a little grittier up front,
we would do that. Not necessarily a fighter but a physical forward
with good character.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick whistles: One problem with Corson. After playing poorly
all season, the young Canadiens are just five points from a playoff
spot, probably too close right now to trade veteran leadership. . .
. Bob Corkum had an off-night Monday despite playing well since
signing with the Kings two months ago. He won just 25 percent of
faceoffs, his specialty. . . . Taylor remains high on defenseman
Aki Berg, who was manhandled by Laraque. Berg was scratched for the
first two games of the trip for lackluster play. Usually he
responds well after benchings. ``He's young and he still has some
things to learn,'' Taylor said. ``(Monday) doesn't change the fact
that he is a very good package with very good skills.''

M'S CLUBHOUSE HAS THAT EMPTY FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ It was like coming to town the day after the
circus left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your eyes go over there, don't they?'' Dan Wilson asked a
clubhouse visitor.
</P>
<P>
   The extra-large space devoted to the locker of Ken Griffey Jr.
in the Mariners clubhouse has been remodeled into blandness.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Stan Javier has the space next to Jay Buhner. Mike
Cameron has the center-field job.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Alex Rodriguez, because he also may be gone.
</P>
<P>
   As one Mariners newcomer after another walked around introducing
himself to one Mariners veteran after another, the first day when
all showed up to spring training was mostly about the guy who
wasn't showing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more subdued in the clubhouse,'' Rodriguez said.
``It's not as exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some work to do on chemistry and camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring training was the best time to be around Griffey. He felt
great, had no pressure, the Mariners were 0-0 and he wasn't tired
from running down gappers surrendered by Seattle pitching.
</P>
<P>
   He plotted playful intrigues for newcomers, had dirt on just
about every vet, savaged all sportswriters' fashion sense, offered
up the rawest jokes for the clubhouse workers and played head games
with anyone wanting to know what's in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a lot of fun to be around,'' said Edgar Martinez, the
only player with more years in the organization. ``He'd laugh all
the time, joke around, play games. He always had something funny to
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always wanted to make people feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   After his trade to Cincinnati, many are uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real sad, no doubt about it,'' said Michael Spears, the
longtime clubhouse assistant and Griffey sidekick known as Jams.
``I like everybody here, but ... it's just not the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys won't say it, but it hurts a lot of them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the transitory world of major league baseball, Griffey was
the rare bedrock for a franchise whose history has much more tumult
than triumph. His 11 years in the major league clubhouse, most of
them as undisputed leader, make his absence so profound that it
even provokes some denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he's gone,'' Buhner said. ``It's like he's on
the disabled list for a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   But before matters disintegrate into a maudlin weepfest, it is
worth recalling the Tom Hanks dictum from ``A League of Their
Own:'' There is no crying in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The fact was, Tuesday was the worst day of the rest of the
Mariners' post-Griffey lives (with the possible exception of a
Reds' sweep in the World Series). Every new day is one small
advance away from the Griffey Mariners that had two straight losing
seasons and only one playoff game win in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   As much fun as Griffey could be, as delightful as he was to
watch, as much missed as will be his climbs up the wall and his run
through history, he wore some people out.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, for example, being a pitcher during Griffey's
years-long lament about the chronically undernourished mound staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked to get on pitchers and rag 'em a little bit,'' said
pitcher Ken Cloude. ``For some guys that worked, for some guys that
didn't. I'm sure you heard his favorite line: `Where's my
pitching?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, it was a comfort to have him in center field
backing you up. No question about the guy's physical ability. He's
a great player.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've always wondered how he would conduct himself
somewhere else. It'll be interesting to see how he goes about his
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The star power of Griffey was so immense that the franchise
mutated around him, bending to his talents and wishes. From
game-day jerseys to travel to lineups to jobs for family to field
dimensions, he dictated almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   The kowtowing for Griffey was hardly a first in major league
baseball. But it is unusual, and wrenching, when the same
well-serviced guy, in the prime of his career, rips a hole in a
franchise that practically shared his DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always hard for me to read him,'' Rodriguez said. ``But
I thought he was a Mariner for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Naively, so did many.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the first day of things never being the same. As
Wilson put it, ``You anticipate this, but the shock isn't until you
get here and see there's no No. 24 with his name on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But baseball shock is almost never fatal. Hey, they once even
canceled the World Series for no good reason, and here we are,
still playing ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we play well and win some ballgames,'' Cloude said,
``it's going to be forgotten pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten? Well, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Gotten over? Tuesday was the start.

   ROMULUS, Mich. _ Aides to Sen. John McCain acknowledged Tuesday
night that the campaign placed thousands of phone calls to Roman
Catholics in Michigan telling them about Gov. George W. Bush's
appearance at Bob Jones University earlier this month and
describing Jones as someone with a history of anti-Catholic
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply pointed out a fact,'' Rick Davis, manager of the
McCain campaign, said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis acknowledged that the campaign made the calls late in the
day as polls were closing in the Michigan primary, which McCain won
by 6 percentage points. Earlier in the day, after Bush had
complained about the calls, a spokesman for McCain, Howard Opinsky,
denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Opinsky's earlier denial, Davis said the
spokesman had not been told of the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the phone calls did not conflict with McCain's pledge
to refrain from running negative advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This I don't believe to be outside the realm of a positive
campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded angrily to the disclosure. ``I'm not bitter at
all,'' he said on Tuesday night after arriving in Burbank, Calif,
from Michigan. ``I don't like being called a bigot, and I don't
particularly care for a campaign that denies all day long that they
did this, and all of a sudden now, as soon as they win, admits
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The call to Catholic voters prompted Bush on Tuesday to try to
assure the state's Roman Catholics that he was a friend who
deserved their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you,'' he said, ``John McCain, he's a man who's
called me an anti-Catholic bigot, and I don't appreciate it,'' Bush
said during a visit to a restaurant in nearby Royal Oak on Tuesday
morning. ``That's shameful politics.''
</P>
<P>
   To pound home the governor's message, the Bush campaign
electronically mailed, in the span of just 42 minutes after 1 p.m.,
nine news releases containing statements from nine Republican
governors, all of whom denounced the telephone calls. Many of the
governors are Catholic, and many assumed that the McCain campaign
was to blame for the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah called McCain's tactics
``shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts labeled McCain a ``typical
Washington politician who says one thing then does another,''
echoing some of Bush's attack ads, and said, ``He should be
ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also released a similar statement from Tom
Monaghan, the founder of Domino's Pizza and an active benefactor of
Catholic causes in the Detroit area.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Roman Catholic,'' Monaghan said, ``I am offended that my
faith is being used as a negative smear tactic to divide people in
a political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a script of the telephone call that the Bush
campaign released Tuesday, a recorded message notes that Bush
visited Bob Jones University, whose officers have in the past made
anti-Catholic statements. Bush has said repeatedly over the last
few days that he does not agree with those statements and has noted
that his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The script provided by the Bush campaign reads: ``Gov. George
Bush has campaigned against Senator John McCain by seeking the
support of Southern fundamentalists who have expressed
anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Jones has made strong anti-Catholic statements, including
calling the pope anti-Christ, the Catholic church a satanic cult,''
according to the script. ``Governor Bush has stayed silent.''
</P>
<P>
   By releasing the script and the blizzard of statements, the Bush
campaign was perhaps doing more than assuring Catholics that they
had nothing to fear from the governor.
</P>
<P>
   It may also have been diverting attention from reports that the
evangelist Pat Robertson, a supporter of Bush, had recorded and
sent an incendiary telephone message branding McCain a foe of
conservative Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Several political analysts said that the Robertson call,
emblematic of the tough politics that Bush's allies on the
religious right used to guarantee Bush's victory in the South
Carolina primary, could hurt Bush with moderate voters if he does
not quickly establish some distance from Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be put back into the bottle,'' Scott Reed, who ran
Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, said of Robertson.
``Somebody should pick up the phone and tell him to stop. He is way
over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Tuesday that Robertson had made the calls
independently of his campaign, an assertion that Robertson
confirmed.

BRASS PACIFIES `A NEW' WHITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ A day after voicing concern over his role,
Devon White got a better handle on the center-field situation
Tuesday from the Dodgers brass.
</P>
<P>
   As position players reported to Dodgertown in preparation for
today's first full-squad workout, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson and
general manager Kevin Malone, along with senior vice president
Derrick Hall, held separate meetings with White.
</P>
<P>
   It was done to ease tension among all sides and give White
clarification as to what he needs to do better this season. And
White got the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is in question now is my defense, and when I came into
the league I was a defensive player,'' White said. ``I'm not a good
defensive player anymore? You tell me. I'm going to go out and give
my best effort.''
</P>
<P>
   When healthy, White is one of the top defensive center fielders
in baseball. But his 1999 season was blemished with hamstring, neck
and groin injuries, not to mention a sore shoulder that kept him
from diving for some balls. But White tried to keep that quiet,
because he doesn't want to use injuries as an excuse, Dodgers
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   White was booed by fans for his play, and questions about his
commitment began to leak out when he missed games because of
nagging injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Devo is committed to showing the Dodger fans that he's
100 percent this year, and they're going to see a new Devon
White,'' Malone said. ``He's going to run more. His legs feel much
better. If he's healthy, he wants to prove to the Dodger fans that
he's going to have a good year, and he's disappointed that he
didn't have the type of year he wanted to in '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to show the fans this year that he's going to be
the type of player that he was, a Gold Glover, and run and play the
type of game we need played. He's going to play defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to settle the issue early, Johnson and Malone both
said White is the starting center fielder _ but there is one
stipulation.
</P>
<P>
   White must be healthy, and right now he's not. His left
shoulder, on which he had surgery in October to repair cartilage,
is less than 100 percent. But Malone said White would be ready by
opening day. Should White not be ready, Todd Hollandsworth is
waiting in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   __ Looking for a lefty: Left-handers hit .156 off Dodgers lefty
Pedro Borbon last season, but he's now in Toronto. The job of
facing left-handed hitters late in a close game this season should
fall to 22-year-old Onan Masaoka, who was protected by Johnson for
much of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel confident enough I could do it,'' said Masaoka, who
held lefties to a .217 average last season. ``When I heard (Borbon)
got traded, I wasn't happy about it, but I know a spot opened up.
If I can fill it, I would take that as a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   However, since the Dodgers have an surplus of right-handed
pitchers, a trade is possible if a left-hander becomes available
for the right price.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Though it's early and pitchers haven't faced
live hitting, the Dodgers are excited about how well Mike Fetters,
a Van Nuys native and Pepperdine product, has thrown the ball. . .
. Right-hander Antonio Osuna, trying to overcome elbow problems
that plagued him all last season, threw off the mound for the first
time since undergoing surgery in September.

LOOKS LIKE RICE IS STICKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Glen Rice is staying. No reinforcements
are coming. The Los Angeles Lakers, with the second best record in
the league, are standing pat as the NBA's trade deadline
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing going on here at all,'' Lakers executive Jerry
West said Wednesday. ``You can never rule out the possibility (of a
deal), but we don't have anything going at this point in time.
Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't figure to change before 3 p.m. Thursday, when
the league's window for making deals closes.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is the Lakers' most tradeable commodity and was the most
likely player to be moved because he's a free agent this summer,
with high salary demands. He's also had difficulty fitting into
coach Phil Jackson's system, though he's been hot for the last five
games.
</P>
<P>
   West, who traded for Rice last season, wants to keep him _ for
the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been actively trying to trade Glen Rice,'' West
said. ``A number of teams have called about him. Everyone wants us
to take their dregs. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Glen a lot personally. I want him to prosper. I've
developed a relationship with him that I think is important. The
important thing is for him to play great basketball and put the
pressure on us to re-sign him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice has been declining interviews for the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson preferred to acquire Bulls forward Toni Kukoc, who was
dealt last week to the Philadelphia 76ers. West did inquire about
Kukoc, but a deal was never close.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' greatest need, however, is a big man to back up
Shaquille O'Neal and play some power forward. That will have to
wait until the offseason, West said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches always want you to explore possibilities,'' he said.
``They've expressed some interest in some people that are not
available.''
</P>
<P>
   An ideal fit would be a player like Miami's P.J. Brown or
Toronto's Antonio Davis. More outlandish trade rumors have linked
the Lakers to overpaid, underachieving types like Cleveland's Shawn
Kemp and Washington's Juwan Howard. But the Lakers, wary of the NBA
luxury tax that kicks in after the 2001-02 season, won't take on
another high-salaried player (and, incidentally, were never
interested in either player).
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a salary structure and we're not going to pay a
luxury tax _ period,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers on an eight-game winning streak, West also sees
no reason to tinker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always get better,'' he said, ``but we've done pretty
well so far. I know a lot of other teams in the league would like
to be doing as well.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Waiting to exhale: Jackson said he's looking forward to the
trade deadline passing, though he sees a positive side to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's always a period of time that builds and builds
the tension. I kind of like it actually,'' he said. ``I like the
idea there's activity and the seat gets a little hot, and things
happen. You hope there's some things going on, conversations. But
the reality is that it's nerve-wracking sometimes for players. I
understand that. . . . I think as a coach right now, it will be a
relief for us Thursday to finally let it ride.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Gored: Jackson attended Monday night's debate between
Democratic presidential contenders Al Gore and Bill Bradley,
Jackson's close friend. He had fun with his assessment of the event
at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did compare Gore to kind of like (Philadelphia guard) Allen
Iverson, who was dancing around the 3-point line, going behind his
back and between his legs and not getting any scoring done,'' he
said.

 McCAIN IS BIG WINNER IN ARIZONA AND MICHIGAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In a brash comeback that threw the Republican
presidential race into turmoil, Sen. John McCain trounced Gov.
George W. Bush on Tuesday in Michigan, the biggest electoral prize
thus far, and in the senator's home state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush had long overshadowed the contest with his vast
endorsements and colossal war chest, his double-barreled defeats
set the stage for the most contentious and perhaps belligerent
Republican primary battle since Ronald Reagan came close to
toppling President Gerald R. Ford in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers had conceded that a loss here would have
effectively ended the contest. And Bush's advisers, confident of
victory in Michigan, had hoped to finally rid themselves of the
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McCain's two-state sweep quashed any notion among
Republicans that Bush is now their invincible nominee. The outcome
assured that what McCain called ``a wonderful, wonderful ride''
after his defeat in South Carolina would continue.
</P>
<P>
   It also means that a Republican nominee would probably not
emerge at least until after the candidates sprint through 16
primaries and caucuses over the next 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   With 86 percent of the election districts in Michigan reporting
at 1 a.m., the vote was:
</P>
<P>
   McCain: 573,877
</P>
<P>
   (50%)
</P>
<P>
   Bush: 510,134
</P>
<P>
   (44%)
</P>
<P>
   McCain, smiling broadly Tuesday night at a rally in Arizona,
immediately recast himself as a Reagan conservative who would
``protect the unborn.'' Putting forth a ``special plea'' to members
of his own party, who have overwhelming sided with Bush, he said,
``Don't fear this campaign my fellow Republicans. Join it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took an unmistakable dig at his rival: ``Today Michigan
sent a powerful message across America _ a message that our party
wants real reform from the real reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned his attention to the coming races, particularly
the delegate-rich California. ``Now we move ahead, our crusade is
spreading from state after state, attracting new people to our
great party.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside a hangar at an airport in Burbank, Calif., where he flew
Tuesday night from Michigan, Bush told about 200 supporters: ``I've
got some good news and some bad news. I just came from a primary
out in the Midwest. The bad news is I didn't win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, noting that he did much better than McCain among
Republicans in that contest, Bush added, ``You're looking at a man
who got 68 percent of the vote in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to congratulate my opponent for a race well run. But
he's going to learn that in the long run it's going to be
Republicans and like-minded independents who make the decision in
this primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Aboard his plane as it touched down on the runway, Bush also
talked about the Democratic presence in the Michigan primary as the
main reason for McCain's victory, and he noted: ``My Republican
vote is getting stronger and stronger. I'm very upbeat about my
chances to win the nomination. Obviously, I wish I'd won tonight.
But I didn't. There was some good news, there was a silver lining
in that cloud, and that is the overwhelming Republican vote, nearly
70 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush still enjoys numerous advantages. And, he noted the
calendar of coming contests where only registered Republicans can
vote will play to his strength.
</P>
<P>
   The voting on Tuesday left a dramatically different picture of
the Republican contest than on Saturday, when Bush defeated McCain
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   And because McCain has portrayed himself as a renegade who does
not mix well with his party's own establishment, his rise creates
huge headaches for leading Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The voting in Michigan has been watched closely not only because
the campaign here was marked by bitter accusations of unscrupulous
tactics on both sides, but, more important, because it is the first
large-state showdown of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan holds more delegates than any of the states that have
already voted combined. In edging out Bush here, McCain rode a wave
of independents and Democrats _ as well as people who had never
before taken part in a Republican primary. Those voters poured to
the polls, swelling turnout estimates to at least one million, more
than double the total in the 1996 primaries here.
</P>
<P>
   In fact more people voted in Michigan on Tuesday than in all the
previous primary states combined.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drew his strength from a different pool of voters: he
attracted far higher proportions of conservatives and Republican
loyalists _ a margin of more than 2 to 1 _ than McCain. But those
voters helped Bush more in South Carolina than here in the Midwest,
where the electorate is far less Republican _ and far less
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The two contests on Tuesday were especially critical for McCain
because after Bush's 11-point victory in South Carolina, he has
sought to demonstrate that he is not a one-state wonder who could
only win a primary in a tiny state like New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the outcome will intensify the focus on the races
next week in Virginia, Washington state and North Dakota. But the
most important voting will be on March 7, which is something of a
national primary, with voters going to the polls in New York,
California, Ohio, Missouri, Georgia, Connecticut and several other
states.
</P>
<P>
   After South Carolina, Bush and McCain rushed to concentrate on
Michigan because the outcome here is far more important. There were
58 delegates at stake in Michigan; 30 in Arizona. McCain was also
widely expected to win in Arizona because he is the favorite son
there who has served three terms in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush's defeat in Arizona underscored how the
primary season has been far rockier than he or his advisers had
anticipated. Bush enjoyed the energetic backing of the Republican
governor, Jane Dee Hull. And for a time last year, surveys in
Arizona showed Bush ahead of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   That led some Bush advisers to happily predict that they would
humiliate McCain in his own state. While Bush advisers now insist
that they never intended to win in Arizona, they poured as much as
$2 million into the state in television commercials and direct
mail.
</P>
<P>
   The seesaw nature of the Republican competition _ while McCain
has won New Hampshire, Bush was victorious in South Carolina and
Delaware _ leaves Bush appearing much more vulnerable than he
seemed for much of last year when polls showed, month after month,
that he towered over the Republican field and could easily defeat a
Democrat. Now, the McCain campaign has fastened onto the theme that
Bush is such a weak candidate that he could lose the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   But the voting in Michigan pointed to larger difficulties for
both Bush and McCain. Bush's constituency is predominately from his
party's conservative wing, according to surveys of voters,
conducted by a consortium of the television networks and The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Those exit polls showed that if Bush is the Republican nominee,
it might be difficult for him to attract Republican moderates,
independents and Democrats in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for McCain, the surveys showed, is that he
encountered difficulty attracting members of his own party. That
could be perilous because many of the coming contests are in states
like New York, where, unlike Michigan, only registered Republicans
can participate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one of the many indications that McCain and Bush appeal to
opposite ends of the philosophical spectrum, Bush attracted the
majority of voters who want to see abortion made illegal to some
degree, and McCain drew the majority of voters who favored keeping
abortion legal.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive race here was something of an embarrassment for
Gov. John Engler, who had promised that his organization would
deliver for Bush. The results here also raised questions about how
much Bush would benefit from the support of governors in states
holding many of the coming contests. Michigan is far more
representative of the nation than the earlier states that have
voted because of its large population, heavy industry, unions and
blend of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the electorate in this state on Tuesday was far different
than four years ago. The number of Democrats voting nearly doubled
to 20 percent of the electorate, while the number of Republicans
diminished to about 50 percent, and independents to about 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Democrats accounted for 10 percent of the voters;
Republicans, 62 percent and independents, 28 percent. Nearly half
the voters said they were conservative, and they backed Bush over
McCain by nearly 3 to 1. But nearly 4 in 10 voters described
themselves as moderates; 6 in 10 of them backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While religious conservatives were credited for delivering huge
support to Bush in South Carolina, they were not as much a factor
in Michigan. Fewer than 3 in 10 voters said they considered
themselves to be part of the religious right movement; those who
did voted overwhelmingly for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a contrast to South Carolina, where Bush successful
appropriated McCain's mantle of reform, the senator regained his
reform image in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, McCain overwhelmed Bush in virtually every
demographic group _ except among voters who consider themselves
very conservative and those who want to make abortion illegal.

<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Shawn Green fills so many holes for the Los
Angeles Dodgers, it's easy to see why the team gave him a six-year,
$84 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The right fielder will hit fourth and add a left-handed bat to
balance the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not where his value ends. He's turned a heavy portion
of the Jewish community into instant Dodgers fans and will be the
model _ or role-model _ player everyone thinks is lacking in sports
today. In the process, he's expected to make the Dodgers markedly
better and be a calm, stable influence in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   These are all things the Dodgers know, not to mention count on.
Green, acquired in a Nov.8 deal with Toronto for Raul Mondesi,
arrived at Dodgertown on Tuesday. And the Dodgers have been quick
to make sure not to put any pressure on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's natural, he's going to try to do more than he
can, but we're going to do our best to spread the responsibility
out to 25 players,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said.
``He's just a part of what we have on this baseball team. He
doesn't have to do anything but be Shawn Green.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson learned from what Kevin Brown experienced last
season. Though Brown pitched well for a mediocre team and finished
18-9 with a 3.00 ERA, there was the admission by many that too much
pressure was placed on him early after signing the record-setting
$105 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's going to be pressure, but I kind of live in a
bubble,'' Green said. ``I told my family and friends that over the
course of six years, everything (written and said) about you isn't
going to be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Brown acquisition was costly, it filled the Dodgers'
need for a front-line starter. They got one of the top pitchers and
competitors in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   With Green, the Dodgers filled more gaps. No longer will the
middle of the lineup be dominated by right-handers Gary Sheffield,
Eric Karros and Mondesi. Green's presence splits Sheffield and
Karros and makes the Dodgers a tougher team to pitch to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to prevent yourself from being an easy target,''
Malone said. ``Any team that's predominantly a right-handed hitting
team is easier to pitch to, to get out. When you have the balance,
it makes it tougher for the opponents. I think that's what's so
important with having Shawn Green in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's what Green is up against: He hit .309 with 42 homers
and 123 RBI last season. He stole 20 bases and had 45 doubles, and
anything less could be perceived as a disappointment if the Dodgers
don't improve on their 77-win season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's going to have a huge impact on this club,'' first
baseman Eric Karros said. ''It'll be good. I'm sure he'll have a
huge impact on L.A. I'm sure he's aware of the expectations, but
one guy isn't going to change the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's arrival in Los Angeles has been marked by a maddening
number of interview and personal-appearance requests, and he'll
feel the brunt of being the latest crucial piece in restoring honor
to a storied franchise.
</P>
<P>
   On his first day in Dodgertown, he met one of the greatest
treasures the Dodgers organization has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get a chance to meet Sandy Koufax on your first
day,'' Green said, ''it's a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, but it is ONLY a start.

   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Shawn Green fills so many holes for the Los
Angeles Dodgers, it's easy to see why the team gave him a six-year,
$84 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The right fielder will hit fourth and add a left-handed bat to
balance the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not where his value ends. He's turned a heavy portion
of the Jewish community into instant Dodgers fans and will be the
model _ or role-model _ player everyone thinks is lacking in sports
today. In the process, he's expected to make the Dodgers markedly
better and be a calm, stable influence in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   These are all things the Dodgers know, not to mention count on.
Green, acquired in a Nov.8 deal with Toronto for Raul Mondesi,
arrived at Dodgertown on Tuesday. And the Dodgers have been quick
to make sure not to put any pressure on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's natural, he's going to try to do more than he
can, but we're going to do our best to spread the responsibility
out to 25 players,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said.
``He's just a part of what we have on this baseball team. He
doesn't have to do anything but be Shawn Green.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson learned from what Kevin Brown experienced last
season. Though Brown pitched well for a mediocre team and finished
18-9 with a 3.00 ERA, there was the admission by many that too much
pressure was placed on him early after signing the record-setting
$105 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's going to be pressure, but I kind of live in a
bubble,'' Green said. ``I told my family and friends that over the
course of six years, everything (written and said) about you isn't
going to be positive.''
</P>

SONICS MAKE MAGIC DISAPPEAR IN 36-POINT ROMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Emanual Davis took the floor in the second
quarter Tuesday night, he wore a serious expression.
</P>
<P>
   No fooling around, he thought. For the backup guard, it was time
to concentrate and help ignite a spark, however tiny. It would be
12 minutes later when Davis finally took a seat.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't until that moment that Davis realized what was
going on around him. That spark had become an explosion. The
so-called basketball game taking place?
</P>
<P>
   Over.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when the Sonics burned the visiting Orlando Magic to
a crisp in a 127-91 victory, Davis was as much a fire-starter as
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   It was Davis' 3-pointer that keyed a 22-0 scoring run that the
Sonics used to dominate the second quarter and crush the Magic
before halftime. Davis had 11 points _ including three 3-pointers _
during that barrage.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, the scowl on Davis' face transformed into a
toothy grin he never relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know we ran off that many points,'' said Davis, who
finished with 17 points. ``And I looked up and we were up
twenty-something points. I didn't pay attention to the score at
all. I just played ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando, on the other hand, had reason to ignore the scoreboard.
The Magic, who had been unexpectedly formidable this season under
rookie coach Doc Rivers, just played poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to sit through,'' Rivers said. ``I wish we had a
white flag. We could have waved it and been in Portland by now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Magic shot just 38 percent and never recovered from the
second-quarter debacle. Davis had as many points in the period as
Orlando, which made just five field goals and went nearly six
minutes without scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we were able to have a blowout is because we
respect them so much,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``We
played hard all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the game wound up being an effortless night for the
Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-9 run in the third put them ahead by 42 points. The Sonics'
biggest lead was 127-84 with a minute left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   For Davis and the rest of the Sonics bench, the game provided an
opportunity to play extended minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always tough when you're sitting there stiff and get
thrown in the fire,'' Davis said. ``But you have to be prepared to
go in there and do your job. That's what all of our bench guys have
been trying to do all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and backup small forward Rashard Lewis perhaps demoralized
the Magic most with their 3-point shooting. Davis had five triples
and Lewis matched Brent Barry with four.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Sonics blitzed the Magic with 15 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Shammond Williams won the most adulation
when his 3-pointer fell to put the Sonics ahead 112-70 with 5:51
left in the fourth. Fans leave with the ability to redeem their
tickets for free Taco Bell chalupas whenever the Sonics reach 110
points.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those nights when Squatch could have played and
posted a triple-double.
</P>
<P>
   The blowout was the second in three games at home for the
Sonics, who have won their past five games in KeyArena. The streak
began after the hapless Chicago Bulls beat the Sonics here, 88-81,
on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the Sonics jumped on the Washington Wizards early
and rolled to a 114-85 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that we've played a couple of teams that these kind
of performances lead to,'' Barry said. ``The games seem to mean
more than just the opponent. ... I said last week, we're tying to
win 20 of our last 30. We're down to 18. Hopefully, our magic
number will keep shrinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Now is as good a time as any to establish home dominance. The
Sonics have a stretch in March in which they play 10 of 11 games in
KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Brent talked about that early (yesterday),'' Sonics
forward Ruben Patterson said. ``We know we're going to have all
those games (here), so we have to take care of business. We know
we've lost some games here we should have won.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Sonics surprised themselves with how little they
allowed the Magic to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hot and we shot the ball well,'' Davis said. ``I'm not
surprised at anything that happens in the NBA night in and night
out.''

   RUSSIA-VOTE (Gadzhiyevo, Russia) _ On March 26, the day Russians
vote for a new president, the people of this city, whose population
is an official secret, will be engaged in a battle they feel far
more intensely than the lop-sided presidential contest that Acting
President Vladimir Putin is expected to win. The citizens of this
closed military city, which hides one of Russia's nuclear submarine
bases above the Arctic Circle, are staging an extraordinary civic
revolt. In a referendum on whether the fleet can put a nuclear
waste dump at the city limits, they are taking on the navy they
have long served. By Patrick E. Tyler.

Then, last Saturday, South Carolina derailed Sen. John McCain's

Bush hit a sizable pothole in Michigan, right in the middle of his
turnpike to victory. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   BUSINESS-RECRUIT (Undated) _ For years, America's big-name
investment banks and consulting firms considered it a waste of time
to send recruiters to second-tier business schools. Harvard,

a handful of others supplied the talent they needed. Now, however,
that elitist approach is fading, another consequence of the
Internet economy. By David Leonhardt.

   ADVISER-AD-COLUMN (New York) _ The hype is everywhere: stories
about 22-year-old Internet millionaires, clerks in start-up
companies with stock values that rival a typical CEO and TV
commercials about fortunes made in online trading. Now a mutual

   BOURBON (New York) _ So many wine snobs, so little patience.
That's why one of my favorite drinking buddies is Al Hirschfeld.
The 96-year-old artist can't be bothered with sermons on grassy
undertones. He's a bourbon man. And when we go out together, he
prefers to keep drinking it past cocktails and through the meal,
which, by the way, he prefers to be steak. I love a guy who breaks

RELEASE 3.0: KEEPING THE INTERNET HEALTHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 By ESTHER DYSON  
 c.2000 EDventure Holdings Inc.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent denial-of-service (DOS) attacks on Web sites such as
Yahoo! and eBay remind us that while the Internet gives economies
of scale to individuals, it does the same for criminals.
</P>
<P>
   A creepy aspect of the highly publicized attacks is that they
came from the computers of a huge number of unsuspecting third
parties whose machines had been compromised by the attackers.
</P>
<P>
   That is, the poor security of the many was used to mount an
attack on the few.
</P>
<P>
   The security of the targeted sites was not compromised, but they
couldn't function because of the tremendous volume of traffic sent
their way.
</P>
<P>
   We can't just say the victims deserved what they got because of
their own loose security _ or that it's up to them to solve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the solutions suggested for such security problems (and
future ones) involve strong government regulation and surveillance.
And many of the reactions to those ``solutions'' justifiably point
out the dangers to individual freedom if we create a Police Net _
the virtual equivalent of a police state.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have to be a choice between security and freedom.
A more fruitful approach is to look at Internet security as a kind
of worldwide public health problem, and ask how we can improve
public hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, computer users _ at home, at work, at universities
_ need to be encouraged to secure their machines, both for their
own safety and so they cannot be used to launch an attack on
someone else in some other part of the world.
</P>
<P>
   How to make this happen? Regulations and specific requirements
would probably set a minimum and offer a clear target that
criminals would take delight in attacking.
</P>
<P>
   As for government surveillance, or limitations on anonymity, or
required registration of all users _ the cure might be worse than
the disease. (None of this means that criminals shouldn't be
tracked after the fact and punished, but we don't all need to be
trackable beforehand.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there are a number of paths to pursue; there's no
single solution.
</P>
<P>
   To start, consider what the insurance industry has done for fire
safety. The insurance companies should get involved _ every large
Web site has been calling its insurance company this month (or
looking for one). And they WILL get involved, since it's a
profitable line of business.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the point is for them to take the trouble to REDUCE
the risks rather than simply charging high premiums for high risks.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies need to acquire the expertise to assess
their clients' security systems. They will probably turn to all
those consultants and experts who no longer have Y2K to worry
about/bill for. Security consulting is a nice new line of business
_ and it's socially responsible!
</P>
<P>
   A final step, one that COULD benefit from government/regulatory
action: Require that companies disclose their security practices
and potential liabilities in financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   Internet service providers and computer vendors would have to
disclose the security provisions of the systems and services they
sell, and could be sued for negligence. In extreme cases, ISPs
might refuse to take traffic from other ISPs known for lax
security.
</P>
<P>
   Then we could let the market (and yes, even the lawyers!) take
care of it, far more flexibly than formal regulations and
requirements could. Yes, it's a pity to bring in lawyers and
liability, but that's an easier cost to bear than the loss of
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In short, we need to understand that electronic security costs
money, just like regular security (locks, guards, alarm systems).
Power implies responsibility; if you buy a computer that can be
used as a weapon, you need to make sure that it is designed and
installed safely.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the average computer user doesn't know how to set up
a safe system, but he needs to demand service from someone who
does.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller businesses (who don't file financial statements with the
public) need to understand that they are liable, just like the
person who doesn't bother to shovel his sidewalk after a snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, government-sponsored EDUCATION (and due-care precedents
set in court) could be very valuable. Self-interested companies
could also be expected to provide education in the form of
advertising and marketing outlining the dangers and their own
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   May the best solutions evolve in a decentralized world, in order
to match the evolving, decentralized risks!

 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA 0224: After 52 years of driving, retiring isn't
easy
 &HT;    By Kelly Daniel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He can't sleep. It's 5:30 on another morning
when there's not a reason in the world for Odis Axel to be awake,
and yet there he is.
</P>
<P>
   Habit, he nods. One day, he's a working man, aiver, on
the job for more than 50 years. Then _ it seems to surprise even
him _ he retires. After a half-century of rising before first light
crept across the skies, Axel has a chance to rest.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't quite want it. He's been retired a short time now,
his driveway empty of his cab, Austin Cab Co. No. 48, and it still
doesn't seem right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you something crazy,'' Axel begins, hands slapped
on both ears, head down. ``I got up one morning and got my shirt on
and _ I always make my coffee _ and I got a cup of coffee. And I
went to the door and said, 'Where's my cab?!'''
</P>
<P>
   His 73-year-old shoulders quiver with his laughter. ``Yeah, I
miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   American society in these high-tech boom days boasts of
28-year-old retirees, millionaires thanks to computer tasks most of
us little understand. But the work of putting foot to accelerator,
hand to steering wheel, car onto street _ that we know well. That's
what Axel did, every work week for 52 years, shuttling ordinary
folks in his cab, finally quitting Dec. 12 because his aching right
arm and both ailing knees demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a role model for everybody who drives a car. He is in
particular a role model for all cab drivers, no matter where,''
says Bertha Means, who owns Austin Cab Co. and suggested the City
of Austin give Axel an official proclamation for his years of
service. ``He is so special.''
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation now hangs in his living room.
</P>
<P>
   In a business where it's common to leave after a few years, Axel
spent nearly a lifetime. Axel never had an accident or an official
complaint filed against him, Means says. He says he was never
robbed, though there were moments when it seemed just a blink away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it could get really rough, but I was always blessed
enough that I had enough customers that I wouldn't just have to
pick up anything and everything,'' he says. Those customers, mostly
elderly people who needed him to take them to doctor's appointments
or a grocery store, are what he misses most. Their loyalty rivals
his.
</P>
<P>
   One woman wasn't feeling well and called for Axel to take her to
a doctor. His cab was in the shop, the dispatcher explained. ``And
she told the dispatcher, 'Well, I'll just take an aspirin or
something and wait until tomorrow,''' Axel says.
</P>
<P>
   Several cab drivers have similar stories. No one has as many as
Axel, Means says.
</P>
<P>
   City employees say just one Austin cab driver, Samuel Nunez with
Roy's Taxi, comes close to matching Axel's years of service _ and
Nunez has seven years to go.
</P>
<P>
   Axel, a genteel fellow, is prone to wearing a pressed white
``Austin Cab'' shirt with his name stitched above a pocket, with
faded black jeans and boots. His curly hair is white, and his
mustache is as trim as his frame. His eyes disappear behind
gold-rimmed glasses when he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   How he got into driving for a living is one of those things,
like weeds wrapped unseen 'round an ankle, that change your
direction before you realize you even took a step.
</P>
<P>
   ``One morning, my car wouldn't start, and I called a cab,'' Axel
recalls. ``And the owner of the cab company picked me up and we got
to talking, and he was telling me about driving.'' The more they
talked, the more he felt driving was better than his job at a
downtown furniture store.
</P>
<P>
   He started working part time at night with Harlem Cab, which
became Austin Cab. There were no two-way radios back then; he drove
back to the station to get addresses for the next pickup. He saved
enough money to buy his own cab _ a 1954 Chevy _ switched to days
and soon saved enough to buy a $500 lot and build a $12,000 house
off East 14th Street. He and wife, Vivian, who retired in 1988
after 32 years as a first-grade teacher, live there still.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what year he started full time, he turns to his wife.
``You would know, because I don't think we were married then,'' he
says. His wife muses aloud, ``We were married in '48.'' Axel's
surprised look stops her. ``Did I marry you in '48? I been telling
people '50,'' he says. He giggles. Vivian gives the impression
she's just rolled her eyes, though her expression remains stoic.
``Oh, goodness,'' she says, and laughs.
</P>
<P>
   By necessity at first, and by routine later on, Axel
concentrated on East Austin. ``When I first started driving, you
could only haul blacks. Then in the '50s, the city changed it to
where a cab was a cab,'' says Axel, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   Austin History Center researchers could find no city ordinances
spelling out the racial arrangement that Axel _ and Means, as well
_ recalls. But the researchers found evidence that reality differed
from the legality, with ``colored'' cab companies separated from
other taxi companies in Austin telephone books until 1960.
</P>
<P>
   But Axel smiles and recalls an elderly white couple who lived
off Exposition Boulevard in the late 1940s. ``They were white, but
they would only ride with me. They didn't care,'' he says. He had
several such families, and he wound up driving second generations.
</P>
<P>
   He never drove a king, you might say. Axel's customers were more
important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those elderly people will take care of you if you treat them
right,'' he says. ``If you treat people right, you'll have no
problems. Now, I'm living witness to that.'' Along the way, Axel
watched this city age, mature and evolve, from a city of 132,500 in
1950 to the metropolis of 643,000 today. ``It's so much different
from when I come up here, like night and day,'' he says. Not all of
it is good, of course. He grows somber, and a touch upset, as he
mentions how many young people he sees wasting time in the streets,
on the corners, out all hours. His spare time goes to his church,
Metropolitan A.M.E. Church, where he was man of the year in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But the knees began to wear on him. It took longer to get from
behind the wheel to tote his customers' bags. It was time to stop.
Even his wife wasn't quite sure he was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a Wednesday, he came in and said, 'I told Ms. Means I
retired.' I didn't believe it. ... He'd talked about it for so
long,'' Vivian says. But that weekend, the cab was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Means, teasingly, but enthusiastically, keeps trying to lure him
back.
</P>
<P>
   But Axel just shakes his head and laughs. His thinks instead
about the cabs that shaped his life.
</P>
<P>
   The first one was a Chevy. Others were Chevys, too. The car in
his driveway now, their retirement car, is a Chevy. But that last
cab, No. 48, was a Ford. He grins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Ford made me retire,'' Axel says. He laughs again,
and Vivian can't help but join him.

   When Odis Axel got his start with the Austin Cab Co., it was
called Harlem Cab, and he kept his hat from the early days. Axel's
loyalty to his job was matched by his customers' loyalty to him.

   Several cab drivers have similar stories. No one has as many as
Axel, Means says.
</P>
<P>
   City employees say just one Austin cab driver, Samuel Nunez with
Roy's Taxi, comes close to matching Axel's years of service _ and
Nunez has seven years to go.
</P>
<P>
   Axel, a genteel fellow, is prone to wearing a pressed white
``Austin Cab'' shirt with his name stitched above a pocket, with
faded black jeans and boots. His curly hair is white, and his
mustache is as trim as his frame. His eyes disappear behind
gold-rimmed glasses when he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   How he got into driving for a living is one of those things,
like weeds wrapped unseen 'round an ankle, that change your
direction before you realize you even took a step.
</P>
<P>
   ``One morning, my car wouldn't start, and I called a cab,'' Axel
recalls. ``And the owner of the cab company picked me up and we got
to talking, and he was telling me about driving.'' The more they
talked, the more he felt driving was better than his job at a
downtown furniture store.
</P>
<P>
   He started working part time at night with Harlem Cab, which
became Austin Cab. There were no two-way radios back then; he drove
back to the station to get addresses for the next pickup. He saved
enough money to buy his own cab _ a 1954 Chevy _ switched to days
and soon saved enough to buy a $500 lot and build a $12,000 house
off East 14th Street. He and wife, Vivian, who retired in 1988
after 32 years as a first-grade teacher, live there still.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what year he started full time, he turns to his wife.
``You would know, because I don't think we were married then,'' he
says. His wife muses aloud, ``We were married in '48.'' Axel's
surprised look stops her. ``Did I marry you in '48? I been telling
people '50,'' he says. He giggles. Vivian gives the impression
she's just rolled her eyes, though her expression remains stoic.
``Oh, goodness,'' she says, and laughs.
</P>
<P>
   By necessity at first, and by routine later on, Axel
concentrated on East Austin. ``When I first started driving, you
could only haul blacks. Then in the '50s, the city changed it to
where a cab was a cab,'' says Axel, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   Austin History Center researchers could find no city ordinances
spelling out the racial arrangement that Axel _ and Means, as well
_ recalls. But the researchers found evidence that reality differed
from the legality, with ``colored'' cab companies separated from
other taxi companies in Austin telephone books until 1960.
</P>
<P>
   But Axel smiles and recalls an elderly white couple who lived
off Exposition Boulevard in the late 1940s. ``They were white, but
they would only ride with me. They didn't care,'' he says. He had
several such families, and he wound up driving second generations.
</P>
<P>
   He never drove a king, you might say. Axel's customers were more
important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those elderly people will take care of you if you treat them
right,'' he says. ``If you treat people right, you'll have no
problems. Now, I'm living witness to that.'' Along the way, Axel
watched this city age, mature and evolve, from a city of 132,500 in
1950 to the metropolis of 643,000 today. ``It's so much different
from when I come up here, like night and day,'' he says. Not all of
it is good, of course. He grows somber, and a touch upset, as he
mentions how many young people he sees wasting time in the streets,
on the corners, out all hours. His spare time goes to his church,
Metropolitan A.M.E. Church, where he was man of the year in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But the knees began to wear on him. It took longer to get from
behind the wheel to tote his customers' bags. It was time to stop.
Even his wife wasn't quite sure he was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a Wednesday, he came in and said, 'I told Ms. Means I
retired.' I didn't believe it. ... He'd talked about it for so
long,'' Vivian says. But that weekend, the cab was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Means, teasingly, but enthusiastically, keeps trying to lure him
back.
</P>
<P>
   But Axel just shakes his head and laughs. His thinks instead
about the cabs that shaped his life.
</P>
<P>
   The first one was a Chevy. Others were Chevys, too. The car in
his driveway now, their retirement car, is a Chevy. But that last
cab, No. 48, was a Ford. He grins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Ford made me retire,'' Axel says. He laughs again,
and Vivian can't help but join him.

<P>
   When Odis Axel got his start with the Austin Cab Co., it was
called Harlem Cab, and he kept his hat from the early days. Axel's
loyalty to his job was matched by his customers' loyalty to him.

 &HT;    Chefs stir up fresh interest in soup
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It is still winter, the tag end of February, and
at lunch nothing sounds better than a big mug of soup.
</P>
<P>
   But if you didn't make it yourself and tote it to the office, a
good bowl of soup can be hard to find. Many restaurants rely on
commercial soup bases, and even homestyle mom-and-pop restaurants
dump bags of frozen vegetables in the pot. And once made, the soup
can sit in heated pots, thickening to a sludge as the hours drag
by.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is the makings of good soup.
</P>
<P>
   But at Chin's Oriental Restaurant indowntown Dayton, owner Art
Chin is a believer in scratch soups. He makes his own stock,
starting with the bones left from deboning chicken for entrees.
</P>
<P>
   At DiSalvo's Deli and Italian store in Kettering, Rinaldo
DiSalvo starts making tomorrow's soup today. It is a six-hour
process that begins with bones _ maybe pork bones from the meat
he's boned to make his sausage or maybe chicken or beef bones.
</P>
<P>
   And at Flavors in Englewood, Elaine Alex-Lorusso and her
husband, Rich, make a different soup every day, choosing from a
repertoire of 45. The variety ranges from a portobello with red
onion in a clear broth, which she describes as ``way beyond
popular,'' to a thick black bean soup with sliced turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the morning we come in and prep for another soup,'' she
says. They, too, make their own stock, a necessity because many of
their customers are vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   While Chin's featured soup changes with the season, ``salmon
soup is the signature for our fusion cooking,'' says Chin, and it
is brought back annually in fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   Other rotating soups that Chin calls light entrees are a ramen
noodle soup with strip steak and a soba noodle soup made with
Japanese dashi and sliced marinated chicken and vegetables, plus a
duck soup. For that one, Chin browns the bones, carrots, onion and
jalapeno peppers to make the stock. The duck meat is marinated,
seared and slivered and added to the soup with shredded vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Chin always has three traditional soups on the line: hot and
sour, wonton and egg drop, but makes some soups to order. Those
quick soups include the house-made broth, with additions of either
cooked rice or noodles, and some chicken and steamed vegetables to
go on top.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best may be a soup of fresh tofu and Asian greens
dropped into the boiling stock, and Chin says they willingly make a
vegetarian version starting with water, a little soy, some ginger,
plus a touch of garlic, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a pretty good vegetarian broth,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At DiSalvo's, the soup of the day depends on the owner's whim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta do something different. I can't do the same thing all
the time,'' he says. He's working on an asparagus soup to introduce
in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Usually DiSalvo roasts meaty bones before adding them to a
stockpot of water. But he changes his methods to suit his whims, so
for his lentil soup last week he skipped the browning process and
just added the unroasted bones to the water along with some leeks.
That was at 8 a.m., and he didn't turn off the burner until 2 p.m.
By then the lentils had thickened to a puree. The soup needed only
to be cooled and refrigerated for the next day.
</P>
<P>
   DiSalvo's soups never go back into a soup pot or steam table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand soup on a steam table all day. It ruins the
soup,'' he says. So he heats each bowl of soup to order. ``People
have to wait for soup here, but it's fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   The lineup, with no scheduled rotation, includes an Italian
wedding soup, full of chunks of chicken as well as Romano-flavored
chicken meatballs and pastina. While that's the deli's
most-requested soup, DiSalvo prefers making bean soup _ escarole
and white beans, black bean soup, split pea soup, pasta fagioli and
minestrone.
</P>
<P>
   As at Flavors, customers just have to call to find out what's
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Here are scratch soup recipes from the three businesses.
</P>
<P>
   CHIN'S FRESH SALMON SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 large servings
</P>
<P>
   8 to 10 ounces fresh salmon, cubed
</P>
<P>
   6 cups unseasoned vegetable or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh minced ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Japanese sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons light soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 shiitake mushrooms, sliced
</P>
<P>
   Assorted vegetables such as carrots, celery, bamboo shoots,
slivered
</P>
<P>
   Cooked noodles, about 4 ounces
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons fresh minced herbs, cilantro, basil, oregano,
rosemary or parsley (use at least two kinds)
</P>
<P>
   Heat the stock and combine the ingredients except noodles and
herbs. Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 minutes until the salmon is
cooked. Add the cooked noodles and herbs and cook just until the
noodles are hot.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per person: 321 calories; 13.6
g fat; 70.3 g cholesterol; 985 g sodium.
</P>
<P>
   DiSalvo prides himself on the fact that he doesn't measure when
he cooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do it,'' he says. That said, this is his approximate
version of the Italian wedding soup he serves at the Deli. His
makes a stockpot full, so we've cut it down to a manageable size.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally soup-sized meatballs for Italian soups are made
with veal and eggs, about two eggs for a pound of meat. DiSalvo's
recipe eliminates the eggs. Instead of veal he grinds chicken
breast and for the meatballs for this soup. Because most home cooks
no longer have a meat grinder you'll have to ask the butcher to do
that for you.
</P>
<P>
   He also says that soaking the chicken in lemon and salt before
cooking is essential to the texture of the chunks of chicken he
also adds to the soup.
</P>
<P>
   DISALVO'S'S DELI ITALIAN WEDDING SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Soup:
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds chicken pieces on the bone, both dark and white meat
</P>
<P>
   1/2 lemon
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt for brining
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   4 medium carrots, shredded
</P>
<P>
   3 medium onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 stalks celery, chopped
</P>
<P>
   olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup acine de pepe pasta
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   Meatballs
</P>
<P>
   1 pound ground chicken
</P>
<P>
   salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces Romano cheese, finely grated
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely minced Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze the lemon over the chicken pieces and rub them with the
salt. Add water to cover and let rest for half an hour. Rinse well
and place chicken in the 2 1/2 quarts water with salt, pepper and
bay leaf. Cook with cover askew for two hours. Be sure to skim off
foam when the stock comes to a boil to ensure a clear broth.
</P>
<P>
   Remove chicken from the stock and set aside. Turn the heat down
to a simmer. Add the shredded carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the chopped onions and celery in enough oil to cover the
bottom of a large skillet. Cook over medium heat until softened. Do
not let brown or this will color the broth. Add the onions and
celery to the stock. Cook at a bare simmer an additional hour
(DiSalvo cooks his big stockpot of soup another two hours). Remove
from heat.
</P>
<P>
   Bone the chicken and return the pieces to the soup. The soup can
be made ahead, cooled and refrigerated at this point.
</P>
<P>
   To make the chicken meatballs, season the ground chicken lightly
with salt and pepper and add the garlic powder, the grated cheese
and minced parsley. Mix by hand. Using your hands, coated with oil
to prevent sticking, form the chicken into marble-sized meatballs.
Meanwhile, cook the pasta separately in abundant boiling salted
water. Drain. If not serving immediately, toss with a little oil
(to prevent sticking) and let cool .
</P>
<P>
   When ready to serve, heat the soup, add the meatballs and cook 8
to 10 minutes. Add the cooked pasta and parsley and heat.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle with additional grated romano cheese before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Or use any miniature pasta such as orzo or riso.
</P>
<P>
   The Lorussos operated restaurants in California, and it shows in
their approach and flavorings.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our soups are low in fat,'' Elaine Alex-Lorusso says.
Her husband, who does most of the cooking, says he uses lots of
garlic and even beer for flavor. Cilantro provides an essential
flavor to this soup.
</P>
<P>
   Lorusso also makes an aioli sauce from roasted garlic to dribble
on top. Home cooks can flavor mayonnaise with garlic to mimic his
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or a dollop of sour cream is good,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHWESTERN VEGGIE SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 small red onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 medium carrot, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 stalk celery, chopped
</P>
<P>
   olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 large green bell pepper, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 large red bell pepper, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cups vegetable stock
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bottle beer
</P>
<P>
   1 large tomato, peeled, seeded and diced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup corn
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces black beans, drained
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup black pitted olives
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup uncooked rice
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   pepper
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon Southwestern or Cajun seasoning
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon each minced parsley and cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Cook the onion, carrot, celery and peppers in sufficient olive
oil to coat the bottom of a large pot, cooking until the onions are
browned. Add the garlic and cook a few minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   Add the stocks, beer, and salt and pepper to taste, plus
Southwestern seasoning, parsley and cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Bring to a boil, turn heat to low and simmer until rice is
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Serve topped with sour cream or garlic mayo sauce, with fresh
garlic toast on the side.

 &HT;    No speak cipollina?
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As we eat out more, hasn't it become obvious
that we need to master a second language?
</P>
<P>
   We call it foodish. And it is not a single language. It's
representative of the amalgamation of cuisines filling our plates:
Italian, French, Asian, Indian, interior Mexican, Tex-Mex, Cajun,
Creole, soul, Caribbean, South American, Greek, German, English ...
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this international culinary language limited to dining
out. It's needed for many new cookbooks, markets and convenience
foods, too.
</P>
<P>
   To guide diners through this new decade, we've put together some
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what they mean when they say:
</P>
<P>
   SEARED
</P>
<P>
   Food that has been browned quickly on the outside to seal in the
juices. You see this term a lot with foods like tuna steak. And
while it may be nice and brown on the outside, it may also mean
that the interior is undercooked. If that makes you gag, ask before
you order or request that the item be cooked to the doneness you
desire. Yes, you can do that. It's your dollar.
</P>
<P>
   RIBOLLITA (ree-bo-LEE-tah)
</P>
<P>
   This is not little ribs, but an Italian vegetable soup thickened
with bread. It is traditionally made with leftover soup from the
day before and should be thick enough to eat with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   HUITLACOCHE (wheet-lah-KOH-chay)
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, this is corn smut gone gourmet. Big in Mexican
cuisine, it's a fungi that shows up in enchiladas and other dishes.
Foodies rhapsodize over it; others may find it an acquired taste.
Half the fun of eating it , though, is pronouncing the name.
</P>
<P>
   CHIFFONADE
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, you're thinking cake, but it's really shreds of lettuce or
veggies. Often used as a bed for foods or a garnish.
</P>
<P>
   PUTTANESCA SAUCE (poot-tah-NEHS-kah)
</P>
<P>
   We included this sauce because of its spicy origin. The sauce,
often served with pasta, usually contains hot red pepper, tomatoes,
garlic, black olives and anchovies. Puttanesca comes from puttana,
which means ``whore'' in Italian. Supposedly the sauce is so named
because it was quickly made by the ``ladies'' between visitors.
</P>
<P>
   BUBBLE AND SQUEAK
</P>
<P>
   A classic English dish, this is basically cooked cabbage and
mashed potatoes, stirred together. So why the name? Some say it is
the noise it makes when the foods are fried together. Others quip
that it is the sound your stomach makes after consumption.
</P>
<P>
   POZOLE (po-ZO-leh)
</P>
<P>
   Some call it a hearty soup; others a stew. Either way, expect it
to have chunks of meat, chiles and hominy. You will find this on
just about every menu in New Mexico, where green chile abounds.
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAMESE SPRING ROLLS
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Chinese egg rolls, these are neither fried, nor crisp.
Instead, meat or seafood and veggies are spread into a moist rice
paper wrapper and rolled up, dunked and eaten. The rolls are
translucent enough to see the filling.
</P>
<P>
   MESCLUN
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you have eaten this, but you may have just called it
salad. It is a gourmet mix of tender young lettuces. Very light,
very nice. The bulk bins at your neighborhood grocery are often a
source of this.
</P>
<P>
   CIPOLLINA (chee-poh-LEE-nah)
</P>
<P>
   A small white, flattish onion that is popular in Italy and
finding its way into American groceries.
</P>
<P>
   HOT
</P>
<P>
   This three-letter word masquerades on many menus. Be alert if an
item says Cajun, chipotle, jalapeno, serrano, habanero, au poivre,
picante or Szechuan. There is a pretty good chance the food will be
spicy. So quit whining. You asked for it.
</P>
<P>
   POT STICKERS
</P>
<P>
   Don't get excited, old hippies. There is nothing illegal about
these little Chinese dumplings. Made of wonton skins, filled with
ground meats and such, the dumplings are browned on one side and
then turned and simmered. Betcha can't eat just one.
</P>
<P>
   AIOLI (ay-OH-lee)
</P>
<P>
   This sauce is known as the butter of Provence, but there is no
butter in it. It's a mayonnaise flavored with lots of garlic and
olive oil. But don't take our word for it. Go to Provence and see
for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   BECHAMEL (BEH-sha-mehl)
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, this is a classic French white sauce. (In Central
Texas, we call it cream gravy.) It is made of milk stirred into a
butter-flour mixture. Bechamel is the base of many soups, souffles
and sauces.
</P>
<P>
   GHEE (Gee)
</P>
<P>
   Can you say ``butter''? That's all this is, a form of clarified
butter used in Indian cookery. The butter is slowly melted to
separate the solids from the liquid. Then the liquid is strained
into a jar for use in frying and flavoring. Without the milk
solids, it can be heated to a higher temperature without burning.
</P>
<P>
   BEARNAISE SAUCE (bear-NAYZ)
</P>
<P>
   You will find this French sauce served with meat, fish, eggs and
veggies. Basically, it is a hollandaise sauce with white wine,
shallots and tarragon. (Not rosemary, as the ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' Internet game says. We're not sure where they came up
with that; our e-mail to them was returned.)
</P>
<P>
   TALK THE TALK Want to learn to read or speak foodish? Some
guides to help you along the way:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The New Food Lover's Companion'' by Sharon Tyler Herbst
(Barron's) has become the food reference bible. It's 700 pages, but
easy to handle and has nice-size print for its 4,000-plus terms.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Wine Lover's Companion'' by Ron Herbst and Sharon Tyler
Herbst is the liquid twin version of the above reference book. Just
as hefty and helpful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Epicurious.com is a Web site that has a food and wine
dictionary. And guess who is the source of this info? None other
than the authors above. This site also archives recipes from Bon
Appetit and other food mags.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink'' by John Mariani
(Broadway) is the newest of the references. Published in 1998, it
includes more than 2,000 definitions about a cuisine that in years
past has been better known in other parts of the country than in
Central Texas. But that is changing quickly.

   Q: Why do tornadoes never seem to hit heavily populated areas?
</P>
<P>
   A: While it's rare for tornadoes to strike big cities, it can
happen. Take St. Louis as an example. The city and its suburbs have
been struck by tornadoes at least 22 times in the past 40 years.
Oklahoma City has been hit by tornadoes 26 times since 1892.
Nashville was struck in April 1998. And who can forget the dramatic
TV footage of a funnel cloud over downtown Miami in May 1997?
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, a tornado striking the downtown core of a major
city doesn't happen often. According to The Tornado Project, an
organization that tracks these storms, there could be several
specific reasons. For one, a central city may produce a ``heat
island' in which turbulent rising air disrupts the formation of
small tornadoes. For another, the ``roughness'' created by the
skyscrapers causes turbulence that disrupts the formation of small
tornadoes. But the most obvious reason is that tornadoes are rare,
and a central city is a very small target area.

   Q: I saw where there's a campaign by the Trader Jon Preservation
Society to buy Trader's famous saloon in Pensacola, Fla. As a
former Navy aviator, I'd like to support this. How can I help?
</P>
<P>
   A: The society's Web site _ www.traderjons.com/ _ says donations
can be mailed to: Trader Jon's Preservation Squadron Inc., c/o
First Navy Bank, 180 Taylor Road, Pensacola, FL 32508. Or you can
make a credit-card donation on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there some rule about flying the U.S. flag 24 hours a day
if there's a light shining on it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Custom may be a better word than rule. Flags customarily are
displayed from sunrise to sunset, but it's not illegal to fly them
24 hours a day. When flown at night, they should be spotlighted.

<P>
   Q: I just discovered that Mount Everest is higher than was
previously thought. How was this determined?
</P>
<P>
   A: A team of mountaineers determined Everest's elevation to be
29,035 feet last May after climbing to the summit and using
equipment linked to a satellite positioning system. That makes the
mountain 7 feet above what had been considered the official
elevation. The revision was announced in November by the National
Geographic Society.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The newspaper reported on a survey of U.S. presidents by
historians who judged them on leadership qualities. Can you list
how all the presidents ranked, from No. 1 on down?
</P>
<P>
   A: Abraham Lincoln was followed by Franklin Roosevelt, George
Washington, Theodore Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Woodrow Wilson,
Thomas Jefferson, John Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower, Lyndon Johnson,
Ronald Reagan, James Polk, Andrew Jackson, James Monroe, William
McKinley, John Adams, Grover Cleveland, James Madison, John Quincy
Adams, George Bush, Bill Clinton;
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, William Howard Taft, Richard Nixon,
Rutherford Hayes, Calvin Coolidge, Zachary Taylor, James Garfield,
Martin Van Buren, Benjamin Harrison, Chester Arthur;
</P>
<P>
   Ulysses Grant, Herbert Hoover, Millard Fillmore, John Tyler,
William Henry Harrison, Warren Harding, Franklin Pierce, Andrew
Johnson, James Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was done by 58 historians from across the political
spectrum who contributed to C-SPAN's yearlong TV series ``American
Presidents: Life Portraits.''
</P>

<P>
   Q: Politicians seem to flock to the scene of disasters,
reportedly to assess damages. Are the state and local officials not
qualifiedno Niagara Falls. What is required to cross in and out of
Canada?
</P>
<P>
   A: U.S. citizens need only proof of citizenship, such as a U.S.
passport or original (or certified copy) of a birth certificate,
plus photo ID such as a driver's license. Minors (younger than 16)
traveling alone or in someone else's custody must present written
authorization signed before a notary from the parent(s) or
guardian.
</P>
<P>
   For full particulars, call any Canadian consulate in the United
States or the Canadian Embassy in Washington (202-682-1740). The
State Department Web site _
http://travel.state.gov/foreignentryregs.html _ also has passport
information about all countries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Todd Eldredge won the national men's figure skating
championship several years in a row. Why has he not competed in the
national championships the past two years?
</P>
<P>
   A: Eldredge, the 1996 world champion and five-time U.S. men's
champion _ 1994 through 1998 consecutively _ said the reason was
simple: ``I had done that (the nationals) for so many years. I
wanted to take a little bit of a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason may have been the inevitable letdown after the
1998 Winter Olympics, in which he placed fourth. But he said he has
put that behind him: ``I really don't think about that anymore;
I've moved on.'' He added that he's never watched videotapes of
that performance in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And now he's on the road back. He will lead Team USA into the
Four Continents Championships, Monday through Feb. 27, at Osaka,
Japan, and he has announced plans to return to the U.S. Figure
Skating Championships in Boston in February 2001.
</P>
<P>
   After that? ``I'm going to do whatever it takes over the next
couple of years to try to make sure my next go-round at the
Olympics, if I get there, will be the way I want it to be.'' That
will be 2002, in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that new evidence has come out about the death of
Natalie Wood. Do you have any information? I haven't seen anything
in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're probably referring to a 13-page article written by Sam
Kashner for the March issue of Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   It suggests that after hours of drinking on Nov. 29, 1981, Wood
and her husband, Robert Wagner, had a furious argument on a yacht,
the Splendour, moored off Catalina Island, Calif. According to the
magazine, previously unpublished police records were uncovered that
appeared to contradict statements made at the time that there was
no such argument.
</P>
<P>
   The police records and witness statements also describe a fight
between the couple over Wood's flirtation with actor Christopher
Walken, who was aboard the yacht that day. Walken reportedly told
police that Wagner had complained that Wood spent too much time
away from home and their children.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, 43, was found drowned after apparently trying to leave the
yacht in the middle of the night. It was thought that she was
attempting to board an inflatable dinghy, but details aren't clear.
Her body was found floating in the Pacific a mile from the yacht,
and a dinghy had washed up nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wood's death was ruled an accident, the circumstances
have long been a source of speculation in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner and Walken declined to be interviewed by Vanity Fair, and
their agents declined to discuss the article.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read recently that some of the new gold dollars would be
shipped directly to Wal-Mart stores to be distributed as change. Is
this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. In fact, the program already is several weeks old.
Effective Jan. 30, Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs locations began
distributing golden dollars in their cash drawers. Earlier this
month, Wal-Mart spokeswoman Laura Pope said customers would be
receiving the golden dollars in change automatically unless they
requested dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for involving the retailing giants was, as the Mint
has stated, to get them into circulation quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the content of the new golden dollar, and what is the
timetable for them to go into circulation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``golden'' dollar is a three-layer composite clad coin,
with a pure copper core sandwiched between _ and metallurgically
bonded to _ the outer layers of alloy material.
</P>
<P>
   The alloy layers are manganese brass, a golden-colored material
composed of 77 percent copper, 12 percent zinc, 7 percent manganese
and 4 percent nickel. Taking the copper core into account, the
overall composition of the golden dollar is 88.5 percent copper, 6
percent zinc, 3.5 percent manganese and 2 percent nickel.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Mint says the construction and electromagnetic
properties of the new golden dollar are so similar in design to the
Susan B. Anthony dollar coin that the new coin is compatible with
mechanical and electromagnetic coin mechanisms currently in use.
Its security features allow machines to distinguish it from slugs,
tokens and foreign coins, the Mint adds.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint has shipped more than 60 million new dollar coins to
Federal Reserve Banks. Philip Diehl, the Mint director, said that
is equivalent to more than a year of bank demand for the earlier
Anthony dollar coin. More than 200 million of the new dollars will
be in circulation by the end of February.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Susan B. Anthony dollar coins were minted in 1979-81. But
we've also seen some Anthony coins bearing the date 1999.
Considering that new dollar coins are being issued in 2000, why did
the Mint do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mint spokesman Michael White explained that the Anthony
dollar was minted for general circulation in 1979-80, plus a small
number in 1981 for collector sets. Some 890 million in all went
into circulation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Anthony coins never were widely accepted, they found a
niche in some vending machines, such as those at post offices where
they were returned as change. So when the government found itself
running out of dollar coins before the new ``golden'' dollar made
it into circulation, the Mint ``bridged the gap'' by producing 41
million more Anthonys in 1999, White said. No more will be made, he
added.

   Q: When is the Vidalia Onion Festival in Georgia?
</P>
<P>
   A: The dates for the 23rd annual festival this year: April
27-30. Information: Vidalia Onion Festival, P.O. Box 280, Vidalia,
GA 30475 (912-538-8687) or online at

<P>
   Q: Can you tell me anything about Swan Island in the Gulf of
Mexico? When I was flying back to the United States from Bogota,
Colombia, someone told me it once was used by the U.S. government
for surveillance on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A: The small Swan Islands (there are two) lie about 110 miles
north of the Honduran coast. While little or no information was
available early on, by 1987 the media was reporting that the larger
of the two Swan Islands had served as a CIA-run radio operation
center for anti-Castro rebels during the attack on Cuba's Bay of
Pigs in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   That report, in the Los Angeles Times, also said Swan Island was
the main depot for a CIA-run military operation supplying rebels
fighting to oust the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. The
article explained that the site was selected for the supply
operation because of the Honduran government's desire to keep
contra activities out of public view.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Swan was the name of the anti-Castro clandestine station.
It reportedly was created by the U.S. government with assistance
from United Fruit Co., which lost large tracts of land expropriated
by Castro. Swan Island originally was a relay station for United
Fruit's Central American radio communications operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing going on there (Swan Island) now,'' CIA
spokesman Tom Crispell told Q&AMP;A this week. ``It has long since been
abandoned.''

<P>
   Q: I read several months ago that information about tickets to
the 2000 baseball All-Star Game would be released by spring
training. What's the latest?
</P>
<P>
   A: The All-Star Game will be July 11 at Turner Field in Atlanta.
The Atlanta Braves now say that information won't be available
until after the regular season starts. So look for news on or after
April 3.

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-200all you or did you call me? Did somebody
make a mistake? If so, do you think it really was my mistake?'''
</P>
<P>
   You can sense a slight disappointment on Nielsen's part that he
never got to deliver that speech. Surely you recall he was a stitch
in ``Airplane!'' (OK, I won't call you Shirley.) From
``Airplane!'', he went on to the short-lived ``Police Squad'' TV
series and wildly popular ``Naked Gun'' and its sequels _ ``Naked
Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear'' and ``Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final
Insult'' _ playing that gullible bumbler, Lt. Frank Drebin.
Overnight, like Tony Bennett being discovered by the Red Hot Chili
Peppers, Nielsen was hip for a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, somebody said to me, `Leslie, do you realize
that you're never going to be over 30 again? The young people, if
you're over 30, they won't even talk to you. And they love you.
They know you're not 30 yet.' That was the biggest compliment in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Nielsen remains in demand for comedy, he is shifting
gears again to tour in a biographical stage show as crusading
lawyer-orator Clarence Darrow. Born in 1857, Darrow was the
greatest defense attorney of his day, remembered for pleading on
behalf of the schoolteacher in the Scopes evolution ``monkey
trial,'' for accused murderers Leopold and Loeb, arguing against
capital punishment and for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't sound like the stuff of comedy, though there are
laughs in ``Clarence Darrow.'' But they're different from those in
``Naked Gun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some very big laughs in the play, but it's more wit,''
Nielsen notes. ``Frank Drebin is dumb and stupid, so it's dumb and
stupid humor. Darrow is not, so his humor has got to come out of
somebody who's pretty smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences may have gone to ``Clarence Darrow'' initially to
catch a glimpse of Drebin, but they stayed and became impressed by
this new Nielsen, which is, of course, the old Nielsen. His
apprehensions about whether he would ever be taken seriously again
have long since vanished. ``It never crosses my mind to say, `Well,
I think they're approaching this a little too light-heartedly, I
better really grab ahold and do this or that.' I just do my work
and Darrow somehow takes care of the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Nielsen has become an avid Darrow fan. ``He was
an extraordinary, compassionate man,'' the actor says. ``A
thoughtful man, a gentle, loving man. A tower of strength and
conviction. He was an incredible speaker. He spoke with such
simplicity and eloquence.'' Reading Darrow's collected papers and
jury summations in preparation for the role, Nielsen confides, ``I
had to keep putting the book down, because I would start to choke
up and tear up.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Nielsen and Darrow have similar backgrounds. ``Well,
we're both small town boys,'' explains Nielsen, who was born in
Regina, Saskatchewan, and grew up in the Yukon, the son of a
Danish-born Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman. ``He married a small
town girl,'' Nielsen says of Darrow. Nielsen did too, though he
divorced her after six years, and went on to two other marriages
that also ended in divorce. Otherwise, Nielsen notes that Darrow's
parents ``nurtured this ability of his to get up and talk and
debate. We were raised to be seen and not heard. Darrow was raised
to be seen and heard anytime he wanted to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen certainly got the seen part right. He moved to the
United States in the late '40s and was seen on that new contraption
called television in live broadcast dramas. In the '50s, Hollywood
beckoned, and he moved west to appear in dozens of mostly
forgettable movies. While he remained a sought-after actor for
decades, it took giving in to the goofball inside him for Nielsen
to emerge as a star and a mobbed-for-autographs celebrity.

   MURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ In a recent column, I suggested
that African-Americans appropriate the Confederate flag, further
decorate it with a huge black circle that has a slash through it
and then fly it from a separate but equally prominent flag staff
over the Capitol of South Carolina. That way, white Southerners who
revere the Rebel flag would have some idea of the outrage blacks
feel when seeing it flown in public places. (Murray, Cox News

   PRISON-VISIT (San Quentin, Calif.) _ First stop: the dungeon. It
hasn't been used in decades, but the message is clear. Repent and
reform. Next, a walk through the ``lower yard,`` a large, scraggly
exercise field where dozens of inmates pump iron, shoot hoops and
jeer _ loudly and profanely. Time now for the gantlet, a tour of
one of the prison's housing units. This weekend, about 50 youths,
some of them gang members, some involved in petty offenses, will
get a tour of the prison. This is the day to set them all straight,
to jar these ``at risk`` kids out of juvenile delinquency by giving
them a glimpse of the oppressive world behind bars. By ELIZABETH

   SEA-OTTER (San Francisco) _ Construction workers building a
house on a cliff overlooking Monterey Bay three years ago heard
piteous, high-pitched squeals, sounding like a scared baby
separated from its mother. They scrambled down, and discovered a
51/2-pound sea otter wedged between rocks. After rehabilitation at
the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the sea otter was released into the
wild. About three months ago, the sea otter became the mother of
her own male pup, marking the first time the aquarium had seen one
of its 60 rehabilitated and released otters reproduce in the wild.

FOR RETRIAL, SUBWAY DEFENDANT GOES OFF MEDICATION 
</HEADLINE>
 PM-NY-GOLDSTEIN-TRIAL-NYT  (gm) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As jury selection began Tuesday in the second murder
trial of a schizophrenic man who pushed a young woman in front of a
subway train, attention focused on a rare tactic by his new
lawyers: The defendant, Andrew Goldstein, stopped taking his
anti-psychotic medication two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, 30, sat calmly and attentively Tuesday between his
new court-appointed lawyers, who advised him to go off his drugs in
an effort to demonstrate to the jury the debilitating effects of
his mental illness. But some experts described the move as
desperate and unethical.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether the lack of medication will have an
incremental or sudden effect on Goldstein's state of mind over the
course of the trial, which is expected to last more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, is
``very comfortable'' with the new tactic, according to his lawyers,
who said he was eager to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about it,'' said Kevin Canfield, one of the
defense lawyers. ``He wants to testify; he does. Whether or not
he'll change his mind, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The move adds another twist to a high-profile case that has
exposed the inadequacies of the state's mental health system.
Goldstein, who has cycled in and out of mental institutions for
more than a decade, has admitted that he pushed Kendra Webdale to
her death on Jan. 3, 1999, but has said he was not responsible
because of his schizophrenia. His first trial, in November, ended
with the jury deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a mentally ill defendant off anti-psychotic medication
during a trial is an unusual legal tactic that divides lawyers and
psychiatrists. Doctors currently treating Goldstein at Bellevue
Hospital Center strongly oppose taking him off his medication, his
defense lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Others were also skeptical. ``It seems irresponsible to take a
man off medication to produce some kind of dramatic effect before a
jury,'' said Richard Uviller, a Columbia University law professor.
``A lawyer's first duty is to preserve his client's health.''
</P>
<P>
   But other experts said it was an ugly but necessary step. Dr. E.
Fuller Torrey, an expert on schizophrenia who heads the Stanley
Research Foundation in Bethesda, Md., said he had intentionally
given homeless mentally ill patients less medication than they
needed before court competency hearings to keep them from being put
back onto the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were his lawyer, I would argue for the same thing,'' he
said. ``If I were Andrew Goldstein, I would want the jury to see
how psychotic I could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrey said it was not clear whether allowing a mentally ill
person to suffer a breakdown causes long-term damage, but he said a
breakdown would surely be harrowing for Goldstein. ``I've never
seen anyone with schizophrenia who enjoyed being in a psychotic
state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic, like the insanity defense itself, is extremely rare,
according to legal experts. Lawyers for Russell E. Weston Jr., a
mentally ill man accused of killing two guards in a shooting
rampage at the U.S. Capitol in July 1998, refused to put him on
anti-psychotic medication. Subsequently, a judge ruled him
incompetent to stand trial for murder and committed him to a mental
institution. But in other cases, judges have forced defendants to
take their medications.
</P>
<P>
   In the Goldstein case, Justice Carol Berkman of state Supreme
Court in Manhattan has said she would allow Goldstein to stop
taking his medication for as long as he appears competent to stand
trial. If he appears not to understand his surroundings, she ruled,
he will be forcibly given his medication.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein showed no signs of disorientation during Tuesday's
court proceedings, briskly answering a series of routine questions
from the judge. In fact, he appeared more alert than he had during
his first trial, when he was fully medicated.
</P>
<P>
   Odd behavior by Goldstein in front of the jury should not
technically affect his case, legal experts say. The jury will be
instructed to judge Goldstein's state of mind at the time he pushed
Webdale, a young woman from Buffalo, not his state of mind during
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts said juries in insanity defense cases are
known to go with their inner sense of whether or not a defendant is
unsound or just faking it. Several jurors in Goldstein's first
trial said they noted his demeanor in the courtroom, which they
said appeared normal.
</P>
<P>
   If neither side presents new evidence in the second trial, an
appearance by Goldstein on the witness stand could be pivotal.
Canfield said he was unsure whether his client would actually take
the stand, warning that prosecutors could ``destroy'' Goldstein on
cross-examination. But the defense may gamble that the image of a
frightened and disoriented mentally ill defendant is their best
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Paul F. Stavis, director of the Center for Law and Psychiatry at
George Mason School of Law in Arlington, Va., said putting any
defendant on the witness stand is an unpredictable tactic. But
putting a mentally ill defendant who is off medication on the
witness stand _ ethical and medical considerations aside _ is
enormously unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he gets into a delusion where he talks about burning
babies, that's not going to help,'' Stavis said. ``But if he talks
about God telling him to do things and crying, that could help.
It's very risky, very risky.''

</P>
<P>
   Ghostface Killah. Epic/Razor Sharp Records. 21 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Quiet, everyone, quiet. It's time for your hip-hop genealogy
lesson. Many mortals may not know this, but the guy who records
under the intimidating name Ghostface Killah also goes by Tony
Starks. Drop the ``s'' and any comic book fan knows you've got the
public-serving Iron Man out of costume. And a fitting superhero
persona for this rapper. Among Ghostface's powers are an ability to
pack incredible descriptions of an arrest (``Saturday Nite''),
appealing to women (``One'') and adolescence (``Child's Play'')
into a single line. As a whole, his second album soars alongside
the other recent solo efforts from fellow Wu-Tang Clan members.
Completing his arsenal are producers who use a French record sample

   Keith Moon is long gone. ``Won't get fooled again'' backs a new
Nissan ad. And ``Tommy'' is a Broadway hit. What a long way it
seems from the Who's mod-punk days, when ``My Generation'' mocked
the over-30 set and Pete Townshend's stage antics set the standard
for angry-man rock. Thank goodness, then, that those deep BBC
vaults have preserved the early Whodlum days, providing this
warts-and-all snapshot of the band on the rise. Recorded from 1965
to '73, the tracks on ``BBC Sessions'' have an alluring
diamond-in-the-rough (often very rough) quality. Roger Daltrey's
voice is hard and earnest. Townshend's slash-and-burn riffing is
fresh and daring. And the rowdy Moon-John Entwistle rhythm section
rumbles along like a freight train. These ``Sessions'' might have
been sanitized and packaged for nostalgia trippers. But the
producers wisely left these flawed gems unpolished, providing
sweatily satisfying versions of fan favorites like ``Substitute,''
``The Seeker'' and ``Pictures of Lily,'' along with a handful of
left-turn R&AMP;B covers.

 &HT;    Oasis' standing slides down a bit further
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It begins inauspiciously, with a self-indulgent instrumental
complete with sampled naughty words and a title that's unprintable
in a family publication. That's followed by ``Go Let It Out!,'' one
of the best things they've done since ``(What's the Story) Morning
Glory,'' the band's second and best album. Sadly, it's downhill
from there. It's not awful, just horribly disappointing. Oasis
sounds weary, as if making music is now a chore. It appears that
the band may have peaked with ``(What's the Story) Morning Glory.''
There was reason to hope that the third album, ``Be Here Now,'' was
an aberration, a bloated misstep that would be rectified with the
next record. This is a better record than ``Be Here Now,'' but
that's faint praise.
</P>
<P>
   It's plain that guitarist and songwriter Noel Gallagher has a
limited storehouse of melodies. ``Gas Panic!'' is certainly a good
tune, but it sounds frighteningly familiar. That song and ``Where
Did It All Go Wrong?'' hint at the fire and heart these guys used
to display in abundance. There's almost half a good record here.
</P>
<P>
   Vocalist Liam Gallagher still has that terrific snarl, but he's
no songwriter, as his sole contribution here attests. Though no
doubt heartfelt, ``Little James'' just proves that parental
affection doesn't translate well to record. It just sounds treacly
and trite.
</P>
<P>
   Closing the record and sounding like an outtake from ``Be Here
Now,'' ``Roll It Over'' is a middling Oasis power ballad that
steals its best bit from Thunderclap Newman's ``Something in the
Air.'' Noel Gallagher cribbing from the rock 'n' roll songbook is
nothing new, but he used to do it with such panache. Now it just
seems like lazy larceny.

 &HT;    `Double Jeopardy' criminally efficient
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as a gender-bent version of ``The Fugitive.'' That
movie's Oscar-winning star, Tommy Lee Jones, lends his gravelly
gravitas to the role of Travis, a tough parole officer who runs a
halfway house for ex-convicts.
</P>
<P>
   The latest arrival is Libby (Ashley Judd), newly released for
murdering her husband, Nick (Bruce Greenwood). The twist is that
not only is Libby innocent of the crime, but the crime never
occurred. The ``corpse'' set up his own apparent demise, framed
Libby, raked in some insurance money and moved on with their young
son in tow, changing his identity en route.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent six years in the slammer, Libby wants to track down
her greaseball ex and get even. Since she can't settle the score
while heeding the halfway house's 8 p.m. curfew, she's soon on the
lam, trying to find Nick, with Travis in hot pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   For better and for worse, ``Double Jeopardy'' glides along with
the smooth, impersonal efficiency of the sailboat that sets up the
movie's first big twist. The movie presents Libby less as an
individual than a collection of skills that serve the needs of each
scene. She's tough enough to break into a locked building and can
also finesse her way into an Armani dress. But when Libby nears her
prey, the script forces her to behave stupidly, dropping her
hard-earned guard long enough to land in peril.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jones is top-billed, the movie belongs to Judd. Like the
movie, she's technically polished, but the performance doesn't
linger in your memory once the credits roll. Grade: B-

 &HT;    Tofu, not just for vegetarian
 &HT;    By Deborah Geering
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tofu, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone?
</P>
<P>
   For the near-decade I've been a vegetarian, I've had to enjoy my
favorite soy-based source of protein pretty much alone. But now,
after watching friends and family members turn up their noses for
so long, I'm actually getting some takers.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time. The comfort food of the Asian world is finally
finding a place on the American dinner plate. And so are many other
soy products, from creamy soy milk to hearty tempeh to rich-tasting
miso.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden interest in a 5,000-year-old food? After all,
Chinese, Japanese and other Asians have been consuming soybeans in
many forms for centuries, all the while enjoying the health
benefits of a low-fat, high-protein food. But Westerners seem to be
approaching this versatile legume from the opposite vantage point.
They're seeking the health gains, discovering incidentally that soy
can be quite tasty, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love soy foods, but you need to know how to cook
them,'' said Mollie Katzen, author of several classic
vegetable-friendly cookbooks, including ``The Moosewood Cookbook''
and ``The Enchanted Broccoli Forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized
manufacturers of foods containing a certain amount of soy protein _
6.25 grams or more per serving _ to put a claim on their packaging
that daily consumption of at least 25 grams could reduce the risk
of coronary heart disease. The ruling was based on the FDA's
conclusion that soy proteins lower LDL (``bad'') cholesterol levels
in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the heart-healthy discovery, scientists are
conducting fast and furious research into other possible health
benefits of the humble soybean. Studies indicate that isoflavones,
a plant chemical found almost uniquely in soybeans, may help reduce
the risk of some cancers _ including breast, colon, uterine and
prostate _ and prevent osteoporosis, loss of bone mass. The weak
estrogen effect of isoflavones may also ease menopause symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   We of the nuts-and-berries set suspected soy's benefits all
along. ``I think for vegetarians, the (FDA) soy announcement
doesn't shake their world too much,'' Katzen said. ``It just
validates what they've already been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, she said, ``It's not at all about taking meat away
from you; it's about adding something.'' She recommends just making
room on the plate for some soy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Although the effects of isoflavones and other chemical compounds
found in soybeans are still being studied, Nancy Anderson, a
registered dietitian and the HeartWise co-ordinator at Emory Heart
Center, encourages people to go ahead and start incorporating soy
foods in their diets. ``You're definitely not doing any harm, but
you could be doing yourself some good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Should men worry about the estrogen effect of isoflavones? ``I
don't think there would be enough to cause any problems for men,''
Anderson advised. ``Men have estrogen in their bodies, just like
women have some testosterone in their bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the recent attention, soy isn't new to America. The
beans first arrived in North America via Savannah in 1765. Soy
became a popular forage plant for cattle about a century later. In
the early 1900s, studies by George Washington Carver expanded the
soybean's reputation from a simple forage crop to an edible and
inexpensive source of oil and protein.
</P>
<P>
   Soy production continued to grow throughout the century as
Americans discovered more and more uses for the ``miracle crop'':
in industry (soy appears in adhesives, inks, polyesters and
pharmaceuticals, to name a few products), agriculture and foods.
Now nearly half the world's soybeans are grown in the United
States, according to the American Soybean Association. In 1995, the
most recent year for which statistics are available, soybeans were
the country's second-largest crop, behind corn, in sales.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of U.S.-grown soy is exported _ mostly to Europe
and Japan. In the United States, soy protein is still primarily
used as animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, chances are extremely good that you've consumed soy
products, even if you're a sworn carnivore. About 80 percent of the
oils and fats consumed in this country come from soybeans, says the
soybean association. If you've ever spread margarine on your toast
or cooked with vegetable oil, you've eaten soybean oil. And if
you've ever been to summer camp or a cafeteria, it's very likely
that you've eaten soy ``filler'' _ usually textured soy protein _
in your meatloaf.
</P>
<P>
   But soy isn't just inexpensive, and it isn't just good for you.
It happens to be good.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Troy Thompson, executive chef at the upscale,
Asian-influenced Fusebox restaurant in Buckhead. Soy permeates the
place. The beans are served as a snack at the bar. Tofu makes its
way onto the menu regularly, and soy sauce, miso, soybean sprouts,
fermented black soybeans and soy milk creep into all sorts of
dishes, including salads and desserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people really notice if it's in there or not,''
Thompson said. ``I think people just enjoy it because it tastes
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Soy food products are amazingly varied _ the Indiana Soybean
Board lists about 30 varieties on its Web site _ but as far as
nutrition goes, not all soy products are equal. Soy sauce and
soybean oil contain few or none of the bean's beneficial compounds.
Miso, a flavoring made with fermented soybeans, boasts many of
their phytochemicals, but the small amounts of miso used in most
recipes don't add up to much.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the most common main ingredients in soy recipes _
soy milk, tofu, Texturized Vegetable Protein and tempeh _ have
relatively high levels of protein and phytochemicals. They are also
high in calcium, fiber and phosphorus. And soybeans are
cholesterol-free.
</P>
<P>
   To use these wonderful foods, it helps to know what they are and
where they come from.
</P>
<P>
   To make soy milk, soybeans are soaked in water, ground and
strained. Packaged in aseptic boxes and sold on grocery shelves,
soy milk can be drunk straight out of the carton or substituted for
cow's milk in many recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Tofu is made by adding a coagulant to soy milk. It comes in
several densities. ``Silken'' tofu is about the consistency of
yogurt. Soft tofu, which looks _ and tastes _ a lot like cooked
custard, blends well in many recipes. And firm tofu is for bold
believers like myself, who don't need to hide their soy. It does
well in stir-fries, soups or as a big ol' slab brushed with
marinade and tossed on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Nutty for soy
</P>
<P>
   Texturized Vegetable Protein, or TVP, is a trade name held by
the Archer Daniels Midland Co.; the lesser-known, generic name is
textured soy protein. It's usually made from defatted, textured soy
flour. When rehydrated, it feels a lot like cooked ground beef on
the tongue but has a very mild taste.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesians developed tempeh, a ``meaty'' substance with a
smoky or nutty flavor. It's made by fermenting whole soybeans into
a cake, sometimes with other grains. Tempeh is a little harder to
find than some other soy foods, but it is available in area farmers
markets, health food stores and Asian grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the most recent soy sensation in American cuisine
is the most basic. Edamame, now appearing at a sushi bar near you,
is a popular snack food in Japan. It's simply the whole soybean,
harvested before maturity when it's still sweet and green. It is
commonly boiled in its pod in salty water and served chilled, ready
for the snacker to pop the beans out of the pod, which is actually
also edible. Edamame is available frozen in Asian groceries and
farmers markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're delicious,'' said Katzen, the cookbook author. ``I put
them in stir-fries and I eat them as snacks. It's this kind of
crunchy, salty taste. It's totally addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   So, if you've decided to incorporate more soy into your diet,
where do you start? For beginners, Katzen recommends trying some of
the prepared products on the market.
</P>
<P>
   As a spokeswoman for the Boca product line, Katzen specifically
suggests Boca Burgers, Boca Breakfast Links and Boca Recipe Basics,
a ground beef substitute. Boca products, and several other brands
such as Prosage and Lightlife, are found in the refrigerator or
freezer section of grocery stores and health food stores. A new
Atlanta-area company, Prevention Foods Inc., has started
distributing a cow's milk-based pudding, called Absoylutely
Delicious, that boasts 7 grams of protein from whole soybeans in
every 5-ounce serving.
</P>
<P>
   You can also try substituting soy ingredients in your favorite
recipes: Replace one-fourth to one-third of the flour in baked
goods with soy flour. Pour soy milk over your cereal in the
morning, or make a smoothie in your blender with soy milk and fresh
fruit. Add canned soybeans and textured soy protein to your next
batch of chili.
</P>
<P>
   But if you ask this longtime tofu fan, soy foods are best when
they're enjoyed just for what they are. Soy doesn't have to be a
substitute for anything you're used to eating; it can be a new
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Says chef Thompson: ``I don't think of it as soy cooking; I
think of it as expanding our cuisine.''

 &HT;    Three-ring cinema: Looking at life under the big top
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems like everywhere you look, the circus is coming to town.
There's Ringling Brothers at Philips Arena, the UniverSoul Circus
at Turner Field (starting Friday) and the Big Apple Circus at
Lakewood Fairgrounds. But say you love sawdust and tinsel but are
allergic to elephants. Here are a few ways to send in the clowns in
the comfort of your own living room.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Greatest Show on Earth'': Or, the grandest kitsch on
earth, depending on your taste. Oscar voted it the best picture of
1952, and we have to admit that its de Mille-ian scope is something
you just don't find at the movies these days.
</P>
<P>
   The inimitable Cecil B., who does the voice-over introduction,
sends us on tour with the Barnum &AMP; Bailey circus. Charlton Heston
is the stalwart circus boss, Cornel Wilde and Betty Hutton
competitive aerialists, Gloria Graham the girl who rides the
elephant and Jimmy Stewart the clown with a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Their scenes mostly serve as bridges between the real circus
acts, though the part everyone remembers _ aside from the
elephant's foot poised over Graham's face _ is the spectacular
train wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Heston later said that the best compliment he ever got on his
acting was a fan letter a lady wrote to de Mille: ``I was amazed at
how well the circus manager fit in with the real actors.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``La Strada'': Another Oscar winner, for best foreign language
film of 1956. Directed by Federico Fellini, for whom circus themes
would become a constant, the movie stars Anthony Quinn as a brutish
circus strong man, Fellini's wife, Giuletta Masina, as the naive
waif devoted to him despite his mistreatment and Richard Basehart
as a high-wire specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn at first resisted taking the role until Ingrid Bergman
showed him an earlier Fellini film, ``I Vitteloni.'' Quinn said he
was ``thunderstruck'' and immediately signed up. However, the
collaboration wasn't a happy one. Director and star never got along
and never patched things up. Years later, when asked why he cast
Quinn, Fellini would give a typically Fellini-esque answer: ``For
his shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Trapeze'': Before going Hollywood, Burt Lancaster had spent
years as a circus acrobat. He'd always wanted to make a circus
movie; producer Dino DeLaurentiis even suggested him to Fellini for
the Quinn role. Instead, he ended up producing and starring in his
own 1956 tribute to the big top _ one that, he hoped, would counter
de Mille's cotton-candy spectacle with a look at the hard work,
discipline and even heartbreak that are a daily part of circus
life. To show he was serious about being serious, he hired Carol
Reed, director of ``The Third Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster plays a former star trapeze performer crippled by his
attempt to perform the legendary triple (as in triple somersault).
Tony Curtis is the rising star he mentors. Gina Lollobrigida is the
female aerialist who comes between them _ in the air and on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Though the stars did some of their own stunts, Curtis later
recalled that some stunts were so dangerous that ``even the doubles
had doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Carny'': Shot around Savannah and released in 1980, this
movie marks the beginning of Jodie Foster's transition from child
star to star, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carny,'' an uneven film with some intriguing moments, didn't
do it for her; it was pretty much a box office flop. But you can
see the early inklings of the talent yet to be tapped in later
roles. She plays a small-town waitress who, bored with her
existence, runs off with a traveling carnival. There, she comes
between best buddies Gary Busey and Robbie Robertson (yes, that
Robbie Robertson, as in the Band.)
</P>
<P>
   The film, which initially was conceived as a documentary, has an
ominous, skittish tone. No spangles here, just a pervasive
strangeness. In one of the weirder scenes, the circus fat man
stands naked in the rain, as if he were taking a shower.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dumbo'': Probably the best-loved circus movie ever made. The
1941 story of the little elephant with big ears is also one of the
most respected works from the first Disney golden age of animation.
As Ward Kimball, one of Uncle Walt's legendary ``Nine Old Men''
(i.e, core animators) said, ``Sure, we've done things that have had
a lot more finish, frosting and tricky footwork, but basically I
think the Disney cartoon reached its zenith with 'Dumbo.'''
</P>
<P>
   The theme is universal _ outcast becomes star. But the scene
that's been reducing audiences to tears for decades is the one in
which Dumbo's mother, imprisoned for protecting her baby from
taunts, reaches through the bars of her cage to soothe him with her
trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg paid homage to the sequence in ``1941,''
showing Gen. Joseph Stilwell (Robert Stack) bawling his head off as
Mrs. Jumbo sings her lullabye.

 &HT;    Incorporating soy into recipes is a cinch
 &HT;    By Deborah Geering
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're ready to start experimenting with soy products in your
kitchen, here are some recipes to get you started. Besides those
using various forms of tofu, we've included some using tempeh and
miso.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Not Really Chicken Salad
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Thawing time: overnight
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 3-5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time since I've eaten chicken, but to me this
tastes like the real thing. Freezing and thawing tofu _ and then
pressing out the excess moisture between several layers of paper
towels _ gives it a ``meatier'' texture. Baked, smoked or roasted
tofu, available in the refrigerated section of many health food
stores, also tastes somewhat ``chickeny.'' It can be used right out
of the package _ no additional processing necessary.
</P>
<P>
   1 pound firm tofu, frozen, thawed, pressed to remove excess
moisture and diced, or 2 cups diced smoked tofu
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup diced celery
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced onion
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup garlic toasted almonds (see note)
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup mayonnaise or soy-based substitute
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon raspberry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup crushed pineapple
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients. Add salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Note: To make garlic toasted almonds, place 1/4 cup slivered or
chopped almonds, 1 clove finely minced garlic and 1/8 teaspoon salt
in a frying pan. Do not add oil. Heat over low heat, stirring
frequently, until the almonds turn light brown, about 3-5 minutes.

   Thai Fried Tofu
</P>
<P>
   With Sauteed Wild
</P>
<P>
   Mushrooms (Fusebox)
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15-20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 8 minutes
</P>
<P>
   AJC dining critic John Kessler raves about this Fusebox
specialty, and after tasting it ourselves we can see why; it's
pleasantly crunchy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth tender and
satiny inside. If this doesn't win over a tofu hater, we don't know
what will.
</P>
<P>
   1 1-pound block silken tofu, cut crosswise into 2 pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup tapioca starch, available at Asian markets (or
substitute equal amount cornstarch)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1 quart peanut oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   1 pound hedgehog or other wild mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   Chives and sprouts for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Blot tofu gently with paper towels
to remove a little liquid, and pat dry.
</P>
<P>
   In a shallow dish, combine the tapioca starch and cornstarch.
Heat peanut oil in deep-fat fryer to 350 degrees. Roll the tofu in
starch mixture and fry in hot oil for 4-5 minutes, turning once.
Cook until crispy and hot in the middle, but not browned.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, melt butter in a large ovenproof skillet over
medium-high heat. Add shallots, mushrooms, salt and pepper. Cook
about 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add coconut milk and put in
the oven to cook slowly for about 3 minutes to release juices.
Return pan to top of the stove and continue to cook over medium
heat until thickened. Spoon over the tofu and garnish with chives
and sprouts.

   Enchiladas Verdes
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those dishes that taste even better the next day,
after the flavors have blended. Feel free to use whatever
vegetables you have on hand.
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 medium red onion, diced, about 1/4 cup
</P>
<P>
   Salt and cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 red pepper, diced
</P>
<P>
   3 ears of corn, shaved, about 3 cups kernels
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 teaspoons cumin seed, toasted and ground
</P>
<P>
   5 garlic cloves, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 jalapeno or serrano chilies, seeded and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 zucchini, diced, about 1 cup
</P>
<P>
   1 cup crumbled tempeh
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Tomatillo Sauce (see recipe, this page)
</P>
<P>
   Peanut oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   12 corn tortillas
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces smoked cheddar cheese, grated, about 2 cups
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large skillet and add the onion, 1/4 teaspoon
salt and 3 pinches of cayenne. Saute over medium heat until the
onion is soft, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the red pepper, corn, 1/2
teaspoon salt, cumin, garlic and chiles. Saute until the corn is
just tender, about 5 minutes. Add the zucchini and cook for 4 to 5
minutes, until the zucchini is tender but not soft. Add tempeh.
</P>
<P>
   Set aside 1 tablespoon of the cilantro for garnish and toss the
rest into the cooked filling. Add salt and cayenne pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Make the Tomatillo Sauce and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Fill a heavy-bottomed medium skillet with 1/4 inch oil; heat to
just below the smoking point (the tortilla should sizzle when it
touches the hot oil). While the oil is heating, lay out paper
toweling on a work surface. Using a pair of tongs, dip a tortilla
into the oil just long enough to heat it through, 2 to 3 seconds.
The tortilla should still be very soft. Lay it on the paper
toweling to absorb the excess oil. Repeat with the rest of the
tortillas, making sure they don't overlap on the toweling. You can
also layer the tortillas on top of each other, with paper towels in
between.
</P>
<P>
   Lay the tortillas out on a work surface. Set aside 1/2 cup
cheese to sprinkle on top. Place 1/3 cup vegetables in the center
of each tortilla and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cheese. Roll the
tortillas, making sure the filling and cheese extends to the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Ladle 2 cups of the sauce into the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch
baking dish and place the enchiladas in the dish. Ladle the
remaining 2 cups sauce over the enchiladas and bake, covered, for
20 to 25 minutes, until they're hot and the sauce is bubbling.
Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Sprinkle with the reserved
cilantro just before serving. _ Adapted from ``Fields of Greens''

   1/2 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced, about 1 cup

<P>
   1/3 medium green bell pepper, coarsely chopped, about 1/2 cup
</P>
<P>

<P>
   1 or 2 jalapeno or serrano chiles, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon creme fraiche
</P>
<P>
   Pour a little water into a medium saucepan; add the onion, 1/2
teaspoon salt and a pinch of cayenne. Cover and cook the onion
until soft over medium heat, without stirring, about 5 minutes. Add
the bell pepper, tomatillos and chiles. Cover again and cook until
the tomatillos are very soft and have released their juices, about
15 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Puree in a blender or food processor until the sauce is smooth;
season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and more chiles or cayenne to taste.
Add the cilantro and creme fraiche (if you're using it) just before
serving.
</P>
<P>
   To save a little time, soak the tomatillos in warm water for a
few minutes before husking them. The warm water softens the husks
and loosens them from the slightly sticky skin of the tomatillos.

   Substituting tofu for ricotta cheese was probably the first way
I ever tried cooking the stuff. The low-fat filling works equally
well in stuffed pasta recipes. Try filling cooked large pasta
shells with it and keeping them in the freezer for a quick weekday
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Food stylist Mary Ann Clayton, who is not a vegetarian,
described this as ``a real winner; one of the best lasagnas I have
ever had. It's light, satisfying and soooooo easy. ``
</P>
<P>
   8 lasagna noodles
</P>
<P>
   1 recipe tofu ``ricotta'' filling (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup shredded smoked mozzarella, regular mozzarella or soy
mozzarella
</P>
<P>
   4 cups Mediterranean Tomato Sauce (see recipe, this page) or
prepared sauce
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted
water to a boil, then add the noodles. Boil until pliable but still
firm, about 6 minutes. Drain the noodles and rinse with cold water
to stop the cooking. Lay the noodles out on clean dish towels.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the tofu mixture among the noodles and spread evenly over
the top. Sprinkle each noodle with 2 tablespoons mozzarella. Roll
each noodle into a jellyroll shape, being careful to keep the
filling in place.
</P>
<P>
   Pour 2 cups tomato sauce in a 9-inch square baking pan. Arrange
the rolls in the pan so that the spirals are visible, and drizzle
with the remaining sauce. Cover the top of the pan with aluminum
foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle on the
remaining mozzarella. Bake until golden and bubbly, about 10
minutes. _ From ``Vegetarian Times Cooks Mediterranean'' by the

   This is a simple dish with an unusual nutty taste and Asian

</P>
<P>
   1 rounded tablespoon white or yellow miso
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup hot water
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vegetable or peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sliced onion
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 cups peeled, diced butternut squash or fresh pumpkin
(about 1 pound)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound uncooked buckwheat soba
</P>
<P>
   1 cup smoked tofu, cut into strips (about 1/4 pound)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (packed) fresh basil leaves, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   Lightly toasted pumpkin seeds
</P>
<P>
   Combine the miso and hot water in a small bowl, and mash with a
spoon until the miso is mostly dissolved. (It doesn't have to be
perfectly smooth.) Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large deep skillet or a saute pan over medium
high heat. When it is very hot, add the onion and saute for about 5
minutes. Sprinkle in the salt, cover and cook for about 10 minutes
over medium heat. Stir in the squash, cover again and cook for 10
minutes longer, or until the squash is just tender. Meanwhile, put
on a potful of water to boil for the soba.
</P>
<P>
   Stir the miso solution and tofu into the sauteed onion and
squash. Turn the heat way down, cover and let simmer very gently
while you cook the soba according to package directions.
</P>
<P>
   When the noodles are done to your liking, drain them thoroughly,
transfer to a serving bowl and pour the vegetable-miso mixture over
the top. Toss with chopsticks or a large fork, adding the basil and
red pepper flakes to taste as you go. Sprinkle the top with pumpkin
seeds and serve hot, warm or at room temperature. _ Adapted from

<P>
   What appears to be a major victory for President Mohamed
Khatami's supporters in the new Iranian parliamentary elections
confirms that the Islamic regime that seized power in 1979 is
unlikely to survive in its current, strict theocratic form.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, after the shah was deposed, the coterie around the
newly powerful Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini purged its more
egalitarian members and crafted a theocracy instead of a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights were virtually ignored in Iran for a decade, until
Khomeini's death in 1989. With typical revolutionary excess, the
regime's zealots were obsessed with winning converts to their
cause, both at home and in the region.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, today in Iran, the most innovative movement is the
Islamic reformation. Iranian thinkers have injected energy and
ideas into a disparate effort, from Egypt to India, to somehow
reconcile a 7th-century religion with modern life.
</P>
<P>
   By using Islam as a popular political idiom, by weaving Islamic
tenets into a modern, Western-style constitution, and by putting
clerics in charge of the state, Iran has actually become a live
test and a venue for debate on the proper relationship between
Islam and the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Any aim to empower Iran's people was hijacked in the early days
of the Ayatollah's regime. Yet, ironically, the failure of the
world's only theocracy to empower its people has provided the
biggest boost for new, progressive ideas about the modern Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the most profound discourse within Islam today is taking
place in the newspapers, courtrooms and classrooms of Iran. Even
clerics who once held high office and intellectuals who were
proteges of the late Ayatollah Khomeini are now challenging the
religion's basic precepts as well as the specifics of theocratic
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran was engrossed last autumn in the trial of Abdollah Nouri,
a cleric, former Khomeini aide and editor of the newspaper Khordad
who had served as vice president, interior minister and Tehran city
councilor.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Court for the Clergy, which operates as an
independent agency, charged Nouri with multiple counts of
``insulting'' Islam, the prophet Mohammad and Khomeini. Nouri's
specific offense was running articles in Khordad that questioned
everything from the Islamic concept of eye-for-eye justice to the
clergy's automatic right to hold power.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial Nouri, dressed in a white turban and clerical
robes, astonished Iranians by taking the stand and denying the
court's right to judge him: ``I totally reject the court, its
membership and its competence to conduct this trial, and any
verdict you reach will have no legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   After his conviction he refused to appeal, on the same grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Nouri was sentenced to five years in prison
and was also barred from political activity for five years, a
punishment tacitly designed to prevent Iranian President Khatami's
closest ally from running for speaker of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And Nouri's newspaper was banned, although his staff defiantly
pledged to launch another publication _ the people's new way of
getting around forced shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Six months earlier, Tehran had been absorbed in a similar trial
_ that of Mohsen Kadivar, a popular young cleric and seminary
professor whose sister was an adviser to Khatami and another Tehran
city councilor; his brother-in-law served as Khatami's minister of
culture and Islamic guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Court for the Clergy charged Kadivar with
``disseminating lies and disturbing public opinion'' for writing
articles that advocated the separation of political and religious
institutions. Kadivar also dared to compare practices in the
Islamic republic with the former shah's repressive controls on
freedom of expression and questioned the powers and righteousness
of the theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``From both a legal and religious point of view, it's quite
permissible to criticize the Supreme Leader or the ruling
establishment,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nouri, Kadivar rejected the clergy's right to judge:
``Investigation into political and press offenses must be carried
out in the presence of a jury and by a qualified court of the
judiciary,'' he told the court. He was convicted and received an
18-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kadivar's case gained him celebrity status. Posters of the young
cleric, who came from a noted religious family in the city of
Shiraz, were plastered all over Tehran. Students held a candlelight
vigil in the hills near Evin prison, where he was being held
without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ``freedom of thought, forever, forever,'' they released
doves as a symbol of liberty. More than 200 journalists also signed
a petition that condemned Kadivar's arrest as unconstitutional and
called it an ``offense'' against Iran's writers and intellectuals.
These responses to Kadivar's imprisonment reflected a newly
emboldened population.
</P>
<P>
   Both trials involved an issue even more fundamental than the
freedom of expression: the separation of religion from government.
In an Islamic society, who has the ultimate power _ the elected
officials or the clergy?
</P>
<P>
   Since Islam is a monotheistic religion that offers not only
spiritual values but also a set of rules by which to govern
society, sorting out the distribution of power is critical to any
genuine, lasting reform. So political change and religious reform
are often tightly intertwined in Muslim societies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, Iran's leading philosopher, Abdul
Karim Soroush, has fueled public debate by offering a framework _
on the basis of faith _ to blend Islam and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that to be a true believer, one must come to the faith
without coercion or pressure _ in other words, freely. That
principle is the origin of all other freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Soroush has not abandoned the tenets of his faith; he believes
that ``sharia'' _ pure Islamic law _ can be a basis for modern
legislation. But he breaks from Iran's theocrats in his declaration
that Islamic law is not static, but instead is flexible and
adaptable because it has only begun to be understood by imperfect
human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Soroush was a long-time follower of Khomeini, who appointed him
to the Committee of the Cultural Revolution to set about being
certain that all Iranian university curricula were in conformity
with Islam.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade after the revolution, even Soroush, who initially
was so close to Khomeini, began to see the Ayatollah as an
instrument of transition, not as the goal. In books, magazine
columns and lectures at the three universities where he taught,
Soroush warned that Islam, like any other religion, should never be
relied upon to rule a state.
</P>
<P>
   To use religion as state law, he argued, opens the door to
totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Often called the Martin Luther of Islam by students, Soroush is
also widely popular among today's young intellectuals, reformers
and the clergy. Many of his former students and followers launched
new, reform-oriented newspapers _ most notably Jameh, Tous, Neshat
and Asr-e Azadegan, or ``Era of the Emancipators'' _ all of which
were closed down, one after another, by the current Islamic-based
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the goal of Soroush, Kadivar, Nouri and other Iranian
reformers is to be religious _ to be Muslim _ without being
fundamentalist, to be reverent but free, and to find a world-view
that is both Islamic and modern.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes Iran quite unique in the Muslim world. And the
work of Iran's reformers is spreading rapidly throughout the
53-nation Islamic bloc. Indeed, this is the last group of countries
to hold out against the wave of democracy that in recent years has
swept the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is still undergoing a transformation. After the elections,
more internal turmoil lies ahead, as the revolution's early
passions are replaced by hard-earned pragmatism, and as arrogance
gives way to realism among many believers in Iranian society.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the government of God is being forced to cede to
secular statecraft _ and to empower Iranians. In the process, Iran
has begun contributing to the spread of public empowerment around
the world.

   From Oxygen.com to TV, the entertainment industry is finally
creating culture that's ``for women, by women.'' But is this the
drivel we've been waiting for? As the executives see it,
``women's'' fare is only a step above ``young adult.'' And though
no one will admit it, the prevailing wisdom is that women are
stupid and narcissistic, desiring only mindless escapism.

   Ahmed Chalabi, 55, is the head of the Iraqi National Congress,
the once and, for now, future guiding body of the Iraqi opposition
to Saddam Hussein. As such, he is also the closest thing either the
Clinton administration or its Republican opponents have to a
strategy for replacing the failed U.S. policy of containing Iraq.
Aside from brutal in-fighting, though, the opposition has one major
problem. It still hasn't figured out a way to outsmart Saddam.

   From Oxygen.com to TV, the entertainment industry is finally
creating culture that's ``for women, by women.'' But is this the
drivel we've been waiting for? As the executives see it,
``women's'' fare is only a step above ``young adult.'' And though
no one will admit it, the prevailing wisdom is that women are
stupid and narcissistic, desiring only mindless escapism.

   Viagra was just the beginning. Soon we'll all be medicated and
wired for high-performance romance. Though many of us think the
totality of sex is unknowable, maybe even divine, considering
today's enraged pace of daily life, who doubts that a drug-enhanced
four-minute sexual encounter among harried urbanites could become
the norm? (Jack Hitt is a contributing writer for The New York

   Ahmed Chalabi, 55, is the head of the Iraqi National Congress,
the once and, for now, future guiding body of the Iraqi opposition
to Saddam Hussein. As such, he is also the closest thing either the
Clinton administration or its Republican opponents have to a
strategy for replacing the failed U.S. policy of containing Iraq.
Aside from brutal in-fighting, though, the opposition has one major
problem. It still hasn't figured out a way to outsmart Saddam.

 &HT;    Former mill town weaves an enticing spell
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRIFFIN, Ga. _ Be careful or you'll get ``socked'' in this
Spalding County town, which counts the infamous John Henry ``Doc''
Holliday as one of its early residents.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Griffin was home to a collection of textile and
hosiery mills, and one of its legacies is the 64-year-old Sock
Shoppe outlet, which today sells 2 million pairs of socks a year.
The shop also offers a good selection of T-shirts, hosiery,
underwear, jewelry and glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't beat the prices,'' said Shirley Ambrose of Macon,
who on a recent Friday afternoon was buying Gold Toe's white
athletic socks trimmed in red for 99 cents. ``We always come here
to stock up on these great buys.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Turner runs the shop, started by his grandfather Robert
Futral and a business partner in 1936. ``People from the North who
are on their way to Florida work visits to our store into their
trips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Socks aren't the only drawing card to Griffin, a historic town
of 22,000 that has gone from textiles to high-tech industry. With
the mix of new companies and new residents comes a renewed interest
in shops, galleries and restaurants. More than 40 stores, many in
restored buildings dating from the 1870s, range from the yummy
(Crumb Snatchers) to the artistic (Clayshaper Gallery &AMP; Studio) to
the hip (All Together women's clothing and accessories) to the old
and trendy (Aging Gracefully Antiques).
</P>
<P>
   And if you want to find the perfect gift or collectible for your
home, stop by the sophisticated Complements shop on West Solomon
Street. But if your Seiko watch needs a fast repair, head to
Sharp's Jewelers, which has been servicing residents' watches _ and
selling jewelry _ since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Marlow, a Griffin resident for 14 years, thinks her
adopted town offers many unusual shops. On a warm February
afternoon, she was shopping in one of her favorites, the Tiger
Lily, a women's clothing store. ``I have family in Gainesville,''
said the mother of 7-year-old triplets and a 3-year-old, ``and they
come to Griffin to shop. They like the atmosphere and the
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Bair, co-owner of She's Having a Baby, counts on both
residents and visitors to buy her clothing and gifts for expectant
and new moms. ``Since Griffin is between Macon and Atlanta, we get
lots of customers from Thomaston, Macon, LaGrange and
Stockbridge,'' she said. One of her best sellers is the Mommy
bracelet, a sterling silver strand bracelet with gemstones,
personalized with children's names.
</P>
<P>
   Like many smaller towns, Griffin lost some of its stores to
outlying malls in the '60s and '70s. But residents fought back,
using city grants to improve old buildings. Today, it's a fun place
to navigate _ on foot. Since 1984, when it was named a Georgia Main
Street City, Griffin has spruced up sidewalks, landscaped medians
and provided benches and trash receptacles. To interest residents
in downtown living, two buildings are currently under renovation as
loft apartments.
</P>
<P>
   A good example of adaptive use is the Dovedown complex. In 1921,
the brick building on West Solomon Street housed the Dovedown
Hosiery Mill, the first manufacturer of silk hosiery in Georgia. It
closed in 1957 and was renovated in 1978 and again in 1995. Today,
it's home to Jasmine Restaurant, an antique mall, a women's
clothing boutique and other stores.
</P>
<P>
   Also breathing life into downtown is the Griffin Auditorium.
Built in 1949, it was renovated in 1999 for $2.5 million and turned
into a state-of-the-art facility that hosts the Griffin Ballet
Theatre plus local and national theater and music groups.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin is named for Gen. Lewis Lawrence Griffin, not the
mythical half-eagle, half-lion monster. It was founded in 1840 and
was intended to be the western terminus for one of Georgia's
earliest railroads. However, the crossing was built farther north
in a little town called Terminus, which later changed its name to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   While Griffin lost out on becoming the state's capital, it
gained _ and retained _ plenty of small-town charm. At least movie
producers think so. With its historic buildings as backdrops,
Griffin has ``starred'' in several films, including ``Mama Flora's
Family,'' ``The Client'' and ``Murder in Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   And the motto on its water tower, Great and Growing, tells
visitors exactly how the town feels about itself.

   Q: I just had my bathroom resurfaced, and the workmen
recommended Greased Lightning as a cleaner. They acted as if I
could get it anywhere, but I am having trouble finding the product.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A: In a flash, we found Greased Lightning, a nontoxic,

CAMPBELL-WOODS IS ONE MATCH WITH SPARK TO IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ To a spa that is a haven for the rich, the
world's finest golfers have assembled, not to spar, but to gently
take the wraps off the first marquee event of a year that is now
stuffed with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship tees off
Wednesday at La Costa Resort and Spa, with a $5 million purse, an
unusual format, and a field of the top 64-ranked players. But those
aspects of the first of four World Golf Championship events this
season are somehow overshadowed by the destruction of two myths: It
does rain in Southern California and Tiger Woods is not invincible.
</P>
<P>
   The weather, usually a given out here, was the story Monday when
Los Angeles and San Diego were nearly washed into the Pacific, and
it is supposed to be nasty again Wednesday. Thirty-two matches are
scheduled for Wednesday, and no one wanted to talk about the
scheduling nightmare if Round 1 gets washed out.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, meanwhile, has gone two weeks without winning after his
ballyhooed streak of six straight victories reached a zenith with
his Pebble Beach heroics Feb. 7. He did report that all was well
(``I hit the ball well last week and hit so many good putts that
lipped out it was ridiculous''), but the questions were about a hot
streak that belonged instead to his first-round opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Campbell, who Wednesday turns 31, is arguably the most
intriguing subplot in this tournament, a reminder that fame and
success are fickle indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my whole career was done,'' said Campbell, the New
Zealander who went from nearly winning the 1995 British Open to
oblivion. ``The lowest point was in the (1997) French Open. I shot
81-80, something like that, went to my hotel room, sitting on my
bed, going: `What can I do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even hit the golf ball. Couldn't putt. Couldn't
chip. I was shanking my chips.''
</P>
<P>
   A club pro's life was a very real option until he had second
thoughts:
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought to myself, `Come on, don't be stupid. You've
done this. There's no reason why you can't do it again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a long road back. His body, broken down from an
inordinate number of golf trips around the world, needed time to
heal. His wrist, an ugly mess of inflamed tendons, needed time to
heal. Most of all, his confidence, shattered thanks to a world
ranking that had slipped from 28th in 1995 to 418th in 1997, needed
time to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got low,'' said Campbell, ``but I just hung in.''
</P>
<P>
   A classic understatement, considering the depths from which
Campbell recovered. From 1996-98, Campbell produced just four top
10 finishes worldwide and was barely a rumor in professional golf
circles. But he reunited with an old swing coach, settled some
problems in his personal life, and strengthened his wrist with
acupuncture, a recipe that helped him close out 1999 with six top
10s, including his first win in years.
</P>
<P>
   That it came at the Johnnie Walker Classic in Taiwan at the
expense of Woods is a source of confidence as he prepares for
Wednesday's challenge against the world's best player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's going to be very good for me,'' said Campbell,
who has won three times already in 2000, the reward being a boost
to No. 64 in the world rankings and a date with Woods. ``I'm
looking forward to it. I've been very hot, my confidence is very
high, and if I keep on doing what I'm doing right now, it is going
to be exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials wouldn't mind exciting, just so long as it
doesn't cross over to upsetting. Last year, Montgomerie, Parnevik,
and Davis Love got bounced in Round 1, David Duval left in the
second, Woods in the quarterfinals, and the inaugural World Golf
Championship endeavor was left with a Maggert-Andrew Magee final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it didn't work, but at the same time it didn't work
for a lot of people,'' said Montgomerie, who put his clubs away 10
weeks ago and didn't touch them until it was time to pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love this game, but at the same time, you need a break
from it, to take stock of what's going on and what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his break was not self-imposed, Campbell perhaps would
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it wasn't good at all,'' he said of those days in
exile, ``but now here I am. I'm back again.''

&HT;     `FALSE MEMORIES' IS A MEMORABLE THRILLER

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine you are Martie Rhodes, a healthy young video-game
designer married to a very stable house painter named Dusty. You
are walking your dog when suddenly you are seized by an unnamed
fear.
</P>
<P>
   When you get home, you are afraid to look in the mirror. You
pull yourself together because you have promised to go coax your
agoraphobic best friend Susan to leave her apartment, get into the
car and go see her shrink. For a year, Susan has suffered from fear
of herself, and then fear of everything outside her apartment.
After the appointment, you go back to Susan's, eat, have some wine;
then Susan confides that she thinks her ex-husband is sneaking in
at night and raping her.
</P>
<P>
   When you get home, you are seized by the fear you will hurt
someone, and in a frantic state begin to throw away anything you
fear you would use as a weapon _ knives, scissors, garden tools,
mirrors, fireplace tools, etc. Dusty is late coming home _ he had
promised to be home by 5 p.m., but doesn't show until much later
because he was busy committing his half-brother Skeet to a rehab
center after Skeet tried to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   So begins Dean Koontz's latest psychological thriller, ``False
Memories'' (Bantam Books, $26.95, 627 pages). And page by page the
terror mounts as an unspeakable monster works to put Martie and
Dusty through as much horror and anguish as can be survived before
he finally tries to kill them. His weapon is a diabolical method of
brainwashing that causes his victims to act on his suggestions with
no idea that they are committing atrocities until the deeds are
done.
</P>
<P>
   This is compelling storytelling that will leave you feeling like
a limp dishrag. The first 200 pages are the setup, and then the
action begins and never slows down. The villain is one of most
heinous that Koontz has ever dreamed up _ and he has come up with
some real nasties over the years.

   (``Nothing But the Truth.'' By John Lescroart. Delacorte Press.
$24.95. 435 pages.)
</P>
<P>
   John Lescroart's latest legal thriller featuring attorney Dismas
Hardy is a riveting read.
</P>
<P>
   Things are not perfect in the Hardy household _ Dismas works too
hard and his wife, Frannie, is taken up with the lives of their two
young children. After getting a client's case dismissed, Dismas
returns to his office and gets a message to call his children's
school. When he calls, he is told that his wife failed to pick up
the kids. He races to the school to get his children, takes them
home and waits for Frannie. He calls his old police partner, who
checks the hospitals. Finally, at 6:20 p.m., Frannie calls and
tells him she is in jail for contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   Frannie never told Dismas that she had been subpoenaed to
testify in a grand jury investigation into the murder of Bree
Beaumont, whose children attend the same school as the Hardy
children. Frannie had been having coffee with Bree's husband, Ron,
at the time of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ron is a key suspect and the district attorney is
on a fishing expedition for evidence against the new widower. When
Frannie refuses to answer a question, then insults the judge, she
gets four days in jail. Convinced of Ron's innocence, at first she
refuses to tell Dismas of a secret Ron asked her to tell no one.
She refuses to apologize and begs Dismas to find Bree's killer.
Dismas' investigation puts the Hardy family in peril as he gets
closer to unmasking the killer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the joys of reading Lescroart is that he makes San
Francisco a character. His characters come alive between dialogue
and vivid descriptions. His plot is creative without being so
overly complex that the reader gets lost. ``Nothing But the Truth''
is one of Lescroart's best tales yet.

&HT;     EX-CONGRESSMAN'S BOOK EXAMINES THE LIONS' DEN OF POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CRAIG MARINE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ronald V. Dellums struck fear in the Washington
establishment even before he got to the nation's capital. He holds
the distinction of being attacked nationally by then-Vice President
Spiro Agnew as he was preparing his bid to become a congressman
from Oakland in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Agnew, always a loose cannon in front of a microphone, used the
safety of an admiring Arkansas audience to say that there was a
dangerous, radical extremist running for office in California who
should be ``purged from the body politic.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack helped shape Dellums' image nationally, and while it
is true he never backed down from a battle, it's also true that
Dellums' legacy is more about building coalitions and bridging gaps
than it is about storming the barricades. Dellums' new book,
``Lying Down With the Lions'' (Beacon, 272 pages, $25), written
with longtime associate H. Lee Halterman, makes this obvious _ even
if it does occasionally bludgeon the reader with the details of one
too many subcommittee meetings.
</P>
<P>
   That Agnew would even be aware of an obscure Berkeley City
Councilman shows just how divided the times were, with a White
House making up lists of enemies, National Guard troops gunning
down students, riots, war on the other side of the world and talk
of revolution with a capital ``R.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were crazy times,'' Dellums said recently while
promoting the book in San Francisco. ``Even the decision to run for
office _ and I was called into service _ was seen by many on the
left as a sell-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But where many people only heard the rage expressed on the
streets, I heard the principles feeding the outrage. I felt that it
was necessary to carry our voice into the system, to articulate our
positions within the body politic. After all,'' he continued, ``if
they were so set on keeping me out, there had to be a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   As different as Dellums appeared to his colleagues when he
entered Congress in 1970 (he certainly stood out with his large
Afro and bell-bottoms), he insisted that some of the best people he
ever met were fellow politicians, often ones with opposing
ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I try to get across to younger people these days,'' said
Dellums, now a young-looking 64, ``is that all of the cynicism and
dismissiveness they have toward politicians and the political
process is misdirected. The political process itself, the act of
becoming elected, for example, does not have to corrupt an
individual in and of itself. It is possible to maintain your
integrity and also fight for what you believe. It saddens me that
so many of our young people seem to have surrendered their
responsibilities in the process.``
</P>
<P>
   Dellums, a Democrat, left Congress in 1998 after 28 years. He
felt, simply, that he had done his share of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never woke up one day and decided that I wanted to be a
politician,'' he remembered. ``It just so happened that people came
to me, thought I could be elected, thought I could do some good. I
tried. And then it was time for me to go. I wanted to get my life
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dellums can't quite shake free of the political spectrum. As
president of Healthcare International Management Co., he has been
trying hard to get more money and medicine to fight the spread of
AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, in Africa. And he
has been using most of the current book tour calling people to
action rather than blatantly pushing his product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when Martin Luther King was assassinated,'' Dellums
said. ``No one person could leap in and take over and carry all of
his messages at once. But many people stepped in and picked up some
part of what he was doing and kept it alive. I tried to be one of
those people, so that if I ever met Dr. King I could look at him
and say, `I heard you, I knew what you were doing and I tried to do
my share.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, what happens too often is that people think that once
they elect a representative, their part of the bargain is over.
They forget that the person in Washington is a reflection of the
voters, that it is the duty of the voters to shape the policies and
agendas that their representatives present in Washington. The real
work, once an election is won, is just beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dellums talks bluntly about the Democratic presidential contest
between Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pointless to enter the debate at this level because they
aren't really talking about the issues in the manner that would
best serve the public,'' he said. ``It's become a personality
contest, manufactured images _ no one is served by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, however, Dellums sees the current election as the
perfect opportunity for progressives to step up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the moment for progressives to take charge and set the
tone of the discussions,'' the former congressman said. ``The
agenda is there for the taking, and if enough people step forward,
it changes the nature of what is being talked about.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I tried to do was very basic: Always show up for the
fight and always be true to my principles. By showing up and
presenting your ideas, they need to be dealt with _ significant
changes, like the ending of a war or freedom in South Africa, can
result. It's much easier to stand on the outside and throw
stones,'' he said. ``I say stop watching and engage.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellums points to the end of his book when asked to evaluate his
time in Congress, saying he was honored to serve the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to Congress for but a minute in the history of the
nation, and I do believe with absolute confidence that I remained
faithful to my sacred bond with my constituency and faithful to the
progressive ideas they manifested through their activism and their
outrage,'' he writes. ``Linking hands with them and with countless
other activists across the nation and around the world in the
service of their legislative agenda has been the highest privilege
imaginable.''

 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The great claim Albany has hung its hat on for
years _ that it is the home of the longest-serving mayor in
American history, the late Erastus Corning II _ has suffered an
irreconcilable blow.
</P>
<P>
   That honor really goes to John Coyne, 84, who was mayor of
Brooklyn, Ohio, for 52 years _ a full decade longer than Corning.
Coyne was defeated for re-election last year by fellow Democrat
Kenneth Patton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even know about Albany,'' Patton said from Brooklyn,
a suburb of Cleveland with 13,000 residents. ``We just thought
Coyne was the longest-serving mayor for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyne was first elected in 1947. Corning served as mayor of New
York's capital city from 1941 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, plenty of publications have referred to Corning as
the nation's longest-serving mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corning was always referred to as that, and it became attached
to his name, and, in turn, that helped to define Albany,'' noted
Paul Grondahl, author of ``Mayor Corning: Albany Icon, Albany
Enigma.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, described by The New York Times as ``a minor
classic,'' Grondahl, a reporter for the Albany Times Union,
explains that Corning passed two other mayors _ Edward Biertuempful
of Union Township, N.J., and Orville Hubbard of Dearborn, Mich., in
1977 for the title of longest-tenured mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But Grondahl said he ``didn't even know about Coyne,'' a
spitfire who spends his Februarys in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Paul Cassidy, the mayor of another Cleveland
suburb, Parma Heights. Cassidy, 80, is the
longest-currently-serving mayor in the country, with 43 years in
office. He already is planning his 2001 re-election campaign in the
city of 26,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ring door bells. I'm campaigning all the time at parties,
weddings, funerals and meetings,'' said Cassidy, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But Grondahl noted that in his book, he ``couched'' the
terminology behind Corning's achievement, naming him the
``longest-tenured mayor of a `major' city.''
</P>
<P>
   So the record may depend on whether Brooklyn and Parma Heights
can be considered ``major'' cities. Or Albany, population 100,000,
for that matter.

MARTINEZ LIGHTS IT UP AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Pedro Martinez arrived for work Tuesday at
8:40 a.m. Even before he parked and locked his SUV, you knew what
was coming. You knew he would peer over his sunglasses, walk into
the Red Sox clubhouse, and have everyone laughing with him by the
top of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   You also knew that there would be a ride on the Martinez
Carousel. The subjects would be intelligence, nudity, death,
discrimination, communication, optimism, work, and curveballs. He
even went into the Jimy Williams Archives and borrowed a bizarre
line.
</P>
<P>
   I am sure there were a few Sox who were upset with the pitcher's
(relatively) late spring training arrival. But it was a nonissue by
8:50. Not only does the man create art with his right arm, he
artfully disarms you as well.
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez smiles, it is as if a sunrise develops on his
face. The smile is full and bright, as distinctive as the symphony
that comes out of Bill Russell when he laughs. Like Russell's
cackle, Martinez's smile is contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I'm in the house!''
</P>
<P>
   It was only 9:15 when a smiling Martinez said that, awakening a
quiet clubhouse. By that point, Derek Lowe had already complimented
him on his new haircut, and Martinez had already made fun of a
reporter's wind-blown hair. ``You look like a witch,'' he said with
a laugh. Minutes earlier, he had scolded the media for misleading
the fans by labeling him a no-show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you talk to Dan (Duquette)?'' he asked. He had left
a message for the general manager, telling him that he wouldn't be
in camp until Tuesday. He had some personal business to handle.
That message was eventually passed on to Williams's voice mail. But
the manager rarely checks his messages in Boston, and Duquette
wasn't available to clarify things until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Since there was such a poor flow of communication, Martinez knew
he would be dealing with a mini-crisis, a crisis that seemed
trivial by 9:30 and downright silly just after 10, when Martinez
walked toward the field. Before Martinez left the clubhouse, big
brother Ramon stepped out first and noticed all the cameras waiting
for his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be right out,'' Ramon said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. The younger Martinez came out seconds later and
headed for his first workout of the spring. He walked past a group
of fans, who applauded when they saw him. They may have noticed
that he weighs more than he did during his dominant, 23-4/303
strikeout/2.07 ERA 1999 season. He said he was trying to go from
176 pounds to 185 in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 182 now,'' he said later. ``I don't know where it is. It
might be in my shoulders, legs, belly, or my butt. I know it's
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He put on the weight because he was concerned about his strength
and endurance. (Williams believes the combination of the workouts
and the Florida sun will take the extra pounds away.)
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Martinez made his teammates laugh as he went through
his workouts. With all this talk of not arriving on time, maybe
people wonder about the way he works. Do they think his comedy
compromises his intensity? He felt the need to explain himself
several times, in several interesting ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not stupid,'' he said. ``I'm not in the big leagues
because I'm cute.'' He said that he has been known to ``run around
naked'' in the clubhouse, cracking up his teammates, but that
doesn't mean he can't concentrate when necessary. He said that he
would match his work ethic against anyone's. And if anyone believes
he is still upset about last year, when he was late for a start and
punished by missing it, ``They are thinking stupidly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carousel was spinning rhythmically at this point, with
Martinez riffing off several issues.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked about the two writers who left him off their
MVP ballots because he is a pitcher, he replied, ``The excuse they
gave me was a cheap one.'' But that doesn't mean he won't talk to
them if they approach him for an interview. ``Sure, I'll talk to
them. I don't believe in discriminating against anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words came with a very serious expression, but that didn't
last long. He was asked to tell the story of the Dominican
television station that reported his death (from a Jetski
accident). His mother was watching the station and called him,
crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby, what happened to you?'' she said. She was explaining to
her son that he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' he told her. ``You're talking to me. I'm
right here sitting, eating crabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez grinned again. He was asked if he could ``duplicate''
last season's record. That's when he pulled out the Williams
Classic. ``That would be 46-8,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Williams, have marveled at Martinez's ability to
master the subtleties of English. Fewer than 10 years ago, he
didn't speak it fluently. Tuesday he was making a joke with
``duplicate,'' by interpreting the word literally. Yes, it's true:
If you duplicated a 23-4 record, it would be a mark of 46-8.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he sits in the dugout sometimes, listens to the
creative and humorous ways Martinez uses the language and thinks to
himself, ``Where did he come up with that one?''
</P>
<P>
   By 1 p.m. you had to remind yourself that there was a minor
Martinez controversy 24 hours earlier. No one was talking about
that. Instead, the Sox were laughing and Martinez was saying he
thinks his team can win the World Series. So in less than one
eight-hour workday, Martinez had everyone at ease.
</P>
<P>
   He does that all the time.

 AN ARCHITECT'S CAREER OF BUILDING PEACE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DICK LEHR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Korean War was six months old when Kwaak YoungHoon, his
mother, and siblings bundled up, left their home, and hurriedly
fled south across Seoul's frozen Han River. His father and an older
brother had already gone ahead to find a safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked and walked,'' Kwaak recalls about that January of
1951 when he was 8 years old. Two older brothers were expected to
follow in a final shift in the family's flight. But the brothers
never arrived, detained and then presumed killed by North Korean
soldiers. The Kwaak family, just like Korea, was divided, the
sheltered sky of a boy forever shattered. ``The time was so
tumultuous,'' he says, ``fractured.''
</P>
<P>
   The war lasted until 1953, one of the bloodiest in history,
leaving about a million South Koreans dead, several million
homeless, and a nation still divided today. It also propelled Kwaak
on a lifelong mission. He and an older brother talked constantly
about working to repair a nation's damage. ``I felt I had to do
something about this. I have to study and prepare myself to prevent
things like this (occurring) again.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Kwaak, 56, is an internationally known architect cum peace
activist. In Korea, he was instrumental in bringing the Summer
Olympics to Seoul in 1988. He designed the Olympic Park for the
games that were attended by North Korea and other Communist
countries and gave the viewing world a glimpse of Olympic harmony
and augured a greater and broader thaw to come. Within a year, the
Berlin Wall fell and then came the sea change of glasnost in the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   He's spending this academic year at Harvard Divinity School, in
part promoting his World City Network, an organization working to
create ``peace'' cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ahead of his time, but his time is coming,'' says Harvey
Cox, professor at the Divinity School about the urban planner who,
Cox adds, has ``a wonderful gift for metaphor, a poetic touch.''
</P>
<P>
   The war of his youth proved to be what Kwaak likes to call ``the
seed of thought'' behind his goal to blend culture, economy,
spirituality, and environment in his designs, a mission, he says,
that requires nothing less than an endless amount of ``willpower
double-helixed with intellectual preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Willpower, willpower,'' he says, his hands closing across his
chest, as if his heart pounds with the force he says is required to
forge a more peaceful world. ``You cannot stop moving,'' he
continues, as the picture of a boy's river crossing comes to mind,
``Because if you stop, you are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwaak is nothing if not prepared. He is an architect, planner,
political scientist, landscape architect, and educator. He also has
a self-deprecating sense of humor, citing the acronym created by
the list. ``My son calls me A.P.P.L.E.'' This year Kwaak is a
fellow at the Harvard Divinity School's Center for the Study of
Values in Public Life.
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``Now my son calls me divine A.P.P.L.E.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for an interview, his preparation overwhelms. The
youthful-looking Kwaak spreads piles of materials across a long
conference table at the Divinity School _ folders, brochures, maps,
diagrams, and his own scribbled musings. It would take days to
cover the story he has in mind, a realization that comes to him
midway through one of his animated riffs, when he pauses and
smiles. ``I am rambling.''
</P>
<P>
   But his stream of consciousness, like good jazz, is captivating.
He runs a leading architectural firm in Seoul, keeps regular
company with world leaders, and is fully committed to his vision of
a new city for the new century. During his fellowship, he has
participated in conferences at which he's talked up his ``global
peace plan.'' His wife is with him and their two teenage sons
attend boarding schools in the Boston area. Just a few weeks ago, a
leading Korean television station broadcast ``The Man Who Opened
the Future,'' a feature about Kwaak's life and work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I make a place, it is for peace,'' he says. Kwaak
created the monument ``Unipeace City'' in the demilitarized zone
between North and South Korea, an emblem for the harmony he hopes
will someday involve all of Korea. His ambition is all-world, the
creation of a network of world cities whose world citizens are
devoted to world peace, places that combine the integrity of their
locale with international citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The cities could be entirely new or reconstituted old ones.
Though mystical sounding, World City sites are in various stages in
the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, Subic Bay in the Philippines, Tromso,
Norway, and what he calls ``Tumen UN city'' at the intersection of
Russia, China, and North Korea. Last month, he traveled to Nepal on
a mission for the United Nations to offer his views on the
struggling city of Lumbini.
</P>
<P>
   ``They persuaded me,'' says Kwaak about the UN request, ``that I
should take this assignment and write a report on why Lumbini has
gotten mired in dissension and conflict and has lost its focus and
meaning.'' He hopes Lumbini will go all-world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a realistic utopian, I think,'' says Cox. ``This isn't
just some kind of utopian pipe dream. What really impresses me
about Kwaak is that he's doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Boston, home of the ``Big Dig,'' the country's most expensive
highway rebuilding project, should take note. The city, state, and
turnpike officials in charge of _ and sometimes quarreling about _
the fate for the 26 acres that will be recovered once the Central
Artery goes under might well bring Kwaak to the table, if not for
actual design input, at least for his contagious and unifying
enthusiasm. In addition to peace activist, Kwaak's way with words
make him a design poet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is this here? Why did they do this?'' he can remember
asking about the Central Artery when he first came to MIT four
decades ago and saw a highway cutting off the North End from the
rest of the city. When first conceived, he says, projects such as
the Central Artery were not about ``vision, but division.'' He
shakes his head. ``People make mistakes. Smart people make
mistakes. Holyoke Center in the middle of Harvard Square is a
mistake. The Central Artery was a huge mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   To Kwaak, burying the Central Artery becomes much more than a
Big Dig plan to solve downtown traffic nightmares; it's a city's
healing process. Tracing on a map how the shape of the North End
resembles a heart, the highway burial becomes a grand act ``to have
a wholesome heart again.'' In this way, the challenge of what to do
with the 26 acres becomes a chance to ``restore the heart's
function'' and, once repaired, Kwaak imagines a string of thriving
parks and public spaces appealing to city residents and tourists
alike, with the edges set aside for new commerce. To him, the new
restaurants, boutiques, and galleries should be variegated _
family-owned and ethnic _ because, crucial to the heart's
functioning, ``Special things happen in those settings. Real life
goes on in those kitchens. They put their heart into their cooking.
The result is socially just and equal and you get real stuff, not
the phony institutional stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For most Bostonians the Big Dig has become a Big Headache.
Kwaak, ever optimistic, urges that the city _ and especially the
power brokers trying to decide the fate of the 26 acres _ take a
collective Deep Breath. ``Let's have a broader mind. The 26 acres
is a wonderful opportunity,'' he says, adding that the area can be
seen as a first step in a greater regional overhaul. Pulling out
notes and rough sketches, Kwaak describes a ``millennium vision''
for the Boston area, in which the recovered 26 acres becomes a
strand in a larger ``Beantown Loop'' of greenery that connects
North and South Station and would allow for ``more oxygen, more
open space, more people.'' Then, looking beyond the Big Dig,
Kwaak's ``Five Layers of Thought'' imagines a ``Millennium Boston
Bay Way,'' or a series of connecting structures in Boston Harbor
that would create new sites for development while relieving
pressure on the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good lesson,'' Kwaak says about the Big Dig.
``Boston made a mistake, now it is healing. Give it time. Be
optimistic. This occasion is very important, a chance to show even
more heart, tolerance, and to find new ways to live together. Don't
make another mistake so another generation suffers for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The smile sneaks across Kwaak's face. ``Boston becomes a World
City.''

&HT;     DOCTORS URGE PRUDENCE IN USE OF DIET SUPPLEMENTS FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SYLVIA WOOD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Megan Galbraith considers herself lucky. Both her
toddlers are enthusiastic and adventurous eaters, willing to try
everything from spinach to burritos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage them to eat a little bit of everything,'' said
Galbraith, a media relations specialist at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in Troy. ``My kids are kind of out of the ordinary.
They'll eat salad.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of parents might be jealous. The toddler years are
well-known for battles over food. Of all the questions Dr. Mark
Osborn fields from parents, nutritional concerns top the list,
especially when it comes to children who don't seem to like
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents tend to get frustrated,'' said Osborn, chief of
pediatrics at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. ``If it's a battle
between the parent and the child over eating, the child always
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents of picky eaters may be tempted by new lines of
nutritional toddler foods being promoted by the manufacturers of
Enfamil and Gerber. These companies are marketing cookies,
crackers, cereals, milk flavorings, microwavable dinners and juices
to parents who worry that their children may not be getting enough
nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toddler years are a key time of growth and development,''
said Dr. J. Roberto Moran, the vice president of global medical
affairs at Mead Johnson Nutritionals, the manufacturer of EnfaGrow.
``We want to make it as easy as possible for moms to help their
young children get the nutrients they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some pediatricians are advising caution in how parents use
these products.
</P>
<P>
   ``These shouldn't be viewed as a replacement for a meal for
picky eaters,'' Osborn said. ``The whole gamut of what a child
needs to grow isn't going to be in a cookie bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Such nutritional toddler foods are following the trend of
similar products for adults, from shakes to snack bars. And while
it's OK for harried adults to occasionally supplement their diet
with these foods, pediatricians say it's more dangerous to take the
easy way out with toddlers, who need meal times to develop new
motor skills and learn healthy habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for children to learn how to choose a good
variety of foods,'' said Dr. Benjamin Alouf, director of general
pediatrics at Albany Medical Center. ``I'm not so sure it's wise to
teach kids quick fixes like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith remembered her anxiety when her children, now ages 2
and 4, would turn their noses up at some meals. ``We had weeks when
they would only eat pasta,'' she said. But as she has learned,
patience and perseverance pay off.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband consistently offer their children a variety
of foods, letting them pick and choose how much they want to eat.
They've also made dinnertime a special time for the family, with
everybody sitting down together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's `talk about our day' time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those strategies are good approaches to avoiding
problems at mealtimes, pediatricians say. ``You can't force a child
to eat, so go with the flow,'' Osborn said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, don't get hung up on three balanced meals a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times parents are concerned that their kids didn't
eat a full dinner,'' Alouf said. ``Instead of looking at the kids'
meals on a daily basis, look at it over the course of a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are the diet will balance out on its own, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still concerned about your child's diet, talk to your
pediatrician. At the 1- and 2-year-old visits, doctors routinely
screen for iron deficiencies. Parents often worry about calcium
intake as well, especially if their child isn't a big milk drinker.
Remember, cheese and yogurt are good substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, set a good example with your own healthy diet.
Pediatricians say children learn by imitation. For toddlers wanting
to prove they're big boys and girls, sometimes nothing is more
appealing than what's on their parents' plates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have something different than them, they always want
what we have,'' Galbraith said.

LAW DRAFTER LINKED TO ASBESTOS INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE APPEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal legislation that could dramatically change the way
asbestos victims are compensated was largely written by a Harvard
Law School professor working for an aggressive coalition backed by
the asbestos industry.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, called the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act, is
expected to be taken up by the House Judiciary Committee as early
as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Law Professor Christopher Edley worked with a Chestnut
Hill consulting firm, Addis &AMP; Reed, on drafting the original
legislation and making revisions. Edley is a registered lobbyist
for the Coalition for Asbestos Resolution, according to lobbying
reports obtained by Public Citizen Congress Watch, a congressional
watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Edley said he is being paid by the coalition, which has nearly
200 members, including industry groups and the GAF corporation, a
major former asbestos manufacturer that for years has been fighting
asbestos-exposure lawsuits from hundreds of thousands of people.
The Associated Industries of Massachusetts is a member of the
coalition, as is a special interest group called Citizens Against
Government Waste, which has ties to W. R. Grace &AMP; Co., a former
asbestos manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Edley declined to say how much he is being paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't bought my views. They have bought my attention,''
he said. ``My standing in political and public policy circles is
too important to me to squander it on a client.''
</P>
<P>
   Edley maintains that the bill is the best hope for victims of
asbestos exposure to be fairly compensated, noting that many of
them have been stuck in the court system for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, apart from rich trial lawyers, agree that the
system doesn't work,'' Edley said.
</P>
<P>
   Edley and the Coalition for Asbestos Resolution say the bill
will weed out those who need assistance from those who do not and
ease a backlog of asbestos-related cases in courts. It would
process asbestos claims through a new federal administrative board.
</P>
<P>
   But critics, including the Association of Trial Lawyers of
America, public interest groups, and some doctors, say the bill is
being written to protect the asbestos industry, by capping its
liability and imposing requirements on victims that are so specific
as to exclude 60 percent of those who deserve compensation. The
trial lawyers group has lobbied heavily against the bill, which
would limit the percentage of fees lawyers can collect in asbestos
cases.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Henry J. Hyde (R.-Ill.), chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, is aggressively promoting the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's spokesman, Sam Stratman, at first rebutted the assertion
that Edley was writing the legislation and its ongoing revisions.
But after a review of Edley's comments to the Globe, Stratman said
Edley ``has been participating'' in shaping the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no one makes decisions about what's in the bill except the
chairman,'' Stratman said. ``I reject the notion outright that Mr.
Edley is writing the bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edley, however, said in a recent interview that he is still
heavily involved in writing and revising the bill. ``I've been down
in the weeds wrestling with legislation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an Oct. 14, 1999, memo, a senior aide to Hyde wrote that
Edley and consultants Deborah Addis and Jim Reed had developed a
draft. ``The chairman is interested to know if any members of the
committee would support the Edley proposal,'' the aide wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Edley and the consultants call themselves the Boston Area Group
on Asbestos Legislation, or BAGEL.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to President Clinton on civil rights who describes
himself as a progressive Democrat, Edley said, ``I make no apology
when talking to Republicans and companies that I'm trying to figure
something out that's a win-win for companies and victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying on the bill ``has been intense,'' said US
Representative Martin T. Meehan, a member of the Judiciary
Committee, along with fellow Massachusetts Democrats Barney Frank
and William D. Delahunt.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Asbestos Resolution has hired a truck to drive
around the Capitol each day, displaying a large, electronic sign
that flashes the number of asbestos cases that have been filed to
the day. And the Association of Trial Lawyers of America has taken
out full-page ads in Capitol Hill newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Under today's federal lobby-disclosure rules, companies do not
have to state how much they have spent lobbying a particular bill.
</P>
<P>
   The report of W.R. Grace's lobbyist, Donald Crane, indicates
that he spent at least $100,000 in 1998 and 1999 on the Fairness in
Asbestos Compensation Act and a few other bills related to tax
issues and the federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Coalition for Asbestos Resolution spent $500,000 to
hire two lobbying firms, Griffin, Johnson, et. al and Timmons and
Co., according to lobbying records compiled by the Center for
Responsive Politics, a Washington group that tracks spending.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Coalition for Asbestos Resolution has hired the
MWW Group, of New Jersey, to advocate the bill, according to Karen
Jordan, a lobbyist for MWW and the coalition's spokeswoman. Records
are not available to show how much the coalition paid MWW.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sole purpose of the coalition is to support and endorse
the legislation,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Trial Lawyers of America spent more than $2
million on lobbying in general in 1998. Fighting this bill is a top
priority of the group, spokesman John Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens Against Government Waste is an interest group that J.
Peter Grace, the former chairman of W. R. Grace, created in 1984.
Patrick Grace, Peter's son, sits on the group's board, said Thomas
Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jordan, Citizens is a ``top member'' of the
Coalition for Asbestos Resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens, a group opposed to government spending, is involved
with the asbestos bill because asbestos cases are filling the
courts, and that causes more courthouses to be built, driving up
federal spending, Schatz said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan declined to say how much money, if any, Citizens Against
Government Waste has provided to the Coalition for Asbestos
Resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying on the bill has also reached the medical community.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christine Oliver, an assistant clinical professor at Harvard
Medical School, has testified against the bill in Washington.
Oliver, also an occupational and environmental specialist at
Massachusetts General Hospital, said she opposes the bill as
written because the medical criteria are too strict. She backs the
idea of the legislation, but opposes this bill, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criteria are the gate, and if people don't get in that
gate, they don't get compensated,'' she said. Oliver has been a
paid expert witness in asbestos cases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Epler, of the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care
Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, also testified at the
hearing, but on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, you need to separate the people who are
impaired versus unimpaired,'' he said.

   Epler was paid by the Coalition for Asbestos Resolution to

   The GAF Corporation has had a hand in drumming up support among

Mintz Levin.

   All three of the Massachusetts congressmen on the Judiciary
Committee _ Delahunt, Frank, and Meehan _ do not like the current
bill, they or their aides said.

   US Rep. Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.) was diagnosed last month with
mesothelioma, an asbestos-linked lung cancer that is usually fatal.
Vento's likely exposure was as a schoolteacher, aide Rick Jauert
said. Prior to his illness, Vento had not paid much attention to
the bill, but he plans to lobby against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``His perspective on the bill obviously changed overnight,''
Jauert said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Meehan, ``I think it'll have a dramatic impact.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Chester A. Arthur was president of the United States
when Cabot Corp. got its start, and the company's core product,
carbon black _ a form of soot used in inks and rubber tires _
hasn't changed radically in the 118 years since.
</P>
<P>
   Which explains, in part, why adapting to the ``dot-com'' era has
not come easily to this Boston-based specialty chemical company
that posted $1.7 billion in sales last year from the production and
sales of mostly prosaic core products _ a mixture of chemicals that
someone once called ``soot, sand, and mud.''
</P>
<P>
   But change is in the wind as Cabot Corp., like many old-line
companies, finds itself snubbed by investors who favor promise over
performance and bid up the price of Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Cabot's response is a research-and-development crusade, putting
chemistry and technology to work in the quest for new products
based on the commodities that are the company's nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   The three major ones are carbon black, used in making tires and
inks and responsible for 60 percent of Cabot's revenue; fumed
silica, a microscopically fine form of sand used in paint and
cosmetics; and tantalum, a metal important in electronics.
</P>
<P>
   As a generation of R&AMP;D engineers who were skilled in finding
better ways to make old products has reached retirement age, Cabot
has replaced them with young chemists and marketing pros to put old
technology to work in generating new products.
</P>
<P>
   And as their efforts proceed, Cabot intends to move these
products quickly to market _ and then convert the divisions making
them into publicly traded spinoffs. Cabot Corp. shareholders
ultimately would get up to 80 percent of the shares of these
fledglings in tax-free distributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a collective decision that we would take our old
products . . . and build a family of new businesses that could
return a reasonable profit,'' Cabot's chairman and chief executive,
Samuel W. Bodman, explained. ``We think we can create value this
way for our shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of these, Cabot Microelectronics Corp., which turns
fumed silica into a chemically active, ultrafine abrasive used to
make complex, multilayered computer chips, including Intel's
Pentium III, is scheduled to make its debut this spring in a $75
million initial public offering. Cabot says this represents 20
percent of the Illinois-based spinoff's estimated total value.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up behind Cabot Microelectronics is a new, waterproof ink
for ink-jet computer printers, which are rapidly overtaking laser
printers in the marketplace. The ink is based on carbon black, and
chemists at Cabot's Billerica research laboratories are working on
color inks that are also permanent. A pilot factory to make black
pigments is being built in Woburn.
</P>
<P>
   And alongside the new inks is a compound for the oil and gas
industry, made from cesium, another rare metal found alongside the
tantalum in a mine that Cabot owns in Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Called cesium formate, it is seen as a substitute for clay-based
muds used in drilling wells that go three miles or more down into
the earth, to lubricate the drilling bit and prevent disastrous
blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders would agree it's high time Cabot Corp. did
something to boost both its image and its share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cabot hasn't had a money-losing quarter since 1993 and
earnings have steadily risen, revenue has been flat for years. The
stock has been stagnant as well; aside from a roller-coaster rise
and fall in 1998, Cabot shares have been stuck around 25 since the
mid-1990s, and the company's price-earnings ratio is around 13 _
well under both the total market and chemical peers.
</P>
<P>
   As Bodman put it in an interview: ``The stock market
unfortunately doesn't applaud that sort of performance.''
</P>
<P>
   One underlying reason is that consumption of carbon black is
cyclical. With 4,400 employees in 23 countries, Cabot usually can
weather localized recessions.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic downturn in Asia in 1997-1998 hit hard, as
demand there for tires plummeted. Cabot closed one of its two
carbon-black plants in Indonesia and only now is reopening it as
conditions improve.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that most Cabot core products are prosaic.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon black literally is soot, produced by burning natural gas
in stationary jet engines and manipulating the air intake to form
different sized crystals. Fumed silica is made from sand in a
process with similarities to that used for carbon black. And while
tantalum is important in electronics, it has few other uses, and
extracting it from its ore is a messy task.
</P>
<P>
   Cabot's other moneymaker is liquefied natural gas. It accounts
for about 15 percent of sales. Cabot's Boston-based Distrigas unit
imports the gas in refrigerated tankers from Algeria and Trinidad
and stores it in tanks in Everett for distribution throughout the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Previously in demand only in the winter, LNG is developing new
year-round markets in the electric power industry, as old nuclear
and oil-fired generating plants are being replaced with cleaner,
gas-burning units. Cabot itself will break ground this spring on
one such plant next to the Distrigas tanks, and next year the
nearby Sithe Energies plant, formerly owned by Boston Edison Co.,
will convert to using gas bought from Distrigas.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wall Street analysts like what they see going on at
Cabot following a decade that was spent mostly in shedding older,
money-losing properties, including oil and gas reserves and
production facilities in Texas and the Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zekauskas of Schroeder Securities says that with costs also
cut in Cabot's other units, the new enterprises should offset the
slow growth of the core businesses. ``I believe Cabot will
outperform the market in the coming year because of its
above-average earnings and growth prospects. The value of its new
technologies should be recognized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch analyst Michael Judd added: ``I can't think of a
particular downside. They can grow from internally developed
programs and spinoffs. Sam Bodman is not afraid to get smaller in
order to create value for shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cabot's spinoff plans resemble the venture capital style that
produces Wall Street sizzlers, there's a reason.
</P>
<P>
   Bodman, 61, who has been at Cabot's helm since 1988, is a former
Massachusetts Institute of Technology chemistry professor who was
mentored in the ways of venture investment years ago by one of
Boston's pioneers in the venture game, Georges Doriot.
</P>
<P>
   That tutelage led him in 1970 to Fidelity Investments, which was
then starting its Fidelity Ventures unit. Bodman over the next 17
years climbed the Fidelity ladder to president _ the job was
``running the fund managers,'' he says _ and number two under
Fidelity patriarch and chairman Edward C. Johnson 3d.
</P>
<P>
   With nowhere else to go at family-run Fidelity, Bodman saw the
opportunity to run Cabot as a way to combine his management
experience with his background in chemistry. It was only after
arriving at Cabot that he began to see the possibilities of
applying a venture capital approach to a the century-old firm,
restructuring the organization and divesting it of older,
money-losing divisions. The operating changes replaced
production-driven operating divisions with units that could focus
on customer needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole new culture in the company, and it is very
entrepreneurial,'' said E. Raymond Corey, an emeritus professor at
Harvard Business School who directs an executive training program
for Cabot.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a new way of doing business at Cabot, the company
still has not lost qualities that make it as much a Boston
institution as a global corporation. Its very name is a metaphor
for times a century ago when the Cabot family represented the
Brahmin elite who ran the city's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The makeup of the Cabot Corp. board continues to reflect those
times. Among its members are two direct descendants of the founder,
Godfrey Lowell Cabot, and a first cousin twice removed. Others
include John H. McArthur, the retired Harvard Business School dean;
Robert Henderson, managing partner of Greylock Management Corp.,
one of the city's premier venture capital funds; and John
Clarkeson, chairman of Boston Consulting Group Inc., one of the
nation's top business consultants.
</P>
<P>
   But McArthur says this, and the ties Cabot Corp. maintains with
MIT, Harvard, the Museum of Science, and other institutions, also
reflect ``a way of thinking'' perpetuated by the Cabot family that
serves the company well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a family here who basically says, `Look, do the
right thing,' '' McArthur said. ``That's certainly better than
relying on a phalanx of specialists and mutual fund analysts who
are always driving you toward short-term earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodman's introduction to the Cabot Corp. when it was seeking a
new chief executive is illustrative. It was Thomas D. Cabot, then
almost 90 and still active on the board, who approached the
transplanted Illinoisan from Fidelity. Both men were members of the
MIT Corporation. Cabot died in 1995 at 98. Bodman is now on the MIT
Corp. executive committee, is a trustee of several other nonprofit
institutions, and sits on four other corporate boards, including
John Hancock Financial Services.
</P>
<P>
   Cabot family members still control about 25 percent of Cabot
Corp. stock, said Kennett F. Burnes, the company's president and
chief operating officer. Executives and employees own about 20
percent. Fidelity holds about 10 percent, half designated for its
Value Fund and the remainder in corporate ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cabot's new products are being developed in its
laboratories, Charles Gray, vice president for technology, makes no
claim all the ideas sprang from there, too. The abrasive that is
Cabot Microelectronics's core product was developed at the behest
of International Business Machines Corp. And cesium formate, the
product for oil and gas wells, was an idea that came from Shell Oil
Co. chemists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pure luck,'' Gray says, that the Manitoba mine Cabot
bought in 1992 as a source of tantalum also contains about 80
percent of the world's known reserves of cesium. But until now,
there were few industrial applications for cesium.
</P>
<P>
   Even more new products are in the wings: a silica-based
insulation material for refrigerators and hot-water heaters; a
translucent form of silica crystals that could be used to
manufacture insulating windows; elastomers made from plastics and
carbon black to make truck tires stop more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The soot-sand-and-mud nickname, hung on Cabot last year in a
Forbes magazine article, appears to have fallen short of the mark
that Bodman hopes to set. The magazine also anointed Bodman as
``the soot king'' _ a title he clearly dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I would much rather be thought of as a guy who took
this old company and helped fix it,'' he said, ``so it could be
prosperous in the years ahead.''

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Hello, Regis? Who wants to be a millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   Well, I guess I do. I have a wife, children, mortgage and a pair
of creaky old cars, ages 21 and 11. Even being a thousandaire
doesn't sound too shabby. And now, my financial savior has come.
</P>
<P>
   He goes by the name Regis. And he lives in my television.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's a way I can actually get that million. Forget
the stock market. Lottery? Biggest sucker bet on the planet. Slot
machines? See previous.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's Regis Philbin's ``Who Wants to be a
Millionaire,'' a game show that rewards people with big bucks for
having their heads stuffed with information that's basically not
worth knowing otherwise. Why else would they call it trivia?
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the advent of this show, all I have to do to get my
million is tap into some of the ridiculous factoids randomly filed
in my cranium through my lifelong odd habit of reading almanacs,
encyclopedias and dictionaries for both work and pleasure. It
serves me well in my job as a newspaper copy editor to know that
the sun is 93 million miles from Earth, that the Boxer Rebellion
was in 1900, and that Abraham Lincoln's secretary of the Navy was a
guy named Gideon Welles. But it never seemed to do me much good
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   If an unusual talent for hitting a baseball is worth millions,
how about a big payoff for maintaining a fabulous wealth of
meaningless information? Fair's fair.
</P>
<P>
   So I was pleased to see that Regis, in his wisdom, allows trivia
nerds to try out for the show via telephone. I called, and Regis'
peppy voice _ tape-recorded, of course _ greeted me with the rules
for getting in on the ground floor of this million-dollar giveaway.
Said St. Regis, ominously: ``Good luck ...''
</P>
<P>
   After punching in my birth date and last four digits of my
Social Security number, I was told I'd have to answer three
multiple-choice questions using the telephone keypad. There was a
limit of 10 seconds per question. No sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The first was an easy one: rearranging four words to make the
title of a movie. That done, the next was arranging four novels in
the time period in which they take place, earliest to most recent.
A little harder, given the pressure. But I got through it OK.
</P>
<P>
   The final question played into one of my strong suits ...
putting four Civil War battles in the order in which they took
place. Bingo!
</P>
<P>
   After learning I was among the approximately 5 percent who make
it through the speed quiz, I had to record my name, town, state and
phone number and choose a taping date from a list they provided. So
I picked a date, and the tinny electronic voice told me to leave a
number where I could be reached the next day between noon and 3
p.m. in the event I was culled at random from the list of trivia
hounds who'd both gotten the three questions right and chosen the
same day for taping.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I postponed all my errands, my daily run and my
trip to the gym so that I'd be right by the phone when Regis
called. And starting right at noon, the phone rang continuously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regis, is that you? ... Sorry, my son's not here. Call back
later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Regis? ... Oh, hi, Mom. Can I call you back in a couple
hours?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Regis, my man! ... No, I don't want my lawn chemically
treated, but you're welcome to come remove the 18-inch layer of
snow that's atop it. And by the way, while I've got you on the
line, did you know that Richard Nixon was the president who
appeared on the old `Laugh-In' TV show? They actually gave some IRS
bureaucrat a million bucks for hitting that meatball question out
of the park. With multiple choice, yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went, with seemingly every friend, friend of friend,
friend of child and telemarketer calling, all of whom must have
been dumbfounded by the peppy hello they got from me.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I have to be at least as upbeat as my friend Regis if I get
the chance to sit on the stage and have him wave those bogus
cardboard checks under my nose.
</P>
<P>
   I had given up at 15 seconds to 3 when the phone rang again. I
couldn't even muster a cheery hello for the telemarketer on the
other end, and just slammed the phone down in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   A couple days later I qualified again, and again the same
scenario: three tense hours next to the phone, continual ringing,
and not one time did the caller sound even remotely like Regis, or
sound even remotely like they were interested in giving me the time
of day, much less a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So, Regis, I'm still hoping to hear from you. I'll keep calling,
and I'll keep my calendar clear in the early afternoon every day.
If nothing else, you've improved my phone manners, because from
noon to 3 daily anyone who calls my house can expect to be greeted
with gusto, a cheery hello worthy of my pal and savior with the
great ties, Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   And no, I don't want any lawn treatments. But have a good day. I
mean it.
</P>

   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ So, Jimy Williams was asked, did he see his
star shortstop appearing as himself recently on the TV sitcom,
``Two Guys and a Girl''?
</P>
<P>
   ``He played the guy, right?'' Williams said. ``Sitcoms? I guess
they're big in Boston. Ah, no, I didn't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also didn't spy Nomar Garciaparra sitting ringside at a
wrestling match in the FleetCenter offering his support to The
Rock. But maybe he will catch Garciaparra in the Amtrak ad he shot,
or in a spot for Dunkin' Donuts that is in the works. It's also
possible he could pick up a supermarket tabloid and find
Garciaparra's name linked with actress Lauren Holly, which was the
talk of at least one camp in Arizona this week.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little tougher than usual to keep up this winter with
Garciaparra, who still trails fellow elite shortstops Derek Jeter
and Alex Rodriguez when it comes to off-field celebrity but appears
to be closing the gap.
</P>
<P>
   But more important to Williams and the Red Sox is this: It's
obvious that Garciaparra did not neglect the spartan training
regimen that in the last several years transformed him from a
160-pound spray hitter into one of the game's dominant sluggers, a
routine that has inspired dozens of imitators, including a
bulked-up Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who worked out in Arizona instead of Florida,
appeared even more expansive across his chest and upper arms
Tuesday, and in his physical exam here, his body fat measured a
startling 5 percent. ``Last year, it was 5.5,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hard as it is to believe, one of baseball's more remarkable
bodies (former teammate Butch Henry once described it as a ``coiled
spring'') is sporting an improved model this spring. What does that
bode for a player who was the American League's Rookie of the Year
his first season, runner-up for AL Most Valuable Player his second,
and the AL batting champion last year?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, I don't really look back at that stuff,'' he said after
working out with several teammates, including newcomer Carl
Everett, prior to Wednesday's first official full-squad practice.
``When I look back at my rookie year, I look back at not making the
playoffs, the next year making the playoffs and losing, and last
year making the playoffs, winning the first round, and losing
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra still refuses to concede that the Sox lost to a
superior team when they were beaten by the Yankees in the ALCS last
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't lose to the better team,'' he said. ``We just didn't
play good at the time. We know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra played against the Yankees with an injured left
wrist, badly bruised when he was struck by a pitch by Baltimore's
Al Reyes the last week of the regular season. He missed a game in
the Division Series against Cleveland, and was able to resume
playing only with the help of multiple cortisone injections.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra missed 27 games with elbow, groin, hamstring, and
wrist injuries during the regular season, but still managed to hit
27 home runs and 42 doubles, while scoring 103 runs and driving in
104.
</P>
<P>
   ``The groin, I sat out for so long,'' said Garciaparra, who
missed the last eight days before the All-Star Game with a strained
groin. ``but the (worst) was the wrist injury, because of the time
when it happened, just before the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to do everything I could to deal with the pain. But
everything is healthy now.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra made four errors as the Sox fell to the Yankees in
five games during the ALCS. In all, the Sox made 10 errors to New
York's five, but Garciaparra blanched at the suggestion that
defensive mistakes cost the Sox the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, you look at the box score, but it wasn't the
errors that beat us,'' he said. ``You can't fault a guy for trying
to make a (tough) play. It's a crap shoot. You either make it or
you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of a lot of stuff. We were in every
single game. Sure, it was frustrating back then. You can blame the
errors, blame the calls, blame anything. But what happened
happened. You just go home and prepare yourself again.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra begins this season as the best hitter in the
American League with at least a thousand at-bats. He has a .322
career average, which trails only National Leaguers Tony Gwynn
(.339) and Mike Piazza (.328) and places him ahead of Jeter (.318)
and Rodriguez (.307).
</P>
<P>
   But there's one place in which both Jeter and Rodriguez are
about to leave Garciaparra in the dust: salary. After his rookie
season, Garciaparra signed a five-year deal for $22.5 million, with
two option seasons that could make the entire package worth $45
million.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, meanwhile, reportedly is on the verge of signing an
eight-year, $118 million deal with the Yankees, while Rodriguez,
who is eligible to leave Seattle as a free agent after this season,
is being projected as the game's first $200 million player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever (Jeter) gets, he gets,'' Garciaparra said. ``I'm
happy for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great. I'm happy with what I did. How can I say now,
`Look what I could have done now?' I'm content with what I got. It
was a great thing to do at the time. It allowed me to take care of
some personal stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, of course, that the Sox will rework Garciaparra's
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't concern myself with that at all,'' he said. ``If they
want to do that, that's totally up to them. All I worry about is
getting ready for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't even cross my mind. I don't know what (Jeter) is
getting, but I know what I'm getting and I'm happy with it.''

JUST HOW LOW CAN THE MEDIA GO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago during the Winter Olympics, Washington Post critic
Tom Shales decried CBS's decision to interrupt Seiji Ozawa's
historic worldwide broadcast of Beethoven's ``Ode to Joy'' with
commercials and feel-good interviews. ``TV,'' Shales wrote, ``had
hit a new low.''
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Just last week, Fox Television one-downed CBS
with its remarkable ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' in
which 50 bachelorettes vied for the hand of a San Diego
comedian/real estate developer named Rick Rockwell. With its
insidious peep-show format, consummated in a putative Las Vegas
marriage, ``WWTMAM?'' was the most degrading and voyeuristic
spectacle I've ever seen. Even for Fox, the channel that brought us
``When Animals Attack'' and ``When Good Pets Go Bad,'' it was a new
low.
</P>
<P>
   If the late-20th and still aborning 21st centuries have taught
us anything, it is never to assume that we have touched the bottom
of the barrel. With Rupert Murdoch, Bill Clinton, and Jerry
Springer gaily calling the tune, we are dancing an ongoing cultural
limbo rock, plumbing new lows on an almost daily basis. Now the
``new low'' is a purely transitional gauge, like those pencil marks
you make of your children's height on the door frame.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, for instance, the Washington Post opined
that the institution of marriage had hit a new low in the United
States. But who could have foreseen last week's Rick Rockwell-Darva
Conger nuptials? Her friends says she's nice, but one of his former
fiancees apparently took out a restraining order against him nine
years ago. One suspects that what Fox Television and the Las Vegas
Hilton have put together shall be quickly rent asunder.
</P>
<P>
   It was roughly this time last year that Time magazine's movie
critic Richard Corliss wrote that Hollywood had ``hit a new low''
by releasing ``The Mod Squad,'' which he called ``a quirky suicide
note'' for a directorial career. But what was the previous low?
Corliss thought it was Sandra Bullock's ``Forces of Nature,'' which
preceded ``Mod Squad'' by only a few weeks. Another reviewer called
the 1997 Tom Everett Scott-Julie Delpy clunker ``An American
Werewolf in Paris'' ``a new low.'' One can only wonder: have they
seen ``Magnolia''?
</P>
<P>
   A serious problem with adjudging new lows is: What happened to
the old low? The Independent newspaper in London told its readers
that US-Chinese relations have recently hit a ``new low,'' in the
wake of the Clinton fund-raising scandal and the espionage
allegations at the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory. Relations may
indeed be strained, but roughly 50 years ago American and Chinese
soldiers were killing each other on the Korean peninsula. By
comparison, you'd have to say the current new low seems like quite
a high, no?
</P>
<P>
   The opening months of the political season have disappointed
bottom-fishers like myself. But our patience is being rewarded.
True, Bill Bradley vs. Al Gore still looks like an Ivy League
pillow fight, but George Bush vs. John McCain may have embarked on
the proverbial race to the bottom. Just last week, a Bush supporter
circulated an e-mail suggesting that Senator McCain has fathered
illegitimate children. I'm sure we'll slip underneath that tawdry
episode soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   The bellwether New York senate race is already plumbing new lows
_ with eight months left until election time! Stern Methodist
Hillary Rodham Clinton is outraged that New York City mayor Rudy
Giuliani has suggested she is anti-religious. If this is a new low,
it will soon be undercut. Rupert Murdoch's pro-Giuliani New York
Post, a journalistic barometer for monitoring low blows, is already
pounding Clinton below the belt. The Post recently featured an
interview with a waitress whom Hillary failed to tip, after running
up a $7 tab.
</P>
<P>
   What revelation could possibly follow? Hillary doesn't brush
after meals? Multimillionaire lonelyheart Rick Rockwell has a wife
and family in Tijuana? Believe me, we haven't hit bottom yet.

 UNDATED: ... World City.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kwaak first began studying architecture and city planning at MIT
in the late 1960s. Laughing at a photograph taken of him then, in
which he's dressed in a white robe and is in flight delivering a
leg kick, he says, ``They thought I was Bruce Lee.'' Kwaak did
teach tae kwon do, but he was mostly ``in preparation,'' later
earning a degree in education from Harvard and, later still, in
philosophy from DongKuk University.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, he says, ``I was always thinking about the
future.'' Though his homeland remains unreconciled, Kwaak found in
urban design ways to promote reunification. Returning to Seoul in
quickly became a leading architect and began thinking of the
Olympics as a way to begin ``to break down ideological walls''
between north and south, the Communist bloc and the West. He
lobbied South Korea's political leaders, went to Montreal in 1976
for the Olympics, which were boycotted by a number of black
athletes protesting apartheid in South Africa, and persuaded
Seoul's mayor in the early 1980s to build a massive National
Stadium he would design and which eventually became the main
stadium for the Olympics in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people thought I was crazy to think Korea could host the
Olympics,'' he says, given the ongoing political turmoil between
North and South Korea throughout the 1980s. But this is when Kwaak
mentions willpower and begins to wax poetic, saying he was pursuing
a ``strategy of the dandelion.'' at the time. First, he says, you
define the vision, in this case the Olympics, and then you treat
the vision as ``a seed of thought, like the seed of a dandelion
that goes off into the wind, over the walls and heads of state and
then it takes hold with the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwaak went on to design the Olympeace Flame lit during the
summer 1988 Olympics that still burns today, as well as the Peace
House where Gorbachev stayed. Though North Korea did not want to
attend the games, to embarrass South Korea, Kwaak recalls,
Gorbachev would not have it. He says Gorbachev's commitment to ``a
new age'' proved instrumental in ensuring the success of the games
Kwaak and other South Koreans had worked so hard to achieve. ``Of
course, every one came. Hungary. Poland. The Soviet Union. So I was
very happy. It was clear to me that the success of the Seoul
Olympics, through television, affected so many people around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwaak believes the Seoul Olympics played a role in ending the
Cold War that has been overlooked by historians, who tend to mark
the Cold War as ending in 1989 with the collapse of the Berlin
Wall. He was irked last November by the 10th anniversary coverage
of the wall's collapse. To him, ideological walls were broken that
summer in Seoul, then an actual wall was broken in Berlin the next
year. ``It is my contention that the Berlin War was triggered by
the Seoul Olympics,'' he says. ``The '88 Olympics had a definite
effect on globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Kwaak's family received shocking news _ the two
older brothers who did not make it across the river to freedom in
1951 had not been killed as the family had long believed. The
brothers had lived for years in North Korea, barred from contacting
the rest of the family. Word came that one brother had recently
died but the eldest son, in his late 60s, was still alive, though
ill. Kwaak's mother was in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is terrifying that a mother cannot go to North Korea to
visit her son.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality of a split Korea once again hit Kwaak personally,
and haunts him. Over the recent holidays, he saw his mother, now
89, in Seoul, and he worries that she won't ever be reunited with
her eldest. During his flight back to Boston, Kwaak did what he
often does in such moments; he picked up a pencil and began jotting
notes and making sketches. Several days later he pulled out the
airline menu covered with the notes he made fresh from a mother's
farewell. ``I am on top of the clouds. I would like to cry but
cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   The notes are a blend of personal feelings and renewed
commitment to spread peace through the vision of his World City
Network. It is the strategy of the dandelion seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how I can wash the tears and sorrow of my mother away,
and it's not only my mother but many others with similiar sorrow
and tears, and I work to reduce this.''

NATALIE WOOD'S LAST DAYS; JUDGMENT OVER INTELLECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To a generation of moviegoers, Natalie Wood was the goddess next
door.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Rebel Without a Cause,'' ``Splendor in the Grass,'' ``West
Side Story,'' and even lesser films such as ``Marjorie
Morningstar,'' Wood glowed with a rare combination of sensuality
and soft-eyed sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Her sudden, shocking death by drowning in 1981 at age 43 was one
of those events that saddened people who hadn't thought about the
actress in years; as is often the case with film icons, fans
mourned the era she represented _ the late '50s and early '60s _ as
much as Wood herself.
</P>
<P>
   On the night she was found floating in the water just off
Catalina Island, Wood had spent the previous few days aboard a
yacht with her husband, actor Robert Wagner; Christopher Walken,
her then-costar in ``Brainstorm''; and ship captain Dennis Davern.
Wood's death was ruled an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two decades later, Vanity Fair writer Sam Kashner
reconstructs the days that led to that night. In chronicling the
``two-day drama of jealousy and rage, fueled by round-the-clock
drinking'' that he says led to Wood's death, it's troubling that
Kashner relies so heavily on the word of Davern, a source he
acknowledges as flawed because the captain has tried to sell his
story to tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   But the writer has done a lot of other research, and he argues
that Davern's account largely squares with that of other witnesses.
While Kashner doesn't quite get to the bottom of the mystery, he
does raise questions about the accepted version of Wood's death.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: To anyone with a soft spot for Natalie Wood, this
story will bring the sadness back.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's propensity for non sequiturs is rivaled only by
his father, former President George Bush. Evidence is accumulating
that Bush fils is not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
</P>
<P>
   But if we're destined for a second Bush presidency (deep sigh),
does its success hinge on his brainpower? Richard Reeves, who is
usually worth listening to on these matters, argues in George
magazine that it does not.
</P>
<P>
   Some of our better presidents have been indifferent students
(John F. Kennedy) or unexceptional intellects (Franklin D.
Roosevelt). ``What counts in governing is not superior
intelligence,'' writes Reeves. ``What counts is judgment on a
couple of big ones, and bringing out the best in the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves ranks the last seven presidents by intellect and then by
leadership skills. Ronald Reagan ranks last in intellect and first
in leadership, while Bill Clinton is deemed first in intellect but
only fifth in leadership.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain fascination to a genius _ F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Marlon Brando, Orson Welles _ who makes a mess of his career. If
we're honest, we'd admit that the sight of squandered genius also
offers a certain consolation for all of us non-geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Ford Coppola has never lived up to the brilliance of his
first two ``Godfather'' films. Once we get past the obvious
question _ How on earth could he? _ there arises a different
question: Were the expectations for Coppola simply the wrong ones?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Carson argues in Esquire that they were. In Carson's view,
``The critical misperception that's hobbled his reputation most,
despite sporadic encouragement from the director himself, is that
he's a thinker _ someone whose movies can and should pass
intellectual muster, when they don't and needn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of Coppola as a Deep Thinker took root, of course,
during the production of ``Apocalypse Now,'' a film that took
forever to make (and even longer to watch). Not only is that movie
``balderdash,'' in Carson's view, but ``Coppola the movie poet'' is
the true essence of the filmmaker, not ``Coppola the ersatz idea
man.'' Seen in that light, Carson contends, such post-``Godfather''
films as ``One From the Heart,'' ``Gardens of Stone,'' and ``Bram
Stoker's Dracula'' have been undervalued by critics and the public
alike.
</P>
<P>
   One Coppola film that few would defend is 1990's ``The
Godfather, Part III,'' and even fewer would defend his decision to
cast his 18-year-old daughter, Sofia, as Mary Corleone. The
invective on her young head by the critics was the sort from which
many careers don't recover.
</P>
<P>
   But Sofia Coppola has resurfaced on the other side of the
camera, making her debut as a director with ``The Virgin
Suicides.'' In Premiere, she describes how dear old dad showed up
on the set one day. ``He would say `You should really say `Action!'
louder. Use your diaphragm.' And I was like, `Are you kidding? Just
go sit down!' ''

THE WILDERNESS REWARDS RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   . . . And a little child shall lead them.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the child to follow is Ryan Lanagan, a fourth grader
who survived a frigid night in the White Mountain National Forest
by striking just the right balance between confidence and caution.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering too late that he had wandered off a trail at the
Waterville Valley ski resort, Ryan took off his skiis and tried to
retrace his path up the mountain. Slowed by the deep snow and
alarmed by the gathering darkness, he remembered what his big
brother had learned in a wilderness survival course. He piled the
snow around him, as insulation from the cold and protection from
the wind, and settled down to sleep to conserve his energy. A
National Guard helicopter spotted the waving arms of his bright red
parka the next morning and rescuers carried him safely down the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Ryan's feat so noteworthy, besides its happy ending,
is the absence among so many adults of the kind of common sense
this 10-year-old displayed in the New Hampshire woods.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that a wrong turn stranded Ryan Lanagan on Mount
Tecumseh, a bad decision killed David McPhedran on Mount
Washington. The 42-year-old teacher and soccer coach from Kents
Hill, Maine, would be alive if he had exercised the same humility
in the face of natural danger as did the boy from Mattapoisett.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem like a harsh judgment to make of a man as
beloved by his students and as respected by his peers as McPhedran
so clearly was at the Maranacook Community School in Readfield,
Maine, where he taught for 13 years. But the death of this weekend
adventurer (and the lucky survival of two climbers who were swept
300 feet down Crawford Notch only days before) is a caution for
those among us who would treat the mountains of New England as
benign parkland, instead of the wilderness areas they are.
</P>
<P>
   McPhedran was an experienced outdoorsman. He carried his own
avalanche shovel to test the stability of the snow before he and
his teaching colleague, Aimee Reiter, toted their skiis up the
aptly named Gulf of Slides on the north face of Mount Washington.
What, one wonders, could his shovel have told him that the
Appalachian Mountain Club warnings posted on the trails and
recorded on its hotline could not?
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural and human-triggered avalanches are likely,'' the
recording said on Sunday morning. ``Travel in avalanche terrain is
not recommended. The wind will be the driving force behind the
inevitable avalanche cycle we know is coming.'' What about any of
that sounds ambiguous?
</P>
<P>
   McPhedran did not encounter unforeseen conditions. He and his
companion triggered the avalanche that killed him, and nearly
buried her in a snowy grave. A man of his experience _ he often
skiied the snowfields and steep gullies of Mount Washington _ had
to know that high winds and a foot of fresh snow on top of a frozen
slab of packed snow and ice were a prescription for avalanche on
New England's highest mountain.
</P>
<P>
   He would not seem to have been the kind of man the New Hampshire
Fish and Game Department had in mind a few months ago when it
announced its intention to charge reckless, cell phone-toting
adventurers for the cost of rescuing them from their own folly.
But, one has to ask, what combination of invulnerability and
arrogance lets someone take the kind of risk he took on a mountain
that has claimed 124 lives in the last century and a half, on an
avalanche-prone gully that claimed two Massachusetts skiiers only
four years ago?
</P>
<P>
   We live in an era of extreme sports, adventure vacations, and
weekend warriors. David McPhedran was part of a generation, wealthy
and healthy enough to defy middle age, to ski in wild, beautiful,
quiet places unsullied by lift tickets and hot-dogging
snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   No one would suggest that we should not seek those special
places, that we should shrink from challenging the mountains or
ourselves. If only David McPhedran _ teacher, soccer coach, mentor
to children _ had packed his caution along with his confidence last
weekend, he might have been around to cheer with us the rescue of
young boy who went skiiing last weekend armed with both.

   LONDON _ To many, Cary Grant was the embodiment of the British
male. Even with that accent, he always betrayed a roughness beneath
his suavity. It's hard to imagine him _ or the likes of Agent 007 _
living at home with mum.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that's what Britain has become: a nation of
Mummy's Boys.
</P>
<P>
   A new Social Trends report, compiled by Britain's Office of
National Statistics, reveals that one in three British men between
the ages of 20 and 35 still live at home with their parents. And
more than half of those between the ages of 20 and 24 do so.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, not even one-fourth of all British males aged
20 to 35 still enjoyed the cushy life at their parent's place.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 15 percent
of American men aged 25 to 34 still live at home, while 59 percent
of men aged 18 to 24 do so.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers here blame the British phenomenon on a number of
factors.
</P>
<P>
   For one, British adults are waiting longer to tie the knot: Over
the last 10 years, the average age at which men get married has
climbed from 26 to nearly 30; for women it has gone from 24 to
nearly 27.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, a growing number of British adults are forced
to remain at home, having been made economic refugees by low-paying
entry-level jobs and the skyrocketing costs of housing.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a house in London, for example, now tops
$244,000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though, the trend doesn't seem to extend to females here.
According to the study, twice as many men as women stayed at home.
Only one in six women are still with their parents by the time they
reach 35.
</P>
<P>
   This begs the question: Is something beyond financial
constraints tying men to the parental hearth?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it appears to be mummy herself.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Heffernan, for example, admits he's a mummy's boy, but
he's far from ashamed. What's more, the 27-year-old part-time
telemarketer has no immediate plans to leave his parent's spacious
home in suburban London.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Mummy) gets me up in the morning, she makes all my dinners,
she runs the bath, makes my bed usually, irons all my clothes,
washes my clothes,'' he said. ``She loves it. It wouldn't be the
same if I wasn't here. She wouldn't know what to do with herself.''
</P>
<P>
   The only downside? Keeping girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be difficult if you go out to a club and meet girls.
I've brought a couple of girls back before and had to kick them out
early in the morning, and usually it doesn't go over too well,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Heffernan does hope to save money while at home so that _
eventually _ he can buy his own house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I move out at 35, I've hopefully got 40 years left to
live on my own,'' he reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   In general, researchers say that girls usually enjoy less
freedom than boys while living at home, and so are more anxious to
fly the coop, even if they aren't ready to marry. Two-thirds of
women rent before buying, but only one-third of men do.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, these researchers say women mature at a faster
pace than young men. Many women in their twenties are at their best
and already can be startlingly self-confident. Men, though, may not
really begin to grow up until they reach about 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young women in Britain are becoming more financially
independent, and just more independent in general,'' said Carol
Summerfield, a co-editor of the Social Trends report. ``And young
women are the ones who are more likely to move out of their old
homes and in with an older partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists are also keen to point out that there's less
pressure on British males these days to be macho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, the heroes of the day were Clint Eastwood
and (Sean Connery's) James Bond, who would never have been seen
running home to mum for a cup of tea,'' said Dr. Mick Cooper, a
psychologist at Brighton University. ``Now there is no shame
attached to being at home.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the prospect of a child living their adult years in
the comfort of their old home makes some parents shudder with fear.
But many are overjoyed at the thought of keeping their offspring at
Chez Mum and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kenny, a columnist for The Daily Telegraph, said this
return to the nest should be viewed as a positive signal of the end
of the generation wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in their twenties and thirties now get along a lot
better with people in their forties, fifties and sixties,'' said
Kenny, whose own sons, in their twenties, still live at home.
</P>
<P>
   She said it's wonderfully useful to have her sons around to do
things like deconstruct ``The Simpsons'' or help research something
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Sue Arnold, mother of three young boys, said
she can't imagine her sons living with her at 30.
</P>
<P>
   She said there should be a distinct winding down of comforts in
all homes _ no more ironing, no more sticky toffee pudding and,
above all else, regular rent payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should flush the little darlings out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, of course, isn't the only country to have witnessed a
rise in the number of adults remaining in their parent's homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the number of adults still living with parents has
grown considerably over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   And, in some countries, it has always been considered normal for
men to stay at home. In Italy, nearly half of all men live at home
until they marry. But this is a place in which men who do not live
at home generally call their mothers, on average, three times a
week, married or not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may be some time before such an arrangement becomes
socially acceptable in the United States, where living at home is
often synonymous with wimpishness.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider last year's hit by the Atlanta-based female
singing trio TLC, which even coined a new term for unsuitable
suitors who still live at home with their mothers _ scrubs.

ARE YOU BUYING ALTERED FOODS? 
</HEADLINE>
 -BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're standing in the cereal aisle at the grocery. Your
5-year-old is whining as he reaches for his favorite brand. The
older two kids are racing around the far corner, threatening to
topple two elderly shoppers. There's a message blaring over the
loudspeaker. No wonder your mind is a scramble as you try to
remember the important thoughts you had before leaving for the
store.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, genetically modified foods: Should you and your family
be eating them? What are they? Where are they? How in the heck will
you know? Suddenly the bright colors and stacked boxes look
ominous.
</P>
<P>
   The debate about genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, is
swirling around consumers these days, but the particulars for most
of us are fuzzy. We hear or read that Europeans are refusing to buy
any GM products _ ones that have been genetically modified _ and
that a trade war threatens. We hear that a third of the American
corn crop is now genetically modified, along with half the soy
crop. We hear that there is no evidence of damage from genetic
modification, and industry spokesmen say that such science is a
boon to mankind. And we hear from the Union of Concerned Scientists
and others that these products have been released without labeling,
without proper research, without enough oversight by the Food and
Drug Administration or the public. Maybe we think this is a lot of
fuss about a few ears of corn.
</P>
<P>
   And then the industry's rationale comes out: Europeans care more
about their food supply than Americans. Most American consumers
never raise questions about genetic modification.
</P>
<P>
   We see red. It's definitely time to think about the subject.
It's confusing, many-sided, and without definite resolution right
now _ but important.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups are trying to push the issue to the forefront and to
increase public awareness. On Feb. 12, Radcliffe Seminars and
Oldways Preservation &AMP; Exchange Trust held a daylong seminar that
explored genetically modified foods from several angles before
about 110 participants.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Frank, managing partner of a Washington law firm that
represents Monsanto, defended the industry's position that
genetically modified seeds _ generally with the DNA altered to
include a pesticide or resistance to a herbicide _ produce plants
that are no different from non-modified seeds. That was essentially
the view taken by the Food and Drug Administration in the early
'90s, when it allowed the biotechnology industry to test on a
voluntary basis and to go forward unless damage was shown. Frank
pointed out that biotechnology in the field of medicine is often
perceived as good, but in food is sometimes met with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Krimsky, professor of urban and environmental policy at
Tufts University and author of several books on biotechnology and
genetics, calls the US regulatory stance ``Show us the dead
bodies.'' He argues for more study on the human health factors and
on potential risks, and urges that all of this be done in public
and that the industry's studies be replicated by independent
bodies. ``We all have the fundamental right to be the first user,
the last user, or a nonuser,'' Krimsky says, echoing what is
disturbing to many: that genetic modification occurred without most
of us knowing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ruth Hubbard, professor emerita of Harvard and author
of ``Exploding the Gene Myth,'' spoke of the complexities of
genetics and the fears of some about long-term effects and the
pressures of the marketplace. ``Man has always affected nature,''
Hubbard said. But now ``we are doing it in an economic and social
context that forces us to fool ourselves, to pretend we know what
we're doing when we have only an inkling.''
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon speakers included several restaurateurs, the
editor of a British food magazine, the founder of a seed mail-order
business who lectures on organic topics, and a nutrition expert.
Despite the view from the industry lawyer, the basic tenor was
skepticism on the lack of labeling and long-term testing and
distrust of both the industry and the government on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   For you in the grocery aisle, here are some talking points:
</P>
<P>
   --What foods are we talking about? Corn and soybeans are the
major crops grown from genetically modified seed. Consumers, even
those who read labels, often have little idea how pervasive corn
and soy are in processed foods. Corn sweeteners are in thousands of
items, from sodas to breakfast cereals to granola bars. Soy is not
only in tofu products such as gardenburgers but also in many other
items, from baby formula to many kinds of cooking oils. Other crops
that may have been grown from genetically modified seeds are cotton
and oilseed rape, from which canola oil is made. So far, wheat seed
has not been genetically modified, although that is under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Although genetically modified fruits and vegetables have been
approved for sale, the expense of using modified seeds makes this
less likely. And a majority of the products made from modified
seeds are not used in food, but instead in such things as paint and
animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   --How can we tell if a product we're buying contains genetic
modification? We can't, unless the product is labeled, and usually
that is done only to certify that it does not contain genetically
modified elements.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy right now is particularly fierce about the
labeling question. Bread &AMP; Circus director of purchasing Tim Sperry
says: ``Our position is that all products made from foods derived
from GMOs should be labeled. The consumer has a right to know.''
Bread &AMP; Circus is moving toward making sure none of its house
brands _ the 365 label _ contain GMOs, but Sperry says there is no
way now to know whether genetically modified seeds were used in
other products at Bread &AMP; Circus, unless they are organic. Organic
food producers do not use GM products.
</P>
<P>
   The Grocery Manufacturers of America, a trade group for the
consumer product industry, supports labeling for nutritional
composition and allergens, says Brian Sansoni, senior manager for
public policy communications, from his office in Washington, but is
opposed to mandatory labeling. Voluntary labeling and getting more
information to the public in general, Sansoni says, is a good
thing. His group believes manufacturers will want to highlight
biotech advances, such as adding nutrients to foods through
modification, in the future and promote them through labeling.
</P>
<P>
   But he insists: ``This is not an issue that is up front and
center with the American consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperry, speaking of Whole Foods, Bread &AMP; Circus's parent
company, and its advocacy of more public forums and information on
genetic modification, thinks ``GMOs are going to become much more
of an issue in the next 12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   --What's happening now in the controversy? Propelled partly by
the British and European refusal to buy genetically modified foods
and some American consumer concerns, a few manufacturers such as
Frito-Lay and Gerber Products have moved either to ask their crop
suppliers not to use GM seed or to set a deadline for removing
genetically modified ingredients from their products. Such
agricultural giants as Archer-Daniels-Midland and Cargill,
according to the Bread &AMP; Circus spokesman, are beginning to
separate out genetically modified products.
</P>
<P>
   And although the FDA's position still is that genetically
modified crops are no different from other crops, the United States
recently signed an international trade agreement agreeing to
specific regulations for genetically altered foods. The Union of
Concerned Scientists, Marion Burros of The New York Times reported
a few weeks ago, sees that as acknowledging that the foods are
different and says it may point to more regulation and labeling in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Rissler, staff scientist at the Union of Concerned
Scientists, sees ``a willingness'' at the Environmental Protection
Agency to strengthen regulations and thinks that the FDA might move
toward making it mandatory that companies present data on
genetically modified seeds and products. US Representative Dennis
Kucinich (D-Ohio) has called for GM labeling and is seeking
sponsors for a bill on the subject. And last year Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickmann announced that his agency would review the
FDA regulatory process. Things are ``definitely bubbling'' about
the issue, Rissler says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even the seed companies are agreeing that more
information is necessary. Frank, the lawyer who represents Monsanto
and spoke at the Radcliffe seminar, says that the industry erred in
not having a ``consumer buy-in'' when genetically modified foods
were first introduced. He sees the need for more consumer education
and for more testing. Labeling, though, he argues, is an issue used
for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Another player in genetic modification, E. I. du Pont de Nemours
&AMP; Co., also advocates more information. Susan Gaffney, a DuPont
spokesperson, quotes DuPont's chief executive officer, Charles O.
Holliday Jr., as saying: ``DuPont will advocate informed consumer
choice.'' She added that DuPont sees labeling as one way to inform
consumers but not necessarily the only way.
</P>
<P>
   --What can you do? If you want to avoid genetically modified
foods, buy only organic products and stay away from processed
foods. Reading labels will tell you whether corn or soy has been
used in a product, but won't indicate whether the ingredient was
from GM seeds.

DID GORE, BRADLEY SHOW THEIR COLOR ON THE IMUS SHOW? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been much too easy for Bill Bradley to fake to his left
and for Al Gore to fake the funk, with George W. Bush and John
McCain impaling themselves on Confederate flagpoles and Bush
plunging the spear even deeper into himself by speaking at a
university that bans interracial dating, gay and lesbian alumni,
and has a history of anti-Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   The double suicide of Bush and McCain has been so spectacular
that the winner of the Republican primaries will be on the death
row of race, stained by the appeal to voters whose taste in heroes
runs more to Bull Connor, George Wallace, and Robert E. Lee than
Harriet Tubman and Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The suicide came so early that for weeks already, Bradley and
Gore have hammered Bush and McCain with righteous indignation.
Bradley said: ``That flag shows the true colors of the Republicans
who want to be president. Both George Bush and John McCain have
embraced the narrow political expediency of the Republican Party.
It's an expediency that ignores a hateful and shameful past in an
effort to bottom-fish for votes from the most right-wing element of
the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, ``Neither of the two Republican candidates had the
guts to take on the bigotry and call for the Confederate flag to be
removed from the state capitol dome. . . . Why in the world would
John McCain and George W. Bush be so scared?''
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to ask Bradley and Gore why they lack the guts
to stop supporting bigotry themselves. During the primaries,
Bradley and Gore have appeared on the Don Imus radio show. Imus is
one of the men who gave us the depraved format of shock talk.
Bradley has appeared on Imus regularly for years since his days in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Imus may be past his peak in popularity, but his show is on 92
stations and still reaches enough white males to be a potent magnet
for politicians. The magnet is so strong they forget that
throughout the 1990s, Imus became known for racist humor and
creating an atmosphere where guests felt comfortable to test drive
their meaner spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Imus and former US senator Alfonse D'Amato mocked Lance Ito, the
judge in the O.J. Simpson trial, with a fake Asian accent even
though Ito himself spoke perfect English. Imus and Donald Trump
have mocked American Indian customs. The show had obscene songs
about Hillary Rodham Clinton going to ``state dinners with her
lesbian friends.'' Senator John Kerry once joked on Imus about
former governor William Weld, ``this guy takes more vacations than
the people on welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Imus said of an African-American New York Times White House
reporter: ``Isn't the Times wonderful? It lets the cleaning lady
cover the White House.'' Imus called a top Washington Post media
critic a ``boner-nosed, beanie-wearing Jew boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several African-American women, such as Oprah Winfrey, Aretha
Franklin, and Serena and Venus Williams, have been denigrated as
whores for their body dimensions. A Mexican tennis player was
called a ``little dishwasher,'' the friendship between entertainer
Whoopi Goldberg and Ted Danson was declared a case of ``jungle
retardation,'' and black people from the Knicks to diseased
Africans are joked about as gorillas and monkey eaters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 on CBS's ``60 Minutes,'' Mike Wallace asked Imus if the
specific purpose of sidekick Bernard McGuirk was to do ``nigger
jokes.'' When Imus denied using the word, his own producer, Tom
Addison, said, ``I recall you using that word.''
</P>
<P>
   Imus said, ``Oh, OK. Well, then I used that word. . . . I don't
apologize for _ for offending people, you know? And I know it's not
politically, not politically correct, and I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has so far ignored this bigotry, joking in January on
Imus that he was working hard ``to live up to your expectations.''
Gore, after talking to Imus about feminist adviser Naomi Wolf,
said, ``Incidentally Don, I need an adviser to tell me how to
communicate to old men, and I was wondering if you might have some
free time.''
</P>
<P>
   So who is bottom fishing now, bantering with a man who scripts
in ``nigger jokes?'' What are the true colors of candidates who
show black folks the good foot at the Apollo, then cut it up with
white folks who kick black people in the spine with stereotypes and
slurs?
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain may already be on the death row of race, but we
do not yet know the true colors of Bradley and Gore. A fungus left
unattended will turn a good foot into one of undesirable funk.
Without a direct challenge to Imus or a refusal to go on his show,
Bradley and Gore will go from men who are agile, swift, and in tune
on race to fakes who found their own way to impale themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans the sharp stake was a flagpole. For the
Democrats, unless they show some guts, it might be a microphone.

A JOURNEY DOWN THE STYX WITH PLAYWRIGHT TOM STOPPARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Tom Stoppard, the ingeniously witty English
playwright, was asked where he got the ideas for his plays, he
replied, ``If I knew, I'd go there.''
</P>
<P>
   He always gets there, and the journey is worthwhile. His latest
itinerary includes the River Styx, the mythical passage of the
afterlife where the poet and scholar A. E. Housman has arrived.
``The Invention of Love'' also plys the River Cherwell, where
Housman studied at Oxford University and where he theorized about
how Latin poets invented love. A subplot involves the
poet-scholar's lifelong, unrequited yearning for a fellow student,
Moses Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plot does not promise to pack the house the way
chandelier-crashing musicals do. But the 1,025 seats in the
handsomely restored Geary Theater here were filled for a six-week
run before the play moved on to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The university classics departments at Stanford and Berkeley may
be big, but Stoppard aims to corral more than the donnish. I'm not
much for ``literature,'' Stoppard said while he was here,
pronouncing the word slowly and disdainfully. More cheerily, he
added, ``I like the theater.'' Shakespeare had the same view,
preferring his works to be performed, not read in dusty libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Stoppard is not Shakespeare, but he is more than what some
critics charge, a mere master of one-liners. He is as
thought-provoking as George Bernard Shaw or Oscar Wilde. Theaters
revive his plays often because their wit and clarity appeal to
different generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a play works out, you don't feel clever, you feel
lucky,'' the 62-year-old playwright said. Luckily for Stoppard, his
favorite stateside stage is the American Conservatory Theater.
Director Carey Perloff, a former Oxonian classics student herself,
directed his latest story with a lively pace that matches
Stoppard's wit. To play the elder Housman, Perloff recruited the
film actor James Cromwell, who played a pig farmer in ``Babe'' and
a police captain in ``LA Confidential.'' Customers who don't read
Latin could easily and delightfully absorb the story of Housman's
return to his youth.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of place is always strong in Stoppard. ``Travesties'' is
based on the coincidence that the Dadaist Trista Tzara, the
Leninist Vladimir Lenin, and the Joycean James Joyce all lived in
Zurich in 1919. Housman's first year at Oxford was Oscar Wilde's
last year there, a circumstance that Stoppard seizes upon with
characteristic vigor. ``Velvet knickerbockers!'' Jackson recalls to
Housman about Wilde. ``I knew he wasn't the full shilling!''
</P>
<P>
   The ``gay angle'' in this play means little to the playwright,
he said. Ditto for Housman, who thunders: ``Homosexuals? Who is
responsible for this barbarity?''
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong, asks a colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's half Greek and half Latin!''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew, I'd go there,'' is an intensely Stoppardian answer
because the playwright knows journalistic cliches from being a
reporter in the 1950s. He might have posed such a query while
toiling for the Bristol Evening World. This most erudite of
playwrights quit school at 17 and never attended a university.
</P>
<P>
   He sketches portraits in pomposity of famous Oxford dons like
John Ruskin, Walter Pater, and Benjamin Jowett. But he barbecues
the newspaper editors of the Victorian era, philistines who hounded
Wilde into jail. ``It shakes one's faith in the operation of a
moral universe by journalism,'' proclaims Henry Labouchere. ``We
journalists have a divine mission to be the tribunes of the
people,'' agrees W. T. Stead.
</P>
<P>
   Stoppard, born in Czechoslovakia, got his early schooling in
India, as did Rudyard Kipling, who asked a Stoppardian question,
``What should they know of England who only England know?''
Stoppard's appeal has been universal since 1967, when he wrote
``Rosencranz and Guildenstern Are Dead.'' His wit and energy banish
what his Housman calls ``the Stygian gloom one heard has so much
about.''

BRADLEY'S NIGHT AT THE APOLLO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL BRADLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Bill Bradley, the problem is promises versus
performance: his promises that he'll do better for blacks, for
liberals, for uninsured kids and oldsters choosing between a Happy
Meal and their medicine, and Al Gore's performance in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic debate Monday night at the Apollo Theater was a
vaudeville turn for the old-time politics that left Bradley
wondering just what he has to promise to win the affection of the
crowd. He is one of the most articulate white politicians in recent
memory on the paramount issue of race in America. Bradley belongs
right up there with Jimmy Carter, Jesse Jackson, and, yes, Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The present occupant of the Oval Office is, admitted Bradley
backer Spike Lee in a predebate interview on CNN, probably he
best-liked president among black Americans ``since Abraham
Lincoln.'' And Al is his First Buddy; case close.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of his support among high-profile black celebrities
and athletes, Bradley cannot dent the loyalty blacks feel to
Clinton-Gore, with the emphasis lately on the party of the second
part. All of the weapons Bradley brought with him to this campaign
_ a brainy New Age lingo to beguile the middle class, a solid but
not spectacular record over 18 years in the US Senate, a slightly
superior television affect that fed off the public's supposed
desire for what marketers called ``authenticity,'' and no scandal
on his resume _ have failed to bring down the Gore juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   It is beginning to dawn on those who felt Gore too muddied up by
the Clinton scandals that the old politics, when practiced from a
position of advantage, beats the new politics. And Bradley's
attempt to paint Gore as ``a conservative Democrat'' who voted
progun and antiabortion in his past congressional lifetime, gets
the underdog no traction with black voters.
</P>
<P>
   Some black commentators have referred to Clinton as ``the first
black president,'' and for a considerable number of reasons. When
Bill fell into the sheep dip over Monica, Whitewater, this-a-gate
and that-a-gate, all his friends and associates were dragged into
court and hauled before the stakeout cameras on courthouse steps
from D.C. to Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   And who were some of the people closest to Bill? Vernon Jordan,
his golfing and schmoozing pal, black; Betty Currie, his personal
secretary and closest confidential associate, black; the head of
Bill's Secret Service detail, the man sworn to defend Clinton with
his life, black.
</P>
<P>
   Black America came to know Clinton as a jive-talking,
hand-clapping, sax-tooting, run-around play-around happy camper
who'd done more for black America, starting with the lowest black
unemployment level ever, than any other single individual since LBJ
or JFK or FDR.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is the beneficiary of Clinton's seven-year-long
investment in the political culture of minority America. All those
Cabinet secretaries, undersecretaries, generals and admirals and
whatnots, those judges and commissioners and ambassadors of color,
those contractors winning more of a share of government work, those
beneficiaries of policies and programs to root out discrimination
and expand economic opportunity, that all counts for something.
</P>
<P>
   So Bradley has a big mountain to climb. He can't gainsay the
gains and the record. All he can do is promise more. And even
though Bradley kept raising the ante at the Apollo, promising
really hard he'd try to find a black running mate, promising more
health care, cheaper presciptions, more of the good stuff and and
less of the bad stuff, he couldn't dent the regard and respect
black America holds for Gore as Bill Clinton's kid brother.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley can point to the Spike Lees and the Michael Jordans and
the cast of the NBA as evidence of his bona fides. But Gore can
point to the record. With his hourglass running on empty, facing
probably extinction on March 7 in the Super Tuesday round that will
drain the rest of his cash reserves, Bradley has gone negative.
</P>
<P>
   It worked for George W. Bush, he must have figured; why not give
it a shot? But like a three-pointer launched from half-court in the
waning moments of a game in which he trails badly, Bill looked
desperate. He and Gore traded the sort of swats and sneers that do
nobody credit. Gore's ploy, that ``racial profiling practically
began in New Jersey,'' was a groaner. Bradley's counterpunch, that
Al was doing ``what I call a Gore dance . . . a dance to avoid
facing up to your conservative record on guns,'' was not quite as
lame. By keeping Bradley at bay, not leaving his foe any openings,
Gore prevailed by emerging relatively unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's jibe that Bradley must be the only Democrat who missed
Kenneth Starr brought guffaws from the crowd, which seemed not to
mind the WWF cast of the evening's entertainment. It becomes
clearer every day: there was never the potential for Bradley to
snatch this nomination from the vice president. Every vice
president who's gone for his party nomination has won it in the
modern era. Bradley overestimated his own appeal, he underestimated
Gore's institutional strengths with the superdelegates and an
incumbent president who dotes on Al, and he misread the tenor of
the voters after being bathed in Clinton scandals.
</P>
<P>
   For all his eloquent articulation, for all the undeniable
sincerity of his views about the need to explain to white people
how they've benefited from ``white skin advantage,'' for all of his
lofty goal-setting for universal health insurance and protecting
poor elders, Bradley is ill equipped to wrest this prize. And for
the same reason, ambitious Democrats like Senator John Kerry
decided not to run: It was never there, really, for anyone but
Gore.

OUSTED FOUNDER STILL TRIES TO CRACK RSA SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Breaking up is hard to do.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than three years since we first looked at the
nasty and personal dispute that led to a split between the founder
and the chief executive of what was then called Security Dynamics
Technologies Inc. and today is known as RSA Security Inc., a hot
computer and Internet security company in Bedford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive, Charles Stuckey, stayed and the founder,
Kenneth Weiss, left the company's board in 1996 with some choice
words for his fellow directors on the way out, calling them
``CEO-manipulated, greedy sycophants.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, who owns about $130 million of RSA Security stock, may be
gone but he's not forgotten. Or silent.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Weiss and another large individual RSA Security
shareholder, Addison Fisher, sent a lawyer to the company's annual
meeting to read a scathing two-page letter criticizing management
in the face of what was then a flagging stock value.
</P>
<P>
   ``They question whether or not management has been effective in
attempting to achieve shareholder value, both short term and long
term,'' the lawyer reading from the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The two shareholders, who owned more than 11 percent of RSA
Security at the time, withheld their votes for three proposals
involving stock option plans at the April 1999 annual meeting and
succeeded in having those votes postponed. The propsoals were
approved the following month.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has since staged a remarkable comeback, climbing from
19 1/8 on the day of the last annual meeting to 54 3/4 Tuesday. RSA
Security shares traded as high as 77 1/2 in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a heck of a comeback in terms of the stock price,''
said Arthur Coviello, the company's former chief operating officer
who became CEO last month, when Stuckey stepped aside to run a new,
venture capital subsidiary controlled by RSA Security.
</P>
<P>
   Coviello may be new as RSA Security's chief executive, but he
didn't sound too worried Tuesday about any beefing by the company's
founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy hasn't been around since June of 1996,'' said
Coveillo. He cited RSA's track record since then: The company's
revenues have grown more than fourfold since the last full year
Weiss was actively involved and profits have increased at an even
greater pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, I spend my time worrying about how to grow this
company. We don't spend too much time worrying about Mr. Weiss,''
said Coviello.
</P>
<P>
   But they do continue to spend time fighting with him.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss and RSA Security executives are at it again, this time
arguing behind closed doors for potentially much higher stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Routine company filings confirm that Weiss filed a demand for
arbitration alleging, among other things, that RSA Security
controlled a number of technical patents whose ownership should
revert back to him.
</P>
<P>
   RSA Security executives declined to discuss the arbitration,
other than to repeat their public assertions there is no merit to
the claim, and Weiss said he was unable to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But people familiar with the situation and sympathetic to Weiss
said the dispute involves seven to 10 patents covering different
types of computer security technology.
</P>
<P>
   Those people, former directors Sheldon Wool and Roy Maletz, as
well as patent attorney Larry Oliverio, said Weiss has argued that
control of the patents should revert to him under the terms of his
past employment contract with the company. The Weiss employment
contract called for the release of the patents to him if they were
not being commercially exploited by the company, they said.
</P>
<P>
   (Wool was pushed off the company's board prior to Weiss's
resignation in 1996 and Oliverio was replaced a short time later as
corporate secretary after serving 13 years.)
</P>
<P>
   The patents now in dispute are said to involve several different
types of security-related technology, including methods to compress
and encrypt computer information and biometric identification using
a person's voice.
</P>
<P>
   How much are the patents worth? There are numbers all over the
board, but no one really knows.
</P>
<P>
   RSA Security has said in public documents that the company
believes the case won't have a ``material adverse effect'' on its
financial position.
</P>
<P>
   Oliverio, who was closely involved with the company's early
patent work, suggests the potential for the technology would be
huge in the right commercial hands. Wool suggest the value of the
patents might be in the ``low- to mid-eight figures,'' meaning tens
of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the amount, this much we know: It's enough to keep us
interested.

DAY CARE CATCH-22 DRIVES UP COSTS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bright Horizons, the nationwide day-care chain, came
face-to-face with a national shortage of preschool teachers, it
launched a direct attack. The company:
</P>
<P>
   --Increased its recruiting staff to 25 from 1 and stationed
three recruiters in Massachusetts, where competition for workers of
all kinds is at a record high.
</P>
<P>
   --Raised its $100 referral bonus to $300 in most states _ and to
$500 in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   --Added a raffle with a trip to Cancun as the prize for
enterprising employees who succeed in bringing in eligible
recruits.
</P>
<P>
   --Beefed up pay and benefits and offered tuition reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep an active database of just about everyone we have
talked to, and we are doing telethons and mailings,'' said Eileen
Smith, director of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reaching out to family child-care providers who had
worked in the home, and we're looking at people who teach Sunday
school or coach soccer teams, people who really enjoy working with
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. company, like many others in the industry,
had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight years after one of the first studies on child care
touched on the influx of women into the workplace and called for
more quality day care, the appeals are loud and furious.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an economic Catch-22: Low unemployment rates and a
mini baby boom have led to long waiting lists and higher fees for
parents, as day-care workers, attracted by more options, higher
pay, and better benefits, leave the industry to work in other
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Bright Horizons began feeling the crunch in 1997. But last
summer, with the Bay State's unemployment rate near record lows,
things got even tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Some day-care centers and chains say they are being forced to
raise rates to pay their teachers more and maintain quality. This
tug of war between costs and care has priced some working-poor
parents and middle-class couples right out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Day care director Joyce Hollman, whose Childrens' Center in
Lexington charges $1,192 per month for a full-time toddler, said
the fee permits the center to offer a teacher-to-toddler ratio of 2
to 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of care is very good, but the cost is quite
substantial,'' Hollman acknowledged. Some families receive vouchers
from the state that help pay for day care, and there are federal
subsidies for low- and moderate-income parents, she said. The
center also provides $22,000 a year in scholarships to needy
parents. But even that isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never be able to meet the needs of children and pay
adequate salaries if all the money for child care must come out of
parents' pockets,'' said Hollman. ``And, as the need for care
grows, this situation is going to be even more unworkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollman pays her staffers $10 an hour, better than the national
average of about $8, but not enough to fill a position that has
been vacant for a year. Last week, Hollman offered the job to a
preschool teacher who turned it down; she had received an offer
with an hourly wage that was $2.50 higher.
</P>
<P>
   Smith wouldn't reveal what Bright Horizons pays its teachers,
but she said benefits have been added to sweeten the pot, including
a 50 percent discount on day care for employees with preschoolers
and back-up care at about 90 percent of its centers. Bright
Horizons also encourages staff to attend classes it pays for that
will lead to a ``child development associate'' credential.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose fees and salaries vary from region to region
as well as within states, acknowledged that it pays some
Massachusetts workers more than those in lower-cost states because
of the competition for employees here. Bright Horizons said it
tends to pay higher wages than some competitors because it receives
corporate sponsorship. It has 10,000 workers at about 300 sites
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But therein lies the catch for some parents: The cost of infant
care at Bright Horizons centers in Massachusetts ranges from about
$900 a month in Pittsfield to a high of $1,400 in Cambridge.
Parents of preschoolers pay $700 a month in Pittsfield, $1,200 in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Bright Horizons has instituted an award-winning program in
Boston for the children of homeless parents, called Horizons
Initiative. Both Dorchester and Jamaica plain programs are run as
nonprofits that do not charge homeless parents for child care.
</P>
<P>
   But Bright Horizons is not alone when it comes to the fees
regular customers pay: Many private day care centers now charge, on
average, $1,200 for infant care.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Hnatiuk, director of child care training programs at
Wheelock College, said high fees must be charged because
Massachusetts has some of the most rigorous licensing standards in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are serving young infants,'' she said, ``you may have
no more than seven infants in a group to be a licensed child care
provider in the state. But you must have two teachers. For children
who are 3 to 5, you can have 20 children and two teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you may have more income to pay two to four teachers
during a 10-hour day and it still is not enough. For toddlers, you
must have no more than nine children in a single group, with two
teachers. So the bulk of the money may go to salaries, but even
that is not enough when you have to pay for programming, insurance,
rent, equipment, maintenance, food, and professional development.''
</P>
<P>
   With the percentage of women in the work force expected to reach
60 percent by 2005, maintaining _ and funding _ quality child care
is not going to get easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most working parents, searching for child care is like
running an Olympic race _ every hurdle they leap is followed by
another,'' said Jan Schneiderman, president of the National Council
of Jewish Women.
</P>
<P>
   When Schneiderman's council researched day care, it found
chronic staffing shortages just about everywhere. In Washington,
D.C., for example, poor and middle-class parents wait up to 16
months for slots to open up at private centers. Some parents are
making ``down payments'' to hold a spot before children are even
conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, annual turnover among teachers at private centers
nationwide is a staggering 30 percent, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Low salaries are a big reason: Between 1977 and 1992, salaries
for child-care workers dropped from $10,161 to $9,251, on average.
At the same time, the number of paid employees in the field more
than doubled, to 468,000 from 190,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts in 1992, day-care teachers were making $11,300,
on average. Today, salaries at corporate sponsored centers in
Massachusetts are in the $20,000-plus range, but even that may not
be enough to entice young men and women who could earn twice as
much with a bachelor's degree. Not surprising, single-site centers
and public day-care services pay even less, resulting in even
higher turnover rates and fewer services.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? ``We need a massive public investment in children's
programs by the federal government and the various states, and we
need it soon,'' Hnatiuk said.

 WASHINGTON: ... Delahunt said.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Very few people have land titles,'' said Maria Ines Restrepo
Canon, director of the National Plan for Alternative Development.
``And those who do live in areas where there are no health clinics,
electricity, or schools. We prefer to find alternative development
for them. We don't put them in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt asked the base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jorge
Amor, about cracking down on paramilitary forces, who have a long
record of human rights abuses and of ties with the Colombian
military. ``Will you fight them?''
</P>
<P>
   Amor stiffened. ``If I am ordered to do it, I will do it,'' he
said. When Delahunt asked about the guerrillas, the commander
noticeably relaxed, but then made an observation that chilled
Delahunt:
</P>
<P>
   ``The FARC have borrowed many techniques from the Viet Cong,''
he said. ``They have paths just like the Ho Chi Minh Trail. You
can't find them in the jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt, the color drained from his cheeks, thanked the
commander as his party prepared to leave. Once in the air, the
congressman's large frame slumped against the plane window. The
comparison with Vietnam was deeply troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bottomless pit,'' he said, looking out at a driving
rain. ``We've got to be real careful and real thoughtful here.''
</P>
<P>
   He now had more questions than answers. But two hours later,
back at the Bogota military airport, he revived after a comment by
Ines, the alternative development director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to see how people live in the country,'' she said.
``The only alternative those people have is to grow illicit crops
or join the guerrillas. I don't know if General Trujillo shares my
view.''
</P>
<P>
   The general looked at her. ``Yes,'' he said finally, ``I
agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt's eyes widened. A Colombian general was on his side.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, the son of a children's book librarian and a US
general, is possessed with an air of certainty. ``I'm often
wrong,'' he has said more than once, ``but I'm never in doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   But he had reservations when President Clinton offered him the
job of drug czar more than four years ago. He was commander in
chief of the US Southern Command, then based in Panama, and he
loved the military life. Vietnam shaped him forever as an infantry
commander, leaving him with an indelible sense of duty to his
country and imbued with physical courage. In Vietnam, he was
wounded several times, including once when he almost lost the use
of his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never learned to duck. He gets wounded every time he's
around fire,'' said his father, who advised him to take Clinton's
offer. ``As an honorable man, you obey the commander in chief. I
told him, `You don't have much of a choice. If it comes out badly,
that's life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At about that time, McCaffrey also expressed doubts publicly
about the benefits of antidrug programs in Latin America, noting in
a speech to the Heritage Foundation in Washington that the supply
of drugs on the streets hadn't dropped because of interdiction
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past year, he has not publicly expressed a trace of
doubt about the Colombian plan. He has been at the forefront of the
administration's policy for a military solution to Colombia's drug
nightmare. More than once, he has been too far in front. Last fall,
for instance, he announced support for a billion-dollar-plus
package of antidrug funds before the White House had agreed to it.
That raised expectations in Colombia for a fast deal, and when no
proposal was forthcoming last year, Colombian President Andres
Pastrana suffered political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Little seems to deter McCaffrey, however. He travels constantly.
He works until 1 a.m. on a regular basis, relying on five hours of
sleep a night. His personal staff works nearly as long. And he has
established a comfortable office environment for himself, which is
to say a military culture.
</P>
<P>
   Time is measured on the military clock. Staffers write IPRs, the
interim progress reviews so favored in the service. McCaffrey
thinks of people as being commanders, line guys, or staff guys,
terms with military definitions. He barks orders. He penalizes
those who don't perform to his standards by not talking to them for
a month or more.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he also inspires awe because of his talent for
marshalling so many numbers and facts in his mind and his ability
to captivate audiences with forceful and colorful speeches that lay
out every detail of the complex problems in fighting drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to relish the Colombia fight. ``What I would suggest,''
he said in an interview, his right arm pumping to make the point,
``is these people are three hours flight away from us. There are a
bunch of them. They are important to our economy. They're a
democracy. My purpose is to reduce the drug threat to the American
people. But I would also argue that we would enhance the chance of
peace in doing this Colombia package.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey and other officials dismiss comparisons with Vietnam.
A senior official last month said American personnel would not be
endangered, adding that ``the blood shed will be (that of) the
Colombians.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said it is logical to support the Colombian military
effort. ``I don't believe there is any disagreement among
knowledgeable, serious people that if we are going to defend the
American public from a wave of cocaine and heroin coming out of
Colombia, we better stand with the Colombians on the Andean ridge
in the coming three years,'' he said. ``And we've got to say it
publicly so the peace process is more likely to work than not.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, McCaffrey was to testify on Colombia before a Senate
committee and then leave for a three-day trip to Colombia. He plans
to return to Washington with even more facts to support his case.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt, meanwhile, has been meeting regularly with Democrats
and Republicans to discuss amendments concerning human rights and
more money for alternative crops. He also may have a chance to
question McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met him,'' Delahunt said. ``I presume we'll meet
now.''

 LA GABARRA, COLUMBIA: ... aid plan.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the first challenges for authorities will be to update
the government's outdated estimates for the amount of coca grown
here. Officially, the La Gabarra region contains about 8,000 acres
of coca. Most residents and farmers, however, say the figure is
closer to 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason these programs haven't arrived yet is that La
Gabarra remains a volatile zone in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Marxist guerrillas controlled La Gabarra as if it
were an independent state, dictating who entered and exited the
area, painting Che Guevara graffiti on walls and creating a tax
system that allowed them to collect a portion on all the coca that
was grown and processed on nearby farms.
</P>
<P>
   But paramilitary squads launched a massive surprise attack last
May, pushing the guerrillas they didn't kill deep into the jungle
or up the Catatumbo into Venezuela. Then they killed or evicted
farmers and residents suspected of being guerrilla sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Sister Sofia began collecting bodies, about 50 of
them from that attack. Three months later, the paramilitaries swept
through the town again, looking for guerrilla infiltrators and
killing another 30 residents. They currently are in control of the
La Gabarra region, but the guerrillas still operate in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Because of protests by human rights groups over the August
massacre, the Pastrana government sent in 500 soldiers and a unit
of the National Police. The troops remained until late last month,
leaving behind 80 police officers who patrol La Gabarra's unpaved
streets twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mayor here, no school system, banks, or courts. The
top government official is Marceliano Castiblanco, the 32-year-old
police captain who sometimes performs civil marriages. But his main
concern is looking out for his officers, who have bunkered
themselves in foxholes and behind sandbags outside a storefront
next to Holy Trinity Church, a block from the convent where Sister
Sofia and five other nuns live.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the police presence, paramilitary troops dressed in
civilian clothes walk confidently through the village, the butts of
their 9mm pistols jutting from their baggy jeans. Nearly everyone
knows where they live.
</P>
<P>
   By themselves, the police can do little to stop them, since they
provide the only protection against the guerrillas who lurk nearby,
waiting for their chance to reclaim the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're either waiting for the next guerrilla attack or for the
next (paramilitary) massacre,'' said one officer who requested
anonymity. ``There is tension here all day and all night.''
</P>
<P>
   By seizing La Gabarra, the paramilitaries have also taken
control of the area's lucrative cocaine industry, which centers
around an outdoor market that operates every weekend at a bend in
the Catatumbo.
</P>
<P>
   Canoes filled with large white bags arrive from the local coca
farms. The bags, which contain coca paste, are sold to drug cartel
buyers, who form one long and orderly line.
</P>
<P>
   Before each sale, a spoonful of paste is held over a burner and
melted to check for its purity. Every transaction is recorded in a
spiral notebook and conducted under the watchful eyes of armed
paramilitary troops, who take a percentage from each sale.
</P>
<P>
   This type of tax system was begun by the FARC to help fund its
operations and has been duplicated by nearly every rebel group.
Experts say these taxes now account for up to 50 percent of all
guerrilla and paramilitary funds and offer strong proof that
Colombia's civil war and its war on drugs have become one and the
same.
</P>
<P>
   The system also shows how the country's narcotrafficking
industry has evolved over the last two decades. When the government
first began its joint eradication operations with the United States
in the early 1980s, marijuana was the main target. But in the
mid-1980s, as American forces were successfully eliminating coca
crops in Peru and Bolivia, the plants were brought to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   That gave rise to the notorious cartels like those in Cali and
Medellin, and to drug lords like Pablo Escobar, who were known for
their violence, kidnappings, and cold-blooded efficiency with which
they ran their operations.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, authorities dismantled the cartels, culminating with
Escobar's death in a gun battle with police at one of his hideouts
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But in breaking up the cartels' vertically-integrated
businesses, the government also opened the way for hundreds of
smaller organizations to step in and take over different pieces of
the drug-trafficking operation. It also allowed insurgent leaders _
many of whom had previously fought against cartels like Escobar's _
to pick up where the drug lords left off.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the middle of his 40-acre coca field outside La
Gabarra, Luis, a 57-year-old farmer, isn't sure who he'd rather
sell to.
</P>
<P>
   When the guerrillas controlled the area, he could count on
getting about $1,500 for each kilo of cocaine paste he sold at
market, even after the rebels collected their tax. It was just
enough to pay his 60 farm workers and to feed his family of six.
Now, under the paramilitary system, he gets roughly $900.
</P>
<P>
   But even worse, Luis said, is the anxiety that fills their lives
_ fear that the paramilitaries will order them off their land or
raise the tax, fear that guerrillas will return and take revenge on
him for paying the paramilitaries. And the new fear: that
fumigation and rapid intervention by US-trained forces will
dramatically escalate the violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sister Sofia, Luis is doing something he'd rather not do.
For a moment, it's enough to make him reconsider coca farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that growing coca is bad and it causes problems not
just here but all around the world,'' said Luis, a former
carpenter. ``I'd much rather grow fruit. But if I can't make money,
then we die. And I'd rather die producing something than die
starving.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Sofia's mother has been so worried about the danger
around her daughter that she once called the mother superior,
begging that Sister Sofia be reassigned to a safer place. The
daughter refused.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, she will be reassigned, perhaps to a quiet girls
school like the one in Bogota where she used to teach. Maybe then,
after three years in La Gabarra, she can start to heal, can start
to forget the endless war that drugs have brought to this remote
village.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this has had an effect on me psychologically and
spiritually,'' she said while walking along the dirt road from the
cemetery back to the town square. ``I've had to deal with a lot and
it's taken some enthusiasm out of me. But I know it's the same for
everyone else who lives here.''

   Few people hoping for good news from Africa would have expected

Zimbabwe should have delivered such an eye-catching lesson in
democracy as the one it gave this week. It has shown that Africans,
like other people, relish the power of the ballot box, and that
brave dissidents, energetic civic groups and networks of
discontented individuals can sometimes win, even in the face of
harassment, bribery of the voters, media manipulation and misuse of
all the apparatus of government. &QL;

   &UR; AMERICA, DON'T HIDE FROM THE PAINFUL TRUTH OF NO GUN RI &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It happened almost half a century ago, in a war that most
Americans barely recall. The story came to light in September, when
the Associated Press ran a starkly detailed account of American
soldiers who said they had gunned down perhaps hundreds of South
Korean civilians in three days in July 1950. Although it is
agonizing to think of U.S. soldiers committing war atrocities,
America must clear the air _ and its conscience _ over No Gun Ri.
The last time America took a serious look at a war crime of its own
_ the infamous My Lai Massacre in 1968 _ it botched the job. &QL;

   Bob Dole recently told a TV audience that the reason he had a
Band-Aid on his thumb was that he had pricked himself in his rush
to replace his Bush button with a McCain one. ``You couldn't find a
McCain button on anybody yesterday,'' he drolly noted, ``but today
they're all over the place.'' Well, not quite all over the place.
There are precious few McCain badges on the lapels of Dole's old
cronies at the heart of the Republican establishment. Why? Because
McCain represents a gigantic threat to the way it does business. &QL;

   Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are

   Are Islam and democracy compatible? Iran's parliamentary
election this Friday will not provide a definitive answer, but it
may provide some hints. Alas, the Islamic world is not burdened
with examples of good government, let alone democracy. But religion
is seldom the culprit. &QL;

churlish not to applaud and say, ``Well done, Wolfgang Schauble. By
falling on your sword, you have done the noble thing and now we can
all put this behind us and move on.'' Yet the words do not come
easily. A feeling persists that this is the wrong leader, resigning
for the wrong reasons, and that it is too soon to bring down the
curtain on the German Christian Democrats' financial scandals. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN _ The overwhelming victory of President Mohamed Khatami's
supporters in the new Iranian parliament is already being portrayed
by the United States as a ``hopeful sign for the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington claims it is on the side of Khatami's democratic
``reformists.'' But the new Iran emerging from last week's poll is
likely to diminish rather than increase American influence in the
region as its traditional allies in the Middle East lose their fear
of Tehran's Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
   With Iraq still under almost daily bombardment by American and
British aircraft and President Saddam Hussein supposedly
``neutralized,'' Western diplomats and arms salesmen have regularly
used the Iranian ``threat'' to justify the continuing presence of
United States troops in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Gulf
emirates _ as well as the purchase by Gulf states of billions of
dollars' worth of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But if Iranian democracy now becomes a reality, these arguments
are going to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Iranian parliamentary election was primarily
domestic in content _ about free speech, the lifting of personal
restrictions and freedom of information _ President Khatami has
consistently argued that peace in the Gulf must be decided by the
Arabs and Iranians who live there, not by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview he gave shortly before his own landslide
presidential election, Mohamed Khatami said that the peoples of the
Gulf must ``join hands'' to ensure peace and security in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe,'' he insisted, ``that strangers, with their
military forces, must leave the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arabs have been quick to understand the seismic shift which
the victory of the Khatamists in Iran represents. Only last
weekend, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia formally invited Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, to pay a state visit to
Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
   And with almost all European nations now maintaining good
relations with Tehran _ Britain reopened its embassy there last May
_ Iran's isolation in the region is fast turning into America's
isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Dutch Shell and the French oil group Total have each
concluded $800 million contracts with Iran since 1995, but the
United States allows American oil companies to invest only a
maximum of $20 million in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran's major hotels are now packed with European and Asian
businessmen, but there are precious few American accents to be
heard in the corridors of the Iranian oil ministry.
</P>
<P>
   True, Syria _ traditionally Iran's only ally in the Arab world _
is intensely concerned by the implications of the elections.
President Hafez Assad was one of the first foreign visitors to
arrive in Tehran after Khatami's presidential victory, and Damascus
may well send a senior delegation again in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Iran funds much of the Hezbollah guerrilla movement which is
fighting Israeli occupation troops in the south of Lebanon, and
Hezbollah officials are themselves asking what the future holds for
their movement if the new Tehran parliament allows President
Khatami a free hand in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has hitherto represented itself as the West's channel of
communication to Iran _ this was the basis of Syria's involvement
in the release of western hostages _ but what will be its role now
that Iran is itself being invited to talk directly to its old
enemies?
</P>
<P>
   A group of Hezbollah members were discussing this very issue at
Tehran airport last week as they waited for the arrival of
colleagues from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   If America holds out the prospect of a new relationship with
Iran, offering to unfreeze Iranian assets in return for an end to
the Islamic Republic's support for the Hezbollah, they were asking
themselves, would the guerrilla battle in southern Lebanon come to
an end?
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly what the Israelis are hoping, although Syria
will be in no mood to oblige. Without Israel's continued bleeding
in Lebanon, Damascus feels that Israel will be under no pressure to
withdraw from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah's existence thus underpins Syria's demand for an
Israeli retreat _ but the victory of Iran's reformists could yet
undermine the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   However, President Khatami has always expressed his support for
the guerrillas' struggle in southern Lebanon, and recently held
warm talks with Seyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah chairman,
promising Iran's continued assistance to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   With the danger of a radical Iran removed from their frontiers,
the Gulf Arabs are also likely to ask why they should repay
Washington for its military ``protection'' by supporting a
``peace'' process that gives ever greater rewards to the Israelis
at the expense of the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one dark suspicion that haunts both Arabs and
Iranians, and it is founded on the conviction that the United
States and Israel _ despite all their publicly-expressed enthusiasm
for democracy _ will find that a truly democratic Iran has no place
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran, they have been recalling once again the era of
Mohamed Mossadeq, freely elected but swiftly overthrown in 1953 by
a coup d'etat funded by the CIA and British intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, U.S. President Bill Clinton was demanding
democracy in Iraq so that its people would be ``democratically
represented'' _ a phenomenon that does not exist in any other Arab
state, saving perhaps Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   If America really supports democracy in Iran, why not in Saudi
Arabia? Does it really want free speech in Tehran and a parliament
which will be free to reject the policies which America wishes it
to adopt?
</P>
<P>
   What if Khatami persists in giving his support to the guerrillas
who are trying to drive Israeli occupiers from their land? Will
this be the sort of democracy that will be left to thrive in the
new Iranian dawn?
</P>
<P>
   This thoughtful, intelligent president, whom so many Iranians
admire, has spoken of peace many times. And of dialogue. And of
respect.
</P>
<P>
   But he had better keep his security men on their toes. &QL;

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN _ It was an unlikely setting for the liberalization of
Iran. The Participation Front offices were stuffy, the street
outside a canyon of hot Tehran traffic, the speakers sometimes
shouting to be heard above the murmur of journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But Reza Khatami _ booming voiced, grey-bearded, flabbier in the
face than his presidential brother _ Tuesday was talking history.
</P>
<P>
   The law forbidding satellite dishes had to be changed,
journalists must be protected and would no longer be convicted by
religious courts, the recent murder of intellectuals must be
investigated, there must be no more intrusion into the personal
life of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   It was heady stuff. But there, apparently, were the figures to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Parliamentary results to date, according to Khatami, showed that
the ``reformist'' movement had won 137 of the 191 declared
``Majlis'' seats _ of which his own Participation Front, loyal to
President Mohamed Khatami, had picked up 109.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives had only 39 seats so far, independents 15.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hojatolislam Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former
president, former speaker of parliament _ and we shall leave aside
for now Rafsanjani's personal wealth _ Khatami ``didn't much need''
him as the next parliamentary speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani, it turned out, came a miserable 29th in the list of
Tehran candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, a British-trained urologist whose searching eyes bear
an uncanny resemblance to those of his brother, smiled little and
spoke much but sounded like the president himself when he insisted
that at the top of his party program lay human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of writers over the past 12 months and the
authorities' invasion of the Tehran university campus last year
would be pursued, he announced.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these are early days. Khatami, who will be leading
the largest party in parliament _ he may yet have 115 seats or more
_ agreed that differing factions might disagree within the
reformist umbrella. And parliament doesn't have the power to change
the Iranian constitution _ only to ensure that it is correctly
obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 6th Parliament (elected in Iran) cannot do everything the
people want,'' Khatami said. ``We will try to answer some of the
people's demands.``
</P>
<P>
   Yet he was quite specific when it came to personal freedoms -
and the intrusion of religious authorities into the lives of Iran's
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``In personal, everyday life, we are going to stop this
insulting of people and we're going to have a Social Improvement
(privacy) Law in the parliament to protect the personal life of the
people. We're going to have a Political Improvement Law so that
people can have rights like public meetings and demonstrations.''
</P>
<P>
   The clergy's special court _ which even placed Ayatollah Hossein
Ali Montazeri under house arrest in Qom and silenced his voice
until The Independent reached him on Sunday _ would no longer be
permitted to convict journalists. ``This court has to work
according to constitutional law,'' Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
   But the West _ which has been happy-clapping every new victory
by Khatami's party and supporters _ should perhaps study his last
words before assuming that Iran is about to become another client
nation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Of Hezbollah's battle against Israeli occupation troops in
southern Lebanon _ the guerrillas are given military and financial
assistance by Iran _ Khatami said that ``we are defending the right
of people whose land has been occupied _ and America is defending
the people who occupied this land.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Gulf, it was for Iran and its Arab neighbors to guard
its security. In other words _ and Khatami was perhaps too discreet
to say so _ it's time for the Americans to leave. &QL;

   ``I'm tired of using drugs. I want to go into treatment. I tried
calling all day yesterday and I couldn't get through.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald made several calls and found a place for him in a
detox center. The two made arrangements for her to drive him there
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``How bad do you want to get clean?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do, I do, Brianne.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You better be here,'' she said. ``I'm counting on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hours after she left was when Jorge's friend appeared
with his gift of heroin. Jorge, 37, who asked to be identified only
by his first name, injected half of the heroin into his veins that
afternoon. ``I need some tough, tough love,'' he said, lighting up
a half-smoked Newport 100s cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   He used the last bit of heroin at 7:30 the next morning, an hour
before Fitzgerald arrived. ``When you're sick and going into detox,
you need something for the day you go,'' he said in her car,
explaining why he got high. ``Because you get really cranky and
frustrated if you don't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped to stay in treatment for at least several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is you need longer treatment,'' Fitzgerald told
him.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge said he wasn't sure he could do that. He said he needed to
help support his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't start to set up roadblocks, Jorge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They hugged each other goodbye at the center. ``I pray to God
I'll do good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald turned reflective as she drove away. ``I don't
envision myself doing this forever. I need a backup plan,'' she
said. ``We all need a backup plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of her frustrations were related to her patients; Amaral,
for instance, was calling her daily in despair. And, more
importantly, she has seen them time and again relapse into their
addictions, even when all signs pointed toward recovery. This is
her never-ending war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But the national priorities in the drug war also have had an
impact on her, especially with the emphasis on locking up addicts.
Nearly 1.6 million drug addicts were arrested nationwide in 1997
for a variety of crimes. That is up from 1 million in 1991. At the
same time, only 37 percent of hard-core addicts received treatment
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money we are spending fighting this war on drugs is a
joke. It's a bottomless pit,'' she said. ``I liken it to the
Vietnam War: We're doing it for years, and the casualties keep on
mounting. We put them in jail. That's how we kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald also believes the Colombian effort won't work.
``People just laugh at it,'' she said. Even if it did result in
driving up prices and reducing supply, she said it wouldn't drive
down the number of hard-core addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the price rose, the crime rate would rise. And somebody
would make a cheaper drug. The answer has to start locally,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her patients have been in and out jail. She saw two in
the course of two days: Lee Boone, 47, of Charlestown, wMass., ho
injected heroin into his groin so frequently that his veins
collapsed and he lost his right leg; and Billy Ketchum, 45, who
used drugs for 30 years, once working as a ``lieutenant'' in a
Colombian drug ring where he could earn $15,000 for four days of
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have shot up a million dollars worth of heroin,'' said
Ketchum, who now lives in a faith-based home for recovering addicts
in Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He closed his eyes and said with feeling: ``I used heroin as my
lover, there was no other. James Brown said he sold his wife for a
$5 bag. Well, I sold my life for a $2 bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone was overjoyed to see Fitzgerald, who in recent years
visited him in an active drug house, a risk that she shudders at
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saint Brianne!'' he exclaimed and motioned for her to sit in
his living room. He has been off heroin for five months, receiving
a daily dose of methadone in a clinic, a substitute addiction but
one that has allowed him to function on a much higher level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got something to show you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boone pulled out his wallet, and as his eyes welled up, he held
up an automatic teller card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I. . .have. . .a. . .bank. . .account,'' he said slowly as two
streams of tears fell from his chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee,'' she said, moving toward him, ``look at you!''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sudden, tender moment of joy. And a fleeting one.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Fitzgerald picked up Iayania Norwood, 23, a recovering
addict who first used crack cocaine with a family member, and the
two of them went to visit another patient, Cassander Johnson, 36.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had been refusing to attend a group therapy session with
other recovering addicts, and Fitzgerald feared she might relapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me very nervous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go. I'm OK. I just get bored,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Norwood challenged her: ``The liquor store's right up
the corner. You're going to go there, aren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right up the corner in fact,'' Johnson said, smiling.
``If I take a drink, I take a drink. I suffer the consequences. So
what?''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald grew angry: ``Last time you took a drink, what
happened? One of these times, Cassander, I'm not going to be there
to pick up the pieces. You're playing with fire. You won't stay
sober.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald put her head in hands. Now her eyes filled with
tears. Johnson wouldn't budge, and Fitzgerald said she would tell
people in Johnson's halfway house about her fears of a relapse.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson yelled at her: ``Why do that? I'm not even going to talk
to you now!''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald and Norwood left. ``This is what I hate about my
job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald needed a break. She went to dinner that night with
her Wellesley girlfriends. ``We were talking about waxing eyebrows,
menopause, all the girlfriend things,'' she said. ``It was nice. I
got an escape, and they live vicariously when I tell them my
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The following week, she learned she was wrong about Cassander
Johnson. She didn't relapse that weekend. Diane Amaral, meanwhile,
finally agreed to go to a hospital, where doctors are monitoring
the effects of different medications.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jorge, he remains in treatment. Two days after arriving
at the detox center, he sat in an empty cafeteria, which was set
for lunch with Lay's chips and Swiss creme sandwiches on white
plates. On the wall was an old window shade, on which was written
``The Twelve Steps,'' the famous recovery process.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 9 urges, in part, to ``make direct amends to people''
whom you have harmed. Jorge said he must make amends to his mother,
because he once stole her gold necklace, gold rings, and a bracelet
in order to buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Then he remembered another incident, on the Boston Common,
nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I snatched a pocketbook from a lady,'' he said, scratching a
several-day growth of beard. ``My friend grabbed her and threw her
to the ground. And I stomped her on the chest. I left my footprint
on her. I really hurt her. She finally let go of the pocketbook. We
ran right into police on horseback and were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at court, the lady said she didn't want to press charges.
I was shocked. I said to her, `I'm very sorry. I have a drug
problem.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``She said to me, `Get help.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge shook his head. ``It takes a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald walked in, plopping her Bottega bag next to Jorge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You going to stay in treatment?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm going to stay, Brianne,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better,'' she said.

<P>
   TEHRAN _ It was an unlikely setting for the liberalization of
Iran. The Participation Front offices were stuffy, the street
outside a canyon of hot Tehran traffic, the speakers sometimes
shouting to be heard above the murmur of journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But Reza Khatami _ booming voiced, grey-bearded, flabbier in the
face than his presidential brother _ Tuesday was talking history.
</P>
<P>
   The law forbidding satellite dishes had to be changed,
journalists must be protected and would no longer be convicted by
religious courts, the recent murder of intellectuals must be
investigated, there must be no more intrusion into the personal
life of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   It was heady stuff. But there, apparently, were the figures to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Parliamentary results to date, according to Khatami, showed that
the ``reformist'' movement had won 137 of the 191 declared
``Majlis'' seats _ of which his own Participation Front, loyal to
President Mohamed Khatami, had picked up 109.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives had only 39 seats so far, independents 15.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hojatolislam Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former
president, former speaker of parliament _ and we shall leave aside
for now Rafsanjani's personal wealth _ Khatami ``didn't much need''
him as the next parliamentary speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani, it turned out, came a miserable 29th in the list of
Tehran candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, a British-trained urologist whose searching eyes bear
an uncanny resemblance to those of his brother, smiled little and
spoke much but sounded like the president himself when he insisted
that at the top of his party program lay human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of writers over the past 12 months and the
authorities' invasion of the Tehran university campus last year
would be pursued, he announced.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these are early days. Khatami, who will be leading
the largest party in parliament _ he may yet have 115 seats or more
_ agreed that differing factions might disagree within the
reformist umbrella. And parliament doesn't have the power to change
the Iranian constitution _ only to ensure that it is correctly
obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 6th Parliament (elected in Iran) cannot do everything the
people want,'' Khatami said. ``We will try to answer some of the
people's demands.``
</P>
<P>
   Yet he was quite specific when it came to personal freedoms -
and the intrusion of religious authorities into the lives of Iran's
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``In personal, everyday life, we are going to stop this
insulting of people and we're going to have a Social Improvement
(privacy) Law in the parliament to protect the personal life of the
people. We're going to have a Political Improvement Law so that
people can have rights like public meetings and demonstrations.''
</P>
<P>
   The clergy's special court _ which even placed Ayatollah Hossein
Ali Montazeri under house arrest in Qom and silenced his voice
until The Independent reached him on Sunday _ would no longer be
permitted to convict journalists. ``This court has to work
according to constitutional law,'' Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
   But the West _ which has been happy-clapping every new victory
by Khatami's party and supporters _ should perhaps study his last
words before assuming that Iran is about to become another client
nation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Of Hezbollah's battle against Israeli occupation troops in
southern Lebanon _ the guerrillas are given military and financial
assistance by Iran _ Khatami said that ``we are defending the right
of people whose land has been occupied _ and America is defending
the people who occupied this land.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Gulf, it was for Iran and its Arab neighbors to guard
its security. In other words _ and Khatami was perhaps too discreet
to say so _ it's time for the Americans to leave. &QL;

IRA WITHDRAWALS A QUESTION OF TAXES AND TIMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I will be 70 1/2 this year and my wife will be 66. I am fully
retired. As you know, one is required to start taking minimum
withdrawals from IRAs the year after he reaches 70 1/2, so for me
that year will be 2001. This means I have only a few months to
position my IRA so as to be most advantageous to me at the time I
must start my required minimum distribution. Would it be advisable
to begin the required minimum distribution from my IRAs this year
rather than having to take two distributions during the first year
if I wait until tax year 2001 to begin the withdrawals? How should
I reallocate my IRA holdings at this time? I have income from the
military, Social Security for myself and my wife, and income other
investments, so I do not need the IRA withdrawals for living
expenses. Therefore, I will take only the minimum withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   G. L. Seal Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. If your goal is to remove money from your IRA as slowly as
possible, you would be better off taking your first mandatory
minimum withdrawal this year rather next year, when you would have
to take two withdrawals, one for the year in which you turned 70
1/2 and another for tax year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the math. Your joint and life expectancy is determined by
the ages of yourself and your beneficiary on your birthdays in the
tax year in question.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if you turn 70 1/2 before June 30, you would calculate the
life expectancy using your wife's age of 66 and your age of 71.
Using the IRS life expectancy tables, you would get a life
expectancy of 22.2 years, and divide the IRA balance by 22.2.
</P>
<P>
   If the balance were the same as it currently is, that would
require a withdrawal of $19,690. (If you turn 70 1/2 after June 30,
the calculation would be based on ages of 70 and 66, the divisor
would be 22.5, and the mandatory minimum withdrawal would be only
$19,427.)
</P>
<P>
   In the next tax year, your divisor would fall to 21.7 or 21.3,
again depending on where your birthdate falls. Thus, you would face
withdrawals of $20,144 or $20,522, basing the calculations on the
same theoretical balance. The upshot is that for the two tax years,
your withdrawals would total $39,571 or $40,212.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the effect if you waited until tax year 2001 to
take the withdrawals. If you were age 71 at the end of that year,
the divisor would be 21.7 and you would take two withdrawals of
$20,144, or a total of $40,288. If you were 72 at the end of tax
year 2001, you would face two withdrawals of $20,522 each, for a
total of $41,044.
</P>
<P>
   There is another way that taking your first withdrawal this year
might benefit you. This is that if you wait until tax year 2001 to
take the double withdrawal, the addition of more than $40,000 to
your taxable income might push you into a higher tax bracket, thus
leaving you not only with heavier withdrawals from the IRA, but a
higher tax bill as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for reallocating your IRA portfolio now that you have entered
the age when you must face withdrawals, I see no reason to make a
change. As I break it down, your current IRA portfolio is 31
percent each in stocks and in bond funds, and 38 percent in CDs and
money market funds. (I have divided the assets of a balanced fund
to make that calculation.)
</P>
<P>
   If you like that allocation, which is a fairly typical one for a
person your age, you can simply take the withdrawals
proportionately from each portfolio segment, or take them so as to
realign the portfolio however you like. But if I were doing it, I
would take the actual yields from the bond portfolio and the
CD/money market segments, which I estimate at a little more than
$18,000, and sell only enough of the stock fund shares as you need
to make up the remainder of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be retiring in about three years. I will need income
for the rest of my life, which I plan to draw from a $150,000 bond
portfolio. My investments now consist of about 80 percent in stocks
and stock funds and the rest in bonds or cash. I am leaning toward
the idea of establishing the bond portfolio in the taxable accounts
and leaving the IRA almost fully invested in stocks and stock funds
for growth. This is based on my assumption that the tax
consequences would be the same whether I withdrew dividends from
the IRA or from the nondeferred account _ that is, both taxed as
ordinary income. Is there a fault in my thinking? Also, where is
there a good source of information on IRA withdrawals on the Web?
</P>
<P>
   J.W., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you have worked out the right plan, but the tax
consequences would not be the same if you used the alternative
approach. If you follow your plan, you will have $200,000 in the
IRA, all in stocks. You won't be required to take anything from
that account, and therefore won't have any tax liability, until
after age 70 1/2. You would then have $150,000 in bonds and
$250,000 in stocks in your taxable accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose that your bond portfolio yields an average 6.5
percent and that the distributions _ income and capital gains
distributions from funds _ averaged 4 percent. You would thus have
taxable income of $9,600 from the bond holdings and $10,000 from
your stock holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The latter figure is a hard one to estimate, particularly if the
majority of the holdings in the taxable accounts is mutual funds
rather than common stocks; a funds pattern of capital gains
distribution can be quite irregular, and sometimes have little
relationship to the short-term performance of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   But look what would happen if you built the bond fund in the IRA
and took the yield from there: You would have the same $9,600 in
taxable income from the IRA withdrawals, but you would also have
$16,000 in taxable income from the taxable accounts, meaning you
would have taxable income of $25,600 rather than $19,600.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal way to build the portfolio is to have your bonds in
the taxable account, and to arrange the taxable stock positions so
that they are dominated by common stocks with the lowest dividends,
and by funds that have historically been fairly tax efficient, such
as index funds.
</P>
<P>
   Your IRA would then be the ideal repository for your stocks with
high payout levels, such as utilities, and funds that traditionally
deliver large capital gains distributions.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy would reduce the short-term tax effects, but of
course the taxman will ultimately get his due, because not drawing
from the IRA should mean that it will grow steadily during the
dozen or so years after retirement and before you need to take
minimum mandatory withdrawals, and the higher the balance at that
time, the higher the withdrawals will be.
</P>
<P>
   So at that point you could adopt a reverse strategy _ selling
the taxable bond positions and replacing them with common stocks
and tax-efficient funds, and swapping some of the tax-deferred
stock holdings for a bond portfolio in the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am in my first year working as a court reporter and am
already concerned about self-employment taxation. Can you recommend
a ``For Dummies'' book?
</P>
<P>
   C.B., Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, there is a book called ``Taxes for Dummies: 2000
Edition'' by Donald J. Silverman and Eric Tyson, but I haven't read
it so I can't provide an evaluation. My tax bible is ``J. K.
Lasser's Your Income Tax,'' revised for each tax year. It resembles
a Manhattan telephone book, and there's no question that some parts
of it are fairly tough sledding.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than faulting the book, I lay the blame for the
complexity on the tax code itself. (Lines from Ezra Pound come to
mind: ``I won't say it wasn't hard going / Over roads twisted like
sheep's guts.)
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, if the dummy is computer-literate, using one of
the computer programs to generate your tax return is probably the
easiest approach. The programs pose a long sequence of questions,
you supply the answers, and you just follow the instructions until
you come to the crushing reality of Line 68 of Form 1040, the one
highlighted Amount You Owe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Money musings: Here's a classic quotation for tax time from
Judge Learned Hand, one of the nation's greatest jurists never to
sit on the US Supreme Court, written in 1934: ``Anyone may so
arrange his affairs that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he
is not bound to choose that pattern which will best pay the
Treasury; there is not even a patriotic duty to increase one's
taxes.''

   I am a gook, evenh I was not one of your North Vietnamese
captors who tortured you and other American prisoners of war more

fought valiantly for their independence after they thought the
United States would grant them freedom after the Spanish-American
War in 1898.

   I am a gook, even though I was not around when European imperial
powers carved up a weakened China in the mid-19th century.

fleeing the Pearl River Delta region of southeastern China for the
lure of gold in California in the late 1840s and early 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   I am a gook, even though I did not suffer from the virulent
bigotry of white Californians who beat and killed Chinese men for
working the gold fields, building the transcontinental railroads,
toiling in the farm lands and in low-level city jobs like laundries
and vegetable peddling and explosives handling during the last half
of the 19th century.

   I am a gook, even though I was not Vincent Chin, who was beaten

devoting their adult lives to rearing seven children to be
productive citizens of the United States.

   &HT;     Commentary

 &HT;     By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Isn't it curious that they can make peace here,
but not there, where it counts?
</P>
<P>
   Organized groups of Jews, Arabs, Jewish-Americans and
Arab-Americans quietly have been meeting in the San Francisco area
for several years now, establishing ties they hope can be
replicated in the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   These Jews and Arabs are nice to each other. Instead of
suspicion, there is trust; instead of hatred, friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for people who live there to break the
barriers. There's too much history,'' said Sandor Strauss of
Lafayette, a member of the East Bay Jewish-Palestinian Living Room
Dialogue Group. ``The main use of the groups here is to understand
where other people are coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20 or so active members of Strauss' group include Israelis,
Palestinians, American Jews, a Syrian and people from other Arab
nations. They meet weekly in members' homes and participate in each
other's religious observances.
</P>
<P>
   The group's current projects are funding Internet access for a
school in Ramallah, on the West Bank, and a medical clinic for
Bedouins in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want as many contacts here as possible going over into
contacts over there,'' Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of California at San Francisco, 20 medical
professionals have organized as the Alliance of Middle Eastern
Scientists and Physicians. They seek $300,000 in grant money for
training Palestinian and Israeli nurses in the United States. The
program would be run in cooperation with the Recanati School for
the Health Professions at Ben Gurion University in Beersheba and
Al-Qudes University, which has campuses throughout the West Bank
and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Dudy Tzfati, an Israeli biochemist who is one of the group's
leaders, said it was organized about a year ago when it became
apparent that Israelis, Palestinians, Moroccans and Syrians were
rubbing shoulders at UC-San Francisco and might be able to
collaborate on something beneficial to their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we want to provide in San Francisco _ a safe,
supportive neutral ground,'' Tzfati said. ``There are a lot of
interactions between Arabs and Jews in the Mideast, but people
don't feel free to express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of California at Berkeley, a group called A
Jewish Voice for Peace is meeting with an Arab group, the Ramallah
Club, and with the Palestinian American Congress, according to
Lincoln Shlensky, a Berkeley graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish Voice also collaborated with the San Francisco-based
human rights group, Global Exchange on presentations intended to
raise awareness in the United States of Israel's practice of
demolishing Palestinian homes on the West Bank that were
constructed without government-issued permits.
</P>
<P>
   A question arises, however. Good intentions are very nice, but
how successful can these efforts really be in helping to change the
complex situation in the Middle East?
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Hijazi of San Bruno, a retired businessman and one of
the founders of San Francisco's Arab Cultural Center, doesn't think
they can have much impact at all.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he said, is that the situation today in the Middle
East is as critical as it ever has been, even with a professed
dove, Ehud Barak, as the Israeli leader. Things are so urgent, he
said, that nothing as slow-moving as people-to-people
collaborations in other countries can be counted upon to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want something done,'' he said. ``Israel has to live as
a Middle Eastern country; it can't live as a Western nation.''
</P>
<P>
   This view is shared by an unusual duo of speakers who were in
San Francisco recently as guests of the American Friends Service
Committee and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Halper, an Israeli, and Salim Shawamreh, a Palestinian,
said that with peace talks stalled, a situation is crystallizing in
the Middle East that could result in a South African-type state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be witnessing the emergence of apartheid,'' Halper
said. ``The danger is they'll negotiate a peace that will confine 3
million Palestinians to 70 little islands (of settlement) on the
West Bank and in Gaza _ and in five to 10 years there will be
another explosion, another intifada,'' or holy war.
</P>
<P>
   Shawamreh said the Palestinians have nowhere to turn because
they're also at the mercy of the surrounding Arab powers, whose
interests often don't coincide with their own, and because they're
friendless outside the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Arab people in San Francisco why they were not looking
at this more strongly,'' he said. ``They said, `We have our own
problems here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably all this has the ring of truth. Still, I don't see
why we need to let the grim reality on the ground half a world away
sour us on the value of good intentions acted out in here.

<P>
   LA GABARRA, Colombia _ The rusted gates to the cemetery were
locked, so Sister Sofia entered by crouching carefully between two
strands of barbed wire, making sure she didn't snag her white
cotton habit.
</P>
<P>
   As she straightened herself, the 31-year-old nun looked around
the knee-high grass. Her large brown large brown eyes fixed on four
fresh mounds of reddish soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the ones we buried, and this is where we put them,''
she said in a calm, soft voice, as if to keep from disturbing these
sleeping souls.
</P>
<P>
   On another small hill, three naked branches were planted upright
in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a married couple here,'' the nun said, her voice
quivering slightly. ``One stick is for the husband, the other for
the wife. The third is for the baby she was carrying. She was six
months pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   When she took her vows to become a Franciscan nun 12 years ago,
Sister Sofia expected to be a teacher, helping to sharpen the minds
of Colombian children. But much of her work over the past year has
been with bodies, not souls. Almost daily, she retrieves corpses
from the banks of the Catatumbo River or from the muddy road that
leads into this remote northern village near the Venezuelan border.
When she buries them, only rarely is she aware of who they were or
how they got caught up in the constant violence that pervades these
jungle hills.
</P>
<P>
   Like most everyone else in La Gabarra, Sister Sofia's life is
dominated by Colombia's brutally entwined conflicts _ the booming
trade in cocaine and heroin and the 40-year civil war that is
largely financed by drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Years of government neglect and chronic poverty have turned
rural areas like these into fertile ground for producing much of
the cocaine and heroin that is sold in the United States. It also
makes these residents more vulnerable to the unwanted attention of
leftist guerrillas or right-wing paramilitary groups fighting for
control of the lucrative bounty from coca fields.
</P>
<P>
   To help restore peace to places like La Gabarra, Colombian
President Andres Pastrana and the Clinton administration are
lobbying the US Congress for $1.6 billion in aid _ most of it in
military equipment and additional training _ to stop Colombia's
drug supply and to strengthen South America's longest-running
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be easy. Despite two decades of antidrug
interdiction by US and Colombian authorities, Colombia's drug
business is booming. Figures soon to be released by US drug
officials are expected to show that Colombia produced 520 metric
tons of cocaine last year, more than triple the original estimate
of 1998's harvest.
</P>
<P>
   In Bogota and Washington, the generals fighting the drug war say
they need US-made Blackhawk helicopters, better surveillance
technology, and more American-trained units who can swoop into
places like La Gabarra and eradicate its coca fields. But their
strategy focuses primarily on left-wing guerrillas _ not the
right-wing paramilitaries who control and tax the open and
flourishing drug trade in towns like La Gabarra.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Clinton administration plan say the Colombians
need the hardware and expertise if they are to find and eliminate
drug fields and break up the cartels that transport 85 percent of
the cocaine into the United States and a growing amount of heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer to see less consumption in the United States or
in Europe, rather than to have more helicopters,'' said Rosso Jose
Serrano Cadena, Colombia's national police chief who oversees most
of the country's antidrug efforts. ``But we have an obligation to
do all we can with the best equipment and personnel we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   The US-Colombia strategy is to push primarily into the south of
the country, prime coca-growing territory controlled by the
15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the largest
insurgent group, also known as the FARC. Planners expect a minimum
of 10,000 people will be driven from their homes by the new
operation, if it is approved.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, US advisers have helped the Colombian police and
military identify fields and laboratories where harvested plants
are processed into drugs. Then crop-dusting planes, provided by an
American subcontractor, fumigate the fields. Days later, a special
team of government engineers and scientists is flown in, flanked by
armed troops, to inspect poisoned fields.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia last year received about $300 million in antidrug
funding from the United States, and American authorities are
present in almost every aspect of the country's antinarcotics
operations. At any one time there are roughly 200 to 300 US
personnel in Colombia, according to one senior official. They
include military trainers, as well as agents from the FBI, Drug
Enforcement Administration, Justice Department, Treasury
Department, National Security Agency, and the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the United States is currently providing $5 million
for crop substitution and other social and economic projects
administered by the Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the current antidrug strategy say that more money
should go toward programs that foster rural economic development, a
better court system, and basic government services. Fumigation,
they add, only worsens a bad situation for many peasant farmers who
resort to growing coca and poppy _ the flowering plant used for
heroin _ either for economic survival or because they have been
coerced by a rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   ``All fumigation does is displace poor people who are already
living under extremely difficult conditions,'' said Ricardo Vargas,
director of the Colombian office of Accion Andina, an umbrella
group of antidrug activists in the Andean region. ``Once their
field is lost, they'll simply find another place to try again.''
</P>
<P>
   Month by month, more of them are coming to La Gabarra.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Located a few miles from the Venezuelan border in an oil-rich
swath in the state of Norte de Santander, there are only two ways
to get here: by canoe along the Catatumbo River, or a spine-shaking
10-hour drive _ most of it over rocks, mud, and thick, wet clay _
from the city of Cucuta.
</P>
<P>
   The area was once a hub for banana and mango farmers. But over
the last five years, it has become the center of one of the
country's fastest-growing coca-producing regions.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, La Gabarra's population swells from 2,000 people to
nearly 10,000. Young males, wearing knee-high black rubber boots,
descend from coca fields in the surrounding hills and arrive in one
of the dozens of canoes that taxi them along the Catatumbo River.
</P>
<P>
   They come to the village to ``rumbear,'' the local slang for
``partying,'' which usually involves two days of heavy beer
drinking, several games of pool, and two nights with some of La
Gabarra's 500 prostitutes. In one weekend, a worker can easily
spend most of his week's salary, about $250.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the coca farms, the workers perform backbreaking and
often noxious tasks. Those who pick the leaves are known as
``scrapers,'' for the way they harvest the leaves off plants with
their bare hands. Meanwhile, ``chemists'' assigned to the rustic
processing labs are exposed to large quantities of cement dust,
gasoline fumes, and sulfuric acid that are used to make the cocaine
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody around here consumes cocaine, probably because everyone
knows the kind of things that go into it,'' said one 20-year-old
farm worker who goes by the nickname, ``Diablo.''
</P>
<P>
   Fumigation and other government-sponsored eradication programs
haven't begun here yet, although Colombian and American officials
say this area will be targeted under the new aid plan.

CATHOLIC-BASHING IS BACK IN STYLE

Countdown commentary column.)

 By GERALDINE FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    I had a hard time watching Pat Robertson on CNN Saturday night,
gloating over George W. Bush's win in South Carolina.
 &HT;    The Christian Coalition was energized, he proclaimed. They had
worked their heads _ he would never say ``butts'' _ off to get out
the vote. They had made thousands of phone calls. They had sent out
tens of thousands of pieces of direct mail. They had made a
difference.
 &HT;    When a reporter suggested that the Christian Coalition had
delivered South Carolina for Bush, Robertson was happy to agree.
But he went even further _ it had actually elected the next
president of the United States, he said.
 &HT;    Hold on now. To quote that great American philosopher, Yogi
Berra, ``It ain't over 'til it's over.'' And Americans who believe
in religious tolerance _ especially those of the Catholic faith _
have a lot to think about after South Carolina.
 &HT;    No doubt about it, Bush's visit to Bob Jones University was a
smart political move _ in the short term. It may have involved
pandering to an institution built in the image of a founder who
reportedly believed that Catholicism is a satanic cult, that the
pope is the Antichrist and that the Catholic Eucharist is
comparable to cannibalism, but it's worth it if the university has
thousands of volunteers ready to help get out the vote.
 &HT;    And he didn't have much to lose _ Catholic-bashing doesn't upset
too many people in South Carolina. As for the wider world, if
Catholic-bashing doesn't seem to hurt museum curators or members of
Congress, why should it harm a presidential candidates?
 &HT;    Back in November, New York's Brooklyn Museum opened
``Sensation,'' an exhibition that featured a rendition of the
Madonna by an African artist which used elephant dung and
porn-magazine clippings among its elements.
 &HT;    It stirred up a controversy, of course, but the museum
administration had known it would _ the same thing had happened
when it was first shown in London. But the directors of an
outer-borough museum that had long struggled to attract visitors
knew that controversy would bring attention, and with the attention
would come long lines of paying customers. As indeed they did.
 &HT;    Canny marketing, to be sure, and if a few Catholics saw the
piece as an insult to them and to their religion, well, that was
the price of success.
 &HT;    I didn't see the exhibit, but as a Catholic I was nonetheless
offended by it. As a believer in civil liberties, I agree with the
show's defenders that its freedom of expression is protected by the
First Amendment _ but, as a Catholic, I will never go to the
Brooklyn Museum again.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, in January Catholic-bashing reared its ugly head in
Washington.
 &HT;    It's been more than a century since the office of chaplain of
the House of Representatives was created, and this year was the
first time a Roman Catholic priest was recommended for the post.
The House Republicans can't find a heartbeat when it comes to
enacting virtually any significant piece of legislation, but the
nomination of a Catholic chaplain woke them up in a hurry.
 &HT;    With the speed of lightning, the Republicans rejected the
nomination, installing a Protestant minister instead. Neither
Speaker Dennis Hastert (R.-Ill.) nor Majority Leader Dick Armey
(R.-Texas) offered any explanation for their actions. And, as you'd
expect, they were surprised at the angry reaction from House
Catholics of both parties.
 &HT;    Since 1960 Catholic politicians, fearful of upsetting the
church/state balance forged by John F. Kennedy, the first Catholic
elected president, have avoided speaking up for themselves. But the
rejection of a Catholic chaplain, apparently for no reason other
than his Catholicism, struck many as a return to the rampant
intolerance of the 19th century, and drew a vociferous response
from many Catholics in the House.
 &HT;    And now Catholic-bashing may actually have helped a candidate
win his party's presidential nomination.
 &HT;    Sen. John McCain may have lost the South Carolina primary
because he refused to pander to the anti-Catholic forces that
dominate that state's Republican Party. McCain declared that he
would have refused to appear at Bob Jones University because of its
teachings against racial intermarriage and Roman Catholicism.
 &HT;    And, as Robertson was so happy to point out, McCain lost by a
beefy 12 points.
 &HT;    But McCain knows something that neither Robertson nor Bush has
figured out: The Democrats who turned out in droves to support
Ronald Reagan in 1980 and again in 1984 were hard-working,
blue-collar Catholics.
 &HT;    McCain realizes that those Catholics are the most conservative
members of the Democratic Party, and that they have more loyalty to
their issues than to political labels. His whole campaign has been
built on reaching out to independents and Democrats.
 &HT;    In short, he wants the Reagan Democrats back. He believes that
the only way for the Republicans to win is as a party of inclusion,
not one of exclusion. And he's right.
 &HT;    In his recent book, former Sen. Warren Rudman (R.-N.H.) wrote
that the Republican Party will discredit itself if it allies itself
too closely with the Christian Coalition.
 &HT;    It already has.

<P>
   QOM, IRAN _ The voice was friendly, elderly, avuncular, so close
to me _ Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri was just three meters (10
feet) away, behind a dividing wall _ that I not only heard his
words through the interphone but the murmur of his actual voice
from the next room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the mouthpieces of the revolution,'' he said.
``But when they treat me, me, like this, how must they be treating
the others?''
</P>
<P>
   It was an eerie experience. To interview the man whom Ayatollah
Khomeini once anointed as his chosen successor is one thing. To
talk to him through a wall after he has spent more than two years
under house arrest in this gold-domed holy city _ two Revolutionary
Guards watching his front door and his every visitor _ was
positively surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the parliamentary elections that have handed
Iran's revolution back to its people, the stubborn old cleric was
still patiently awaiting his freedom _ and condemning the elderly
Islamic clergymen who put him there, who ``did not keep the promise
of the revolution,'' who refuse to yield political power to the
president of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   This was his first in-person interview in captivity _ house
arrest was meant to shut him up.
</P>
<P>
   We had to walk quickly through the back door of the house of
Ayatollah Montazeri's son Ahmed and persuade him to let us talk to
his father through the white cord telephone attached to an inner
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to my home,'' the Ayatollah growled at me in English.
It was one of the few kind things he said. Because the reasons for
Montazeri's house imprisonment _ and the contents of his
extraordinary interview Sunday _ go to the very heart of the crisis
behind last week's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Ayatollah believes that the Supreme Leader of Iran, the
unelected Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, should not hold political power,
should not be able to hinder the reformist movement of President
Mohamed Khatami _ who appears to have received an overwhelming vote
of support in last week's poll.
</P>
<P>
   Did he still believe that the velayat e-faqih _ the institution
of religious guide created by Khomeini and once awarded to him _
had been misused? The voice growled again, this time in Farsi.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an Arabic expression that says: `There's a limit to
all things _ and everything that passes its limit destroys itself.'
If the institution of the Supreme Guide was one of an observer, it
would remain. But if there is dictatorship, it cannot continue...
</P>
<P>
   ``People like me and Mr. (Mohsen) Kadivar (a `reformist' cleric
in Tehran) are sent to prison because these people cannot tolerate
criticism. Yet the Imam Ali always said: `You should criticize me.'
These gentlemen should behave the same way (as the Imam).''
</P>
<P>
   All the while we were speaking to each other through that
whitewashed wall in Qom Sunday, the Ayatollah's son Ahmed stood
beside us, bearded and turbaned, turning at one point to mutter
that ``this is the first time he has given such an interview.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Montazeri expect now to be freed, in the aftermath of
last week's election, to be spared the Ayatollah Khamenei's charge
of ``treason against the revolution?''
</P>
<P>
   Back came the disembodied voice. ``All my hope is in God. But
these people (the conservative clergy) should take note that
keeping me in prison is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Husseiniya (religious teaching school) class next to
my home where I have many Korans and books _ and they took them
from me. I have 3,000 cassettes and audio-equipment and they took
all of it. Even if a person is convicted, they're not allowed to
confiscate his belongings...
</P>
<P>
   ``Our revolution was Islamic and (came about) through the will
of the people. And we asked for independence, for freedom and for
an Islamic Republic. It seems that they (the clergy) have forgotten
freedom. They did not keep the promise of the revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his habit of speaking out which lost Ayatollah Montazeri
the favor of Imam Khomeini. Once described by Khomeini as ``the
fruit of my life,'' he dared to write a letter to the founder of
the Islamic Revolution after the end of the Iran-Iraq War,
condemning the hanging of thousands of young Iranian men and women
accused _ often without proof or fair trials _ of joining the
violent pro-Iraqi ``mujahedin'' opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Khomeini, whose son Ahmed _ also now dead _ is said to have
intercepted the letter, allowed the executions to continue and
dismissed Montazeri as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatollah Khamanei, the man who now holds the job Montazeri was
destined for, was enraged by the latter's subsequent criticism of
his powers.
</P>
<P>
   Our talk Sunday in a tiny apartment off an alleyway in the
suburbs of Qom, suggested that the voice will not be stilled. &QL;

<P>
   ``We have another expression in Persian that says: `Rights are
something you must seize _ they're not given to you.' The people
had to elect good representatives and oblige them to work in the
people's interest. Violence brings negative results. But they (the
conservative clergy) have created what are called `force groups'
who used violence and attacked people when they wanted to speak
publicly. And they attacked me too. These kinds of action make
people hate religion. But you can never serve the interests of
religion through violence.''
</P>
<P>
   And had he changed his views on the ``velayat e-faqih,'' the
all-powerful institution of the nation's Islamic Guide?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote four books about this,'' came the voice down the
interphone. ``But right now it's not (about) what I wrote in my
books. In our constitutional law, the executive power is separate
from the institution of the Supreme Leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things now are not according to constitutional law here. The
president is supposed to be responsible but the tools of power are
in other people's hands. According to Islam, they should be
separate.''
</P>
<P>
   And he began to talk about issues he had not chosen to address
so far, the 100 intellectuals and writers, for example, who were
``disappeared'' under the presidency of Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani in the decade up to 1998, the authorities' attack on
Tehran University dormitories last year that led to student riots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election should be enough to stop the bad things they have
been doing in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's said that they have killed 100 innocent people. The
judiciary must follow this up. And when they invaded the
university, they did nothing about those who violated the campus.
But they arrested some of the students. So people should ask for
justice. Our constitution says so.'' &QL;

   Yes, he agreed, Iranians were happy after their election. ``They
really did their duty and they went to take hold of their destiny.
But if they want to do this, they shouldn't let others decide for
them. Thank God, the people participated well in this election _ I
wish them all success.'' &QL;

<P>
   In the meeting room across the tiny hallway, there were
photographs of Montazeri with the murdered Iranian Justice Minister
Ayatollah Behesti _ killed by a ``mujahedin'' bomb after the
revolution _ and of Montazeri's son Mohamed who died in the same
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The voice down the telephone was a lonely one and we gently
offered the only surviving son, Ahmed, the hope that our next
interview would be conducted in a more civilized way. He smiled but
remained silent. I could see why. The family's future depends on
those elections. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOGOTA _ At Sigmund Freud Park on the National University
campus, minds are often altered on heroin.
</P>
<P>
   In the dance clubs near the beaches of Cartagena, hips grind to
a mix of ballenato music and Ecstasy pills.
</P>
<P>
   And inside the decrepit slums of Cartucho, in the heart of the
capital, children in tattered clothes puff on cigarettes laced with
a cocaine derivative called ``basuco.''
</P>
<P>
   As Colombia struggles to end decades of battles against drug
cartels and insurgents, it is confronting a new war within its own
borders. Drug consumption is growing steadily, from modern
apartment buildings to the most remote jungle hamlets, and the
government now admits that something must be done about it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a relatively new phenomenon that both infuriates and
embarrasses the country's leaders, who for years have blamed
Colombia's drug problems on the overwhelming demand that comes from
the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And while most of the cocaine and heroin grown and processed in
this country remains destined for export overseas, officials here
can no longer hide the growing demand at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug consumption here is something we realize we have to
address immediately,'' said Gabriel Merchan, director of Colombia's
national office on drug policy. ``It's another painful price that
our society has to pay for narcotrafficking, but if we commit
ourselves now we can stop it from growing further.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is not alone among Latin American countries to face a
new drug-consumption dilemma. Other countries that have become
players in the region's booming narcotrafficking industry _ whether
as producers or gateways into the United States _ have seen rising
levels of drug abuse among their own citizens, most notably Mexico,
Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Although Merchan and other officials insist that the drug-abuse
problem is only a fraction of that found in the United States and
Europe, Colombia's war on drugs may prove to be trickier in a
country where supplies are cheaper and more addictive because of
their purity.
</P>
<P>
   A gram of 70-percent-pure heroin sells for as little as $10 at
Freud Park. Ecstasy pills, a synthetic drug popular in the United
States since the 1980s, can be had for $3 each. And a half-gram of
basuco powder, a byproduct of cocaine processing that contains
traces of gasoline, ether, and sulfuric acid, can be bought for
just 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a bitter taste that at first makes your stomach ache
and gives you diarrhea,'' said Jaime Carbajal, 33, a recovering
basuco addict who now works for a drug treatment center in Bogota.
``But your body adjusts quickly and it makes you feel calm, not
strong, but not weak, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Current drug-consumption statistics for Colombia are hard to
find. Most officials rely on two government-funded studies _ one
conducted in 1992, the other in 1996 _ to gauge the trends.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2 percent of Colombia's 35 million citizens said they
took some illegal drug the previous year, according to the 1996
report, nearly double the rate in the first survey. Among
respondents, marijuana had been consumed the most, followed by
cocaine, basuco, and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 government survey of children and young adults, released
two weeks ago and using a different methodology, found that 5
percent of Colombian men and women between the ages of 10 and 24
are regular consumers. In the United States, that number is roughly
3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sad consequence of a country with a large
narcotrafficking industry,'' said Klaus Nyholm, director of the
United Nations Drug Control Program office in Colombia, which
sponsors nearly two dozen drug-fighting programs.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Colombia's heaviest drug consumption is not in
Bogota, a metropolis of 7 million people, or in the remote fields
that process cocaine and heroin, but in the rolling hills that
produce the country's other famous product: coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Along a miles-wide corridor on the western slopes of the Andes
Mountains, cadres of field workers _ mostly men who spend months at
a time moving from farm to farm _ smoke large quantities of
marijuana. The demand for the plant in the region has created
thriving drug markets in Pereira, Manizales, Armenia, and other
towns along the coffee belt.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating Colombia's drug-use problem is its worsening
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a model among Latin American countries for its
steady prosperity and thriving middle class despite years of civil
war, Colombia is now in the midst of one of its worst recessions in
70 years. A growing number of businesses and investors have taken
their money out of the country mostly because of the escalating
violence involving government troops, leftist guerrillas, and
right-wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a complicated situation that it's hard to know where
to start,'' said one drug-treatment worker in Bogota who requested
anonymity. ``Do you stop the drug traffickers first, or the civil
war, or create more jobs for people? There's only so much money
that government can spend and people are losing patience.''

<P>
   QOM, IRAN _ The voice was friendly, elderly, avuncular, so close
to me _ Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri was just three meters (10
feet) away, behind a dividing wall _ that I not only heard his
words through the interphone but the murmur of his actual voice
from the next room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the mouthpieces of the revolution,'' he said.
``But when they treat me, me, like this, how must they be treating
the others?''
</P>
<P>
   It was an eerie experience. To interview the man whom Ayatollah
Khomeini once anointed as his chosen successor is one thing. To
talk to him through a wall after he has spent more than two years
under house arrest in this gold-domed holy city _ two Revolutionary
Guards watching his front door and his every visitor _ was
positively surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the parliamentary elections that have handed
Iran's revolution back to its people, the stubborn old cleric was
still patiently awaiting his freedom _ and condemning the elderly
Islamic clergymen who put him there, who ``did not keep the promise
of the revolution,'' who refuse to yield political power to the
president of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   This was his first in-person interview in captivity _ house
arrest was meant to shut him up.
</P>
<P>
   We had to walk quickly through the back door of the house of
Ayatollah Montazeri's son Ahmed and persuade him to let us talk to
his father through the white cord telephone attached to an inner
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to my home,'' the Ayatollah growled at me in English.
It was one of the few kind things he said. Because the reasons for
Montazeri's house imprisonment _ and the contents of his
extraordinary interview Sunday _ go to the very heart of the crisis
behind last week's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Ayatollah believes that the Supreme Leader of Iran, the
unelected Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, should not hold political power,
should not be able to hinder the reformist movement of President
Mohamed Khatami _ who appears to have received an overwhelming vote
of support in last week's poll.
</P>
<P>
   Did he still believe that the velayat e-faqih _ the institution
of religious guide created by Khomeini and once awarded to him _
had been misused? The voice growled again, this time in Farsi.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an Arabic expression that says: `There's a limit to
all things _ and everything that passes its limit destroys itself.'
If the institution of the Supreme Guide was one of an observer, it
would remain. But if there is dictatorship, it cannot continue...

   Eight months later, opponents of NATO's war in Kosovo could not
have imagined more bitter vindication of their warnings than events
in the city of Mitrovica, where Serbs and Albanians confront each
other, kept apart only by the Ibar River and the increasingly
desperate efforts of the NATO-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the mistakes in its execution, the war was fought with
the noble aim of building a stable, tolerant and multi-ethnic
Kosovo. But over the past few weeks Mitrovica has witnessed savage
ethnic cleansing anew.
</P>
<P>
   Serb residents in its overwhelmingly Albanian southern part have
been terrorized and murdered, while Serb mobs have driven out
Albanians marooned in the Serbian enclave on the north bank of the
Ibar.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has tried to maintain order but has instead been dragged
into the struggle _ most violently when American troops were stoned
this weekend as they searched for illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It may be true that the French peacekeepers first assigned to
the city showed excessive sympathy for the Serbs, but Mitrovica
illustrates the reality of a Kosovo where ethnic hatreds burn as
fiercely as ever, where even 50,000 foreign troops cannot impose
civil order and where the main growth industry is Albanian
gangsterism.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest responsibility, of course, lies with the two
communities themselves. With all the resources in the world, NATO
and the United Nations cannot force Serbs and Albanians to live
together peaceably if they do not wish to.
</P>
<P>
   Some blame also lies with the U.N., which is supposed to run
Kosovo. Not for the first time, its structures have proved unwieldy
and overcomplicated.
</P>
<P>
   But, ultimately, the U.N. is no more than the collective will of
its member nations, and it is not the U.N.'s fault that of the
4,800 police _ the most vital single component of a new civil
administration _ promised by those member nations, only 2,000 have
been sent.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has erred too, by not doing enough to protect the Serb
minority and Serbian holy places _ perhaps in the unspoken hope
that the fewer Serbs left in Kosovo, the easier the place would be
to run and the more quickly its future would be settled.
</P>
<P>
   But at heart Mitrovica reflects the ambiguities and confusions
that still dog the entire Kosovo enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Even now it is not clear: are we trying to build a multi-ethnic
state that juridically, at least, remains part of Yugoslavia _ or
are we trying to nudge it towards independence?
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that an independent Kosovo is inevitable, and encouraged
by President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, Serb nationalists see
Mitrovica as the basis of a mini-state that can reunite with
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Albanians strive to prevent the Serbs from
gaining the mineral resources of nearby Trepca, the main economic
asset of an independent Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Partition, however, is not the answer. The notion that good
fences make good neighbors is appealing in a part of the world
where trust is so scarce.
</P>
<P>
   But formal division of Kosovo would not only betray the lofty
moral arguments that justified the war: it would send exactly the
wrong message to Bosnia, Montenegro and Macedonia, other Balkan
countries where different ethnic groups coexist uneasily.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of Mitrovica is that the West, like it or not, is in
Kosovo for the long haul, and must send the police and other
resources required to see the job through. &QL;

   Eight months later, opponents of NATO's war in Kosovo could not
have imagined more bitter vindication of their warnings than events
in the city of Mitrovica, where Serbs and Albanians confront each
other, kept apart only by the Ibar River and the increasingly
desperate efforts of the NATO-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the mistakes in its execution, the war was fought with
the noble aim of building a stable, tolerant and multi-ethnic
Kosovo. But over the past few weeks Mitrovica has witnessed savage
ethnic cleansing anew.
</P>
<P>
   Serb residents in its overwhelmingly Albanian southern part have
been terrorized and murdered, while Serb mobs have driven out
Albanians marooned in the Serbian enclave on the north bank of the
Ibar.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has tried to maintain order but has instead been dragged
into the struggle _ most violently when American troops were stoned
this weekend as they searched for illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It may be true that the French peacekeepers first assigned to
the city showed excessive sympathy for the Serbs, but Mitrovica
illustrates the reality of a Kosovo where ethnic hatreds burn as
fiercely as ever, where even 50,000 foreign troops cannot impose
civil order and where the main growth industry is Albanian
gangsterism.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest responsibility, of course, lies with the two
communities themselves. With all the resources in the world, NATO
and the United Nations cannot force Serbs and Albanians to live
together peaceably if they do not wish to.
</P>
<P>
   Some blame also lies with the U.N., which is supposed to run
Kosovo. Not for the first time, its structures have proved unwieldy
and overcomplicated.
</P>
<P>
   But, ultimately, the U.N. is no more than the collective will of
its member nations, and it is not the U.N.'s fault that of the

EVANGELICALS FIND NEW ACCEPTANCE AT MAINSTREAM COLLEGES 
</HEADLINE>

 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evangelical Christians, once known for their strident
anti-intellectualism and cultural isolation, increasingly are
studying and teaching at the same elite universities that had
scorned them.
</P>
<P>
   The president of a leading evangelical school, Fuller
Theological Seminary, says he's having a hard time holding on to
faculty because they keep getting hired by Ivy League schools.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Notre Dame, one of the centers of American
Catholic scholarship, has as its first non-Catholic provost a
Protestant evangelical who has been pushing to integrate
evangelical students into academe.
</P>
<P>
   And at Harvard University, there are 1,000 graduate students on
the e-mail list of the evangelical InterVarsity Christian
Fellowship _ double the number of four years ago _ while the
divinity school, once closely associated with Unitarianism, boasts
a new visiting professorship in evangelical studies.
</P>
<P>
   The entry of evangelical students and faculty into the ivied
halls of mainstream higher education is slowly changing both
communities, as the interaction between two once-estranged groups
leads each to a more nuanced view of the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a period of a fortress mentality . . . evangelicalism
has been engaging contemporary culture much more vigorously,'' said
John Wilson, editor of Books &AMP; Culture, a Christian journal begun
in 1995 and modeled on The New York Review of Books.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, because of changes inside academia and in the
general population, universities have become much more open to
talking to and about evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a school which tries to respond to the growing diversity in
American religion, not to pay real attention to evangelicals and
evangelical theology, would be leaving out a very big sense of the
picture,'' said Harvey Cox, a professor at Harvard Divinity School.
</P>
<P>
   Definitions of evangelicalism vary, but most scholars apply the
label to Christians who believe the Bible is the actual word of
God, who claim a personal conversion experience, and who seek to
convert others. Evangelicals can be part of any Christian
denomination, and are often confused with fundamentalists, a subset
of evangelicals who believe the Bible is literally true and not
open to critical scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new book by pollster George Gallup Jr., 39
percent of Americans describe themselves as born-again or
evangelical Christians, including an increasing number of
Catholics. Gallup wrote that ``contemporary evangelicalism has been
gaining momentum among Americans since the early 1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of this century, evangelical Christians have been
excluded from the academic mainstream, in part because of the
isolationism of the evangelicals and in part because of its
antipathy toward evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that evangelicals have often been
anti-intellectual, but it is also true that many intellectuals have
been anti-evangelical,'' said Susan Harper of the Pew Charitable
Trusts, a foundation that spent more than $14 million over the past
decade trying to improve the quality of evangelical scholarship at
major American universities.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mouw, president of Fuller Theological Seminary in
Pasadena, Calif., recounts an incident five years ago when, upon
declining an invitation to speak at an Ivy League school, he was
asked, ``Do you think you might be able to find me another smart
one?'' Today, Mouw says, ``I'm having a hard time holding on to my
faculty because they're going to Ivy League schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the scholars much in demand is Mark Noll of Wheaton
College in Illinois, who in 1994 wrote a much-noticed book entitled
``The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind,'' in which he lamented that
``despite dynamic success at a popular level, modern American
evangelicals have failed notably in sustaining serious intellectual
life.'' Five years later, Noll was hired to teach for a semester at
Harvard, and now the university is considering trying to woo him
for a permanent job.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say much of the cultural isolation of evangelicals in
America has been intentional. Evangelicals have tended to view
mainstream society _ epitomized by the elite universities _ as not
only hostile but also corrupting in its secularism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evangelicals . . . were very nervous about worldly wisdom and
the pursuit of academic degrees,'' said Michael Cromartie, director
of evangelical studies at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in
Washington, D.C. ``There was a pietism that assumes that all we
need to know is the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   No more. Joel Harter, a student at Harvard Divinity School, says
he chose Harvard because of concern about the separation between
the conservative religious community and academia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from the South, and most people in my church didn't
understand why I was going to Harvard, because they thought that
was the last place you would find God,'' said Harter, 27. ``I was a
little bit fearful about how I'd be received . . . but I found a
lot of openness, whatever your faith is.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of trends in the worlds of academia and evangelicalism
have converged to bring about this trend.
</P>
<P>
   First, a handful of evangelical Protestants won recognition as
leading scholars in fields such as history, philosophy, and
religion, and their scholarship won them jobs at some prestigious
universities. The presence of evangelical scholars, such as
historians George Marsden at Notre Dame and Harry Stout at Yale and
theologian Stanley Hauerwas at Duke, in turn enticed evangelical
students to those schools.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Pew Charitable Trusts, a foundation long
interested in evangelicals because of the staunch Presbyterianism
of its founder, put together a major program aimed at improving the
interaction between evangelicals and universities. Throughout the
1990s, Pew funded programs to urge students at evangelical colleges
to consider careers in academia, offered financial aid to graduates
of evangelical colleges who pursued graduate work at elite
universities, and funded research by evangelical scholars.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, universities could not help but notice the
astonishing rise in popularity of evangelicalism as divinity
schools placed an increasing emphasis on studying religious
practice as well as theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more interest today in religious practice and on
ordinary people, and that focus on people tends to favor the study
of evangelicalism and folk Catholicism, rather than intellectual
trends,'' said Edith Blumhofer, director of the Institute for the
Study of American Evangelicals at Wheaton in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the openness to evangelicals is also driven by the
same trend that saw universities embrace programs studying gays,
women, and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an irony that, in a climate of intense toleration, if
not relativism, everyone, even evangelicals or fundamentalists, has
a right to be there,'' said Nathan Hatch, the evangelical
Protestant who is provost of Notre Dame. ``The breakdown of a
monolithic liberal intellectual culture helps a lot of people _
women, minorities, and evangelicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nation's top evangelical scholars have done their
undergraduate work at the nation's booming Christian colleges,
which include Gordon College in Wenham, Mass. Traditionally,
students from such colleges had done graduate work at evangelical
seminaries and entered church-related professions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time when these (mainline) seminaries would have looked
down on our graduates as narrowly sectarian and unable or unwilling
to engage in the kind of scholarship they provided has passed,''
said Galen Byker, president of Calvin College in Michigan, one of
the largest evangelical colleges in the United States. ``We've sent
them good students, and there's been a growing recognition that
these students can remain committed to their evangelical faith and
world view, and still do well and benefit from that kind of
graduate education without automatically abandoning their
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say evangelical students can find themselves
happier at major universities than at evangelical colleges because
there are fewer expectations, and therefore greater tolerance, for
how individuals express their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been wonderful to be at Harvard, where everyone is not
Christian, because it helps solidify my sense of what it is that I
believe,'' said Paul Ashby, a 25-year-old graduate student in
chemistry and an evangelical Protestant who came to Harvard from
Westmont, a Christian college in California. ``Being here
surrounded by non-Christians has made me much more bold in claiming
the truth of Christianity.''

<P>
   TEHRAN _ This is a Persian tale, of hope and love and
generosity. It is also, like all Persian stories, not as simple as
it seems; a trifle opaque perhaps, elliptical, full of heroes who
might not all really be heroes. And it may yet prove to have an
unhappy, tragic ending.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, like the French Revolution and the Russian
Revolution, the Iranian Revolution finally fell under the control
of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Could any election have been more historic in the Middle East,
that dark terrain of dictatorships and torture chambers and secret
policemen? Could any people have broken free of their chains more
gently, more elegantly, and with so much trust?
</P>
<P>
   How else could one interpret the tens of thousands who queued
for hours outside the Husseiniya Ershad mosque _ in which Dr.
Shariati and his friends once protested the Shah's autocratic rule
_ to vote for the friends and supporters of the man they all
adored, President Mohamed Khatami?
</P>
<P>
   And when I talked to them, they all spoke of integrity and
democracy and the mistakes of the past, the men in their jeans and
cheap coats, the women in their ``Hejab'' covering, showing
infinite courtesy to the foreigner who had come to ask his usual
blundering, foolish questions.
</P>
<P>
   I even asked Hojatolislam Seyed Abdulwahed Moussavi Lari, the
Iranian interior minister watching the voters fill in their forms
in the mosque, what historians would write about the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will say...that the people came to vote because they
wanted freedom and to determine their own destiny,'' he announced.
</P>
<P>
   The West has always consistently and willfully misunderstood
Iran and we were at it again Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government and, of course, the American press and CNN
and all the usual suspects were billing the elections as a crucial
struggle between ``reformers'' and ``hard-liners,'' the poll which
could give President Khatami, elected with 70 percent of the vote
last May, a parliament that would at last break the power of the
``conservatives,'' the ``radicals,'' the ``extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   America, of course, says it would like Khatami's supporters to
win _ although I am not sure this is true because America likes
dictatorships in the Middle East and, with one exception, fears
real democracy in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, as usual, the world is being presented with a
partial, skewed version of events here.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where this Persian tale becomes opaque. For look at
some of the men who now say they are supporting Khatami, who are
now calling themselves ``reformers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani, Mohtashemi, Karroubi: the list is endless, all men
from the past, a few of them _ Mohtashemi comes to mind _ with
blood on their hands and a number of ``pro-Khatamists'' (not,
mercifully, candidates) with blood all over them.
</P>
<P>
   Why, wasn't that friendly Ayatollah Khalkhali advocating reform
this month the very same Ayatollah Khalkhali whom I interviewed in
Qom all of 20 years ago, after he had hanged men like thrushes in
Evin Prison, including a 14-year-old old boy for whom, he said, he
had no conscience because he had ``sent him to heaven?''
</P>
<P>
   And what of those stories now moving through the bazaars? In the
decade up to 1998, so they say, up to 100 dissidents were
``disappeared'' in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Gangi, probably the finest Iranian investigative
journalist _ there are precious few around _ is demanding a truth
commission to find out who ordered their murders.
</P>
<P>
   How high did their death warrant go? Wasn't Ali Akbar Mohtashemi
an interior minister after the revolution? Wasn't Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani the president when all those men were put to death?
</P>
<P>
   And isn't that the same Rafsanjani who is now a pro-Khatami
``reformist,'' aching, no doubt, to become speaker of the new
pro-Khatami parliament?
</P>
<P>
   So what is this new parliament going to look like? It may call
itself ``reformist'' but _ like a cup of tea that is steadily mixed
with coffee _ it may not taste like tea when it is drunk. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I put this point to the men waiting to vote outside the mosque
in the Seyed Khandan district. Wasn't there a danger, I asked, that
the parliament's 290 members would look rather similar to the
gentlemen who filled the previous anti-Khatami assembly?
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't the ``reformist'' movement being diluted? Weren't there
one or two men who might be seeking to avoid retribution and keep
their profits by joining the winning team?
</P>
<P>
   One of the men told me to read a copy of Thursday's ``Asre
Azadegam'' which had listed all the ``bad events'' since the
revolution, and another said _ using the same words as a woman
candidate I had met earlier _ that ``there was a kind of change in
these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some had admitted their mistakes, he said. And no one had to
vote for them. Had not one ``reformist'' party refused to put
Rafsanjani on their list because he was not ``Shafafiyat'' _ a
lovely new Iranian word that means ``straight-talking?''
</P>
<P>
   A publisher of political works and modern Iranian literature,
this bespectacled voter _ note that they haven't yet reached the
point of wanting their names printed _ insisted kindly that the
``men of the past'' had changed their attitude towards society.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference from the first period of the
revolution,'' he said. ``These men have learned to pay attention to
what we say and what we want.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its initial stage, our revolution was like the French and
Russian revolutions. At first they thought they had to be radical
but little by little they understood that radicalism isn't good in
any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Such trust he reposed in the men he was electing, such
simplicity. But it was moving all the same. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People laugh in Tehran again now. Their jokes have become
powerful, daring.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pro-Khatami parties has a slogan _ ``Ei Iran, Ei
marze, pourgohar'' _ which means ``Oh Iran, the precious
homeland.'' Note the lack of the world ``Islamic.'' And note _ much
more to the point _ that this was the title of a popular song
during the reign of the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Was this really the same Tehran I remember 21 years ago? The
same people? The same proud, stubborn, brave, single-minded race
that walked in their tens of thousands into the Shah's guns?
</P>
<P>
   I watched that extraordinary revolution and the world seemed to
have changed. America was no longer able to maintain its power
throughout the Middle East. A dynasty had been swept away in
Robespierre blood and fury. But Friday, instead of shouting ``Death
to America,'' they queued for hours to vote for a new, gentler
revolution that would belong to them.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could share all their faith but like all Persian tales,
I think this needs a familiar sign off: To Be Continued. &QL;

RHETORIC, BUDGET PRIORITIES ARE AN UNEVEN MATCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two days before Christmas, several senior Clinton
administration officials gathered in the office of National
Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger to discuss an unusual idea for
the Colombian drug-fighting package.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Budget and Management suggested taking $100
million from the $1.3 billion in Colombian aid and earmarking it
toward treatment of US addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Around the room, almost everyone said no. But OMB officials
persisted, believing that the $100 million might boost chances of
the bill's passage as well as give a rare opportunity to put extra
money into treatment for US addicts. They wanted the input of Barry
R. McCaffrey, the US drug czar.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, McCaffrey turned them down, too.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, he said the $100 million wouldn't
help pass the Colombian aid package.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is silly. It's minor politics,'' McCaffrey
said. ``This is the Andean ridge program. We are going to have
intellectual clarity and integrity in what we are doing. This isn't
a puck we are slapping around. I want them (Congress) to look at
this and examine it on its own merits . . . and not throw
sweeteners in there.''
</P>
<P>
   But for advocates of more treatment, McCaffrey's decision once
again underscored the gap between his rhetoric and his budget
priorities. While McCaffrey has eloquently and forcefully called
for more money for drug treatment, advocates say it is telling that
a plan for substantial new dollars for treatment came from outside
the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McCaffrey's major focus domestically in the drug war
has been on prevention, including an unprecedented $1 billion
five-year media campaign that places in-your-face antidrug ads on
prime time television. Recent disclosures that his office reviewed
TV scripts as a way of vetting messages on drugs drew widespread
criticism, but McCaffrey has since taken the offensive, saying his
office didn't censor any script and that fighting for antidrug
themes is what his job is supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from the days of ``Just Say No,'' the Nancy
Reagan-embraced abstinance theory that had such little impact on
hard-core addicts. But under McCaffrey, there have been many
changes in the drug policy office, including a huge funding
increase.
</P>
<P>
   In four years, his budget has gone from $13 billion to a
proposed $19.2 billion next year. While treatment dollars have
increased by 26 percent over that time, the share of the overall
budget devoted to treatment has decreased slightly, to 18 percent
from 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when President Nixon declared war on drugs in 1971
he put two-thirds of his funding into treatment. The results were
dramatic. Between 1971 and 1973, national crime rates dropped, the
number of drug-related arrests fell, the number of federal inmates
decreased, and record numbers of addicts sought and received
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the war on drugs has shifted to punishing offenders,
border surveillance, and fighting production at the source
countries.
</P>
<P>
   With 50 federal agencies controlling parts of the drug budget,
the drug czar has few chances to alter the funding equation.
</P>
<P>
   In rare cases, his office receives discretionary funds. After
taking office in 1996 and pledging to ``focus as a priority . . .
reducing consumption'' among hard-core users, McCaffrey received
$250 million in reallocated Pentagon funds. His decision at that
time was to put $202 million of it into interdiction efforts in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he extols the virtues of comprehensive solutions,
however, he stops short of calling for treatment for all addicts
who want it _ an unsuccessful initiative attempted by his
predecessor, Lee Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCaffrey wants some odd number of (Blackhawk) helicopters in
Colombia, but that has nothing to do with what we are doing here,''
said Michael J. Kineavy, director of Boston's employee assistance
programs in the Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Services. ``There's
a huge disconnect from what I see in the streets and what is
happening in Washington. One of the key issues for us is treatment
on demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't back treatment on demand, McCaffrey said,
``We have. We are. We're doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Facts show otherwise. Federal figures indicate that only 2.1
million of the nation's 5.7 million addicts received treatment in
1997.

<P>
   TEHRAN _ This is a Persian tale, of hope and love and
generosity. It is also, like all Persian stories, not as simple as
it seems; a trifle opaque perhaps, elliptical, full of heroes who
might not all really be heroes. And it may yet prove to have an
unhappy, tragic ending.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, like the French Revolution and the Russian
Revolution, the Iranian Revolution finally fell under the control
of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Could any election have been more historic in the Middle East,
that dark terrain of dictatorships and torture chambers and secret
policemen? Could any people have broken free of their chains more
gently, more elegantly, and with so much trust?
</P>
<P>
   How else could one interpret the tens of thousands who queued
for hours outside the Husseiniya Ershad mosque _ in which Dr.
Shariati and his friends once protested the Shah's autocratic rule
_ to vote for the friends and supporters of the man they all
adored, President Mohamed Khatami?
</P>
<P>
   And when I talked to them, they all spoke of integrity and
democracy and the mistakes of the past, the men in their jeans and
cheap coats, the women in their ``Hejab'' covering, showing
infinite courtesy to the foreigner who had come to ask his usual
blundering, foolish questions.
</P>
<P>
   I even asked Hojatolislam Seyed Abdulwahed Moussavi Lari, the
Iranian interior minister watching the voters fill in their forms
in the mosque, what historians would write about the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will say...that the people came to vote because they
wanted freedom and to determine their own destiny,'' he announced.
</P>
<P>
   The West has always consistently and willfully misunderstood
Iran and we were at it again Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government and, of course, the American press and CNN
and all the usual suspects were billing the elections as a crucial
struggle between ``reformers'' and ``hard-liners,'' the poll which
could give President Khatami, elected with 70 percent of the vote
last May, a parliament that would at last break the power of the
``conservatives,'' the ``radicals,'' the ``extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   America, of course, says it would like Khatami's supporters to
win _ although I am not sure this is true because America likes
dictatorships in the Middle East and, with one exception, fears
real democracy in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, as usual, the world is being presented with a
partial, skewed version of events here.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where this Persian tale becomes opaque. For look at
some of the men who now say they are supporting Khatami, who are
now calling themselves ``reformers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani, Mohtashemi, Karroubi: the list is endless, all men
from the past, a few of them _ Mohtashemi comes to mind _ with
blood on their hands and a number of ``pro-Khatamists'' (not,
mercifully, candidates) with blood all over them.
</P>
<P>
   Why, wasn't that friendly Ayatollah Khalkhali advocating reform
this month the very same Ayatollah Khalkhali whom I interviewed in
Qom all of 20 years ago, after he had hanged men like thrushes in
Evin Prison, including a 14-year-old old boy for whom, he said, he
had no conscience because he had ``sent him to heaven?''
</P>
<P>
   And what of those stories now moving through the bazaars? In the
decade up to 1998, so they say, up to 100 dissidents were
``disappeared'' in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Gangi, probably the finest Iranian investigative
journalist _ there are precious few around _ is demanding a truth
commission to find out who ordered their murders.
</P>
<P>
   How high did their death warrant go? Wasn't Ali Akbar Mohtashemi
an interior minister after the revolution? Wasn't Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani the president when all those men were put to death?
</P>
<P>
   And isn't that the same Rafsanjani who is now a pro-Khatami
``reformist,'' aching, no doubt, to become speaker of the new
pro-Khatami parliament?
</P>
<P>
   So what is this new parliament going to look like? It may call
itself ``reformist'' but _ like a cup of tea that is steadily mixed
with coffee _ it may not ike tea when it is drunk. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I put this point to the men waiting to vote outside the mosque
in the Seyed Khandan district. Wasn't there a danger, I asked, that
the parliament's 290 members would look rather similar to the
gentlemen who filled the previous anti-Khatami assembly?
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't the ``reformist'' movement being diluted? Weren't there
one or two men who might be seeking to avoid retribution and keep
their profits by joining the winning team?
</P>
<P>
   One of the men told me to read a copy of Thursday's ``Asre
Azadegam'' which had listed all the ``bad events'' since the
revolution, and another said _ using the same words as a woman
candidate I had met earlier _ that ``there was a kind of change in
these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some had admitted their mistakes, he said. And no one had to
vote for them. Had not one ``reformist'' party refused to put
Rafsanjani on their list because he was not ``Shafafiyat'' _ a
lovely new Iranian word that means ``straight-talking?''
</P>
<P>
   A publisher of political works and modern Iranian literature,
this bespectacled voter _ note that they haven't yet reached the
point of wanting their names printed _ insisted kindly that the
``men of the past'' had changed their attitude towards society.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference from the first period of the
revolution,'' he said. ``These men have learned to pay attention to
what we say and what we want.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its initial stage, our revolution was like the French and
Russian revolutions. At first they thought they had to be radical
but little by little they understood that radicalism isn't good in
any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Such trust he reposed in the men he was electing, such
simplicity. But it was moving all the same. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People laugh in Tehran again now. Their jokes have become
powerful, daring.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pro-Khatami parties has a slogan _ ``Ei Iran, Ei
marze, pourgohar'' _ which means ``Oh Iran, the precious
homeland.'' Note the lack of the world ``Islamic.'' And note _ much
more to the point _ that this was the title of a popular song
during the reign of the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Was this really the same Tehran I remember 21 years ago? The
same people? The same proud, stubborn, brave, single-minded race
that walked in their tens of thousands into the Shah's guns?
</P>
<P>
   I watched that extraordinary revolution and the world seemed to
have changed. America was no longer able to maintain its power
throughout the Middle East. A dynasty had been swept away in
Robespierre blood and fury. But Friday, instead of shouting ``Death
to America,'' they queued for hours to vote for a new, gentler
revolution that would belong to them.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could share all their faith but like all Persian tales,
I think this needs a familiar sign off: To Be Continued. &QL;

   CHIBUTO, MOZAMBIQUE _ Four days ago in Washington, U.S.
President Bill Clinton proclaimed Mozambique the world's
fastest-growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Tiago Chauque, 35, was up a tree, saving
himself, but none of his hard-earned belongings, from the country's
worst floods in living memory.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he was probably out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work in a South African gold mine. They dismiss you if you
don't turn up for work. I have a wife and five children to
support,'' he said as he waited, stranded, at Chibuto, 150 km (100
miles) northeast of the capital, Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   Here, a patch of grass large enough to land a plane protrudes
from an endless landscape of sand-colored flood water which has cut
the former Portuguese colony in two. But there were no planes
Tuesday for Chauque or the 50 others who had made it to the
airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   A French air force transporter brought emergency rations and
jerry cans but left without any flood refugees.
</P>
<P>
   For all President Clinton's fine words, an African economic
dream _ which enjoyed three successive years of GDP growth
exceeding 10 percent less than a decade after the end of a 16-year
civil war _ has been washed away.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse, say meteorologists. Cyclone Eline, 60
km (37 miles) wide and bearing winds of up to 260 kph (160 mph),
hit the coast Tuesday considerably north of the already flooded
Gaza province, where some 70,000 people have lost their homes,
crops and livestock.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Alain Dupleix, a French air force navigator working in
the disaster zone, a second ``intense tropical cyclone'' _ the
highest rating possible _ is on its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyclone Felicia is three days from Reunion Island and could be
here in a week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Chibuto, everyone knows the disaster is not over. ``The
Limpopo, the Elephant River and all their tributaries have burst
their banks because of rain which did not even come with cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know more rain is coming and the dams in Zimbabwe and South
Africa are overflowing,'' said Donato Salomao Mate, a local
councillor. ``As soon as one of the dams opens its walls, we will
be climbing the trees again. It is only a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Salomao Mate has found shelter for 6,000 people in churches and
municipal buildings near Chibuto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic consequences are dire. We grow maize, beans,
groundnuts and casava here. The harvest was just about to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maputo, at the World Food Program's coordination center,
Inyene Udoyen said helicopter pilots had seen feats of survival
befitting this miracle economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are taking sheets of roofing into the trees and
doing their cooking in the treetops while they wait to be
airlifted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The international community has been quick to react because,
according to the French ambassador, Bernadette Lefort, ``the
Mozambicans are very resourceful and efficient, even if they lack
the transport.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain has pledged aid; Italy has sent rubber dinghies; France
has sent a Transall and 11 crew; Spain has sent a planeload of food
and tents; and South Africa is engaged in a massive helicopter
rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the impact of the floods, the as-yet unknown damage
that will be caused by Eline _ which was Tuesday tearing roofs off
in Inhambane and Sofala provinces as it moved west _ and the future
possible ravages of Cyclone Felicia have devastated the country's
morale.
</P>
<P>
   No one has started counting the material cost yet, but it will
be extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. warns that well-buried landmines from the war that
ended in 1992 will rise to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism developments built in the past five years _ and which
offered the promise that Mozambique would become a top destination
_ have been swept into the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Lefort said: ``Nobody dares even start counting yet.
As an example, a sugar mill, into which French, German, Portuguese
and South African investors ploughed $20 million (pounds
sterling12.5 million), has just gone. I hate to think what the
international investors are making of this.'' &QL;

<P>
   TEHRAN _ The overwhelming victory of President Mohamed Khatami's
democratic ``reformists'' in the new Iranian parliament is already
being portrayed by Washington as a ``hopeful sign for the West.''
But the new Iran emerging from last week's poll is likely to
diminish rather than increase American influence in the region...
In Tehran, they are recalling once again the era of Mohamed
Mossadeq, freely elected but swiftly overthrown in 1953 by a coup
d'etat funded by the CIA and British intelligence. &QL;

   LONDON _ Eight months later, opponents of NATO's war in Kosovo
could not have imagined more bitter vindication of their dire
warnings than events in the city of Mitrovica, where Serbs and
Albanians confront each other, kept apart only by the Ibar River
and the increasingly desperate efforts of the overwhelmed NATO-led
peacekeeping force. There is plenty of fault to go around but at
the heart of the matter, Mitrovica reflects the ambiguities and
confusions that still dog the entire Kosovo enterprise. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two men hardly know each other, but the gods
could have put them on parallel paths. They were born a year apart
at the start of World War II, both from middle-class Massachusetts
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, they built remarkably successful careers in
public roles. In 1996, both resigned for new challenges in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Now, their paths cross for the first time, on an issue taking
place some 2,500 miles from their birthplaces _ the Clinton's
administration's $1.6 billion plan to fight the drug crisis in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   They are Barry R. McCaffrey, the drug czar from Taunton, Mass.,
and William D. Delahunt, the congressman from Quincy, Mass. They
are two Roman Catholic Irishmen, each with a head of snow-white
hair, a healthy-sized ego, and the stamina of a person half their
age.
</P>
<P>
   Each believes he knows best how to tackle the exploding drug
business in the most troubled country in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Each believes the other is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to today's war on drugs, where the epicenter isn't in
the humid fields of coca in Colombia or the dens and living rooms
of drug users in any American city or town. It's here in the
nation's capital, and it is unfolding in faceoffs between people
like McCaffrey and Delahunt; cigar-smoking Colombia generals and
gutsy human rights investigators; shiny-shoed lobbyists and
placard-waving protesters warning of an endless war, perhaps
another Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has begun hearings. The administration and the
Republican congressional leadership both are pushing for a deal
soon, an uneasy alliance but one that enhances chances of passage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are no guarantees on the outcome, expected in the
next six weeks, nor even on the makeup of an emergency aid package.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is arguably America's most daring gambit in its nearly
three-decade-old war on drugs, a potential alliance with a military
that not long ago had been widely discredited due to human rights
abuses and a fight that some fear could somehow evolve into
something much larger than a US support role.
</P>
<P>
   That observation comes from retired Lieutenant General William
J. McCaffrey, 85, an English High graduate, former inspector
general of the Army, and father of the drug czar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all sorts of hazards ahead on this one,'' the elder
McCaffrey said one day last week in his Alexandria,Va., home.
``Everyone needs a little wisdom now as you're working your way
through the minefields.''
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on who will be doing the navigating _ his son or
Delahunt.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, 57, the youngest four-star general in US
history, a man who served four tours of combat duty, has seized the
lead role in selling the administration plan that bears hallmarks
of a military strategist. His idea is to give the Colombian
military enough airlift capability to support three US-trained
antidrug battalions in a push into the heartland of drug
cultivation, the guerrilla-controlled Putamayo and Caqueta regions
south of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt, 58, the Norfolk County district attorney for 21 years
who made his mark with the innovative ways he handled domestic
abuse and civil rights cases, has assumed the role of the
anti-McCaffrey, one of the leading behind-the-scenes organizers of
Democrats and moderate Republicans who oppose a military solution.
His idea is to send a blitz of diplomats to push the peace process
between the government and the guerrillas, put more money toward
new crops and a better judicial system, and spend much more
antidrug money on treatment of addicts at home.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how each man arrived at his position offers a
telling glance into the force of their character. And it indicates
how the complex situation in Colombia can inspire divergent
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt, the son of an office secretary and a sales manager for
US Rubber Co., has always wanted to see things for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his election to Congress in 1996, he readily
accepted an invitation from Representative John Conyers Jr., the
18-term Michigan Democrat, to accompany him on a trip to Haiti. The
visit inspired Delahunt. He took an interest in other international
issues, focusing in particular on Venezuela and Colombia _ in part,
he says, because he saw long-term economic opportunities for local
companies in both places.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia fascinated him for another reason closer to home: As a
prosecutor he had helped send hundreds, if not thousands, of people
to jail on drug charges. Now he had a chance to explore the drug
problem at its root.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 21 years of seeing people destroy themselves and destroy
those around them, it really makes this more personal for me than
for others,'' he said in a recent interview. ``I've seen the
abuser, I've seen families, I've seen friends, I've seen victims of
the abusers. It's such a human story, not just about dollars and
cents.''
</P>
<P>
   He first traveled to Colombia early last year, and has returned
twice since, including one risky visit deep into territory
controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the main
guerrilla group known as the FARC. To date, he has been the only US
congressman to meet with them.
</P>
<P>
   For Delahunt, the first two trips convinced him that the
solution in the drug war didn't rest solely with a military push.
The country was too big, he believed, and the guerrillas too
well-financed and equipped as a result of the taxes they levy on
the drug trade. A solution, he thought, could come only as a result
of a deal ending the nearly 40 years of civil war. But how could
the United States help facilitate a deal?
</P>
<P>
   That was on his mind last month when he traveled to Colombia for
a third time and spent a day in the heart of the southern
coca-producing region. On a flight from Bogota over the
snow-covered Andes Mountains, Delahunt peppered a US embassy
official with questions about the dangers to Americans in the war
on drugs. Between 100 to 200 US military officials are in Colombia
each day, US administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a plane shot up yesterday full of holes,'' said the
official, who asked not to be identified, referring to an OV-10
aircraft used to spray pesticides on illicit crops. ``We take fire
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The official described the routinely risky missions for US and
Colombian officers in which they randomly check coca or poppy
fields after spraying them. ``We go in with several helicopters. We
pick out a field, and 50 Colombian jungle commandos go first and
secure the border and all four corners. We then go down and take
samples and rate the damage. A gunship is flying low overhead in
case guerrillas come near, and then we get the hell out of there,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have anywhere near enough assets to fight this war?''
Delahunt asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' the official said. ``Not even close.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt's plane landed at the Larandia military base, near the
southern town of Florenzia. There, Colombian military officers
briefed him on fumigation, coca production, new types of coca
imported from Peru, and the profile of the typical coca farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who owns these large tracts of coca fields?'' Delahunt asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are squatters, growing coca on state land,'' said
General Ismael Trujillo, Colombia's antinarcotics director.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those who grow coca on their own land, the
congressman asked. ``Sanctions may have an effect on them,''
Delahunt said.

   LONDON _ Eight months later, opponents of NATO's war in Kosovo
could not have imagined more bitter vindication of their dire
warnings than events in the city of Mitrovica, where Serbs and
Albanians confront each other, kept apart only by the Ibar River
and the increasingly desperate efforts of the overwhelmed NATO-led
peacekeeping force. There is plenty of fault to go around but at
the heart of the matter, Mitrovica reflects the ambiguities and
confusions that still dog the entire Kosovo enterprise. &QL;

   JERUSALEM _ Sticks, stones _ and, for that matter, bullets and
bombs _ can break your bones. Could this be why two sworn political
enemies in Israel shifted their battle to cyberspace?
</P>
<P>
   A cyber war has been waged on the Internet between the far-right
settlers' movement, who believe that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is determined to betray his nation by making peace with the
Arabs, and the left, who see him as a hard-liner intent on stealing
more land from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the right-wingers launched an Web site in which
users could play at assassinating Barak, and several others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunt the Judenrat members (a reference to the Jewish
collaborators during the Holocaust) and prevent them from turning
Israel over to the Nazis from the PLO,'' said the graphic. Barak's
face then appeared on screen to be shot into pieces with one click
of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the opposite cyber corner stands Gush Shalom, a left-wing
pressure group made up of Jews and Palestinians, which has long
demanded Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   It has been bombarded with threatening e-mails after pioneering
a Web site in which Jewish settlers' homes _ which, in reality, are
dotted strategically across the West Bank in growing numbers _ rain
down from the heavens on to Arab land.
</P>
<P>
   In what amounts to the ultimate Palestinian fantasy, players can
rub them out.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much speculation about who is behind the
right-wing site, although there is little doubt it is aligned with
the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper said it was listed under the name of
the wife of an American millionaire, one of the leading donors to
Israel's radical right.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the site was shut down by its operators Tuesday
on the basis that it incited violence. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   With a knock on his apartment door, Jorge felt salvation was at
hand. A friend appeared bearing gifts: two $10 bags of heroin.
</P>
<P>
   After the friend left the Boston apartment, Jorge put four small
white rocks onto a spoon, dissolving the drug in a quarter-teaspoon
of water. With his needle, he drew in the liquid heroin. And then
he picked up a belt and wrapped it around his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   With his left hand, he took the loaded needle and gently pricked
the soft underside of his arm until he found one of his shriveled
veins. He emptied the narcotic into his blood. The belt fell,
unfurling like a snake at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd thank God for this,'' said Jorge, after a long silence
during a cold afternoon this month. ``But I don't know if it's him
I should thank. Should I thank God to bring me something evil? I
can't thank God. Should I thank the devil?''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the power of drugs that users embrace the devil on the
wings of a high. For a high, they would risk custody of their
children, sell their daughters' bodies, and steal from the mother
who gives them refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Drug culture has existed as long as human civilization. In
21st-century America, despite falling crime rates and reports that
indicate a leveling off of first-time drug use among the young,
there are still 5.7 million known drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems that the drug problem has been receding, that is
largely percepton. The drug problem has shifted away from the
sleek, white-collar culture of recreational cocaine users in the
mid-1980s to today's legion of hard-core addicts in the underclass,
where addiction compounds endemic poverty, despair, and violence.
</P>
<P>
   In just two years, from 1995 to 1997, the number of Americans
with severe drug addictions jumped 23 percent. This group cost
American society $110 billion a year, a figure compiled by federal
researchers that accounts for drug-related diseases, traffic
accidents, and lost productivity on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Congress is considering a Clinton administration plan that
would open a new, and some say, perilous front in the drug war in
hopes of making drugs less available to Jorge and other addicts _ a
$1.6 billion, two-year package that relies heavily on military
force to attack the source of coca and opium poppies in Colombia,
which produces 85 percent of America's cocaine and 65 percent of
its heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Congress began holding hearings on an ambitious
proposal to give Colombia 30 UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters to deploy
drug-suppression troops into remote areas of that country and
state-of-the-art APS 145 radar to interdict drug shipments leaving
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians who live around coca and poppy fields warn that even
if US-backed forces poison hundreds of thousands of acres and burn
drug labs to the jungle floor the demand for drugs from the United
States will ensure that the $500-billion-a-year global industry
finds a new foothold elsewhere along the Andean spine.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers and addicts contend that the best way to attack
demand is by devoting more money to treatment, just as President
Nixon did on June 17, 1971, when he declared drug abuse ``public
enemy No. 1 in the United States.'' He earmarked two-thirds of new
antidrug funding to treatment. Since the early 1980s, however,
treatment has accounted for less than a third of federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's drug budget remains at that level,
with the vast majority of the money aimed at stopping the supply of
drugs and only a small portion going to help wean people like Jorge
off them. Barry R. McCaffrey, White House drug czar and a former
general who commanded the infantry division that led the ``left
hook'' attack on Iraqi forces in Operation Desert Storm, contends
that a robust effort to knock out drugs at the source will help
save the lives of American youths.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's first drug czar believes antidrug missions in
Colombia will do little to change balance of the drug war. ``We
have a phenomenally large border, and as long as demand is there,
and as long as people in other countries have economic situations
that make trafficking attractive, you are going to have drug
trafficking,'' said Jerome H. Jaffe, whom Nixon hired to head his
drug-fighting efforts. ``That is something that is an absolute
reality. To do anything, you have to bring down demand.''
</P>
<P>
   And fighting demand means fighting drug use on a
person-by-person basis. Antidrug work is a tedious daily campaign
of encouragement, tough love, and therapy that is different for
every addict. A year in recovery does it for some, a decade for
others. For still others, it never works. The drugs win.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   If you step into Brianne Fitzgerald's size-8 1/2 red-and-black
Arche boots for a few days, the first thing that you'll realize is
that her patient list of drug addicts is made up of people in great
pain who are crying out for help _ and have been for years,
sometimes decades.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Fitzgerald is a nurse, a South Boston resident
who lived for years in the western suburbs, a divorced mother of
four children, including three sons who play fullback on three
different football teams (Boston College, Northeastern University,
and the New York Giants) and a daughter who trains for marathons in
her off hours on the hills of San Francisco. They comprise a
determined family, but perhaps none more determined than Brianne.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in Newton, Mass., the oldest of eight children. Her
father was an alcoholic. He worked as a bookkeeper for Texaco. Her
mother held jobs as a nurse and fashion model. ``I became a
caretaker very early on,'' Fitzgerald said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   She married at 21 and almost immediately began having children,
eventually settling into a comfortable life in Wellesley. But she
wanted something more, and at 33, she answered a newspaper ad for a
job in a ``clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be an inner-city methadone clinic for heroin
addicts. She got the position. Soon she was spending her mornings
pouring methadone into cups for a line of addicts whose last names
began with the letters A to L and her late afternoons preparing
dinner for six in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I did before going to work was take off my
diamond ring,'' she said, her hands still ringless.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, spanning a divorce and a move into the city, she
stuck with her work with addicts, attracted by the stark difference
from her early upbringing, lured by ``living on the edge a little
bit,'' and buffeted by the knowledge that she could make a
difference in some people's lives. Not all. But some.
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, she drove her 1998 blue Toyota Corolla to East
Boston to see a patient. Fitzgerald works for Neighborhood Health
Plan, an HMO that has made the determination that the most
effective _ and cost-efficient _ care for high-risk patients is to
send nurse practitioners on home visits.
</P>
<P>
   On Meridian Street in East Boston, Fitzgerald parked and walked
up a flight of stairs in an apartment building to visit Diane
Amaral, 42, a recovering heroin and cocaine addict, who had lost
custody of her four children years ago because of her addiction.
</P>
<P>
   As Fitzgerald carried her heavy black Bottega Venetta bag over
her shoulder and a Zip-lock bag containing four homemade double
chocolate chip cookies in her hand, Amaral started shouting from
above.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just cracking up in here!'' she said, as Fitzgerald walked
into her apartment, closed the door, and handed over the cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Amaral ignored her. ``I'm beat up,'' she said, pacing in her
kitchen. ``I'm tired. Maybe I should just die. At least I would die
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to go to the hospital?'' Fitzgerald asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No! No! I just want something for my pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaral's hands hurt so much that she was sleeping only a few
hours a night. She was not sure why they hurt but the pain was
unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will try to help you,'' Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Amaral shouted for another 10 minutes and put her face in her
hands. ``My head, my head,'' she said, weeping.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald had to leave. She set up an appointment for Amaral at
Lemuel Shattuck Hospital in Boston; perhaps a doctor would
prescribe something for her pain. As Fitzgerald left, Amaral ran
after her, mumbling apologies, and handed her a small present, a
honeysuckle mist-scented drawer sachet from Victoria's Secret.
``Thank you, Brianne, thank you,'' Amaral said in a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   In her car, Fitzgerald looked weary. ``Where do you begin?'' she
asked. ``You'd think I'd be burned out, too. I grew up in an
alcoholic family, so I'm no stranger to helping addicts. I learned
the hard way in this job, though. When you work harder than the
addicts, you get real disappointed because then they don't get
clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mobile phone rang. It was a former patient, an ex-heroin
junkie named Walter Applegate. They set a lunch date at a deli in
South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after she arrived, Applegate walked in, the picture of
health. Baby blue eyes. A barrel chest that filled his sweatshirt.
``I lift weights four times a week,'' he said. ``I weighed 105
pounds when I was doing heroin. Now I'm 190.''
</P>
<P>
   By his estimate, he was in and out of 70 treatment centers
during the 15 years he was an addict, and six of those years were
spent in prison. Now a plumber, he said he finally got sober on
Labor Day 1995. ``It was the consequences,'' he said. ``I just
didn't like losing my home, my boy, my family.'' He hasn't seen his
15-year-old son in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was using, it came down to seeing my son or getting
high. I would rather get high,'' he said matter-of-factly, his
strong hands gripping a steak sandwich. ``I know as long as I stay
sober, I'm going to see him again. I know I can be a good father.''
</P>
<P>
   He kept shifting in his seat as he spoke, eyes darting around
the restaurant. He seemed on edge. ``You OK?'' Fitzgerald asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, yeah, yeah,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't so sure. How could she be? Over time, she has learned
not to trust quick assurances.

   JERUSALEM _ Sticks, stones _ and, for that matter, bullets and
bombs _ can break your bones. Could this be why two sworn political
enemies in Israel shifted their battle to cyberspace?
</P>
<P>
   A cyber war has been waged on the Internet between the far-right
settlers' movement, who believe that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is determined to betray his nation by making peace with the
Arabs, and the left, who see him as a hard-liner intent on stealing
more land from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the right-wingers launched an Web site in which
users could play at assassinating Barak, and several others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunt the Judenrat members (a reference to the Jewish
collaborators during the Holocaust) and prevent them from turning
Israel over to the Nazis from the PLO,'' said the graphic. Barak's
face then appeared on screen to be shot into pieces with one click
of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the opposite cyber corner stands Gush Shalom, a left-wing
pressure group made up of Jews and Palestinians, which has long
demanded Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   It has been bombarded with threatening e-mails after pioneering
a Web site in which Jewish settlers' homes _ which, in realit
dotted strategically across the West Bank in growing numbers _ rain
down from the heavens on to Arab land.
</P>
<P>
   In what amounts to the ultimate Palestinian fantasy, players can
rub them out.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much speculation about who is behind the
right-wing site, although there is little doubt it is aligned with
the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper said it was listed under the name of
the wife of an American millionaire, one of the leading donors to
Israel's radical right.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the site was shut down by its operators Tuesday
on the basis that it incited violence. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Indian high-tech boom is one of the great under-publicized
stories of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   For many years the Indian subcontinent has produced talented
computer people who did, in general, head off to the developed
world to make their fortunes. Silicon Valley in California is
attracting upwards of 50,000 of them a year.
</P>
<P>
   True, there was an established software business in India,
located principally around Bangalore, but as recently as 1995
Indian software exports were only $300 million a year. This was
despite the fact that Indian programmers are paid less than half
the rate they would get in the U.S., and are of higher quality too.
</P>
<P>
   You can measure this by counting the errors made in lines of
code and apparently Indian programmers make only one-third as many
mistakes as their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, however, the Indian high-technology
sector has moved up a gear. Last year Indian software exports were
nearly $3 billion _ ten times the level of four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Four things account for this takeoff. Most obviously there is
the Internet, which has both increased demand for computer skills
and make people aware that they can buy such skills from anywhere
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It has also given a simple online delivery mechanism for
software, which in theory existed before but in practice has become
much easier. Expect this to grow as demand for the Internet booms
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003 it looks as though there will be more Internet users in
Asia than in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there was the Millennium Bug. Fixing it demanded vast
amounts of competent computer programming time. India could deliver
that in abundance and buyers have now discovered that the people
they thought they had brought in to fix problems could now help
them do much more than just that.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem proved a blessing, for it gave these people an
entree into companies that they would never have got into
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Third, there is the emergence of English as the default language
of the world. Other less developed countries can offer computer
skills, but frequently there is a language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Few can offer the combination of English and technical
competence. As a result it is not just programmers that are in
demand: India is becoming a call-center, handling the nighttime
calls for a number of U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   This night shift does not just apply to voice traffic. The
development of a true 24-hour world economy has created a demand
for a computer night-shift.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. computer workload can be passed at the end of the
working day to Indian operators who can carry on the software
development _ or simply fix problems _ before America wakes up. &QL;

REMOTE CHINESE REGION PRESERVES ANCIENT MUSIC

<P>
   LIJIANG, China _ Neglected by the central government for a
millennium, bypassed by explorers since Marco Polo, and ignored by
conquering armies since Kublai Khan, this isolated, forgotten
pocket of Yunnan province has reawakened like the Rip Van Winkle of
modern China.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 50 years ago, the 370-mile trek from the
provincial capital to this medieval town nestled high in the
mountains southeast of Tibet was an 11-day trek by horse caravan
and bus. It was a backbreaking trip to a destination dismissed by
generations of Chinese elites as a miserable outback. The first
airport was built only four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Untouched by the vicissitudes of fashion, war, or the passage of
time, the sounds of eighth-century music waft from the doorways of
ancient theaters. The strains of banjos, lutes, and guitars, heard
from centuries-old buildings, stands in stark contrast to the Top
40 Chinese pop blaring from modern shopping centers in most cities.
</P>
<P>
   Here, one can still sit any evening in the heart of the old town
and drift 1,200 years back in time, to an era when Dongjing music
was used by disciples of Confucius for meditation, and by Taoists
to accompany the chanting of scriptures. Set to poetry and liturgy,
Dongjing became the court music of the Tang Dynasty, an era widely
viewed as the golden age of Chinese culture, an artistic flowering
that shaped painting, music, and literature from Indochina to Japan
and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   So remote is this region that scholars believe the music didn't
arrive in Lijiang, home of a minority group known as the Naxi,
until the end of the 14th century, 600 years after Dongjing became
the fashion in the palaces of central China. It is thought to have
come with Chinese soldiers and their families who were resettled
here to guard against invaders from the west.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise in China, musical tastes evolved in the centuries that
followed, and by the 19th century Dongjing music had all but
disappeared _ as had many of the instruments used to play it.
</P>
<P>
   But in Lijiang, musicians preserved original scores from the
Tang Dynasty and continued to craft instruments that elsewhere had
been relegated to antique collections or garbage heaps.
</P>
<P>
   Lijiang was shaken out of its slumber, however, by China's
communist revolution in 1949. Musicians were ordered to stop
performing at religious ceremonies, and some were sent to
``reeducation'' camps. During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, even
secular ancient music was banned, its educated practioners
persecuted and forced to become farmers. Patriotic ballads replaced
old music, and the Tang Dynasty sounds were silenced.
</P>
<P>
   One victim of the radical campaigns was a pianist named Xuan Ke,
who served 21 years in prison and labor camps for his love of old
music and his provocative writings. When he was released in 1978
after two decades behind bars, Xuan asked himself what he would do
with the rest of his life. Western music would survive without him,
he reasoned, but the ancient melodies that floated from the alleys
during his youth in Lijiang would not.
</P>
<P>
   Xuan began tracking down the aged literati who had played for
the Taoist scripture associations. ``Many had been sent to the
mountains, because they were rich men _ landlords, businessmen,
officials. Many wernced to death, but fortunately some were
saved,'' Xuan recalled. He tried to persuade them to revive the old
music, but most were too afraid.
</P>
<P>
   Xuan finally found seven musicians willing to form an
underground orchestra. By 1981, they had 21 players.
</P>
<P>
   That they had instruments was something of a miracle. In other
parts of China, old instruments were destroyed by rampaging Red
Guards; here, musicians managed to hide bells and gongs in jars or
in the walls of their homes, and to bury ancient lutes, guitars,
and banjos in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, authorities refused to let the group play
for outsiders. One complaint was that the musicians were ``ugly and
toothless'' and would embarrass the city. But in 1986, the first
year Lijiang was opened to visitors, authorities grudgingly
recognized the Naxi Ancient Music Association as a cultural
treasure _ and a lucrative draw for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Today &LR; , the orchestra is struggling against a different threat,
trying to keep tradition alive despite the perpetual pressure in
contemporary China to hurtle into the modern age. Once denounced
for embodying the ``four olds'' _ old ideas, customs, culture, and
habits _ the group now boasts of its ``three olds'': old scores,
old instruments, and old musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the time when communist authorities wanted to stamp the
music out. But the years of suppression left a damaging legacy: Two
generations did not learn the art once passed from father to son. A
somber row of 23 black-rimmed portraits above the stage underlines
the biggest threat to the music today: the death every year of the
orchestra's elderly members.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seven of the players are over 80, and their faces reflect
the effort they must make to keep playing. Between numbers, Xuan, a
musicologist and irrepressible chatterbox, regales the audience
with the history of Dongjing music and tales of the troupe's
adventures performing as far away as Paris and Oslo. As he talks,
his white-bearded musicians nap in their chairs. Sun Ziming, a
hoary 90-year-old with bottle-thick glasses and a long, wispy
goatee, even sleeps while they play, but somehow he wakes in time
to strike his 10 miniature gongs.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent night, a rich red light bathed the orchestra in an
otherworldly glow. Clad in long silk brocade robes of sapphire,
maroon, and black, and seated on delicately carved antique chairs,
the musicians uttered a low chant to begin the Taoist scriptures.
The banging of a giant drum and the tinkle of ancient bronze bells
joined in, and finally, a full array of cymbals, flutes, zithers,
and even a priceless 400-year-old lute.
</P>
<P>
   Several songs had an undulating, rhythmic cadence reminiscent of
waves washing the shore; one had the sharp, high-pitched sound of a
knife scratching glass; another was like majestic thunder
announcing a storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This music may be difficult to listen to,'' Xuan warned an
audience of 100 Chinese tourists, ``but remember, it is
1,200-year-old music . . . frozen in time, like in a jar without
germs.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Xuan lamented, the ``germs'' that corrupt old art forms
are everywhere. Television, chain clothing stores, and karaoke bars
have come to Lijiang, and young people are more likely to sport
hip-hop fashions from Chinese cities than the old aprons still worn
by local grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our music faces an attack from society. Young people in China
are not interested in the classics. They like karaoke and pop,''
Xuan said derisively.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike so many old things in China that are on the verge of
extinction, the ancient music of Lijiang stands a chance. Xuan
founded a summer academy in 1997 that trains 130 teens a year.
Numerous locals have learned the music to cash in on its fame, and
seven copycat orchestras now perform in town.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the oldest member of the original orchestra is 90, but
the youngest is just 19 _ and female. The effort to breathe new
life into the old music has opened the door to women for the first
time in history.
</P>
<P>
   And with a row of black-haired beauties in traditional Naxi
costumes playing alongside a formidable collection of toothless
senior musicians, the prospects for the ancient music's survival
don't look so bad after all.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Indian high-tech boom is one of the great under-publicized
stories of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   For many years the Indian subcontinent has produced talented
computer people who did, in general, head off to the developed
world to make their fortunes. Silicon Valley in California is
attracting upwards of 50,000 of them a year.
</P>
<P>
   True, there was an established software business in India,
located principally around Bangalore, but as recently as 1995
Indian software exports were only $300 million a year. This was
despite the fact that Indian programmers are paid less than half
the rate they would get in the U.S., and are of higher quality too.
</P>
<P>
   You can measure this by counting the errors made in lines of
code and apparently Indian programmers make only one-third as many
mistakes as their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, however, the Indian high-technology
sector has moved up a gear. Last year Indian software exports were
nearly $3 billion _ ten times the level of four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Four things account for this takeoff. Most obviously there is
the Internet, which has both increased demand for computer skills
and make people aware that they can buy such skills from anywhere
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It has also given a simple online delivery mechanism for
software, which in theory existed before but in practice has become
much easier. Expect this to grow as demand for the Internet booms
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003 it looks as though there will be more Internet users in
Asia than in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there was the Millennium Bug. Fixing it demanded vast
amounts of competent computer programming time. India could deliver
that in abundance and buyers have now discovered that the people
they thought they had brought in to fix problems could now help
them do much more than just that.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem proved a blessing, for it gave these people an
entree into companies that they would never have got into
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Third, there is the emergence of English as the default language
of the world. Other less developed countries can offer computer
skills, but frequently there is a language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Few can offer the combination of English and technical
competence. As a result it is not just programmers that are in
demand: India is becoming a call-center, handling the nighttime
calls for a number of U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   This night shift does not just apply to voice traffic. The
development of a true 24-hour world economy has created a demand
for a computer night-shift.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. computer workload can be passed at the end of the
working day to Indian operators who can carry on the software
development _ or simply fix problems _ before America wakes up. &QL;

DEMOCRATS CLASH OVER LONG-AGO VOTES IN DEBATE IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY AND WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When former Senator Bill Bradley said during Monday night's
Harlem debate that Vice President Al Gore voted several times two
decades ago to preserve tax breaks for segregated private
academies, Gore labeled it a ``phony and scurrilous'' charge.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, the vice president said of one of those votes, in
1981, 336 other House members sided with him.
</P>
<P>
   This week, on Web sites, and via fax machines, the dispute
continues. But the record suggests that Bradley is mostly correct:
that Gore's votes, however well-intentioned and however much
company he had in making them, had the effect of preserving tax
exemptions for thousands of segregated private schools that had
sprung up in the wake of court-ordered public school desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore was on the offensive as well: Bradley, he said, was the
only Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee to vote in 1995 to
end a tax break designed to encourage minority ownership of radio
and television stations. Bradley conceded that he cast the vote,
but disputed Gore's inference that he opposes opportunities for
minority ownership of broadcast outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Neas, who was the executive director of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights from 1981 to 1995, says both candidates
have admirable voting records on civil rights issues. Gore's votes
that helped block an end to tax-exempt status for segregated
schools and Bradley's vote in 1995, Neas said, ``were inconsistent
with the excellent records both men compiled in Congress on civil
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The more serious charge of the two was Bradley's, made as part
of his effort to revitalize his campaign by drawing caustic
comparisons between Gore's liberal positions today and his
conservative congressional voting record on issues ranging from gun
control to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday night debate, at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, also
produced several other accusations and denials. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   --Bradley denied, in response to a question, that he had
advocated appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the
1996 campaign finance scandals. ``I did not propose a special
prosecutor,'' Bradley said during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   But only a day before, Bradley, during an appearance on ``ABC
This Week'' came very close to saying just that: ``I think that it
would be very important to get to the bottom of it. I think a
special prosecutor is one way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   --Gore insisted that Bradley had done nothing about ``racial
profiling'' in his home state of New Jersey. Tuesday, Governor
Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who lost the 1990 Senate race
to Bradley, wrote to Gore that Bradley ``did little, if anything at
all, to address the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean, also a Republican, said
in an interview it was ``totally unfair'' to criticize Bradley for
not taking earlier notice of police practices in his state. ``As a
US senator I don't understand how Bill Bradley could have had
anything to do with it at all,'' Kean said.
</P>
<P>
   --Gore charged that Bradley, before giving a major education
address earlier this month, ``went for 14 months without making a
speech on education policy per se.'' Bradley gave three education
speeches while touring Western Iowa on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious charge, though, was Bradley's accusation about
Gore's votes in 1979, 1980, and 1981, when Gore represented a
largely rural Tennessee district in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Those three years, the House and Senate, pushed by conservative
Republicans and a major lobbying campaign by the Christian Right,
amended Treasury Department spending bills to forbid the Internal
Revenue Service from stripping tax-exempt status from segregated
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the amendments drew the support of substantial majorities
because of concerns that rules the IRS proposed to identify and
penalize schools that were deliberately segregated might ensnare
institutions, including private parochial schools, that had done
nothing to avoid integration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides hammered at that point Tuesday, and at Bradley for
``distortion'' on the issue, by insisting that IRS rules would have
required admission quotas for black students that many private
schools could not possibly have met.
</P>
<P>
   But the IRS rules required no such quotas, according to Neas and
Jerome Kurtz, who was the IRS commissioner under President Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz said Gore is wrong on the issue, and that the massive
opposition to the rules _ 200,000 letters to the IRS alone, he said
_ was led by people ``who cast the proposed rules in the worst
light.'' The congressional votes, Kurtz said, tied the government's
hands until a 1983 Supreme Court decision, on an 8-1 vote, upheld
the right of the IRS to deny tax-exempt status to segregated
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The US Commission on Civil Rights, in a 1980 document, said the
congressional votes had the effect of encouraging segregated
private schools. By 1979, the commission estimated, 3,500 private
schools had been founded or had seen enrollments mushroom in
districts, predominantly in the South, where public schools had
been desegregated. Yet, despite federal law, just 110 lost
tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   The issue exploded when the IRS developed guidelines for
establishing evidence that private schools were intentionally
discriminating. ``This was a very serious problem, and the law was
crystal clear,'' Kurtz said, adding that in some Southern school
districts, including Birmingham, Ala., segregationists using
tax-exempt donations were establishing private school districts
within public districts.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined in public documents, and explained by Kurtz, the IRS
proposed to focus its attention on the new or high-growth private
schools in those districts with the so-called ``20 percent'' rule.
It provided that if such a school, for example, was located in an
area with a 30 percent minority population, then the IRS would look
into its tax-exempt status if less than 6 percent of its student
body was nonwhite.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz and Neas, in separate interviews, said that those
guidelines did not amount to quotas; and that any private school,
for instance, a Hebrew school in a black community, might offer a
legitimate reason for not meeting such numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religious right tried to turn it into a quota issue, and
it was not,'' Neas said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, (D-Mass.), who voted against
restricting the IRS action, said that Gore was wrong to vote the
way he did. ``At the time, Al represented a conservative district
in the South,'' Frank noted. ``Al should now be able to say, from
time to time, that this or that vote was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Frank, who is neutral in the race, said he doesn't
regard the issue as a ``vote that matters,'' and he suggested that
Bradley was wrong to make so much of it.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bradley made the same point about Gore's criticism of
Bradley's vote on the minority broadcast license issue.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Bradley's charges about his IRS votes, Gore
denounced Bradley's 1995 vote to repeal the tax break rewarding
sales of radio and television companies to minority-owned
businesses. Gore said Bradley had effectively ``voted against''
several well-known African-American media outlets and programs.
</P>
<P>
   The vote eliminating the provision was politically charged,
prompted by reports that the media giant Viacom Inc. stood to avoid
up to $600 million in taxes through the sale of its cable TV
systems to a partnership owned by an African-American businessman.
That news infuriated congressional Republicans, and many Democrats,
who felt Viacom was exploiting an affirmative-action provision
mainly for financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradley spokeswoman said Bradley's vote was not motivated by
the Viacom controversy, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``His belief was that there were better ways of helping minority
business owners than through the tax code,'' said campaign
spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke.
</P>
<P>
   The tax break was ultimately repealed in 1995 with little
congressional opposition. Although it was signed into law by
President Clinton, Gore said Monday he would seek to restore it.
</P>
<P>
   Frank expressed disappointment at the tone of the dialogue.
``The voters' expectations for perfection are lower than both of
them seem to think. Both of them are reluctant to admit past
error,'' Frank said.

<P>
   SEOUL _ The national police agency has devised what it believes
to be a sure-fire way to turn off demonstrations without firing the
peppery tear gas that once floated over the center of Seoul and
other large cities during the spring riot season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are placing women on the front line,'' Lee Moo Young,
commissioner-general of the agency, said Tuesday. ``There is no
need for tear gas. Maybe we'll see tear-gas bombs replaced by
makeup in our police stations.''
</P>
<P>
   While masks and shields remain the traditional garb of police
units rushed to potential trouble spots, Lee's aides said the units
were now often dispatched without the tear-gas canisters they once
carried.
</P>
<P>
   The large black armored cars laden with tear gas are now
confined to their garages, the police said. ``We did not use tear
gas once last year,'' Lee said. ``I am determined not to use tear
gas again.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason the police stopped firing tear-gas canisters, he
said, was that ``Molotov cocktails always follow'' _ a reference to
the wild clashes that used to occur each spring when radical
students and workers tossed bricks, stones and explosives to
protest government policies and big business.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions, readying for negotiations this spring, agreed that
the new approach to dealing with protest is to lower the level of
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've placed these female'' police officers on the front
lines, said Ahn Pong Sul, international director of the Federation
of Korean Trade Unions, which claims to have more than 500,000
members in many major industries. ``Of course, they are unarmed.
How can we attack females?''
</P>
<P>
   In a society in which women historically were relegated to
household chores, Lee promised that women in police uniforms will
become increasingly common sights _ not only at demonstrations but
everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   He said the national police agency, which now has only 1,764
policewomen among its 140,000 members, would hire an additional 600
women each year for the next three years _ and more later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are part of an eastern culture,'' he said, discussing the
role of women in the police, both here and in Japan. ``We have
shared the view that women are weak, but I completely disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Lee said, statistics showed that the number of
visitors to South Korea increased in direct correlation to the drop
in the use of tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, 210,000 tear-gas canisters were used in Korea, while
in 1997, 130,000 were used,'' he said. ``At that time the
credibility of Korea in foreign countries dropped to its lowest
point.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when only 3,400 tear-gas canisters were used, and last
year, when the police stopped using it altogether, South Korea
scored points in public relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While conservatives sometimes criticized the police as too
lenient, Lee said a poll had shown that four of every five Koreans
agreed ``we should not use tear gas.'' He added: ``I am very
confident that my policy will work.'' &QL;

&HT;     HOW FOX DEBASES MARRIAGE AND WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARGOT MAGOWAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I don't think television could shock me anymore.
But then, during sweeps week last week, I watched Fox's new hit,
``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' and realized modern
television had sunk to a new low.
</P>
<P>
   The show began with the introduction of 50 women, all competing
for the grand prize of marriage to a multimillionaire, their union
to be sealed with a $34,000 engagement ring.
</P>
<P>
   The women stepped into the klieg lights wearing everything from
bathing suits to wedding gowns, exposing their bodies to be rated
and judged. Meanwhile, Mr. Multimillionaire was safely shrouded in
a darkened booth. The whole scene brought to mind the voyeuristic
ambiance of a peep show.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the show's worst sequences, each finalist had 30
seconds to convince Mr. Multimillionaire that she was the one he
should choose. While guitar porn rock played in the background, the
women said things like, ``I know just how to please a man.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the show, Mr. Multimillionaire finally appeared in
a tux and chose his bride, the blondest and thinnest of them all.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned by this degradation and mockery of the marriage
ceremony. How can there be any presumption of honesty or integrity
in marriage vows when the groom takes them _ as Mr.
Multimillionaire did _ just moments after meeting his wife to be,
promising to love her until death?
</P>
<P>
   Are those elements that I thought were key to marriage _ vows
and love and commitment _ without real meaning?
</P>
<P>
   A wedding ceremony should be a sacred celebration, inspired by
devotion so powerful that those in love want to make a lifelong
commitment to each other publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the Fox network, marriage became a modern-day flesh
auction with women transformed into a commodity to be purchased by
a wealthy man.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not completely naive. I know that marriage was initially
created as a financial contract. I know that in Biblical times the
purpose of marriage was to control the means of reproduction, that
is, women.
</P>
<P>
   I know that when women had no social, political or financial
power, when they were not allowed to own property and were only
valued for how many children they could bear, marriage existed just
to ritualize the transfer of ownership of women from fathers to
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   I know that remnants of these ancient roles of womanhood are
still prevalent in marriage ceremonies, but I had thought they no
longer had significance.
</P>
<P>
   Though brides still traditionally wear white, the color has lost
its relevance as a symbol of virginal innocence, once so prized in
a woman. Few recall now, when the priest asks if anyone has just
cause why the marriage should not take place, that the question was
originally meant to determine if anyone had evidence that the bride
was, in fact, not a virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward a few thousand years to the debut of Fox's
top-rated show. After watching these women on TV, whose worth was
measured by how well they conformed to limited ideals of beauty,
while male worth was measured by wallet size, I was feeling pretty
cynical about gender roles and matrimony.
</P>
<P>
   Then something happened to restore my faith. The debate on
California's Proposition 22, the ballot initiative against gay
marriage, caught my attention.
</P>
<P>
   As supporters of the initiative condemned gay marriage for
defiling a holy institution, I thought of the irony. An elegantly
packaged prostitution ring on prime time television is perfectly
legal, yet two people in love who want to make a public and legal,
lifetime commitment to each other, with sincere vows, are forbidden
legal recognition of their marriage because they are of the same
sex.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' illustrates the
worst of marriage, defeating Proposition 22 would bring out the
best of it. Allowing gay people to marry shatters all of the
antiquated sex stereotypes that still threaten to be resurrected in
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   If marriage is to survive and thrive in this millennium, it
needs to evolve. The marriage contract is a living document. We
need to keep the best of it _ the love, the romance, the vows _ and
leave behind those elements that reduce human beings to property.
</P>
<P>
   If Californians really are concerned with family values, they
should be fighting for the right of people who truly love each
other to legalize their commitment.

<P>
   SEOUL _ The national police agency has devised what it believes
to be a sure-fire way to turn off demonstrations without firing the
peppery tear gas that once floated over the center of Seoul and
other large cities during the spring riot season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are placing women on the front line,'' Lee Moo Young,
commissioner-general of the agency, said Tuesday. ``There is no
need for tear gas. Maybe we'll see tear-gas bombs replaced by
makeup in our police stations.''
</P>
<P>
   While masks and shields remain the traditional garb of police
units rushed to potential trouble spots, Lee's aides said the units
were now often dispatched without the tear-gas canisters they once
carried.
</P>
<P>
   The large black armored cars laden with tear gas are now
confined to their garages, the police said. ``We did not use tear
gas once last year,'' Lee said. ``I am determined not to use tear
gas again.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason the police stopped firing tear-gas canisters, he
said, was that ``Molotov cocktails always follow'' _ a reference to
the wild clashes that used to occur each spring when radical
students and workers tossed bricks, stones and explosives to
protest government policies and big business.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions, readying for negotiations this spring, agreed that
the new approach to dealing with protest is to lower the level of
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've placed these female'' police officers on the front
lines, said Ahn Pong Sul, international director of the Federation
of Korean Trade Unions, which claims to have more than 500,000
members in many major industries. ``Of course, they are unarmed.
How can we attack females?''
</P>
<P>
   In a society in which women historically were relegated to
household chores, Lee promised that women in police uniforms will
become increasingly common sights _ not only at demonstrations but
everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   He said the national police agency, which now has only 1,764
policewomen among its 140,000 members, would hire an additional 600
women each year for the next three years _ and more later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are part of an eastern culture,'' he said, discussing the
role of women in the police, both here and in Japan. ``We have
shared the view that women are weak, but I completely disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Lee said, statistics showed that the number of
visitors to South Korea increased in direct correlation to the drop
in the use of tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, 210,000 tear-gas canisters were used in Korea, while
in 1997, 130,000 were used,'' he said. ``At that time the
credibility of Korea in foreign countries dropped to its lowest
point.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when only 3,400 tear-gas canisters were used, and last
year, when the police stopped using it altogether, South Korea
scored points in public relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While conservatives sometimes criticized the police as too
lenient, Lee said a poll had shown that four of every five Koreans
agreed ``we should not use tear gas.'' He added: ``I am very
confident that my policy will work.'' &QL;

&HT;     THE PERFECT PLACE TO PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ No one has to tell me that it is the height of
absurdity. On a rainy day when I am already late for work, I leave
my car at home because I have such a great parking spot.
</P>
<P>
   New York comedians used to make jokes about this kind of
behavior: People who never go out because they can't bear to lose
their parking place.
</P>
<P>
   Now the joke is in San Francisco, and it's on me.
</P>
<P>
   Before I bought my house, I told anyone who would listen that my
only absolute, no-compromise requirement for a home was a garage or
off-street driveway.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't care about a view, a fireplace, a deck, the size of the
bathroom or even the extent of the termite damage. But a parking
place was non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   So much for lines in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   My little house has no garage, no driveway and no realistic
potential for creating either of those things. (What did I expect
in this town for $275,000?) Worse, like thousands of San
Franciscans, my quiet, totally residential street offers fewer open
parking spaces every week. What was a tight situation almost two
years ago when I moved in, has become borderline desperate.
</P>
<P>
   As with the congested freeways and bridges of the entire Bay
Area _ one stall or fender bender wrecks traffic flow for miles and
hours _ one sloppily parked vehicle on my block negatively affects
every car on that street and the three nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in somebody's out-of-town guests in a camper or someone
else's dinner party for six, and you have Parking Hell. Throw in a
month of sewer work or even a day's filming of ``Nash Bridges,''
and you start thinking seriously about moving to Montana.
</P>
<P>
   You also start to entertain fantasies about doing major damage
to the vehicle of anyone who parks stupidly or selfishly or _ on
your street _ ignores the little white guidelines your neighbors
painted a few years ago on the curb.
</P>
<P>
   But, instead of taking a tire iron or hammer to an offending
car, most of us just write notes and stick them on the windshield.
Some of us write civilized notes that give the parking slob the
benefit of the doubt: Perhaps you didn't realize ... Please don't
do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Others assume the worst and blast the transgressor with vile
curses and nasty put-downs.
</P>
<P>
   In the big karmic picture, I suppose it matters which kind of
note you write. But when it is 10 p.m., you have groceries to
unload and a motorcycle is smack in the middle of a huuuuge parking
spot right in front of your house, word choice means little.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after I moved in, I ran into former Mayor Art Agnos and
got to talking about the joys and agonies of home ownership in San
Francisco. I mentioned the parking problem on my street.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, when I was mayor, I hoped we might be able to create
some kind of program where homeowners could lease the space
directly in front of their house for a nominal fee from the city,''
Agnos said. ``After, say, 6 p.m., that spot would belong to you.''
</P>
<P>
   I told Agnos that plan sounded like one more reason I was sorry
he never got a second term as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Especially because street parking has only gotten worse since
his time in office.
</P>
<P>
   According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, there
were 325,766 autos registered in San Francisco in 1992, Agnos' last
year as mayor. At the end of 1998, 351,509.
</P>
<P>
   Although the DMV is another month from publishing its official
1999 figures, the preliminary count for last year is 357,233 autos
_ an increase of more than 5,700 cars in just one year.
</P>
<P>
   As for total vehicle count _ cars, trucks, trailers and
motorcycles _ it appears to have risen more than 8,000, from
445,691 in '98 to 453,905 in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, I have to say, I think half of those 8,000 are using
my street for overnight parking.
</P>
<P>
   So ridiculous and time consuming as it is for someone who
commutes at off-hours and DOES have a parking place at her office,
I find myself leaving my car at home as often as I possibly can.
</P>
<P>
   Even if I have to forgo a trip to the grocery store and finish
the work day with a long bus ride and a trudge up my hill, you
can't believe how great it feels to come home and know you've still
got a terrific parking place.

 &HT;    Stock market volatility stirs advice buzz
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stocks or mutual funds? Tech stocks or blue chips? These are
choices investors face in today's volatile market, and the business
press is stepping up with advice.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Money (March), The Wall Street Journal's personal finance
magazine, says old ``must own'' tech stocks such as Intel and other
PC makers are on the outs in a new tech market where ``a new
generation of companies (is) poised to profit from the Internet
revolution.'' The magazine's ``ultimate tech portfolio'' includes
Lucent Technologies and others in the growing fiber-optics field.
</P>
<P>
   According to Money (March), the trick for investors now is to
profit from what it calls ``the jackpot market'' of big winners
without increasing exposure to potential corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep no more than a 40 percent weighting in big tech stocks,''
the magazine suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual Funds (March), which is devoted to the funds industry,
says biotechnology is not as sexy as the Internet, but it's
``cutting-edge stuff'' that investors should look at.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big advances in science, earnings and, yes, market values
helped lift the average biotech fund 82 percent last year,'' more
than half of it in the fourth quarter, the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg Personal Finance (March) asks a question every mutual
fund investor has considered at one time or another: Would I be
better off investing directly in stocks? If you do it correctly,
you create your own fund, the magazine suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need only 15 or 20 stocks to get all the benefits
diversification can bring,'' says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of dynasties
</P>
<P>
   Time was when a Henry Ford II or Tom Watson Jr. could assume
that taking over a family-dominated company was like a royal right
of succession, even in a public company. No longer, says Forbes
(March 6), noting that corporate boards are not reluctant any more
to let family heirs cool their heels before electing them chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   August A. Busch IV, 35, won't necessarily become chairman and
chief executive of Anheuser-Busch even when his hard-driving dad,
August A. Busch III, 62, steps down in three years, the magazine
says. There are other examples, including Motorola, Estee Lauder
and Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Says the younger Busch: ``I'd be lying if I told you I didn't
want to be CEO. But I'm young _ with time on my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Corporate profits soared 37 percent in the fourth quarter and
19 percent for all of 1999, a Business Week (Feb. 28) survey of 900
companies shows. It was the best year since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In ``the biggest flip-flop in recent industrial history,'' the
Japanese firms that appeared to be buying America a decade ago are
quietly selling their U.S. factories to Americans, says Fortune
(Feb. 28), citing Sony, Fujitsu and Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Georgia companies are being more inventive to retain top
employees in a tight labor market, Georgia Trend (February)
reports. The magazine cited Revenue Systems, an Alpharetta software
company, that bought BMWs to attract key employees in lieu of
paying big fees to headhunters. The car stays behind if the
employee quits, however.

&HT;     A PRESIDENT WITH A REAL LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CYNTHIA BAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ As Bill Clinton continues his frenetic
efforts to set up his ``legacy'' before leaving office, he'd be
wise to remember that political achievement does not always stop at
the White House door.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the anniversary of the death of a man who
demonstrates this _ a man who, though quite mediocre as president,
left an extraordinary legacy as a senator, Secretary of State, and
then, after leaving the Oval Office, an eight-term congressman.
That man is John Quincy Adams _ author of the Monroe Doctrine,
Amistad hero and the sixth president of the United States.
Understanding the essence of John Quincy Adams (1767-1848),
however, may prove troubling to our current chief executive. Adams'
many accomplishments throughout his life rested on his complete
indifference to personal popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Adams first courted unpopularity when, as a Federalist senator
(1803-08), he jumped party lines, supporting Thomas Jefferson's
Louisiana Purchase and the Embargo Act and so infuriating his own
party (which despised Jefferson) that it refused to renominate him.
That, in turn, made Adams so angry he quit the Senate before his
term ended.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next eight years abroad as a diplomat before
returning home to serve as secretary of State (1817-1824) to James
Monroe. In 1823 he formulated the famous ``Monroe Doctrine,'' which
continues to underpin U.S. diplomacy even today; it declares the
entire New World off-limits to colonization and political
intervention by the Old; and it most strongly recommends that the
United States stay out of European affairs unless ``seriously
menaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams was a very active secretary of State, responsible not only
for the Monroe Doctrine but for acquiring Florida from Spain and
expanding our borders to the Pacific. In between, he set up the
first filing system for the State Department (before him, treaties
were just left lying around) and organized all its papers.
</P>
<P>
   In Adams' day, the office of secretary of State was a
springboard to the White House, and so, in 1824, he was duly
nominated. The election, however, ended badly, with Andrew Jackson
winning the popular vote, but not a majority in the Electoral
College. Adams eventually squeaked out a narrow victory in the
House of Representatives. It was a bad start to a presidency, and
things never improved. Adams served, quite blandly, for one term,
and the popular Jackson crushed him in the next election. He was 61
years old _ seven years older than Clinton will be when he leaves
office and, in the eyes of his contemporaries, an elderly man.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point, Adams, unlike all other presidents before or
since, refused to hang up his boots. Instead, he entered Congress,
throwing himself for the next 17 years into defending the First
Amendment _ specifically, a citizen's right to petition the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Every Monday, Adams would enter the House with a stack of
petitions and attempt to read them aloud. And, although he insisted
he was no Abolitionist but merely believed in the Bill of Rights,
nearly all these petitions advocated partial or complete abolition
of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of this, the South-leaning House passed a gag
rule tabling all petitions regarding slavery; Adams fought back for
the next eight years, using all sorts of ruses to get his petitions
read. He became a hero to the abolitionist North and an unremovable
thorn to the South, who could never figure out how to get this
sick, shrill, insistent old man to shut up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1839 the insistent old man, who had not practiced law for
three decades, successfully argued the Amistad case before the
Supreme Court, making him even more of a hero to the anti-slavery
North (and Steven Spielberg, who directed ``Amistad,'' the movie)
and bestowing upon him a popularity he had never enjoyed as
president. Although Adams' case rested on subtle and very complex
legal reasoning, the result was easy to understand: Thanks to
Adams' brilliance as a lawyer, the Africans who had taken over the
slave ship Amistad were allowed to go home.
</P>
<P>
   But Adams lost all his Amistad popularity when, three years
later, he presented a petition which recommended dissolving the
Union because of the slavery issue. While highly opposed to
disunion himself, Adams' commitment to the First Amendment made him
feel obligated to read this petition, even though reading it
created (as he suspected it would) a national uproar, provoking a
charge of high treason and a censure vote by the House. Adams' self
defense was masterly, and successful. He lived to see the gag rule
against his petitions repealed, and was sitting alert at his desk
in the House when, 80 years old, he suffered a fatal stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' legacy _ the Monroe Doctrine before he was president and,
afterward, 17 years of dogged defense of the First Amendment and
rule of law _ resulted from pursuing what he believed was right.
The word ``popularity'' was not in his dictionary _ except as an
object of scorn _ and neither was ``legacy.'' But by scorning the
former, he achieved the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who likes to be liked, needs to decide which he likes
more: the applause of today or the respect of tomorrow.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ He can't sleep. It's 5:30 on another morning
when there's not a reason in the world for Odis Axel to be awake,
and yet there he is. Habit, he nods. One day, he's a working man, a
cab driver, on the job for more than 50 years. Then _ it seems to
surprise even him _ he retires. After a half-century of rising
before first light crept across the skies, Axel has a chance to
rest. He doesn't quite want it. He's been retired a short time now,
his driveway empty of his cab, Austin Cab Co. No. 48, and it still
doesn't seem right. ``Let me tell you something crazy,'' Axel
begins, hands slapped on both ears, head down. ``I got up one
morning and got my shirt on and _ I always make my coffee _ and I
got a cup of coffee. And I went to the door and said, 'Where's my
cab?!''' His 73-year-old shoulders quiver with his laughter.
``Yeah, I miss it.'' American society in these high-tech boom days
boasts of 28-year-old retirees, millionaires thanks to computer
tasks most of us little understand. But the work of putting foot to

   PILLET-DESIGN (Paris) _ Christophe Pillet has a dream that
stretches like a beach. And there's furniture in it. The relaxation
and ease of the sea and the sky reside in the forms of the
furniture, like the sounds within shells. Mr. Pillet, a 40-year-old
French designer, studied at the National School of Decorative Arts
in Nice, so that he could surf after classes. At his atelier
apartment in the 11th arrondisement in Paris, he displayed a
drawing of his dream, a design for an ideal home commissioned by
Interni, a Milanese magazine. He would like to think that it is
also part prediction: that objects like chairs and sofas could have
an ambience more important than their individual design. By William
L. Hamilton.

   GENERATION-NEST (Chicago) _ Melanie Laucks had furniture issues.
Her roommate was moving out of their two bedroom/two bath loft
downtown, and taking all her Ikea sortaswedishstuffen with her.
That left Ms. Laucks, a 23-year-old student in the theater program
at Columbia here, with rooms to fill. On the El she had seen an
advertisement for Crate and Barrel's new younger, hipper sister
store, CB2. So she went. There are 44 million shoppers like Melanie
Laucks out there: consumers age 20 to 34 with an estimated $125
billion of their own to burn, not to mention Mom and Dad's money.
Some 50 percent of them are married with children of their own and
46 percent own their own homes, according to a 1998 Yankelovich
Monitor survey. Crate and Barrel, Target, Williams-Sonoma and
upstarts like Furniture.com are waking up to these tantalizing
statistics and targeting Generation Nest. By Rick Marin.

House, You move it, you own it.'' Then there are logistical queries
like ``How do you transport a 39-foot geodesic dome?'' or ``Can a
log cabin be airlifted?'' Once an oddity, house moving is gaining

advertisement for Crate and Barrel's new younger, hipper sister
store, CB2. So she went. There are 44 million shoppers like Melanie
Laucks out there: consumers age 20 to 34 with an estimated $125
billion of their own to burn, not to mention Mom and Dad's money.
Some 50 percent of them are married with children of their own and
46 percent own their own homes, according to a 1998 Yankelovich

BRADLEY CALLED THE VICE PRESIDENT A WHAT? I THINK I'M GOING TO
FAINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've heard some tough charges and countercharges during the
2000 presidential campaign. So far, candidates have accused one
another of lying, cheating, consorting with lobbyists,
misrepresenting their own and one another's records ...
</P>
<P>
   The mud has been slung by Republicans, Democrats and even
would-be nominees of the ``hopelessly dysfunctional'' Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump wasn't even a declared candidate _ and eventually
decided not to run _ when he characterized Pat Buchanan as a
``Hitler lover.''
</P>
<P>
   That was rough. But the campaign got even rougher Monday night,
when Democratic front-runner Al Gore faced challenger Bill Bradley
in a no-holds-barred debate at Harlem's Apollo Theater in New York.
The tirelessly civil Bradley bare-knuckled Gore with the insult to
end all insults: Bradley called Gore a ``conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for fellow Democrats to argue about Social
Security and health care. But when two guys are running for the
Democratic presidential nomination and one of them accuses the
other one of being ``conservative'' _ well, that's something else.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was so taken aback that he admitted in a post-debate TV
interview to harboring conservative leanings when he was a young
congressman representing a rural House district in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   He awakened to the higher wisdom of unbridled liberalism, Gore
explained, when he was elected to the Senate and began to see the
world through the eyes of constituents who resided in more
cosmopolitan locales: Memphis, Nashville ...
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been less forthcoming during the debate when Bradley
branded him a ``conservative Democrat'' who embraced liberal ideals
only after being selected as Bill Clinton's running mate in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   If he was so doggone conservative, Gore demanded, why was his
presidential candidacy endorsed by liberal icons such as Ted
Kennedy and members of the Congressional Black Caucus?
</P>
<P>
   That's obvious, Bradley replied. It's because those folks
weren't aware of Gore's horrifying and secret past as a
``conservative Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``conservative Democrat.'' If that label isn't the ultimate
affront in a Democratic primary campaign, what is?
</P>
<P>
   As negative campaigning goes, it ranks right up there with John
McCain's accusation that George W. Bush ``twists the truth like
Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   You know the deal: ``Conservative'' is to liberal Democrats as
``Clinton'' is to conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Can we say ``anathema,'' boys and girls?
</P>
<P>
   As ridiculous as it might seem to accuse Al ``Government Has the
Answers'' Gore of dabbling in conservatism, Bradley has a point.
When Gore unsuccessfully ran for president in 1988, he was far and
away my pick among the Democratic candidates because his positions
on issues such as defense and gun control seemed considerably less
to the left than those of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was, after all, running against the likes of Michael
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson; those guys could make Clinton look
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The then-senator from Tennessee didn't fall by the wayside in
that campaign because he was too boring. He lost in '88 because he
couldn't keep up with Dukakis and Jackson when it came to singing
the praises of big government and trumpeting the glories of
liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then. This is now.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, having watched Gore jump through hoops to help Clinton
insinuate the federal government into more and more aspects of
Americans' daily lives, even the most skeptical liberal would have
to take Gore's word for it that he's a true believer.
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley thinks that the dreaded C-word will somehow torpedo
Gore's support among rank-and-file Democrats, he'd better think
again.
</P>
<P>
   But here's something for voters to think about. Next fall, when
Gore is trying to convince the electorate that he's not the
wild-eyed liberal his Republican opponent will say he is, do you
suppose he'll suddenly start wearing that ``conservative Democrat''
insult as a badge of honor?

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a sickness, I know.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms are clanking luggage, jangling kitchen drawers,
exclamations of ``What in the world?'' from visitors to my culinary
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   I am a gadget geek.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger objects are the worst manifestations because it's
hard to hide the evidence of my disease. The 2-foot-tall
couscoussier lugged back from Morocco, the German juice extractor
that resembles an Invention Convention project, the skyscraper food
dehydrator, the 3-kilo kugelhopf mold from Alsace, the cazuela
hefted through customs from Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   My basement is the repository for these massive must-haves,
stashed behind the Dreft and the dryer sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, it's the same song, but in shorter verses.
</P>
<P>
   There, the drawers are a jumble of a Norwegian sugar cube tong,
a fish scaler and cherry pitter that once belonged to Julia Child
and were sold at a charity auction, an ice cube tong from the days
of cocktails and Bakelite barware.
</P>
<P>
   There's a butter slicer that has never been used because it
seems, well, just a touch obsessive. There's a little bird that
spits out juice when filled with a lemon wedge. That too, has never
seen use because fingers work so much faster.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are the gadgets that do make life easier. A metal
ginger grater from Korea is a wonder compared with those silly
little porcelain things that do nothing so much as mush the pink
root. (But, of course, there are several of the porcelain versions
in the drawer, as well.)
</P>
<P>
   There's a Mouli grater, that essential French hand-held
contraption that chews up herbs and garlic to make fabulous
flavored butters. And the German obsession with a tool for
everything is represented with an asparagus spatula, the better to
mete out the hallowed spring ritual of ``spargel'' season.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly none of this is necessary to the preparation of daily
fare. But if ever one of my neighbors should need a shrimp
deveiner, I'm there for them.

&HT;     FAILED LENDING COMPANY HAD PROMISING START UNDER YOUNG
FOUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ By his late 20s, David Silipigno, a brash
businessman with a knack for sales, had already built a sizable
mortgage business that specialized in customers with bad credit
histories and generated $600 million in loans annually.
</P>
<P>
   But Silipigno's National Finance Corp. seemed to unravel even
faster than it was built.
</P>
<P>
   Today, National Finance Corp. is the focus of an FBI probe
started soon after the business collapsed and threw about 350 local
employees out of work only days before Christmas 1999. Investment
banking firm Bear Stearns has complained that $5 million to $6
million it should have been paid is missing. The Urban League of
Northeastern New York may be left holding the bag in connection
with a $2 million loan made to NFC in the hopes of bringing a
telemarketing center to a planned development in Arbor Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Silipigno, 29, has declined comment. His lawyer, Bill Dreyer,
would say only that Silipigno ``is seeking a position as a
consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Silipigno, colleagues say, is ambitious and energetic, setting
goals for himself to accomplish every day. He admonished his
workers to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a passion, and it can be positive, or it can be
negative,'' said Aaron Dare, the executive director of the Urban
League. His organization not only wants the repayment of $2
million, as a court has ordered, it needs to find a tenant for the
Arbor Hill telemarketing center NFC was supposed to occupy.
</P>
<P>
   Silipigno dropped out of the State University of New York at
Albany early to focus on the mortgage lending company he had
started at age 19 in his parents' Clifton Park home, according to
Dare. He was majoring in sociology before he left after five
semesters, according to the university records.
</P>
<P>
   Silipigno may have been inspired to enter the mortgage business
by his father, who worked in management with a national lender,
Dare said.
</P>
<P>
   He even hired his father, Joseph, as executive vice president
early on in the development of NFC, according to National Finance
Corp. newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   NFC hired and trained employees to call consumers or homeowners
with bad credit and sell them loans to consolidate debt or get a
home. The market was real and the consumers were well-chosen,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   And the company, Dare's research showed, kept growing. First it
was a home business, then it moved into a 20,000-square-foot
building that later expanded to 40,000 square feet. The employees
who performed well, or were particularly loyal to or friendly with
Silipigno, were rewarded with raises, former employees said.
</P>
<P>
   Audited accounting records portrayed the company as ``very
strong,'' Dare said.
</P>
<P>
   The young entrepreneur appeared to enjoy the trappings of
success. Silipigno liked nice suits, and drove a late-model
Mercedes and Porsche, according to Dare and Department of Motor
Vehicles records. DMV records also show a Land Rover and a boat
were registered in his name, though it was not clear whether he
still owns them. Lake George property records confirm he owns a
house and acreage on the lake worth $608,000. And Saratoga County
records show that last year Silipigno bought a $1.4 million home in
Clifton Park.
</P>
<P>
   Silipigno could be mercurial, said Dare, who claimed to be on
the receiving end of one tirade. Silipigno yelled at Dare when the
Urban League executive could not accommodate the number of NFC
employees Silipigno wanted at a visit by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Dare saw the temper as part of the hard-driving personality.
``You've got to be tough to be successful at his age,'' Dare said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also could turn on the charm. ``He was very aggressive,
he was very smooth, and I don't say that pejoratively,'' said
George Robertson, head of economic development for the city of
Schenectady, which was, for a time, in the 1998 bidding to land the
telemarketing center. ``It's with Melvin Milquetoast that you get
nervous, because that person isn't going to make it in the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   But the terms of the deal Silipigno proposed didn't sit right,
Robertson said. The company ``wanted a $2 million grant,'' which
would have been public money, and that, Robertson said, ``sent up a
real red flag. It was a deal we were suddenly not comfortable
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Schenectady backed out.
</P>
<P>
   But Silipigno knew how to sell and negotiate. Whenever a
question came up, Dare said, Silipigno had an explanation. ``You
look at him and see what he's been able to do, in spite of the
odds, and you really believe he's going to pull it off,'' Dare
said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Silipigno is described as a charismatic leader who commanded
loyalty. When Silipigno partied with employees at the popular
Saratoga Springs bar of the moment, he held court and captivated
others with his visions of the company, according to former
employees who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Silipigno could sometimes sound like a motivational speaker. His
column in the company newsletter routinely asked workers to join
him in success. ``You, as an employee, must show NFC management
that all the talent we will ever need, already exists within the
company. ... You're either a winner or your (sic) not _ YOU MAKE
THE CHOICE,'' Silipigno exclaimed in the November/December 1997
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm seemed to work.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees have said they now realize that last year they
should have suspected things were not going well at the company.
Plans for an initial stock offering were shelved. The industry
started consolidating. There was talk within the company that
expenses were too high, employees said.
</P>
<P>
   But Silipigno told employees in the 1999 newsletter, for the
first and second quarters, that the answer was within reach, that
``the true value of NFC has yet to show its face.'' He closed with
this: ``With business partners like you NFC will always have its
place in this industry.''

INTERNET STOCK OFFERING SETS OFF FRENZIED BUYING SPREE IN HONG
KONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The fever over Asian Internet stocks came close to
delirium here Wednesday, as tens of thousands of Hong Kong
residents besieged local banks to buy shares in the stock offering
of a one-month-old, Chinese-language Internet service known as
Tom.com.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the offering expired at midday, it had been
oversubscribed more than 1,000 times, putting Tom.com on track to
be the most sought-after initial public offering in Hong Kong's
history. The last such stock mania was in May 1997, when Beijing
Enterprises, a mainland Chinese company known as a ``red chip,''
issued shares amid a wave of euphoria over Hong Kong's return to
China.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny Internet start-up and a sprawling state-controlled
conglomerate would seem to have little in common. But market
watchers here were struck by the parallels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very reminiscent of the red chip craze in 1997,'' said
David Webb, the editor of Webb-site.com, which tracks stock
offerings. ``We've got a huge speculative frenzy in a single
category of stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   At one of HSBC's branches in Kowloon, nearly 50,000 people lined
up after dawn to submit forms. As the noon deadline approached, the
crowd became restive and police were summoned to keep order.
</P>
<P>
   Tom.com and Beijing Enterprises have something else in common:
Investors are less interested in their business than in the
perceived value of their political connections. Beijing Enterprises
is controlled by the Beijing municipal government; Tom.com is
majority owned by the two flagship companies of Li Ka-shing, a Hong
Kong billionaire almost as well known for his ties to Beijing as
for his business acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Among Tom.com's minority investors is Pacific Century
Cyberworks, an Internet firm controlled by Li's son, Richard Li.
Pacific Century is negotiating to take over Hong Kong's main
telephone company, Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, and its shares have also
rocketed in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought the stock only because of Li Ka-shing; I believe in
the Li dynasty,'' said C.M. Law, 37, a housewife who is one of the
more than one million applicants. ``I don't really know what kind
of business they're in. I know it is some sort of technology
company, like Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom.com is not an online bookseller like Amazon.com. But that
may be one of the few businesses it does not plan to enter, judging
from the company's 200-page prospectus, which is printed in Chinese
and English. It aims to be ``the leading multilingual China-related
new media mega-portal,'' with Web sites in cities with big Chinese
populations, like Singapore, Sydney, San Francisco and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, though, Tom.com operates a single Internet site
that broadcasts programming from a Hong Kong radio station. The
company reported losses of $10.3 million in 1999, on sales of $6.7
million, which it attributed to the costs of its expanding Web site
development team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not very much there, frankly,'' Webb said. ``They seem
to be promoting `push' technology, which I thought went out with
Pointcast.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tom.com's operations seem quite beside the point. After
slogging through more than two years of economic misery, Hong Kong
people have finally recovered their appetite for speculation. That
coincides with the emergence of Internet start-ups like Tom.com and
Pacific Century Cyberworks. Analysts said the speculative surge
could just as well have been sparked by a rally in property prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong adjusts instantly to any change in the market,''
said William H. Overholt, the head of Asian research at Nomura
International. ``This is a population that has survived by being
fast on its feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming response will allow Tom.com to price its stock
at the high end of its offering range, though still only 23 cents
per share. The company will issue 428 million shares, plus a
possible extra allotment of 64.2 million shares, so it could raise
a total of $113 million. The stock begins trading on Hong Kong's
new technology exchange on March 1, and analysts expect it to rise
tenfold on the first day.

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IN TAIWAN STAKE OUT THEIR TURF 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ The eminent industrialist made his prediction:
A victory by the opposition party's candidate in presidential
elections next month would cause a disastrous crash in the Taiwan
stock market, because investors fearing hostilities with China
would yank out their money.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, in an interview Wednesday, was Kao Ching-yuen _
chairman of Taiwan's National Federation of Industries, chief
executive of the giant President Group conglomerate and, not
coincidentally, a leader of the Nationalist Party that has ruled
Taiwan for half a century and now faces possible defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Kao's warning of economic catastrophe was one of many dire
predictions by political opponents who say the election of Chen
Shui-bian on March 18 would cause dangerous tensions, and perhaps
war, with China.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's Democratic Progressive Party has, from its founding in
the 1980s, called for Taiwan's formal independence _ which China
calls a cause for war. But the Party has moderated that stance,
hoping to ease fears in Beijing and Washington and broaden its
electoral appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about China's view of Chen intensified after China
warned in a report this week that any step toward formal
independence, or even an indefinite delay in negotiations toward
reunification, could lead to a military attack. The report did not
directly discuss Chen or his party.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings about China's possible reactions and the questions
about the sincerity of his conversion are a source of endless
exasperation for Chen. In truth, he argued in an interview
Wednesday, perhaps only his party can _in the manner of the
fervently anti-Communist Richard Nixon's historic opening to China
_ reach a lasting accord with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a peacemaker, not a troublemaker,'' he insisted, his voice
croaking from campaigning. His basic position, and his rationale
for backing away from his original, harder line, is that since
Taiwan is already an independent state in practice, there is no
need to codify its status.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, that leaves his policy little different from that
of the governing Party of President Lee Teng-hui, although the
Nationalists still pay lip service to a distant goal of unifying in
some way with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Though dogged by fears that his victory would provoke a crisis,
Chen has a good chance of winning in the race against Lien Chan of
the Nationalist Party and James Soong, a longtime Nationalist who
is running independently and hence dividing the party's traditional
large vote.
</P>
<P>
   In his doomsday prediction Wednesday, Kao, the Nationalist and
industry chief, was specific: right after Chen's election, he said,
the stock market would plummet to one-third of its current level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people will wire part of their money out of Taiwan just
to play it safe,'' said Kao, charging that Chen, 49, and his
colleagues are too young and inexperienced to guide Taiwan safely.
And who can be sure, he and other critics ask, that once in office
they won't let their true pro-independence colors show?
</P>
<P>
   Told of the dire economic prediction, Chen smiled and recalled
that opponents had made similar efforts to ``terrorize people,'' as
he put it, in 1994, when he made his successful run for mayor of
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after I won, the stock market actually rose by
hundreds of points,'' he said. Chen then, as he has hundreds of
times in recent months in speeches and interviews and meetings with
foreign diplomats, rattled off the new policies he and his party
have adopted to prevent unnecessary trouble with China.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, he said, he would not try to write Taiwan's
sovereign status as a ``state'' into the Constitution. He would
not, as the party once promised, call a referendum on Taiwan's
future or to change its official name from the Republic of China to
Republic of Taiwan; only if Taiwan is attacked, he said, would he
ask the public to consider such basic changes.
</P>
<P>
   And as a first step toward smoother relations with the mainland,
Chen said, he would _ subject to national security concerns _ ease
the current government's restrictions on direct shipping,
transportation and communications across the straits, and on
large-scale investment projects in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Removing obstacles to cross-straits commerce, which is already
huge despite them, has been a prime goal of Beijing, which seeks by
any means to enmesh Taiwan more deeply in its fold. For the same
reason, and to hold back a bargaining chip for future negotiations,
Taiwan's government has maintained the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in part because of the rising impatience of Taiwan's
own businessmen and the Democratic Progressive Party's unexpected
willingness to make concessions, all the candidates here have
pledged to nurture deeper economic ties to China.
</P>
<P>
   Kao, the industrialist, made it clear Wednesday that he has
never been happy about his own party's restrictive policy. ``We
just want to pursue trade and investment,'' he said of Taiwan's
businessmen. ``We hope politics won't have any impact.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, the powerful industry association led by
Kao announced that he would travel to Beijing soon after the March
elections to discuss improving economic ties. He is certain to be
feted by senior Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Chen and his party, even with their economic olive branch, may
be a hard sell in Beijing. The Chinese may prefer almost anyone to
Lee, who has riled them by bluntly asserting that Taiwan is
sovereign and equal and that the two sides should talk on a
``state-to-state'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen is unlikely to pretend, as the Nationalists have, that
he is negotiating toward a long-term goal of ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not oppose talking about it,'' he said Wednesday, ``but
`one China' should not be a pre-condition.'' In any future
negotiations with China, he said, the two sides must meet ``on an
equal status,'' and without any preconditions about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Some artful finessing of concepts may be needed for China to
agree to talk on those terms. But, realistically or not, Chen said
he sees a chance to overcome deeply rooted enmities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent cross-straits tensions,'' he said, ``originate in
the historical hatred between the Nationalist Party and the Chinese
Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can only be ended by a Party without that burden,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as Nixon could open up to China,'' he said, ``we feel
that the Democratic Progressive Party could play a similar role,
opening up a new chapter in relations with mainland China.''

 &HT;    GORE HAS STRONG ADVANTAGE WITH HISPANICS IN BIG STATES
 &HT;    740&AMP;add. With HISPANICS-DATA. For release Sunday, Feb. 27.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Democratic primary voting nears in the four
biggest states _ Texas, Florida, California and New York _ Vice
President Al Gore appears poised to reap the support of the large
Hispanic communities in all four.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has courted Hispanic voters from the very beginning of his
campaign. His original intent was to blunt the Hispanic appeal of
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who he expected to face in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Bill Bradley has mounted an unexpectedly strong
primary challenge, Gore's groundwork is set to pay extra dividends,
because the former New Jersey senator has done little to court
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore effort has been exhaustive:
</P>
<P>
   His first campaign appointment was Jose Villarreal, a San
Antonio lawyer who is his national treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign set up a Hispanic working group that touted the
economic gains of Hispanics under the slogan, ``Ganamos con Gore,''
or ``We Win with Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   He lined up endorsements from 521 key Hispanic politicians in
California, Texas, New York and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   His political allies floated rumors of a possible Hispanic
running mate: Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   He offered a Spanish version of his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He seasoned his speeches before Hispanic audiences with a
healthy dose of beginner Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   And the White House pitched in with periodic events showcasing
administration efforts on behalf of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Hispanic vote tends to be Democrat. Clinton got
61 percent nationwide in 1992 and 72 percent in 1996, and Gore has
tapped into the same network for his campaign this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's extra efforts to cement that vote were sparked by
Bush's success in his 1998 re-election campaign, when he got nearly
50 percent of Texas's Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, Gore's strategy is likely to give the vice
president an edge over Bradley next month in the key Democratic
presidential primaries in California, Texas, New York and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently has Bradley actively campaigned for the Hispanic
vote. The day after his bare-knuckles debate with Gore at the
Apollo Theatre last Monday, he visited Public School 24, a new
Spanish-English dual-language elementary school in the New York
working-class neighborhood of Sunset Park.
</P>
<P>
   He used the appearance to question Gore's commitment to health
care coverage, education reforms and economic development. He also
received the endorsement of a local Hispanic city councilman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know much about him,'' Katherine Cardona said of
Bradley. She knows a little more about Gore, but mostly that he has
been Bill Clinton's vice president for the last seven and a half
years. ``And I like Clinton,'' she added. ``So maybe Gore could do
as good a job as Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardona is the kind of voter Bradley needs if he is to overcome
Gore's lead in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She is 34. Her grandparents moved the family to New York from
Puerto Rico. She is the mother of two children, both in public
elementary school. She works in sales at Manhattan Latin Music
Center, a wholesaler of CD's and videos. Her husband, Silva, works
as a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to speak, but nobody was listening,'' Cardona said.
``But now the politicians are starting to pay attention to Latinos.
They see the country is big and is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hispanics currently make up about 11 percent of the U.S.
population, a proportion that is expected to grow to 25 percent by
2050. They will outnumber non-Hispanic blacks by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But only in the 1998 congressional elections did Hispanics start
to wield the influence expected of such a fast-growing population.
</P>
<P>
   In the hotly contested New York Senate race, for example, 82
percent of Hispanics voted for Democrat Charles Schumer, who ousted
Republican incumbent Al D'Amato. Similarly, in California, Gray
Davis received 78 percent of the Hispanic vote to help him defeat
Republican Dan Lundgren in the gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanic voters have become a powerful focal point for
candidates,'' said Henry Cisneros, a former Clinton cabinet member,
former San Antonio mayor and now president of the Spanish-language
television network Univision Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``A presidential candidate cannot win the election ... without
winning Latino votes,'' said Leo Briones, a Los Angeles political
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign has made little effort to reach out to
Hispanics. Last weekend, for example, he was the only one of the
major candidates for president who did not send a representative to
the Mexican American Political Association's 41st annual Education
and Endorsement Conference in California.
</P>
<P>
   And while campaign literature in Spanish is available from
Bradley, his campaign Web site has no content in Spanish beyond the
candidate's biography.
</P>
<P>
   Biography may, in fact, be Bradley's problem in the Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   Few white American politicians have spoken as eloquently as
Bradley about the country's racial divide. And Bradley's commitment
to issues of importance to Hispanics is, at the very least, the
equal of Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's perspective is mostly the product of his 10 years
as a professional basketball player, a white man living in a
largely African American world.
</P>
<P>
   As a recent editorial in The Record newspaper in Bergen, N.J.,
suggested, ``had Bradley been a baseball player, and shared locker
rooms with more Latinos, perhaps things might have been
different.''

EDITORIAL: PRIVACY ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 22:
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet matures, preserving user privacy and anonymity
is becoming a significant problem. Technology now makes it possible
for online businesses and advertisers to turn the Internet into a
realm where activities and habits are monitored and recorded,
largely without consumer knowledge or consent. Unless businesses
can protect privacy, the erosion of trust could seriously harm
e-commerce as well as cause the public to become wary about using
the Internet for education, research and other important
non-commercial functions.
</P>
<P>
   In the offline world, a big part of personal privacy is simply
the freedom to remain a face in the crowd. No one tracks a shopper
as he visits various stores in a mall or keeps notes on what
products he looks at. But in cyberspace, that shopper's behavior _
which Web sites he visits, and which ads he clicks on _ can all be
instantly recorded and compiled, albeit through computer-based
identifiers rather than by name. Most consumers have little idea
that unseen advertising networks on the Internet track their
movements across multiple Web sites. Most do not know that Web
sites can collect and sell data about them. But consumer concerns
are rising, and businesses are getting worried about a privacy
backlash.
</P>
<P>
   This month the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an
advocacy group, filed a complaint against DoubleClick with the
Federal Trade Commission, alleging unfair trade practices in its
tracking of the online activities of millions of Internet users.
DoubleClick, the leading Internet advertising company, places ads
for its clients on about 1,500 Web sites _ including many of the
most heavily used sites such as AltaVista _ that are part of the
DoubleClick network. When a computer user views an ad on a network
site, DoubleClick places a ``cookie'' file on the user's computer
hard drive that carries a unique identifying number. The cookie
allows DoubleClick to monitor the user's computer _ though without
being able to identify the user by name or address _ whenever he
visits a network site, and note the content he is viewing to
deliver a targeted ad that is customized to a user's interests.

   Last year DoubleClick acquired Abacus Direct, a company that has
a vast database of millions of names, addresses and other personal
information collected by the nation's largest direct-mail
catalogues. Now DoubleClick is building a new online version of
Abacus, and will be able to match personally identifiable
information on purchasers collected by the online Abacus with
DoubleClicks' data on those individuals' subsequent Web activities.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick says it will give users the opportunity to opt out
of this matching. But privacy advocates fear that this kind of data
collection will become widespread in cyberspace, and that personal
information _ from browsing habits to the research one might do on
the Web _ could potentially be released to employers, insurers and
others. Industry's answer to these worries is self-regulation and
the creation of privacy policies. Unfortunately, even good policies
are largely unenforceable. A new study by the California HealthCare
Foundation of 21 major health-related Web sites found that many
violated their own stated privacy policies, and shared personal
information collected from visitors without their permission.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to give users easier ways to block the
collection of information. DoubleClick, responding to public
criticism, has begun a campaign to tell users how to opt out of
tracking. The World Wide Web Consortium, the group that designs
standards for the Web, is creating a new way for Web sites to
transmit the site's privacy policy automatically, and allow users
to signal only the information they are willing to share.
</P>
<P>
   Also, several Internet privacy bills have been introduced in
Congress. Businesses are concerned that government regulations
could hinder the Internet's dynamism. Many users may want to
receive ads aimed at their interests. But all users should get a
meaningful choice about how personal data are collected and used.
Maintaining privacy will be integral to the Internet's future, if
only because consumers need to feel safe enough to participate.

ANALYSTS KEEP TRYING TO PREDICT HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the hottest Internet companies of the past decade died
quietly last week. PointCast, a company that automatically
``pushes'' data to millions of Internet-linked computers, had once
been considered a world-changing company at the forefront of a
crucial technology.
</P>
<P>
   Among those singing the praises of push technology were the
technology industry analysts at the Yankee Group in Boston.
Customers who bought the company's reports on push services would
have learned that PointCast and similar companies had a bright
future. Indeed, in late 1996, Yankee analysts predicted that push
services would be a $5.7 billion business by now. Instead the
market quietly faded away.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in 1998, Yankee Group predicted that there
would be about 1.25 million households using high-speed Internet
connections. That forecastproved to be about right. According to
recent cable industry data, there are now approximately 1.4 million
users of high-speed cable modems in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting the future is a perilous business, especially in
high-technology industries. But that hasn't stopped a host of
expert analysts from attempting it. Companies like the Yankee
Group, Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., International Data
Corp. of Framingham, Mass., and Jupiter Communications Inc. of New
York earn millions for providing businesses with forecasts on the
high-tech future, and strategic advice on how to prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous executives aren't the only ones who rely on these
experts for hire. Journalists from every newspaper in the land,
including The Boston Globe, routinely quote analysts from these
leading research firms, and build stories around the statistics and
forecasts they provide.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts say that forecasts of industry trends are
little more valuable than horoscopes, especially when they attempt
to look three or four years into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no science in industry forecasting at all,'' says
Boston business consultant William Sherden, author of a skeptical
book about the folly of trying to predict the future. Even Sherden
admits, however, that he sometimes purchases a forecast, in search
of a little near-term guidance about industry trends.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to people who produce the research, and they'll concede
that their long-term predictions are at best rough guides to the
future. John Gantz, chief research
</P>
<P>
   officer at IDC, even warns that in many cases, nobody goes back
to check the accuracy of an estimate made years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what anyone tells you,'' says Gantz. ``No one in
this business goes back and looks at the actuals . . . not on a
rigorous basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gantz insists that the very popularity of his firm's
services provide some evidence that IDC often gets it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get it wrong often enough, they won't buy our stuff,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Jupiter Communications chief executive Gene DeRose
readily acknowledges that the specific numbers aren't really the
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about the lessons that we give them, and the
dynamics of how the industry works,'' he says. DeRose says his
customers need the assurance that statistics can bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace demands and has a passionate need for these
numbers,'' he says. But in the end, Jupiter and other firms say
they use the data mainly to point up trends.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Spence, assistant director of e-commerce marketing for
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. in New York, is a loyal buyer
of research from Jupiter Communications, even though she knows
their long-term forecasts will sometimes fall short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jupiter has been very responsive to us getting the information
we need,'' Spence says, ``and it's all about timing.''
</P>
<P>
   But what good is timing if the data are wrong? Spence replies
that she doesn't expect market research data to tell her precisely
what's going to happen next year or the year after.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work with statistics and numbers enough to know you can
pretty much make statistics say whatever you want them to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she adds, each forecasting firm will inevitably come
out with a different statistic.
</P>
<P>
   What matters to Spence is not whether the market for online
furniture sales goes up 30 percent or 40 percent, but whether it's
likely to go up at all. It's the direction she's looking for, not a
particular data point.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the forecasters don't even get the trends right.
Yankee Group wasn't alone in wildly overestimating public demand
for push software products like PointCast. Wired magazine produced
a special issue devoted to push software, claiming that it would
transform the way people used computers. Major software makers like
Netscape Communications Corp. and Microsoft Corp., desperate to
catch the wave, built push software into their Internet browsers.
They all got it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the analysts keep trying, driven by intense demand from
companies desperate for a glimpse into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have some way to plan,'' says Glantz. ``No company
can operate without plans and strategies that go beyond a year.''
</P>
<P>
   IDC, Yankee, Jupiter, and many other forecasting shops follow a
business model called ``syndicated research.'' Old-line consulting
firms like Arthur D. Little &AMP; Co. had long done in-depth research
for their large corporate clients. But starting in the 1970s, firms
like IDC and the Yankee Group hit on a way to provide the same
service to smaller clients. They'd prepare detailed reports on
various industry segments, then sell the information to anybody who
cared to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee Group, for instance, was founded in 1970 by Howard
Anderson, a Harvard Business School graduate who'd noticed that
there wasn't much solid data available on computer companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point he determined that there was a lack of knowledge
about how technology was going to impact business,'' says current
Yankee Group chief executive Berge Ayvazian. So Anderson began
cranking out reports on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Yankee Group has about a thousand customers. Each
subscribes to one or more of the company's two dozen service
groups. For instance, there are analyst teams that specialize in
media and entertainment businesses, telecommunications in Latin
America, and of course, Internet computing. Each subscription sells
for $25,000. That money not only buys access to research, but also
the researchers. Subscribers are entitled to phone their analysts
for detailed briefings.
</P>
<P>
   This human contact is the real value of the subscription,
according to senior vice president Brian Adamik.
</P>
<P>
   ``We require our analysts to talk to our clients every month,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   IDC follows a similar business model, but with a much larger
catalog of 200 services. Even more than Yankee Group, IDC is
associated with statistics _ data on past performance of key
technology markets, and forecasts of how those businesses will
perform years into the future.
</P>
<P>
   IDC and other research firms get their information in much the
same way reporters do, with lots of legwork. Say you're trying to
figure out how many computers are being sold. IDC's John Gantz says
his company would approach the question from multiple angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We survey users to find out `What did you buy,' `What do you
have installed today' . . . and we even call the vendors to ask
them, `What did you ship?' '' Gantz says. ``We have relationships
with the big distributors. We get information from them on how much
did they move (and) pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. The analysts will also contact the companies
that make components that go into the devices. How many hard drives
are being made? For that matter, how many hard drive controller
chips are being made? By tracking the supply of the components used
in a product, companies like IDC hope to get an accurate picture of
how many are being produced.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts tend to be people with MBA degrees and a knack for
qualitative analysis, or veterans of the industries they track. A
handful, like Jupiter Communications' DeRose, got their start as
journalists. Along with hard numbers, the analysts absorb anecdotal
data that give them a feel for the state of an industry. A certain
amount of this gut-level instinct winds up in these reports, and
plays a major part in the one-on-one discussions between analysts
and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal data plays a large role in the reports issued by
Forrester Research. Much of the firm's research is based upon
interviews with vendors, distributors, and consumers, in an effort
to understand their buying patterns or marketing plans. The results
are written up in brief, breezy reports with relatively few hard
numbers to slow the reader down. (Forrester executives declined to
be interviewed for this story. The company is in a federally
mandated ``quiet period'' because of a pending stock offering.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Harvard Business Review-Lite,'' says Jeffrey
Rayport, an associate professor at the Harvard Business School, and
a consultant with Monitor Group of Boston. ``There are those who
say that's totally unscientific.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rayport is just as skeptical of the number crunchers like
Yankee Group and IDC.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are others who'd say the numbers you get . . . are
totally suspect, so how can you trust those?'' In Rayport's view,
Forrester's word-of-mouth approach is at least as likely to produce
reliable results.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the technology analysts try to gaze far into the future.
Julio Gomez of Gomez Advisors Inc. in Lincoln prefers to sell
customers accurate information about the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give them tools to help them do their jobs today,'' he
says, ``not tell them what things are going to look like in five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez's 40 researchers analyze the performance of a host of
Internet retailing companies, using a set of standardized criteria
_ how easy is it to use the site, for instance, and how its prices
compare with those of other sites. The resulting data is used to
rate the quality of these retail Web sites, and these ratings are
constantly reviewed and updated.
</P>
<P>
   The final ratings are available to the public at the Gomez Web
site. But Gomez also uses the data to produce short-term analyses
of trends in various Internet retail markets, like online computer
retailing or bookselling. It's these reports that Gomez sells for a
fee to corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our value is more for tactical decisions than for long-term
strategic decisions,'' Gomez says.
</P>
<P>
   That might endear him to William Sherden, a renowned skeptic of
efforts to predict the long-term future. In his 1997 book ``The
Fortune Sellers,'' Sherden mocks human efforts to make accurate
predictions in a wide range of areas, from weather to the stock
market. In his view, it's possible to make fairly reliable
predictions about an industry's performance looking ahead a few
months, usually by assuming present trends will continue. But go
further out _ a year or more _ and it all becomes guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   Sherden isn't questioning the analysts' ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the people who are producing these forecasts
actually believe they're doing something useful and valuable and
reliable,'' he says. He just thinks they're kidding themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Sherden says, companies ``are not buying it for
market predictions; they're buying it for technology trends.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an attitude that the technology forecasters cheerfully
embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that you can't possibly predict very accurately or
with much detail . . . what that market opportunity or that new
arena is going to look like,'' says Yankee Group's Ayvazian. ``It's
not the forecast that's valuable; it's the strategy that's
valuable.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ohio _ Every environmentally-conscious Internet
surfer faces a moral dilemma when he gets rid of his early '90s
computer dinosaur:
</P>
<P>
   Pay $40 to $70 to have it recycled, or toss it in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of tons of computers and other electronic devices are
shoved off desks every year to make way for newer versions.
</P>
<P>
   They contain mercury, PCBs and heavy metals ranging from lead to
silver and gold.
</P>
<P>
   Landfill operators, under the squeeze of evolving Environmental
Protection Agency regulations, refuse to accept truckloads of
electronics from businesses, though a lone computer in a garbage
can still legally gets crushed and buried with the rest of the
trash.
</P>
<P>
   A computer collection day at the Clark County Fairgrounds in
November was ``less than successful,'' said Debra Karns, county
Solid Waste Management District director.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than a dozen people brought electronics to the collection,
and many of them were dismayed at the cost, although it had been
included in the announcement, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A computer monitor costs $19 to leave; the cathode ray tube out
of a TV was $10, and a computer system intact was $3 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't accustomed to paying to have materials
recycled,'' Karns said. ``We've had calls all along from people who
want to do the right thing. We want to provide an avenue where
people can afford to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses herded toward computer recycling by the EPA rules
have nurtured a new species of entrepreneur: The trash broker.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first in the Miami Valley, Springfield resident Ray
Harris, incorporated Special Waste Systems two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't advertise; we're not in the phone book. We're pretty
busy as it is,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   He charges about $50 to pick up a personal computer for
recycling, but his regular customers are businesses that discard
truckloads of electronics each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Harris sends the goods to Recyclights, a Columbus, Ohio firm
that reclaims the useful metals, mercury, circuit boards and other
components, and recycles the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Recyclights' customers within 50 miles of Springfield, all of
whom contract through Harris, include 30 large industrial accounts
with monthly or quarterly pick-ups of computers, fluorescent bulbs
fixtures, batteries and other hazardous recyclables.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric near Cincinnati handed over 35 office computers
a couple weeks ago and will have another 35 within the next few
weeks. Fletcher-based Midwest Micro, which manufactures,
distributes and repairs computer systems, has Harris pick up 80 or
90 monitors every two or three weeks, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was a special waste director for Laidlaw in Dublin before
the company was bought out by Allied Industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of customers asking me, `There's got to be a
better way to do this. Can't we recycle this?' But we (at Laidlaw)
would opt to take it to a landfill because that was revenue for
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the trade magazine ``Resource Recycling'',
consumers readily participate in computer recycling, whether it's
through collection events, computer store drop-off sites or
curbside pick-up.
</P>
<P>
   Government-sponsored collection programs operated by local solid
waste districts seem to work the best, but they've been slow in
coming, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is among bidders for a contract with the Darke County
Solid Waste District, which is attempting to gather grants to make
computer recycling free to individuals, district director Anne
Vehre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``End-of-life electronic equipment recycling won't happen until
someone takes it on,'' Vehre said. ``We have places to send printer
cartridges and floppy disks, but there's really nothing set up for
electronics.''
</P>
<P>
   America is lagging behind Europe in exploring ways to recycle
that make money and protect the planet, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy watching a soybean farmer separating beans from corn got
the idea for a new machine that can automatically separate the
parts of a TV or computer in minutes, but it's not to the point
where it has been marketed as yet,'' Vehre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology's being developed where waste disposal is going to
look like it's out of a science fiction movie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, solid waste districts across the country are
juggling their commitments to the environment and to the taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good public policy to spend $600 a ton to recycle
something. You sometimes just have to dispose of it in the most
responsible way possible and move on,'' Karns said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge is: how do you get people to understand there's
a cost for this and get them to support it?'' she said.

 &HT;    `Electronic house call' system gaining notice
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The team of techies and medical folks knew the project
looked promising _ an electronic system to bring health care into a
patient's home. A high-tech return of the house call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it had potential,'' said John Peifer, a senior
research scientist at Georgia Tech. He was one of more than a dozen
researchers from Tech and Augusta's Medical College of Georgia
developing the invention.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, ``We didn't realize the full potential,'' adds
Peifer, noting that the Internet then was still in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the prospects for the CyberCare ``electronic house call''
system _ a melding of medicine and the Internet that can monitor
patients at home _ are being noticed on Wall Street, even before
the Food and Drug Administration approves the device.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the parent firm, Florida-based CyberCare, were trading
at less than $1 at the time of an August merger. The share price
has zoomed to $36.25 at Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   That ascent has taken the two Georgia universities and the
inventors along on its wild ride. Each college received about
720,000 shares after the technology was licensed to CyberCare. Now
that original stake is worth $26 million to each.
</P>
<P>
   With home care uses, telemedicine's backers say these systems
can improve health care for chronically-ill patients while lowering
medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   CyberCare is a textbook case of how research projects can be
turned into commercial products, said Bill Todd of the Georgia
Research Alliance, a public-private coalition to help foster
high-tech development in the state.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the buzz around CyberCare increased as the company
announced a subsidiary of Shanghai Industrial Holdings has signed
an agreement for a joint venture to market and sell the electronic
house call system in Asia. The joint venture will buy about 60,000
of the units CyberCare said.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the company received orders from a Florida company to
put the system in the homes of 250 elderly patients. That state's
Medicaid program is discussing a pilot project.
</P>
<P>
   The CyberCare house call system starts with a PC, but without a
mouse or keyboard. Attached to it are medical devices such as
stethoscope, thermometer, blood pressure cuffs, and other
instruments to monitor diabetes, asthma and other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The patients, by hitting icons on the screen, can take their own
measurements, which are sent to health care providers. There's
two-way interactive video, so the provider and patient can see and
talk to each other. A camera at the patient end can zoom close to a
wound, an eye or a medicine bottle, so the nurse or doctor can
inspect it.
</P>
<P>
   CyberCare said the equipment will retail for $5,000 to $7,500,
and lease for $150 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials point out that 1 percent of Americans consume
about 35 percent of health care costs. With conditions ranging from
diabetes to congestive heart failure, they require hospitalizations
more often than others. Constant monitoring can prevent some
expensive hospital stays.
</P>
<P>
   Parent company CyberCare, based in Boynton Beach, Fla., has
revenues of $50 million from air ambulance, pharmacy and therapy
center businesses. But the stock run-up is driven by the electronic
house call's promise.
</P>
<P>
   CyberCare isn't alone in seeing a huge home care market.
Minnesota-based American TeleCare has been producing home care
systems, and Kodak just received FDA approval for its own device.
</P>
<P>
   ``CyberCare is a work in progress,'' said Bob Cerza, chief
operating officer of American TeleCare, a private company. ``To
their credit, they have created a tremendous amount of excitement
in investment markets. They have enhanced visibility for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The key for these companies is producing a system that can prove
cost-effective for insurers or home care companies, while making it
easy for patients to use, said Jon Linkous of the American
Telemedicine Association.
</P>
<P>
   While CyberCare has competition, it has the lone patent for
Internet transmission of the audio, video and medical data
combined, notes analyst Paul Bornstein of Connecticut Capital
Markets, which has a ``buy'' rating on the stock. ``No one has what
CyberCare has,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The invention arose from a telemedicine project at MCG. The
original technology hooked up physicians with patients at remote
sites for diagnoses of health conditions. But the early systems
were more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   For the home care project, Tech brought to the table its
engineering capabilities, and MCG its medical expertise. ``The
magic came by putting these two parts together,'' said Dr. Max
Stachura of MCG, one of the inventors.
</P>
<P>
   The Army made a $950,000 grant to the Tech-MCG project in 1995,
and it was matched by the Georgia Research Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot program in 1995-1996 installed systems in 25 homes in
Augusta, Ga. and in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original test did videoconferencing, blood pressure,
temperature, pulse, stethoscope, and weight, all on a touch
screen,'' said Stachura. Eventually the project needed business
expertise. ``We realized this was work that could be
commercialized,'' said Jean-Lou Chameau, dean of engineering at
Georgia Tech. In 1997, three companies bid for licensing the
technology. The winner was an investment group that eventually
became CyberCare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognized it would revolutionize the way health care is
provided,'' said David Richey, a company founder.
</P>
<P>
   They signed an agreement with the universities to license the
technology. The universities got a 10 percent stake each in
CyberCare, plus royalties based on future shares.
</P>
<P>
   The company was bought in 1999 by Medical Industries of America,
and the resulting company took the name CyberCare (now known
legally as Cyber-Care). The FDA is expected to approve the
technology in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most successful commercialization projects
ever at Tech,'' said Michael Burrow, who worked on the invention
there and is now the CyberCare engineering director.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sales engine must kick in. CyberCare is looking at
companies to manufacture the equipment. The first line of customers
is expected to be HMOs and other health insurers looking to lower
the cost of care and avoid expensive hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Potential customers will include home care companies. A visiting
nurse in a car can do five or six home visits a day, Richey said.
``With this, a nurse can do 20 to 25 of those visits a day.''

<P>
   Other buyers could be assisted-living centers, schools, prisons
and individuals. Richey said the company has also talked to
Wal-Mart about putting telemedicine booths in its stores.
</P>
<P>
   The colleges, meanwhile, plan to reinvest their CyberCare money
in research programs. Tech has distributed about half its stake to
about 10 inventors, while MCG plans to give about five people 35
percent of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remarkable sum of money that has been generated by
both universities,'' said Matthew Kluger, vice president for
research at MCG.
</P>
<P>
   Along with seeing the commercial application of the research,
Peifer said, ``We've enjoyed watching the stock go up.''

 &HT;    Bringing NASCAR home
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR games are for gearhead geeks; that's why Electronic
Arts' NASCAR Rumble ($50; www.ea.com; for the Playstation) was such
a welcome addition to our collection of driving games. This NASCAR
game injects a little humor and a whole lot of arcade action into
really cool game. You take on the role of a NASCAR star and guide
him to championships using cars, trucks and hot rods. Throughout
the game are cool powerups (including Nitro, Freeze and Sonic
Boom), hidden cars and hidden courses. The great thing about this
game is that EA has taken the serious racing game and added a bunch
of Wahoooo! to it.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Want some action with those pretty graphics? Activision's
Battlezone II: Combat Commander ($50; www.activision. com) delivers
the goods with gorgeous, other-worldly landscapes to cruise around
in and fight through with combat ships and on foot. But what about
the game play? Unlike 1998's Battlezone, the sequel eschews some of
the strategic elements to focus on the action, which isn't
necessarily a bad decision. The game plays very smoothly,
especially on faster machines. Unfortunately, the story isn't as
strong as the 1950s revisionism of the first game, and some of the
game missions are a little disappointing. But with a mix of
first-person shooting and spaceship combat, the game has some
fantastic moments and is worth a look.

 &HT;    WinZip a big help in extracting files
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An e-mail of the sort I just love to get came last
week. To begin with, it asked a question I could answer, and those
are always the best kinds of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, it came from a 72-year-old lady working with her first
computer, and on the Internet, no less.
</P>
<P>
   My correspondent was having trouble extracting zipped files she
had downloaded from the Internet. Her downloads were winding up on
her desktop, and so were her extracted files. I hope my advice
helped, and it struck me others might be able to make use of it,
too.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't too long ago I was still using good old PKZIP and its
brethren for archiving and unarchiving files. Now the market is
flooded with programs operating under license from that venerable
utility, making it Windows-friendly and much more user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The best of these is WinZip, and in fact my correspondent was
using it. I don't know which version she is using, but I'm using
the latest, which is Version 8.
</P>
<P>
   The other utility I use in this process is Windows Explorer (not
Internet Explorer), which is simply the housekeeping program that
comes with Windows 95 and 98. It's on your Start/Programs menu.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea, if you're going to be downloading programs
from the Internet, to use Windows Explorer to make a directory in
which to store them. It's also a good idea, by the way, to have
Norton Anti-Virus or some similar program checking them as they
come in.
</P>
<P>
   When you choose to download something from the Web, your browser
will present a dialog box asking you where to store it. Store it,
of course, in the directory you made for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is downloaded, start up Windows Explorer again. Find
your download directory on the left side of the split screen and
double-click on it. This will present a list of files on the right
side.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the zipped file you wish to unzip and double-click on it.
</P>
<P>
   If WinZip is installed, this will start it. It will present a
list of the files in the archive. If you wish to extract all of
them, simply click on the Actions menu and select Extract. You'll
get a dialog box asking where you want to put the extracted files.
You can have them sent to some other directory if you wish.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to extract all of them, just highlight the
ones you want before pulling down the Actions menu and then change
the order from All Files to Selected Files.
</P>
<P>
   That's all there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have WinZip, you can go to www.winzip.com and
download Version 7 or the beta Version 8. It's shareware, so if you
like it send in your $29. I assure you it's well worth the money.

 &HT;    A Furby fix sans fuzz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nothing says ``annoying fur-based creature''
like Furby, the Gremlin-like creature that took toy stores by storm
last year. Now, with the Furby CD-ROM Game ($10 for Windows,
www.hasbrointer-active. com), you can have a Furby of your own
sitting right on your desktop, chattering all the live-long day.
Even with five game activities, a Furby-to-English dictionary and a
set of virtual pet tools, the CD-ROM can get repetitive very
quickly. But for $10, it's cheaper than the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   IT MIGHT BE YOUR TYPE
</P>
<P>
   It's sort of odd typing out a passage from ``All the President's
Men'' to wacky game-show music, but that's one of the exercises
offered in Typing Tutor ($30 for Windows and PowerMac;
www.simon-andschuster.com). In addition to various arrays of finger
workouts, there are eight games designed to make learning how to
type a more painless process. Bottom line: Diverting enough, but
between the activities are the same drills any typist-in-training
has had to go through.

 &HT;    Inquiring minds eagerly cater to that box on the desk
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was once a time when I was a computer hobbyist.
My first computer came as a box of parts to be assembled _ an old
Altair that was as worthless as my most shiftless relative. But the
idea wasn't to use the computer to do work. Instead, it was enough
that rows of red lights flashed on its panel and there were toggle
switches to throw.
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, computers became more common and even
occasionally useful. By the time I was working as an advertising
copywriter, I wrote such masterpieces as ``Free Gift Inside'' using
a Macintosh computer. It was almost reliable and even encouraged my
laziness with cryptic error messages such as: ``Work session too
long, please quit.'' When that message appeared, I eagerly obeyed,
heading for the Mexican restaurant on the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone has a computer. And most of us are eager to do
right by them. We subscribe to computer magazines, watch computer
shows on television, buy books that openly call us dummies.
</P>
<P>
   We seem almost desperate to be well thought of by that box on
our desk.
</P>
<P>
   I often get e-mails from readers who worry about the darnedest
things, agonizing over questions that frankly don't much matter as
far as the health of the computer. But since the questions do
matter greatly as far as the mental health of the readers, let's
look at some useless computer questions. I'll tell you my own
answer to these subjective questions, but keep the good news in
mind. It really doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Should I turn off my computer or leave it on all the time? Turn
it on when you begin using it for the day and leave it on. When it
is time to go to sleep or leave for an extended period, turn it
off. It's true turning a computer on and off isn't good for a
computer, but the damage is slight and gradual. Turning it off when
you are away for extended periods protects the computer from big _
and much more harmful _ surges that happen when the power comes
back on.
</P>
<P>
   Which is better, an AMD or an Intel processor chip? I prefer the
Intel chip. But the AMD chip, especially its new Athlon, is an
excellent chip. It outperforms the Intel chip in many benchmark
tests. Both chips perform the same functions in much the same way.
But Intel is the standard, and most software is written
specifically for it. I doubt you'd ever have trouble with the
Athlon and _ if you prefer it _ that's fine. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Should I buy a Macintosh or a Windows PC? I use both and am
comforted by the fact neither is used to provide the computing
power for a heart/lung machine. If you use one or the other at
work, buy the same kind for use at home. If you don't use a
computer at work and don't have a personal preference, buy the kind
your most computer-savvy friend owns. That way, when you have
trouble _ and you will _ you'll know someone who can help.
</P>
<P>
   How powerful a computer do I need? Most computers for sale these
days are plenty powerful enough for word processing, e-mail and the
Web. If you play games, get the most powerful computer you can
afford. Games demand more from a computer than almost any other
task.
</P>
<P>
   Should I buy a brand-name computer, or is it OK to buy an
off-brand? The guts of a well-made off-brand computer (note the
well-made) are identical to the guts of a well-made brand-name
computer. What you are often paying for (besides the obvious markup
to pay for the advertising and marketing that created that brand
name) is the assurance of good technical support and customer
service. If you feel comfortable judging the merits of the parts
used in the off-brand computer and don't feel you need a lot of
hand-holding, it's safe to save the money. If you want hand-holding
and the assurance that comes with a brand name, buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Now you are free to worry about more important things, like how
you're going to pay for that new computer.

&HT;     OTTER RESCUED BY CONSTRUCTION CREW IS FLOURISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEREY, Calif. _ Construction workers building a house on a
cliff overlooking Monterey Bay three years ago heard piteous,
high-pitched squeals, sounding like a scared baby. They scrambled
down, and discovered a 5 1/2-pound sea otter wedged between rocks.
</P>
<P>
   They collected the baby otter, and carried it to the Monterey
Bay Aquarium. There the otter, along with another rescued female
pup, spent five months in a tank, growing strong on a special fish
and mineral diet. The two females were released into the wild in
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   About three months ago, the sea otter, golden with a grizzled
gray head and chest, and weighing 45 pounds, became the mother of
her own male pup, marking the first time the aquarium had seen one
of its 60 rehabilitated and released otters reproduce in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Aquarium scientists, who announced the birth Tuesday, were
ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like new parents. We thought we better start passing
out cigars,'' said Michelle Staedler, research coordinator at the
aquarium. ``That's probably the biggest milestone to date, not only
to see the otter integrate back into the population, but to mate
and reproduce.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monterey Bay Aquarium has taken on the return of animals to
the wild as a challenge, particularly as sea otter numbers decline.
Only 100 to 150 remain in Monterey Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pup's being born is promising work for the aquarium and
the work they're trying to do,'' said Michael Harris, a sea otter
biologist working for the California Department of Fish and Game.
``This is one of the primary goals _ to see that the animals they
rehabilitate go back into the wild and have a positive effect on
the population.''
</P>
<P>
   The rescued otter-turned-mother was not a typical candidate when
she was taken to the facility in March 1997 from south of Carmel
bundled in the arms of a burly construction worker.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't accept formula or bond with the humans who
sometimes tried to swim with her and teach foraging. But she was
comfortable swimming in a tank filled with natural sea water, where
her companion was the other female otter, seven weeks her senior,
with whom she was released in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Aquarium scientists keep track of the released otters by
searching in boats with binoculars and by following radio
transmitters attached to the animals. Through these devices, the
scientists know that the two female otters still keep company and
often rest on the same rocks near the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists worry about the declining numbers of otters, and the
quality of the natural world to which these otters return.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's official spring count
showed a population of 2,090 otters, a drop of 12 percent over
three years in the otter territory along the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   The otter population in California is listed as threatened under
the Endangered Species Act while Alaskan otters flourish. The Fish
and Wildlife Service might heighten protection in California, and
list the otter as endangered, which might bring in $8 million
sought by scientists to document the environmental hazards otters
face.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists blame disease and suspect problems from sewage, storm
runoff, oil and other pollutants. Other threats may be gill nets,
which are allowed under fishing regulations as close as 180 feet
from the shoreline, and traps used by the commercial fishermen who
catch live fish for market.
</P>
<P>
   A possible cause of the decline, some believe, is a scarce
supply of otter food such as shellfish, urchins and sea stars
perhaps related to changing ocean temperatures and weather
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Diseases also have taken a toll. Of the dead otters found during
the past several years, 40 percent have died of disease, said
Murray Dailey, parasitologist at the Marine Mammal Center in
Sausalito.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years, the protozoan encephalitis has caused
tremors and brain damage. A fungus causing San Joaquin Valley fever
started killing otters 10 years ago. And the spiny-headed worm,
found in seabirds and their feces, has been attacking otters for
the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's alarming that this is happening in such large numbers,''
Dailey said. ``It's happening to adult, mature animals that should
be able to withstand this sort of thing.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 &HT;    Storing photos on Web easy, even without a page
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that digital pictures are so common, many people
enjoy sharing these instant memories with friends.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a home page on the Web, that's easy to do. You can
either make the photos available to anyone who drops by your
personal page or place them in hidden directories so that just your
friends and family can see them.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you don't have a personal Web page, there are free
and easy ways to share your photos using the Web. There's a real
advantage to this over sending the photos as e-mail attachments
since _ if you want to send photos to nine friends _ that's a
lengthy process for you, and even to the friends who must take the
time to download them.
</P>
<P>
   By using the Web, you upload the photos one time, and your
friends can view the pictures when they have the time and the
inclination.
</P>
<P>
   One site that provides free storage place for photos to be
shared has a terrific name that says it all: The Digital Fridge.
You'll find the site at www.thedigitalfridge
</P>
<P>
   .com/. You can either post your pictures to areas called
``digital fridges,'' where anyone can see the photo, or put the
picture in a private area where a password is needed to view it.
You don't need fancy software to upload your pictures, nor do your
friends need it to view them. The community photo areas, by the
way, are divided into categories such as family, pets, sports and
work, as well as many others.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called Zing _ Free Online Photo Albums, E-mail
Greeting Cards and Digital Picture Storage. It's located at
www.zing.com/. There are some similarities with the first site,
including ease of use and the fact the Web site automates the
process of uploading photos (an important service, since many
novice computer users freeze at the thought of uploading or
downloading information).
</P>
<P>
   But Zing takes things beyond the ability of sharing your photos
with friends over the Web. You also can order regular prints of
your digital images (at prices that are comparable with what you'd
pay locally) and create photo greeting cards, using stock images
that you find at the site or with your own pictures. You also have
the option, again, of buying printed versions of your cards.
</P>
<P>
   MyFamily.com is geared to, you guessed it, families. The site,
at www.myfamily.com, lets you store photos on a free Web page.
You'll get automated help in creating family photo albums (as well
as other services geared to families, including help creating a
family tree). This is another free site, and it's packed with
features, including the ability to share computer files as well as
photos.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other sites reviewed here, the money comes from
advertising you'll see on the site and added services that are
offered for money. For instance, this site has a gift center where
you can order family-oriented gifts.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL MEMORIES AT WWW
</P>
<P>
   .globalmemories.com/ makes no bones about it: You pay to use
this site as a way to share your photos.
</P>
<P>
   But the reasoning _ no telling whether it's a good enough reason
or not _ is that you also can store videos here for sharing. Videos
take up a lot more space than still photographs.
</P>
<P>
   For $99 you can store five minutes of video and 10 photographs
for six months. (There are other price plans, too. Check out the
Web site for a complete list of prices).
</P>
<P>
   There also are related services offered, including video
production work.

 &HT;    Don't despair if you haven't seen the movie or read the book
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We are supposedly a nation too busy for anything but
work. Banks have become ATMs. Grocery stores stick prepared dinners
up front so workers can grab something quickly on the way home. Gas
stations let you pay at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   That's nice. But it's just toying with efficiency, really. If we
indeed are a harried nation, we should get serious about it.
</P>
<P>
   Movies, for example. Who has time to sit in the dark for two
hours? Why not get a nice summary so you can nod knowingly when the
latest trendy, independent film that sweeps the nation is talked
about at work?
</P>
<P>
   A Web site is here to help.
</P>
<P>
   www.rinkworks.com/movieaminute/ can trim the fat from your
leisure time; it will boil that latest plot down to a digestible
few sentences.
</P>
<P>
   As the promotional copy on the front of the Web site reads:
``Let's face it. There's a lot of movies out there and very little
time to watch them in. ... We've taken several classic and
contemporary movies and extracted the important stuff, cutting out
all the filler. (You'd be surprised how much filler there is
sometimes.) With our ultra-condensed versions of your favorite
films, you can experience whole movies in just one minute!''
</P>
<P>
   A movie such as last summer's ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a
horror flick about three people getting lost in the woods then
dying, was shot with a hand-held camera. It became infamous for
sending viewers speed-walking out of the theater, queasy from
motion sickness. The Web site reduces it to three tolerable
components:
</P>
<P>
   Actors: A twig! I'm scared!
</P>
<P>
   Audience: Get me some Dramamine.
</P>
<P>
   Actors: Thump.
</P>
<P>
   The end.
</P>
<P>
   More interested in the classics? How about ``It's a Wonderful
Life?'' The 1946 Frank Capra film is a holiday season staple. But
with shopping and wrapping and party-going, who has time to let
Jimmy Stewart figure out the meaning of life? The Web site helps by
reducing the story to the important points:
</P>
<P>
   James Stewart: I'm useless.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Travers: Don't say that. The happiness of the entire
universe depends on your existence.
</P>
<P>
   James Stewart: Hooray!
</P>
<P>
   The end.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``When Harry Met Sally,'' a film about two people
who annoy each other while falling in friendship before finally
falling in love.
</P>
<P>
   Sally: I hate you.
</P>
<P>
   Harry: That's your problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sally: I think I love you.
</P>
<P>
   Harry: I might love you.
</P>
<P>
   Sally: I hate you.
</P>
<P>
   Harry: Please don't.
</P>
<P>
   Sally: I love you.
</P>
<P>
   Harry: I love you, too.
</P>
<P>
   The end.
</P>
<P>
   The idea works well for books, too. The folks at Rinkworks.com
reduce tedious and time-consuming classic literature and bedtime
stories to something to be enjoyed in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cat in the Hat,'' a Dr. Seuss classic about two kids and a
mischievous cat, has lots of rhyming words that can trip up a
reader. Thanks to the Web site, the essential elements are
presented rhyme-free.
</P>
<P>
   Sally and Me: We're bored.
</P>
<P>
   (The Cat in the Hat shows up and wrecks the entire house. He
cleans it up just before Mom gets home.)
</P>
<P>
   Sally and Me: Let us never speak of boredom again.
</P>
<P>
   The end.
</P>
<P>
   Adult stories fit the format as well. Already a short book,
Ernest Hemingway's ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' a story about an
old man's struggle to haul in a big fish, is reduced to a three
tight, symbolism-free sentences: An old man catches a fish that's
too big for his boat. The fish gets eaten by sharks. Then he goes
home and dies.
</P>
<P>
   Or take ``Moby Dick,'' another story of one man's (Captain Ahab)
obsession with a large fish. It's required reading for most
schoolkids. But with ESPN and MTV and Ricki Lake and Sega, who has
time?
</P>
<P>
   Ishmael: Call me Ishmael.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ahab: Crew, we will seek the white whale and kill it,
because I am insane.
</P>
<P>
   Crew: Alas, your destructive obsession will be our undoing.
</P>
<P>
   (They almost find the white whale. Then they almost find the
white whale. Then they find it.)
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ahab: I stab at thee. I stab at thee.
</P>
<P>
   (Everybody dies except Ishmael, although this is no surprise,
because it was foreshadowed CONTINUALLY from the BEGINNING.)
</P>
<P>
   The end.

E-COMMERCE: INTERNET RESHAPES THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Photo NYT 1 and a graphic are being sent to NYT photo
clients. Nonsubscribers can make individual purchase by calling
888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Ball, president of Webcor Builders, a Silicon Valley
construction company, can smell inefficiency in a project _ even
before he walks around the job site to discuss things with the
foremen and supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   The tell-tale odor is the ammonia-like one that can fill a
construction trailer with each new shipment of revised blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   To Ball, whose $500 million-a-year company is based in San
Mateo, Calif., the very presence of blueprints indicates that some
members of the construction team have not yet embraced the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that those who have already entered the era of
e-construction can view architectural drawings online and print
relevant sections straight from their computers _ without wasting
time waiting for the drawings to be commercially printed, packaged
and delivered to the scores of participants in a given project each
time the plans get tweaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stinks,'' Ball said of the bad old blueprint era. ``It all
stinks. That's the whole point.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Ball and others on the vanguard, the air is
not clearing quickly enough. Many construction executives complain
that their industry has been among the last to embrace the
Internet, even though the medium offers a ready solution to their
thorniest problem _ how to coordinate the efforts of what sometimes
amount to hundreds of separate teams across the lifespan of a
project as the original plan evolves, doorway by redesigned
doorway, conduit by rerouted conduit.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Internet has begun to reshape the highest reaches of
the nation's $1.2 trillion construction industry. The nation's
biggest contractors, like Turner Corp. and Bechtel Group, have
started to use e-commerce sites like Bidcom and Cephren, which help
them communicate with partners and subcontractors and even buy
materials and bid for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Webcor, though perhaps one-fifth Turner's and Bechtel's size,
has joined them in incorporating the Web into its basic operations.
(The Web in Webcor's name predates the spread of the World Wide Web
by more than two decades; the company was founded in 1971.)
</P>
<P>
   Webcor is using the Cephren system extensively in building a $50
million, 12-story office tower in Santa Clara, Calif. The
building's owner, Tishman Speyer Properties, is based in New York,
but has employees in locations around the country who are involved
with the project. The architect, Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum
Inc., is in San Francisco, as is the engineer, Middlebrook and
Louie Structural Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Ball said the Cephren system was proving invaluable, enabling
the various parties to communicate ``without all the faxes, without
all the calls.'' He estimated the cost savings at $50,000, but said
it could have exceeded $200,000 if all the subcontractors and
suppliers were online. ``Right now, it's a good tool for us,'' he
said. ``Next year, it'll be more necessary for people to have on
our projects. In two years, it'll be absolutely mandatory.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, e-commerce has barely penetrated the industry's
second and third tiers, among companies with less than $100 million
in annual revenue, where most communication still occurs the
old-fashioned way _ with faxes, voice mail and overnight packages.
The result, executives and industry analysts said, is the loss of
billions of dollars in potential savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Construction has always been a very fragmented industry
because it's so local,'' said Kent Allen, an e-commerce analyst for
Aberdeen Group, a consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   So far only a fraction _ some $6.3 billion _ of the construction
industry's overall business is conducted online, according to
Forrester Research, which studies e-commerce. Even by 2004,
Forrester expects the online total to reach only $141 billion, or
less than 11 percent of total construction spending.
</P>
<P>
   Some construction executives cite a stubborn resistance in their
industry to any new approaches to business. Others suggest that the
Web's continued reliance on the personal computer makes the medium
impractical on many job sites (although at Webcor, hand-held Palm
computers supplement desktop and laptop machines). And some of the
holdouts say that the benefits of e-commerce sites have not yet
been made sufficiently clear to them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, enthusiasts say they have noticed a shift in the
attitudes of the biggest construction firms in recent months, and
they hope a trickle-down effect could compel more subcontractors to
catch the Web wave _ or face the prospect of losing work.
</P>
<P>
   Ball says Webcor now uses Cephren in connection with every new
construction project. As with other Cephren clients, Webcor pays a
start-up fee of $750 and a monthly fee of $1,250 to connect the
entire construction team, then receives passwords enabling all
parties to enter the portion of the Cephren site devoted to their
particular project. Cephren charges an initial $1,500 training fee
and offers support to clients during the life of a project, but
clients are primarily responsible for the site's content and
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The passwords allow for differing levels of access to
information and services. A midlevel manager on a building site,
for instance, might be able to post a request for information on
one area of the site, but might not be able to view the minutes of
the senior project-management team's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Such centralized communication is the essence of Cephren's
offering _ as it is with the company's chief competitor, Bidcom,
and smaller newcomers like Buzzsaw.com. Analysts generally regard
Bidcom, founded in 1997 and based in San Francisco, as the
construction-oriented Web site with the biggest following, with
Cephren close behind.
</P>
<P>
   These companies and others on their trail are also developing
marketplaces for their sites, which would include huge catalogs of
construction goods, as well auction services that would allow
suppliers to bid on various portions of a project. But for these
Web sites, the core component ``is the linking together of the
communications of dozens of companies, as they collaborate on
everything from design and engineering to management,'' said Jas
Dhillon, chairman of Cephren, which was formed in January by the
merger of eBricks and Blueline Online. The company uses Blueline's
former headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif., where Blueline was
founded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Web collaboration means that the most up-to-date blueprints can
be posted on the site, with e-mail notifications going out to
anyone who needs to know. Work schedules can also be e-mailed or
posted on a particular page on the site, so that different teams
can track how the job is proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, most of the construction Web sites also create a
virtual paper trail of the project _ including who has viewed what
information and when. If legal disputes arise, there is a
compendium of evidence about which parties were informed of and
accountable for what parts of the job.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the same information is vital to the building's
maintenance team after the job is completed. Rather than having
stacks of equipment manuals and building specifications stored in a
warehouse, the data can be compiled on disks or cartridges and kept
in a single desk drawer.
</P>
<P>
   It is during the construction itself, though, that the Web
offers the greatest advantages, Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can all work off of the same page. Before, I'd have to go
out to the job site, meet with people and ask them how things are
going,'' he said. ``Now, I know the answers to the questions before
I ask them.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, if everybody were using the system _ and not everyone
is. The steel subcontractor on one current Webcor project, for
instance, declined to sign up for the Cephren service. The supplier
was selected by the building's owner, anyway, because it had
submitted the low bid.
</P>
<P>
   But being offline meant that Webcor and the project engineers
``had to send paper back and forth'' to the subcontractor before
completing the specifications and placing the order for the 3,000
tons of structural steel required, Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Web site, he said, the structural engineers, the steel
subcontractor and the contractor could have worked on the plans in
tandem on the Web site. ``You get it done in one day, instead of
dropping a week'' each time the parties have to send the plans out,
review them and make changes offline, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ball said the losses from such inefficiencies depend on the
project. With an office building, ``if it takes another week to get
the project done because of that, there's another week that the
owner can't fill the building,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the rents being paid, it can be anywhere from
$100,000 to $200,000,'' Ball said. ``But there's not much I can do
right now. A lot of these subcontractors are still in the Dark
Ages.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is not stopping entrepreneurs and their investors, though,
from setting up sites on the assumption that such laggards will
eventually see the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of start-ups now with $5 million worth of
backing,'' said Carl Bass, chief executive of Buzzsaw.com. The
company was spun off from Autodesk, the maker of
computer-aided-design software, and last fall raised $15 million in
an initial round of financing. ``If you can quote the size of the
industry and spell AEC'' _ the industry acronym for architecture,
engineering and construction _ ``you can raise $5 million,'' Bass
said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that Buzzsaw would would be competitive because
Autodesk's AutoCAD software _ widely used by architects _ made it
easy to integrate the design and architectural drawings into the
Buzzsaw site easily. ``Design is at the headwaters of this whole
process,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   Some other sites are focusing on more narrow slices of the
construction industry, hoping to entice smaller subcontractors to
log on. One, NetClerk, in South San Francisco, means to give users
a way to navigate the municipal permit process. On the site, users
can find, complete and submit permits that municipalities require
before installing a water heater, for instance. So far, NetClerk is
operating primarily in the Bay Area, but has ambitions for a
national expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see more and more companies like ours pop up,
to make the entire process easier,'' said Jon Fisher, NetClerk's
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Sanders, an analyst with Forrester Research, agreed.
``Down the line a bit, these sites will evolve to the point where
they'll include players that are far upstream, like providers of
sawmill equipment,'' he said. ``Procurement will be in place, and
everyone will be plugged in along a virtual supply chain. It'll be
incredible to see how that drives efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, executives like Webcor's Ball plan to enlist the
support of building owners to persuade every subcontractor on a job
to get wired.
</P>
<P>
   As for that recalcitrant steel subcontractor that got the job
solely on the basis of a low bid?
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time I'll do a better job of convincing the owner to go
with somebody else who wasn't as low, but who'll save us money in
the long run by using this system,'' Ball said. ``It's the new math
of the Internet.''

TRAFFIC AND WEATHER GET REGULAR UPDATES. WHY NOT THE INTERNET?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (Eds: Susan Stellin is director of development for The New York
Times on the Web.) 
 By SUSAN STELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the midst of the recent service disruptions at several
high-profile Web sites, television viewers who tuned in to the
evening news might have noticed the decidedly technical turn the
programs had taken. For those who were otherwise engaged, picture
the incongruous image of a network television anchor earnestly
explaining the intricacies of the ``denial of service'' attacks
that shut down the likes of Yahoo, eBay and ETrade.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time the networks had broadcast stories
about problems affecting the Internet, of course. But the recent
news reports shed the bright light of mass media coverage on an
issue previously overshadowed by stories about highflying Internet
stock prices: The global network we have come to depend on is not
nearly as reliable as we would like.
</P>
<P>
   This is old news to anyone who has ever had trouble connecting
to America Online or typed an address into a Web browser only to
confront the message ``server unavailable.'' But the extent of the
recent media coverage of the issue raises a question: How long
before some type of ``Internet update'' joins traffic, weather and
stock market reports as a staple in our daily media diet?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, if after telling listeners about delays on a local
freeway, the weather forecast and the closing levels of the Dow
Jones industrial average and Nasdaq, the drive-time radio announcer
continued with this update:
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet traffic continues to be slow nationwide after a
backhoe cut through a fiber cable east of Cleveland. There are
scattered rubbernecking delays after the Victoria's Secret Webcast.
And word is just in that a security alert from the CERT
Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon University warns that a new
version of last year's destructive Chernobyl virus has turned up in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Stephens, a professor of journalism and mass
communication at New York University, said he could imagine some
type of Internet report becoming commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense,'' he said, ``we move on the Internet, and
anything that obstructs our traffic is newsworthy depending on the
number of people it affects.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stephens said it might be too early to predict what focus a
regular update about Internet traffic might take. ``Is it going to
be security concerns or is it going to be traffic tie-ups? What the
regular `Internet feature' is going to be isn't entirely clear
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, it is not yet clear what medium consumers might
turn to for this information, or which medium would be most suited
to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Internet news feeds might be most likely to provide updates
about service disruptions at isolated Web sites. But in the event
of a more widespread problem, consumers might not not even be able
to log on to get this information.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens noted what happened during the power blackout in New
York City in 1965, when some broadcasters were off the air. ``Not
only did things go black, but the form of information to tell you
why it had gone black wasn't available,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, in any case, the best place to find information about
Internet traffic flow, and problems that may have disrupted it, is
online. Typically, it is not all in one place, and you have to know
where to look to find useful data.
</P>
<P>
   The aptly named Internet Traffic Report
(internettrafficreport.com), published by Andover.Net, is one of
several sites that monitor the flow of Internet data. Using a test
called a ping, the site measures how long it takes data to travel
from one point to another and back and then posts average response
times for various regions.
</P>
<P>
   For someone whose Internet connection seems to be lagging
behind, this information can shed light on whether the problem is
global or local, though it may not necessarily explain why a
collector eager to unload a truckload of Fiestaware cannot call up
eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Twickler, the president and chief executive of
Andover.Net, said the Internet Traffic Report was more a hobby than
a core part of the company's business, which has shifted toward
providing resources for Linux software developers.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether some type of Internet report would ever become a
media staple, Twickler said the determining factor would be the
level of interest. ``It's not a technical barrier,'' he said.
``It's who wants to know and why _ and up until the last couple of
years no one would have cared.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at companies whose core business is measuring
Internet traffic said there was now a higher level of interest in
the data they collect _ but more from the perspective of
corporations than consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it ever becomes important to the consumer,'' said
Lloyd Taylor, vice president for operations at Keynote Systems
(www.keynote.com), which provides Internet performance measurement
and consulting services. ``If I can't get to Amazon.com, is my
natural inclination to go to some Internet weather site or just go
try Barnesandnoble?''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Keynote Systems offers a variety of charts on its
Web site that could be of interest to consumers, like the average
time it takes to execute a stock transaction at various Web
brokerage firms. The company also distributes the data it collects
through the trade publication Internet World and USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Peter H. Salus, editorial director of Matrix Information and
Directory Services, which publishes the Internet Weather Report
(www.internetweather.com), contends that the network performance
data his company gathers is relevant to consumers, but shares some
of his colleagues' skepticism about whether people care. ``People
don't seem to want to know the technical details of how their baby
pictures get to Grandma,'' he said, ``but they do want to know that
they get to Grandma.''
</P>
<P>
   Salus said the information his company published was primarily
of interest to Internet service providers, multinational
corporations and financial services companies that must ``keep
track of slowdowns in trades where a matter of minutes can be
millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The average Internet consumers have much less at stake. Unlike
drivers stuck in a traffic jam, they also have much less ability to
devise a route around whatever is causing the delay.
</P>
<P>
   But Salus expects consumers' level of interest in network
traffic to rise, particularly as more bandwidth-sapping
technologies become part of their daily lives. And Salus, for one,
would be happy to provide media outlets with the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to talk to Don Imus and tell him where the traffic
is,'' Salus said, ``and then he can curse at the ISP's.''

INTERNET USERS: ISOLATED, MAYBE, BUT NOT SO DIVIDED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Stanford University survey on the social impact of the
Internet sparked debate last week because of its contention that
the rise of the global computer network is leading to a new wave of
social isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Internet enthusiasts rose en masse to complain that the study
overlooked the community-building aspects of the Internet. They
rejected the idea that more time spent in front of computers means
more isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Largely overlooked in the uproar was another striking finding
made by the researchers: that the so-called ``digital divide''
between higher-income individuals with access to information
technology and others who lack such access is largely a myth.
</P>
<P>
   According to Norman Nie, a Stanford political scientist and a
former Gallup Poll researcher, the most significant variables in
predicting Internet access at home or at work were education and
age. College education increased the rate of Internet access by
more than 40 percent, and Internet access was 40 percent more
common among people under 25 than among those over 65. High-income
individuals were 21 percent more likely to have Internet access,
while women, blacks and Hispanics had lower rates of access by just
4 percent, 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively, than the average.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was conducted by the Stanford Institute for the
Quantitative Study of Society, polled 4,113 individuals and 2,689
households, including both Internet users and nonusers. The
researchers found that overall, some 55 percent of those surveyed
had Internet access at home or at work and that 43 percent of
households were online.
</P>
<P>
   It also found that age differences in Internet usage reflect
generational differences, suggesting that Internet use will
increase sharply over time.

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ The Beatles never got back together, but
four members of the original Apple Macintosh team are regrouping.
And they mean to take the best of the quirky Apple computer and
move it to the world of Linux software.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Hertzfeld, Mike Boich, Susan Kare and Guy Tribble are busy
trying to re-create the innovative tone originally set by Apple
Computer's founder, Steven Jobs, when he led a band of renegades to
design the Macintosh in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They work in a low-slung, nondescript office building here,
filled with Silicon Valley-style cubicles and adorned with the
ubiquitous penguin mascot of the Linux free software movement. They
plan to take some of the best ideas on computer ease of use and
blend them into a new visual desktop interface for Linux. With
others in the movement, their goal is to transform the Linux
operating system, which has been designed and maintained by a
rag-tag group of computer hackers, into a direct desktop competitor
to Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The group founded Eazel Inc. last fall with financial backing
from the Silicon Valley angel investor Ron Conway and the former
Apple and Macromedia executive John Colligan. Mike Homer, a former
executive for Apple and Netscape, is also on the board. This
summer, Eazel plans to begin offering a free user interface _ an
icon-based software control system that can be downloaded from the
Internet _ that they say will give Linux an ease-of-use advantage
over Macintosh and Windows-based computers.
</P>
<P>
   Eazel's biggest coup to date has been in persuading Tribble to
leave Sun Microsystems, where he had been chief technology officer
for Sun's alliance with Netscape. Known as a brilliant software
designer who made significant contributions to the original
Macintosh, introduced in 1984, Tribble followed Jobs two years
later to Next Inc. There, he led the design of the software
interface for the Next system, before joining Sun in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Eazel faces a serious challenge. Microsoft has just begun
shipping a more robust version of its Windows operating system,
Windows 2000, and Linux has only a minuscule share of the market
for desktop personal computers _ the primary market for Eazel's
Linux interface.
</P>
<P>
   Linux's strength to date has been in the market for server
computers _ network machines on which the user interface and
popular desktop applications are much less important. Currently,
Linux has a 25 percent share of the server market, compared with 38
percent for Windows. But on the desktop, only 4 percent of the 99
million operating systems sold in the United States last year were
Linux, according to International Data Corp., a market research
company.
</P>
<P>
   But for Andy Hertzfeld, a programmer whose business card reads
``software wizard,'' market share is not necessarily what matters.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the hardware designer Burrell Smith, Hertzfeld was
the very soul of the original Macintosh development team, a group
of computer designers who professed a passionate belief that their
new computer would change the world. But after Jobs was forced out
of Apple by its former chief executive, John Sculley, in 1985,
Hertzfeld became disillusioned by the company's corporate politics.
</P>
<P>
   He left Apple and began pursuing software design for non-PC
based computing devices, like intelligent stereo systems. In 1990
he helped found General Magic, a design effort underwritten by
Apple, Sony and other consumer electronics companies intent on
devising a hand-held wireless computer.
</P>
<P>
   After General Magic failed, Hertzfeld turned his programming
explorations to the World Wide Web. Then, in January 1998, he
noticed Netscape's announcement that the company would freely
distribute what it called the Mozilla version of Netscape's browser
software for use by the so-called open source programming
community.
</P>
<P>
   Open source code _ free distribution of the underlying program
instructions for software, so that other programmers can pursue
further development _ is one of the basic principles behind the
open or free software movement that Mozilla and, even more
important, Linux, came to represent.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzfeld had known Richard Stallman, one of the founders of the
free software movement, for more than 15 years. But Stallman had
always struck him as a ``kook,'' he said. When Hertzfeld himself
began to rethink the idea of free software, he concluded that
Stallman was a visionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became so obvious to me,'' Hertzfeld said. ``The shared
software infrastructure should be owned by the community. It's
beautiful and it's correct. And so I started working in the free
software world.''
</P>
<P>
   Completely free software, of course, will not pay the rent. So
last summer Hertzfeld began to think about the idea of turning his
passion into a business. With Mike Boich, another early Macintosh
programmer who had gone on to start several Silicon Valley computer
hardware companies, Hertzfeld searched for a way to combine the
free-software philosophy with a for-profit business.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Bart Decrem, a Stanford law school graduate who had
created a nonprofit technology access center in East Palo Alto,
Calif., the two former Macintosh designers struck upon the idea of
designing a free user interface for Linux and then selling a highly
automated form of Linux service and support on a subscription
basis. The Eazel team persuaded Susan Kare, a graphic artist who
designed icons for the original Macintosh and also for Microsoft,
to join their effort.
</P>
<P>
   There are now at least 140 competing distributors of the Linux
operating system, and both Microsoft and Apple are already pursuing
similar Internet-based software-support ideas. So Eazel could have
trouble distinguishing itself in an already crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   But Hertzfeld contends that by automating many of the
system-configuration and management tasks that are now barriers to
ordinary computer users, the Linux community can achieve the same
kind of growth on the PC desktop that it is now seeing in the
computer and Internet server markets, creating a market big enough
for many players.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts say that Eazel's timing may be right, if
the Linux movement can build the kind of popular applications that
are now largely dominated by Microsoft in the PC industry _
programs like word processors, spreadsheets and databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eazel is at the right time,'' said Dan Kusnetsky, an operating
system analyst at International Data. ``Nobody has made a major
impact on the desktop with Linux yet because the barrier has been
applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Eazel has formed an alliance with the group of Linux programmers
who developed the Gnome interface for the Linux operating system.
Under this pact, the Eazel team has taken responsibility for the
appearance _ the ``look and feel'' of the program that serves as
the control panel for the Linux operating system _ while the Gnome
group will concentrate on the internal plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   The Gnome programmers are led by Miguel de Icaza, a Mexican
software programmer who is the guiding light behind one of the two
main user interfaces in the Linux world. The other main interface
is a desktop manager system known as KDE _ for K Desktop
Environment _ which is also widely used by Linux programmers. But
Hertzfeld's programmers decided that the Gnome team more closely
matched their style and perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gnome just resonated with my spirit,'' Hertzfeld said, while
acknowledging differences between the older, original Macintosh
people and the younger, free-software hackers. ``It was a little
bit strange meeting them,'' he said. ``We felt like graybeards and
they seemed like teen-agers.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the year-old relationship has not been painless. The
two groups talked about, then rejected, the idea of merging, and
they have quibbled over various technical issues. In the end,
though, Hertzfeld said he believed that the two teams' ability to
reach an accommodation illustrates the strength of the Linux
programming movement.
</P>
<P>
   De Icaza, in turn, has started his own company, aiming at the
heart of Microsoft's dominant Office suite of business-productivity
application programs. His company, Helixcode, based in Boston, is
finishing a free Linux competitor to Office that includes a word
processor, spreadsheet and mail and calendar program.
</P>
<P>
   But de Icaza remains cautious about how quickly the Eazel-Gnome
alliance will be able to mount a direct challenge to the world's
largest software company in the operating system market. ``I'm not
so sure how vulnerable Microsoft is,'' he said.

NPR STARTS A MUSIC PROGRAM STRICTLY FOR INTERNET USERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   National Public Radio has quietly inaugurated its first
Internet-only radio program.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Songs Considered,'' available in a streaming audio format
from the show's Web site (www.npr.org/programs/asc), features
full-length versions of the brief musical excerpts heard between
segments on NPR's ``All Things Considered'' news magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Although NPR makes some of its on-air shows available through
its Web site, the leap by a major radio organization into
Internet-only programming helps validate the concept of using the
Web to ``narrowcast'' to a smaller listener base.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Boilen serves as the disc jockey for ``All Songs
Considered.'' The first hourlong program made its debut in January,
and a second show is due to arrive online later this month. As one
of the directors of ``All Things Considered,'' Boilen selects the
dozen or so musical snippets _ known in the radio industry as
``buttons'' _ that can be heard on the daily two-hour news program.
</P>
<P>
   Boilen, who is 46 and has worked at ``All Things Considered''
for 10 years, said listeners' enthusiastic reactions to the buttons
inspired him to start the Web-based show. ``People are
music-starved,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``They like this
music because it's not like music you can hear anywhere else on the
radio. We play music from all over the world, and from all
different eras.''
</P>
<P>
   The first show includes an ethereal song by a Scandinavian
vocalist and a lush orchestral version of a Paul McCartney tune.
Boilen, who serves as the online show's host, and his producer,
Bill Deputy, also picked tracks by performers who have been
interviewed or reviewed on ``All Things Considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Pezzillo, founder of GoGaGa.com, one of the first
Internet-only radio stations, said NPR's online show confirmed
``that Internet radio is a force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first,'' Pezzillo said, ``the major radio groups regarded
the Internet as a novelty, but this is clearly yet another sign
that they need to take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Boilen and Deputy are still experimenting with the
length of each ``All Songs Considered'' program and debating how
often to put up a new show, the service has yet to be mentioned on
``All Things Considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, they have plenty of music from which to choose.
Boilen and Marika Partridge, the other director of ``All Things
Considered,'' select 60 to 80 buttons each week. The buttons serve
as transitions between news stories, help end segments at precise
times and sometimes add an emotional or reflective element to a
piece. ``It's the glue that holds the show together,'' Boilen said.
</P>
<P>
   Boilen said his office at the show's studios in Washington had
been taken over by 4,000 to 5,000 compact disks. He picks the day's
buttons about 30 minutes before the radio show goes on the air.
``Sometimes a piece of vocal music is too overt'' in its meaning,
he said. ``An instrumental lets you fill in the blanks.''
</P>
<P>
   But the short excerpts can be hard to identify, prompting a
daily flood of letters, e-mail messages and phone calls to NPR and
its 600 affiliate stations seeking the identity of a song or
artist. Some hum the tunes, others send in chord structures.
</P>
<P>
   Since December 1995, button titles have been listed on NPR's Web
site. But because of music-licensing restrictions, the buttons are
not played on the Web version of ``All Things Considered.'' For the
new online program, however, the necessary licensing arrangements
have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the ``All Songs Considered'' site will find
information on each recording and, where possible, a link to the
label that issued it. But to avoid the appearance of journalistic
impropriety, Boilen said, the site does not send people to online
music vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Boilen is considering adding multimedia elements to the site,
perhaps a montage of photographs submitted by visitors that would
appear while a song plays. But for now, the music remains the most
important element.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm passionate about this,'' Boilen said. ``Each one of these
songs is a piece of art. But the way radio is today, this music
will never get heard. It's just out there in the wind. I just want
to give people a chance to taste it.''

POLICING THE INTERNET: ANYONE BUT GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The attacks on eBay, Yahoo, Etrade and other big Web sites
earlier this month showed the Internet to be surprisingly
vulnerable to a few laptop-toting cyber-vandals. This is a pressing
public concern, surely, as the nation increasingly comes to rely
for commerce and everyday communication on this chaotic, global
computer network.
</P>
<P>
   But when President Clinton met last Tuesday with more than two
dozen representatives of the Internet community, a big role for
government was not on the agenda. The president asked what could or
should the government do. Not a lot, the Internet elite told him.
The group's message: It's an industry issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in that room was asking the government to fix this
problem,'' said Nicholas Donofrio, senior vice president for
technology at IBM, who attended the meeting in the Cabinet Room of
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering epitomized the main thrust of government policy in
the Internet arena. Government, the theory goes, should offer a
forum and be a cooperative partner, so as to facilitate the rapid
rise of Internet commerce. That stance was set in a July 1997
policy document on e-commerce written by Ira Magaziner, a senior
White House policy adviser at the time. His document extolled the
``breakneck speed of change in the technology'' and stated,
``Government attempts to regulate ((the Internet)) are likely to be
outmoded by the time they are finally enacted.''
</P>
<P>
   The hands-off approach, however, will be challenged more and
more as the Internet moves rapidly into the mainstream. For just as
the Net creates new forms of commerce, it also opens a door to new
forms of crime. And the malicious hackers who recently brought down
the big commercial Web sites by jamming them with a flood of bits _
a tactic known as denial-of-service attacks _ are but one example.
</P>
<P>
   Online con artists are doing a booming business. In a report to
the Justice Department in January, the National Consumers League
warned, ``The Internet has become the new frontier of fraud.'' The
Federal Trade Commission, for example, reports an alarming surge in
consumer complaints of fraud on Internet auction sites, to more
than 10,000 last year from about 100 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Yet combating such crimes seems to be among the easier Internet
issues to handle. Cracking down will require some new tools, new
skills and new forms of cooperation among federal and state
agencies. The FBI, Justice Department and FTC are increasing their
computer crime and Internet fraud squads. But the issue appears to
be mainly one of enforcement, not the need for new laws or
policies. The problem seems manageable, even familiar in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   Other new technologies, from cars to credit cards, have prompted
dire warnings that they would bring a flood of crime. In the early
1900s, the automobile was seen as an ideal means for bank robbers
and murderers to flee before police could catch them. Criminals did
use them, but police got their own cars and motorcycles, cars were
licensed and federal agents were allowed to pursue suspects across
state lines. Later, credit cards were seen as a license for fraud.
And, indeed, credit card fraud exceeds $1 billion a year. But law
enforcement authorities and industry have kept it a manageable cost
of doing business, amounting to roughly 9 cents for every $100 of
goods purchased by credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   The thornier policy issues raised by the Internet concern
privacy and antitrust matters. On privacy, the United States has so
far adopted a self-regulatory approach, letting the online industry
set its own policies for collecting personal data on computer users
who visit Web sites _ and for informing users of those policies and
how they can opt out. The FTC is monitoring the industry's efforts,
saying that self-regulation, if effective, is more flexible and
thus preferable to direct government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates and other critics say self regulation
gives too much power to Internet companies and too little to
consumers. The danger, they warn, is that increasingly
sophisticated software will soon allow marketers to track a user's
every mouse click and then match that information with demographic
databases to establish online profiles of individuals. Those
profiles could, in theory, be used to determine not only what
online marketing pitches people see, but also potentially what job
and education opportunities people are offered.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says such concerns are overstated. But the FTC
recently began investigating how medical Web sites handle personal
information. And last week, DoubleClick, the Internet's leading
advertising placement company, reported that the FTC was
investigating how the company collected and used personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the profiling technology disturbing _ this notion of
checking on consumer viewing habits without them knowing it _
especially if that information is then merged with other databases
so they can be identified,'' said Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the
FTC.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy issue is so sensitive that Robert Litan, an
economist at the Brookings Institution, recommends ``minimalist''
privacy legislation to engender consumer trust and ensure the rapid
development of E-commerce. The effect, he says, would be similar to
legislation in the 1970s limiting a person's liability to $50 if
his credit card is lost and used fraudulently, which eased consumer
worries about credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more innovative views of government's role in the
Internet era comes from Lawrence Lessig, an antitrust scholar and
the author of ``Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig argues that the headlong commercialization of the
Internet threatens its decentralization and openness _ the
technological ``architecture,'' as he puts it _ that has made
wide-open innovation, competition and free expression essential
features of the Internet. That core architecture, he explains, is a
network that has open access and public software standards so that
anyone can communicate over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig sees the efforts of cable television operators, who are
beginning to offer high-speed Internet service, to deny competing
Internet services access to their cable network as one such threat
to the openness of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government should be pro-active early on to make sure the
architecture of the Internet remains open,'' Lessig said. ``If you
get the architecture right, the regulation takes care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But other experts are skeptical of the need for much government
involvement, all the more so of the pre-emptive variety advocated
by Lessig. The answer they offer is to let markets work _ the
Internet being first and foremost an extremely efficient market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there a role for government and that policy must be
informed by the new technology,'' said Carl Shapiro, an economist
at the University of California at Berkeley. ``But the fact is the
technology is enabling an enormous amount of new competition and
breaking down barriers. The Internet is off and running, and for
the most part the government should stay out of its way.''

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE CLASS OF '93? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (bl)  
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ In the fall of 1995, two years after
graduating from Stanford University, Diane Barrum received a call
from her sophomore roommate, Srinija Srinivasan, asking her to join
a company recently founded by two other young Stanford alumni,
Jerry Yang and David Filo. The deal was this: In exchange for
18-hour days, grinding away in overcrowded conditions, Barrum would
get in early on a hot phenomenon called the Internet. But Barrum,
happily employed by a biotechnology company based in Seattle, said,
``I just was not ready to take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrum, as it happens, turned down the chance to be employee No.
30 at Yahoo, the wildly successful Internet portal, or gateway,
which has a current market value of about $82 billion. Now she is
back in Palo Alto and, after a hiatus of traveling and joblessness,
has recently joined an Internet start-up, too. ``Of course, I wish
I'd taken it,'' she said of the Yahoo job. ``One can only imagine
what I'd be worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Such tales of quick riches and missed opportunities can be heard
in many places these days, among people of all ages. But probably
nowhere else was the swift, unexpected divergence of fortunes
thrown into such stark relief as among Barrum and her peers in the
Stanford undergraduate class of 1993, who burst on the scene just
as the World Wide Web was coming into its own.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, only a small percentage of recent college graduates
have become Internet millionaires. But there are enough from elite
universities, like Harvard, MIT and Stanford, that they are
influential far beyond their numbers. A look at a sampling from
this one Stanford class _ among the earliest to have so many
success stories _ makes this phenomenon clear.
</P>
<P>
   The university says it does not track the wealth of its alumni,
but school officials acknowledge that many in the class of '93 have
become wealthy unusually early. It includes five of the six
founders of the Internet portal Excite (now Excite(at)Home); three
founders of the online retailer of sporting goods, FogDog; one of
the first employees of Yahoo; a pioneer of Trilogy Software; and a
top executive with LinkShare. Many of these 20-somethings are now
worth tens of millions of dollars, if not more. When the class
gathered in 1998, it donated $163,000, then the largest class gift
for a five-year reunion _ only to be surpassed last year by the
Internet-rich class of '94.
</P>
<P>
   In part, these technology Wunderkinder strike a chord with their
peers because they have achieved the dual aspirations that have
defined Generation X: being passionate about work and free from
authority. But their existence has also raised the whole
generation's visions of early wealth and, for some, served as a
nagging reminder of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation has made its money so young that it is almost
unnatural,'' said Alan Wolfe, a sociologist who heads the Center
for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. ``Whether
you are repelled by these young millionaires or attracted by them,
they cannot be ignored. In that sense they are icons for their
peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, in the heart of Silicon Valley, has turned out a
disproportionately large number of Web superstars. With top-rated
programs in science and engineering _ and almost 9 out of 10
undergraduates taking at least one computer course _ the
palm-lined, mission-style campus in Palo Alto has been ground zero
for the high-technology boom.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the class of '93, like Srinivasan and Barrum,
have seen their fates spun wildly apart by the Internet _ not so
much because of any particular differences in cleverness or
ambition, but because some of them happened to be very well placed
as the transformation began.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hennessey, the school's provost and former dean of the
engineering school, noted that 1993 was ``right on the cusp of the
Internet explosion.'' Like others on the Stanford faculty, he is
acutely aware that the success of the Internet has ushered in a new
era of student life.
</P>
<P>
   On its statistical face, the Stanford class of 1993 was almost
indistinguishable from its predecessors. It was split roughly 50-50
between men and women; about 7 percent of the class were
African-American; 17 percent were Asian-American. Students' majors
were not particularly skewed toward technology. Of the 1,730
degrees conferred, 6.6 percent were in engineering, 10 percent were
in economics and 16.7 percent in biology or human biology.
</P>
<P>
   But the more forward-looking graduates were ideally positioned
for the Internet economy. Not only had they been exposed to many
new technologies _ e-mail was nearly universal among Stanford
undergraduates by 1992, as were experimental high-speed
telecommunications lines _ but they also were entering the working
world well before the Internet sector was swamped with start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Rich alumni are nothing new for the university that graduated
William Hewlett and David Packard (class of '34), the founders of
one of Silicon Valley's first high-technology businesses. But not
so long ago, Stanford graduates expected success to take time.
</P>
<P>
   Herrant Katchadourian, a sociologist, is tracking an earlier
Stanford class, from 1981. In his book, ``The Cream of the Crop,''
graduates at their 10-year reunion reported widespread contentment
with their salaries, which averaged $54,000, roughly $18,000 above
the average then for college graduates. Many said proudly they
expected to earn as much as $1 million a year _ 10 to 15 years down
the road. Perhaps when he revisits them next year at their 20-year
anniversary for a new book, he will not find them so sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet has given the class of '93 and its successors a
far different timetable _ and even greater ambitions. Consider
Krista Rollins, 27, a 1993 graduate who is now vice president for
communications at Trilogy Software, based in Austin, Texas. She
once thought that her biggest career concerns would be salary,
title and the number of people she managed, but her idea of success
has changed. ``It used to be much more about the long term,'' she
said. ``Now it is about how to become very successful in the next
three or four years.'' By her mid-30s, or 40 at the latest, Rollins
hopes to be ``very financially independent'' _ that is, rich enough
to quit.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford faculty has noted the changing culture with mixed
emotions. James Montoya, vice provost for student affairs, has
sensed the acceleration in the student life cycle since the early
'90s, as undergraduates have moved to ``Internet time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be `I'll get out of school and travel and see the
world before I settle down,''' he said. ``But what I hear now is
`This is the time to join a start-up, before I get old and have
responsibilities, like a family.'''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, not every member of the class of '93 shares
this computer-industry intensity about striking it rich. According
to a class survey for the five-year reunion, some 12 percent called
high technology (separate from engineering) their field of endeavor
_ a big proportion, compared with most universities. But plenty of
other graduates were still in medical training or had begun other
careers, while some were taking time off to raise children. Still,
the existence of such sharply divergent paths has made young
graduates feel like players in some sort of modern lottery.
</P>
<P>
   THE PROGRAMMER: A Physics Major Makes Good
</P>
<P>
   Graham F. Spencer came to Stanford in 1989 with the intention of
becoming a physics major, but he was drawn more to computers. After
finishing school, he formed a company with five college friends to
build a software navigator for the newly emerging Web. Spencer,
whose major was computer science, is now acknowledged as the
programming genius behind the portal known as Excite.
</P>
<P>
   In the lean first years, he worked 80-hour weeks, getting by on
beans and rice. But before the company's initial public offering in
1997, Spencer netted 600,000 shares of Excite stock; his stake
would be worth $64 million at the time that the company merged with
At Home in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I deserve the money I have? I struggle with that a lot,''
the soft-spoken Spencer said. ``On some level, I'd like to believe
I have certain skills that have made me successful. But how can
being a little more competent at computer science make you so much
richer?''
</P>
<P>
   He describes himself as ``anti-ostentatious,'' saying he does
not go in for ``three cars a year and champagne.'' He and his
fiancee own a cozy new home in Palo Alto. In this money-flooded
valley, of course, plain-vanilla dwellings can run $1 million, but
this is no gizmo-filled palace; it is cramped enough that the
dining table occupies part of the living room.
</P>
<P>
   His great indulgence has been travel _ weekend trips to Vail,
Colo., to snowboard, or to Hawaii to surf. Recently, he and his
fiancee took a two-week trip to Italy, often staying in
$500-a-night rooms on the Amalfi coast. He also works at home
whenever he feels like it, padding around the house in his stocking
feet and keeping his Siamese cat company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his low-key lifestyle, Spencer acknowledges that money
has altered his relationships with peers. He met his fiancee at
Excite and said it made a difference to both of them that she had
her own substantial stock holdings and had ``earned'' her right to
partake of the lush life.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, after his hometown newspaper in Columbia, S.C.,
splashed his net worth across the front page last year, high school
friends, he said, started treating him ``like some sort of
billionaire, which I am definitely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer plans to retire by the age of 40; in the meantime, he
wants to get a better sense of how to live without organizing all
his time around work. ``I hope I get more comfortable with spending
money,'' he said wistfully. ``The problem is that the only people I
know well who have this kind of money are like me _ they just got
it. None of us knows what we want to do with it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as if Spencer is waiting around for legitimacy. He
has sold less than 5 percent of his stock and still puts in long
hours at Excite as a kind of superprogrammer. While he says he is
``basically a volunteer'' _ meaning that he does not have to work
if he does not want to _ he says he feels inextricably tied to the
long-term success of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deliberately try not to keep score on my own net worth,
because that is gross at some level,'' he said. ``I want to feel
that we've built something sustainable, something great.''
</P>
<P>
   THE E-RETAILER: Lots of Money But No Dates
</P>
<P>
   At 27, Robert Chea, founder of FogDog, does not look a day over
19 but has the poise of a 50-year-old chief executive. As the son
of Cambodian immigrants who struggled to put him through school,
Chea felt he had to be rich. ``I'd be disappointed in myself,'' he
said, ``if I did not make a lot of money.'' But even as a sophomore
in college, Chea wanted more than a fat bank account. He wanted
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he remembers, his concept of success came from an AT&AMP;T
commercial. The advertisement, which aimed to showcase the
liberating power of the company's digital technologies, showed
futuristic scenes of people receiving faxes in huts on tropical
islands. ``That was my measure of success,'' he said, ``to be at a
level where I had enough free time to sit on the beach, but was
still connected to the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The path to controlling his destiny almost eluded him. He
arrived at Stanford in 1989, interested in philosophy and
archaeology. But his mother nudged him toward electrical
engineering. Upon graduating, he applied to law school, thinking
that he would pursue a career as a patent lawyer. But through a
classmate's father, Chea got caught up in showing sporting-goods
makers how to use the Internet and eventually formed the company
that would become FogDog.
</P>
<P>
   Chea, by his own accounting, has worked terrifically long hours
seven days a week for five years. But the results are clear. Last
fall, FogDog moved its headquarters from a nondescript, cramped
office park outside San Jose, , to a glorious, light-filled loft
near Redwood City, complete with stainless-steel fixtures and blond
wood desks. It is the sort of office that Heather Locklear, the
``Melrose Place'' diva, would inhabit if she ever signed up to do a
sitcom about being chief executive of an Internet start-up. Chea
owns 1.15 million shares of FogDog, which went public in December.
The shares are now worth $10.25 apiece, making his stake worth
$11.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   There have been personal costs. In his five-year class reunion
book, for example, Chea said only half-jokingly that he had not had
a date in five years. ``It's by choice dammit,'' he wrote. At a
recent birthday party, his friend Andy Chen, FogDog's co-founder,
felt so bad for Chea that he invited all 70 employees to write down
names of date possibilities in the form of a classified ad, letting
Chea choose three.
</P>
<P>
   Chea no longer has any desire to live on a tropical island and
talk to his officemates _ essentially his whole social universe _
by phone. And he has less desire to absent himself from the
technology culture that so enthralls him. ``I can't imagine what it
would be like,'' he said, ``to be a lawyer and hear about the
Internet all the time and not get to participate in it.''
</P>
<P>
   THE NONCONFORMIST: Looking Beyond The Internet Life
</P>
<P>
   While the potential of the Internet economy has dazzled many
graduates, it has left a distinct minority of the 1993 class
feeling nonplused _ and left out.
</P>
<P>
   In another time, San Francisco might have seemed like a slice of
paradise to Elaine Romanelli, a music major who prides herself on
spontaneity and artistic aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bay Area landscape has changed greatly since the 1970s,
when Stanford was a center of radical student protest and San
Francisco a mecca of counterculture.
</P>
<P>
   Romanelli misses being part of a generation that followed its
heart, regardless of money. She has tried hard to hold on and
recreate a bit of that spirit. Her work life since college has
included being a co-founder of a business that provided ``haikus on
demand'' (two for a dollar) and quitting a respectable job in
marketing to try her hand at professional singing. She lives in a
dilapidated Victorian house in the grittier South End of San
Francisco and frequents a local cafe that is a sympathetic home to
creative types.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a Stanford graduate living in San Francisco, she has
not been able to avoid the Web rat race. ``The Internet is a
pervasive presence here,'' she said. ``Many, many jobs are
Web-based, and e-commerce just sort of permeates everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanelli is a petite woman with delicate features, and her eyes
flash when she is asked about the Stanford stars of the moment. She
is far from worshipful. ``The thing that gets to me,'' she said,
``is that the people getting wealthy are young, single boys.'' In
previous generations, she said, real wealth could take decades to
accumulate, but her peers ``don't have coping tools'' for the vast
sums they are now able to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are getting rich and spending their money on
`supersoakers''' _ as exceedingly expensive toys like Jaguars and
automated houses are known in the parlance of Silicon Valley.
``They don't have a sense of philanthropy or giving back to the
community _ or any community outside of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the Web leaves Romanelli cold, even a little
indignant. ``A society of people who write to each other solely by
computer is not my idea of utopia,'' she said. She has watched
friends and classmates devote themselves to Internet start-ups, and
she believes their lives are too narrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an insane amount of money, but also an insane amount
of work. It is like slave labor.'' The computer, she said, ``was
supposed to facilitate life; out here, it has worked the other way
around.''
</P>
<P>
   THE WEB EDITOR: Feeling Fulfilled In Love of Work
</P>
<P>
   Despite the financial gulf that separates Srinivasan, who joined
Yahoo, and Barrum, who did not, they remain comfortable friends.
There is no animosity or visible jealousy, just a tacit acceptance
of changed circumstances. For a dinner of take-out Indian,
Srinivasan pays and Barrum picks it up.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that, like many other young Stanford millionaires,
Srinivasan, who had an interdisciplinary major called symbolic
systems, eschews aggressive displays of wealth. She lives in a
loft-style duplex in one of the least fancy areas of Palo Alto,
among graduate students and Internet worker bees. She dresses in
print skirts with matching pastel T-shirts, a low-cost uniform of
working women everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   When she and Barrum, who majored in human biology, spread out on
the tan sofas in her living room to chat, they talk about family
(both are close to their parents), about friends from college and
about eventually juggling careers with children (both are single).
When it comes to money, both acknowledge they are more than a
little stunned at the turns of fate. ``Don't get me wrong _ Srinija
has worked very hard and I always knew she would be successful at
something,'' Barrum said. ``But I never thought she'd be a big deal
at a company at age 28, and she did not either.''
</P>
<P>
   Srinivasan, who as the fifth employee at Yahoo is probably worth
tens of millions (she will not say), concedes that her sudden
wealth has taken her by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked hard and I don't think I am dumb and I am deeply
passionate about my work,'' she said. ``But in no way has my effort
been proportionately rewarded. Emotionally, that is something you
have to come to terms with.''
</P>
<P>
   She considers herself successful, not because of what she is
worth, she said, but because she loves what she does. As vice
president and editor in chief of Yahoo, she leads a team that sorts
the ever-expanding constellation of Web sites into categories that
will make sense to subscribers. When tough calls arise at work _
like whether messianic Jews should be listed under Judaism or
Christianity _ she has stomachaches that keep her awake at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly spend my days in ways that I feel are engaging,
compelling and fulfilling and rewarding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrum nods at her friend's words. ``When I was living away from
Palo Alto, I felt there was all this excitement going on here and
all these young people having a real effect on so many companies,''
she said. ``I felt I was missing out. I came back not for the
money, but for the excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she adds that living life in the Internet center, it is
difficult to be 28 and not yet a success without occasionally
feeling uneasy. ``You can't deny that knowing people who have
gotten wealthy changes your perspective on some things,'' Barrum
said. ``I feel like I am falling behind in the race to buy a house,
a race to achieve monetary goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Will she have another shot at Internet riches? ``Yahoo is not
going to slip into the ocean,'' she said, ``but it is not going to
make a lot of millionaires anymore.''

IT'S SURE GETTING CROWDED IN HERE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Several of us Win98 users compared notes
(please don't tell Mr. Gates), and we are all experiencing similar
problems. For example, the task bar continues to display empty
buttons after a program is closed. Also, we are seeing programs
being terminated for invalid operations more frequently. Are you
aware of a problem with a Win98 update?
</P>
<P>
   _ Longing for OS/2
</P>
<P>
   DEAR LONGING: Problems with something from Microsoft? Surely you
jest! Why, Microsoft is a tribute to the far-reaching vision of one
determined, spunky young man with a gleam in his eye and ...
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's about as far down as Bill usually reads before
deciding to send out his special re-education squads. I think
something's going wrong with Windows 98, too, but nobody seems to
know what it is.
</P>
<P>
   I've had several letters from readers with similar problems.
Most report getting messages indicating system resources are
getting low, even though they have what they think is sufficient
memory. Sorry, but that memory has nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``System resources'' is actually a special, fixed chunk of
memory Windows uses for interface stuff, like those task-bar
buttons. When a program needs to use an interface tool, it gobbles
up some of the resource memory. It's supposed to let go of that
memory when it's finished, but that doesn't always happen. Could be
the program was terminated before it got the chance, could be bad
programming, could be a lot of things. You run out of resources,
though, and you crash.
</P>
<P>
   All of these problems cropping up at once points to something
like a recent Windows update that everyone has installed, or maybe
a new program that a lot of us have loaded. See if you can find any
common denominator.
</P>
<P>
   Not that that will fix your problem. We're all in the same boat
here, waiting for somebody _ Microsoft or whoever _ to admit
there's a problem and fix it. You can keep checking the Windows
update site, but why don't you and everybody else experiencing this
problem report it to Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   Go to support.microsoft.com/support/webresponse.asp and click on
``Submit a question using no-charge support.'' You'll have to get a
user ID and password, plus you'll be giving Big Brother Bill your
address and number, so if you feel squeamish, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need your product identification number, so I hope
you're not using bootlegged copies of Windows like me. Uh, I mean
like some innocent people unknowingly do.
</P>
<P>
   And if anybody finds out what's causing this mess, please let me
know, I'm tired of crashing in the middle of an Unreal Tournament
death match.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a cable modem, and tech support says I
have a dynamic IP address. I have read about cable modems making it
easy for hackers to enter your computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hacked Off
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HACKED: First of all, tell that support guy he's an idiot.
Cable modems are supposed to give you a static, or unchanging, IP
address, your own unique spot on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Because your address never changes, a hacker would know exactly
where to look, assuming you're a worthy target. To see if you're at
risk, go to grc.com and look for Shields UP!, which will report any
vulnerabilities. You'll also find a good review of personal
firewall software, which keeps bad guys on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   (Dr. Emilio Bombay has a static IP address, a firewall and a
large mallet with your name on it, so go hack Yahoo! instead.

EPSON PRINTER, H-P SCANNER GEMS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As more and more computer peripherals are released that use a
Universal Serial Bus, or USB, port, I am more and more impressed
with the technology. At this point, I've sworn off using the poky
serial and cantankerous parallel ports forever. So should you.
</P>
<P>
   As the year goes on, you'll begin seeing more computers that
don't even have these ``legacy'' connections. There are quite a few
out there already, including Dell Computer Corp.'s WebPC and Compaq
Computer Corp.'s iPaq and Presario EZ 2200. Folks who buy these
computers will need to get printers, scanners and other components
that have a USB connection. Their older devices will be useless.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of going legacy-free, as it's called, here
are a pair of good choices for handling printing and scanning
chores:
</P>
<P>
   _ Epson Stylus Color 860, $250, Epson America: While it's not
quite as thrilling as the competition in the graphics card arena,
there's a quiet little war being fought in the printer world.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, Epson had the richest colors and impressive
speed, although it achieved this speed in a noisy fashion _ its
printers grunted and snorted like a caged bull. Hewlett-Packard's
print quality was a little better, but its consumer printers were
slower.
</P>
<P>
   Then, starting last year, HP improved its speed so its printers
can match and even outdo Epson's. And the HP printers are
whisper-quiet. The color saturation also improved so the HP printer
output looked much richer.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Epson's turn. The company has started to release its
next generation of inkjet printers. These new models are faster
than before, with gorgeous quality, and they're much quieter.
</P>
<P>
   The Stylus Color 860 is aimed at businesses, but it's an
excellent printer for general home use. It easily has the best
photo-quality output I've seen, and gets it in your hands quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Epson has a resolution of 1,440 by 720 dots per inch, and
prints in black-and-white at 9.5 pages per minute, a figure that
roughly matched my own tests. The spec sheet also says it can
achieve seven pages per minute in photo-color mode, but I got about
half that. Still, being able to generate a large image in
photo-realistic mode at 3.5 pages per minute is pretty impressive.
</P>
<P>
   It will connect to your computer using either a USB or parallel
port connection, but you'll definitely want to use the former.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scanjet 5300c, $299, Hewlett-Packard: When you first take the
ScanJet 5300c out of its box, you'll probably think, ``Cool! This
must be a legal-sized scanner!''
</P>
<P>
   But no. Only the case is legal-sized; the scanning window
handles only 8{ -by-11 documents. Better have some spare desk space
available, because this model hogs some serious real estate.
</P>
<P>
   This is an update of HP's 5200 scanner series, one of its most
popular for consumer users who want high-quality scans. If you've
been laboring under a parallel port-based scanner that you bought
for $150 or less and feel the need to upgrade, this is an excellent
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The 5300c borrows an idea from Visioneer's line of One-Touch
scanners, putting buttons on the front of the device for specific
purposes. There's a button for scanning to an e-mail program, to a
fax machine, to make a printed copy and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The scanner can handle resolutions up to 1,200 dots per inch via
hardware, then can use software to achieve 9,600 dots per inch. Its
scans are beautiful, with near-perfect colors.
</P>
<P>
   HP's newest scanners have a nifty new feature that attempts to
tell the difference on a scanned page between text and images. When
passing the scan on to an optical character recognition, or OCR
program, this allows the page to keep its layout intact when being
moved into word processing software.
</P>
<P>
   The scanning process is not quite as fast as some other scanners
I've tested, particularly Visioneer's One-Touch 8600. And its
drivers are definitely not as friendly _ they load slowly, even on
a fast machine, and they don't allow for much tweaking of an image
before it's passed on to the receiving program.
</P>
<P>
   This scanner can also be used with a parallel port but, again,
you'll lose speed and reliability if you do so.

MOST HOME USERS NEEDN'T FRET ABOUT HACKER GETTING INTO FILES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Former CIA Director John Deutch has been accused of engaging
in the unsafe practice of using his unsecure home PCs, which
supposedly contained classified information he was not authorized
to download, to surf the Web. The inference here is that the
personal files of the ordinary PC user are at risk for being
viewed, stolen or corrupted when one is on the Internet. Is this
true?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have not seen details of his computer setup. But if he was
using America Online, as I've read, and had a simple dial-up
connection, he probably was safe.
</P>
<P>
   When you dial into most Internet providers or an online service
like AOL, you are assigned a number called an IP address. This
number is assigned to you from a block of them that are available
to the provider, and usually it is assigned at random. The number
you get when you sign on to the Net tonight will be different from
what it was last night.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it hard for a hacker to target you. In order to find
you, he or she would have to know the number. There are millions of
computers that dial into the Internet. This means anonymity for the
users, which keeps them from being targets.
</P>
<P>
   If a hacker were to stumble upon the right IP address _ or if
Deutch had a fixed IP address, as is the case with DSL and
cable-modem connections _ there are circumstances in which a user
is wide open. Those circumstances include having a home network and
binding File and Print Sharing to TCP/IP, the protocol used by the
Internet. A hacker who figured out the IP address could, in theory,
map your computer to look like a hard drive on his/her machine. But
again, this would be highly unlikely with a dial-up connection.
</P>
<P>
   There might be other ways to get to Deutch's computer. For
example, it's theoretically possible to create a rogue Java or
ActiveX program that could be embedded in a Web page. Someone
targeting a high-profile person like Deutch might be able to find
out his or a family member's e-mail address, then send him a link
to a booby-trapped Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Or a would-be intruder might send him or a family member an
attached program that, when run, looks harmless but plants a Trojan
horse on his machine. The hacker could then use the Trojan to
access his system.
</P>
<P>
   These risks can be avoided by simply being smart. Don't click on
links to unfamiliar Web sites sent to you by strangers. And don't
run executable programs sent as e-mail attachments, even if they
come from someone you know.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to read a column I wrote last year on DSL and cable
modem security, which deals with these issues in more detail, at
www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/tech/395376.
</P>
<P>
   You may also want to visit my Big Pipes page, which deals with
high-speed Internet access and has links to sites that deal with
security. It's at www.dwightsilverman.com/bigpipes.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Help! I have lost the toolbars I'd set up on my Windows 98 SE
desktop. When I right-click on the taskbar, the Toolbars option is
grayed out. How can I get them back?
</P>
<P>
   A: You probably have TweakUI on your system, a Control Panel
module that lets you customize Windows 95 and 98. The Windows 98
version includes a tab called IE4. Click on that tab, and find a
check called ``IE4 Enabled.'' Chances are, this is not checked.
Click to check it, then click Apply.

PUSHING AND PULLING FOR AN URBANE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Darien Dash has piled on the gold chains and partied
with Puffy, then put on his three-piece suit for a Rose Garden
briefing with President Clinton on the perils of Internet
illiteracy in black and Hispanic communities.
</P>
<P>
   He has huddled with the secretary of commerce, William Daley,
and communications czars like AT&AMP;T's Michael Armstrong to discuss
``the digital divide'' _ the one where 41 million white Americans
but just 5 million blacks have access to the Internet. Then he has
headed home to Hackensack, N.J., to help bankroll a hip-hop anthem
(``No Pigeons,'' which sold 700,000 copies last year).
</P>
<P>
   He has accepted the post of ``technology chair'' for School
District 5, in Harlem, along with the directive to put a computer
on every desk. The appointment came 10 years after he returned home
from school, a kid himself, to find his father, a methadone addict,
dead of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   At 28, he heads the first-ever publicly traded, black-owned
Internet company, and he's also the happily married head of a
frenetic household that contains three children under the age of 7.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the hats, some of them virtual and some the real
thing, worn by Dash, who is to black American entrepreneurs on the
World Wide Web what Martha Stewart is to the lifestyle scene:
ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   He's an Internet missionary worth millions. Last time he peeked,
his salary was $250,000, and his net worth reached an amount that
leaves him at a loss for the Dale Carnegie eloquence that usually
comes so naturally. ``Um, ah, a lot, about $110 or $115 million,''
he guesses, nearly strangling himself with the earpiece cord for
his car phone, which he wears even when not in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Dash can filter in some Ebonics, the better to keep in
tune with his juvenile audience and rapper acquaintances (he made _
and spent _ $100,000 during his sophomore year of college when he
and a cousin, Damon Dash, teamed up as managers and snagged
inaugural record deals for the rappers Jay-Z and Original Flavor).
But the lawyer-speak that came with his political science degree
from the University of Southern California has been handy in
navigating the boardrooms of mainstream clients like Reader's
Digest, Visa, and Otis Elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Still, according to Dash, whose hipper clients include Queen
Latifah, the heart of his business is delivering something the next
generation of blacks and Hispanics won't successfully negotiate the
21st century without: Internet access and customized content for
minority households, 71 percent of which are Internet-less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thing is, get connected, get plugged in, or get shut
out,'' says the slogan-conscious Dash.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Dash, whose mind moves as fast as his name suggests,
describes the straws that stirred the drink for entrepreneurial
youth, himself included, on the street: ``In the '70s, the game was
pimps and prostitution and hustling, in the '80s the game was
crack, in the '90s the game was sports and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in 2000, the game is technology. That's the new hustle.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we define it,'' he adds, indicating two dozen workers
communing with their computers in a 28th-floor suite just off Wall
Street. Of the 50 or so technicians he employs here and at his New
Jersey office, just two are over 35, and one of those is his
mother, Linda.
</P>
<P>
   ``She watches my back,'' he says. ``And she signs my paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Last February, in step with Black History Month, his
six-year-old company, DME Interactive Holdings, became the first
publicly traded black-owned Internet entity in a reverse merger
that left Dash with 66 percent of the company's stock. On Monday,
again with a nod to Black History Month, Dash announced a
partnership with America Online, which has taken a minority stake
in DME to start Places of Color, an online service for urban
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL was the vehicle that first put 20 million Americans
online, and we're like the urban version of AOL,'' says Dash.
``We're going after a $700 billion market that's 75 percent
unpenetrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Dash is convinced that his Internet inroads may help his
customers avoid some wrong roads. He says that if he hadn't had a
stepfather _ the Casablanca Records executive Cecil Holmes, who
taught him the value ``of hard work and walking the straight and
narrow'' _ he probably would have been sucked in by the same fast
track that ruined his parents' marriage and eventually killed his
father, Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the space of two weeks when I was 18, my father died, and I
was one of the first ones to find him; my dog died; my stepfather's
house in Paramus burned down; my mother and stepfather separated;
and my girlfriend, the woman who later became my wife, left me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was either going to turn to ice,'' he said, ``or have faith
and make something of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   First came USC, then a Madison Avenue marketing job. He sold a
digitally compressed 30-channel music service, took note of the
company's reluctance to install cable boxes in poor and minority
urban homes, and determined to start a business without those
prejudices. So far, so good. Now, his addiction to technology is
his only problem, and to solve it, he intends to retire at 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, how much money do you need, how many hamburgers can
you eat, how many cars can you drive?'' he asks. ``People say
`you'll never be able to leave this.' I say never say never.''

TAX DEBATE GROWS AS NET BOOM ROLLS ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROSS KERBER AND STEPHANIE STOUGHTON   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   E-commerce continues to boom as more consumers than ever click
on the ``buy'' buttons at Amazon.com and other online shops. But an
unresolved issue hangs over the emerging online marketplace:
whether cyberpurchases should be subject to the same sales taxes
levied on brick-and-mortar retailing.
</P>
<P>
   While a congressional commission has been examining the question
and hopes to issue recommendations this year, any chance of
reaching consensus in 2000 seems remote given the wide range of
views on how sales taxes would affect e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The basic positions on sales taxes are clear: Opponents fear a
tax would dramatically slow the spread of e-commerce, just as it is
on the verge of gaining a secure foothold among consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the increased acceptance of online retailing
could potentially produce sales-tax numbers that are too large to
ignore. And they say ``e-tailers'' will have a competitive
advantage over regular retailers unless they are also required to
collect sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Between these two poles, there is an array of opinions and
alliances, but even those whose allegiances are clearly on the side
of protecting e-commerce think sales taxes in some form are
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see how the tax system would withstand the
Internet being tax-free,'' said Shikhar Ghosh, head of iBelong Inc.
and chair of the Massachusetts Software and Internet Council.
</P>
<P>
   For now, a federal moratorium on new Internet taxes is in place
at least through October 2001, with the result that the states are
becoming the battleground on the sales-tax issue.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, legislators plan to study how much sales-tax
revenue the state is losing on orders residents place over the Web.
Representative John H. Rogers (D-Norwood), cochair of the taxation
committee, said that the risk of doing nothing could be that ``this
technology would gradually make the sales tax obsolete'' as
ever-more shopping and purchasing moves online.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said a subcommittee will be formed to study the tax issue
in coming months, though an aide to Senator Marian Walsh, the other
cochair, said no action is expected before 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The mere formation of the subcommittee is controversial. Last
year, Governor Paul Cellucci, a staunch opponent of Internet sales
taxes, vetoed a budget item that would have created a commission to
study e-commerce taxes. Cellucci testified recently before Congress
against sales taxes, and on Wednesday he will take his antitax
message to a technology luncheon in Newton, appearing with Virgina
Governor James Gilmore, another sales-tax opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, who also chairs the federal Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce that is studying Internet tax issues, faces
bills in the Virginia General Assembly to eliminate retail sales
taxes, on the grounds that if online retailers don't have to
collect a sales tax, neither should brick-and-mortar merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore said the bills are simply political posturing and have
no real chance of passing. Despite the ongoing debate, he believes
the federal moratorium on sales taxes could be extended several
years while the issue continues to be sorted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a desire right now for a continued moratorium,''
Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   It is an open question whether the states are bound by the
moratorium, but so far most are following the federal government's
lead.
</P>
<P>
   In response, some state and local officials have argued that
they may be forced to raise other taxes to make up for lost revenue
if the emerging online marketplace continues to grow. Sales taxes
accounted for $3.3 billion of the $14.2 billion in taxes
Massachusetts collected last year.
</P>
<P>
   But these leaders have run into resistance from governors who
want to protect the booming technology sectors that have boosted
their states' economies.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines have grown fuzzier _ and thornier _ over time.
Conservative Republicans are battling conservative Republicans.
Retailers are duking it out with retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Even traditional merchants aren't always on the same side.
Federated Department Stores Inc., an old-line merchant that has
planted solid roots online with macys.com, is conspicuously absent
from the parade of traditional merchants complaining that their
online rivals are being pampered.
</P>
<P>
   Technology firms also have developed different positions on the
tax issue. Internet gateways America Online Inc. and Lycos Inc. are
staunchly opposed to Internet commerce taxes. But a few high-tech
companies have said they would support some online taxes if the
tens of thousands of local and state tax systems _ each with its
own different regulations _ were somehow simplified.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over taxing so-called ``remote'' sellers such as
eToys Inc. is hardly new. The issue first emerged following the
explosion in catalog sales. It resurfaced several years ago when
tax collectors nationwide began suspecting that the online
marketplace would grow much, much larger.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Internet retail sales are fast gaining ground on catalog
sales. The Direct Marketing Association says online sales will
reach $31.1 billion in 2004 compared with $75.5 billion in catalog
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe Internet revenue will surpass catalog revenue by
2004. By then, Forrester Research estimates, online sales
nationwide could reach $184 billion, up from $20 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet and catalog transactions are already subject to
state sales taxes. But they go largely unpaid because most of these
retailers aren't required to collect those taxes unless they
actually have operations in the state where the purchase is made.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, consumers are supposd to be reporting their sales tax
obligations on many of their catalog and online purchases. But
these rules are rarely enforced by the states where they are in
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers have been further baffled by retailers' decisions to
tax or not to tax. Nordstrom Inc., for instance, charges online
sales taxes in states where it operates department stores. A Web
site co-owned by Barnes &AMP; Noble does not have widespread taxes
because the retailer considers its online store to be a separate
division. Also giving most consumers a tax-free shopping experience
are a host of retailers who exist only in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   On its own, Staples Inc. has figured out a way to collect sales
taxes from electronic customers in each of the 44 states in which
it operates retail stores. It wants its online rivals to figure it
out, too.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the company is looking for ``any state initiative
that levels the playing field,'' said Shannon Lapierre, a Staples
spokeswoman.

CONFESSIONS OF A WB TEEN-DRAMA BUFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago on ``Dawson's Creek,'' Pacey (Joshua Jackson)
explained to his brother why he could never tell Joey (Katie
Holmes) that he's in love with her. It would have disastrous
effects, something akin to the tides changing directions, floods
destroying the Earth and a Hell Mouth opening up and unleashing
hordes of havoc-wreaking demons on humankind.
</P>
<P>
   Whew. Pacey watches ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' too. Glad to
see I'm not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   I have plenty of friends who share my stalkerlike obsession for
the Buffinator. I've never felt embarrassment in proclaiming
adoration for Buffy, Xander, Willow, Giles and the rest of the
Scooby gang, especially since every TV critic in America has backed
me up.
</P>
<P>
   But what about all those other WB dramas largely designed for
teen-age girls? You know the ones: ``Felicity,'' ``Dawson's
Creek,'' ``Roswell,'' ``Popular,'' ``Charmed,'' etc. What are
30-year-old men like me to do when their peers are watching
``adult'' dramas such as ``Homicide'' and ``Law &AMP; Order,'' and
we're glued to the Frog Channel watching 17-year-olds pontificating
on life issues they shouldn't be worrying about until they're,
well, our age?
</P>
<P>
   You make excuses.
</P>
<P>
   For months, I had been referring to shows such as ``Felicity''
and ``Dawson's Creek'' as ``guilty pleasures.'' A friend finally
clocked me. ``Either embrace them or quit watching,'' he said. ``No
one has that many guilty pleasures.''
</P>
<P>
   Point taken. It's now time to come out of the closet. Yes, I'm a
WB drama teen-aholic and proud of it. So, like, shut up!
</P>
<P>
   These shows have some of the best writing on TV. Now, if you're
not up-to-the-minute on your pop culture, much on ``Buffy'' and
``Charmed'' will sail over your head faster than ``Popular's''
Nicole can throw away her discount store bracelet when a
fashion-minded friend busts her for donning it. And the acting's
not bad either.
</P>
<P>
   But before I totally kick open the door, let me first offer a
few disclaimers: First, as someone who keeps himself entrenched in
the local arts scene, I can't be accused of succumbing to Couch
Potato Syndrome, for which they're still searching for a cure. Most
of these shows I view the following morning from the tape in my
VCR. Let's just say I go through a lot of videocassettes.
</P>
<P>
   Second, I do watch a few ``adult'' shows, mainly ``The
X-Files,'' ``The Practice,'' ``Once and Again'' and, though I'm
even more embarrassed to admit to this vice, ``Ally McBeal''
(although I don't know why I continue to hang on; ``Ally'' gets
dumber each week). I must confess that I've completely given up on
sitcoms. Well, once reruns kick in I might catch up on lost
``Simpsons'' and ``That '70s Show'' episodes. Currently, those two
are up against ``Felicity'' and ``Freaks and Geeks,'' respectively.
(By the way, the latter is probably the best
slice-of-high-school-life show on television, now that Buffy's
protecting a college campus, but we're just talking WB.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, I don't watch every WB drama. Don't do ``7th Heaven.''
Can you say ``Touched by an Angel'' meets ``Eight Is Enough?'' And
``Safe Harbor'' might as well be called ``Baywatch 7th Heaven.''
What's that all about? I quickly lost interest in the ultraboring
``Jack and Jill,'' and besides, the new ``X-Files'' season finally
began. And ``Charmed'' just has too many unfunny royal witches
(read: former stars of bad TV shows Shannen Doherty and Alyssa
Milano) to care anymore. Then there's the new show, ``Zoe
Dot-Dot-Dot,'' but like I said, I can't be bothered with sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   Here are, in order of importance to me (because this story is
all about me, after all), quick breakdowns of the WB shows and
their worth in cellphones.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' 7 p.m. Tuesday. No doubt, it's one
of the best TV dramas ever. Now in its fourth season, it's still
smartly written and loaded with surprise plot twists. To creator
Joss Whedon: Thank you thank you thank you for finally making Spike
a regular. And though we were totally bummed to see Oz (Seth Green)
depart, the whole Willow and the lesbocious Wicca chick thread
almost makes up for it. We also dig the new bf, Riley. But it's
really time to give Giles a love interest. Jenny's been dead for
how long now? Oh, and the ``Hush'' episode with its creepy
``Gentlemen'' was the best hour of television I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 10 cellphones (on a scale of 1-10)

   ``Angel'' 8 p.m. Tuesday. I was determined to love this show,
since it is a ``Buffy'' spinoff. It started off slow, but like the
title character, it doesn't reek anymore. At first I wasn't down
with the ``Batman'' parallels (come on, a grapple hook, stakes that
retract from his sleeves automatically?), but the fact that the
characters kept making fun of the Dark Knight-y lead character (he
dwells in the Bat Cave, drives a Batmobile) salvages it. I hate
that they killed off Doyle and replaced him with Wesley (the
Watcher who replaced Giles in last season's ``Buffy.)'' Does Angel
really need two bumbling sidekicks? And although Cordelia still has
some of the best lines, she's not as funny when there's no one to
snark back at her, a la ``Buffy's'' Xander. Nevertheless, the
``Buffy/Angel'' punch makes Tuesday night the real Must See TV.

   ``Roswell'' 8 p.m. Wednesday. OK, so it's a supernatural
``Dawson's Creek,'' which means it's often slow-paced and the
young'uns are waaaaaay too serious. But it has the best-looking
cast (and that's saying a lot for the WB) and the best
funky-cool-chick character, Maria (Majandra Delfino.) And could
Brendan Fehr (who plays Michael) look any more like a young David
Duchovny? Don't think so. Extra points for using Dido's song ``Here
With Me'' as the theme. Speaking of music, here's another reason
I'm hooked on the WB: the music. All of the shows play scores of
weepy Lilith Fair singer-songwriters. I like to call this genre SEW
(Suicidal Ethereal Women). The WB loves Beth Orton, Fiona Apple,
Tara McClean, Sarah McLachlan and The Sundays as much as I do.
``Felicity'' scored major points for playing Kate Bush's ``This
Woman's Work'' early in the game. Which brings us to ...

   ``Felicity'' 7 p.m. Sunday. I started watching because it
originally followed ``Buffy.'' Again, it was way too serious at
first, but finally lightened up. After ``The Practice,'' it had
last season's best cliffhanger. I really was caught up in the whole
Noel vs. Ben ordeal. And unlike most people, I dig the new 'do.
Major kudos for giving Meghan and Sean more time. Now, if we can
just do something about Julie. She has way too many issues.

   ``Popular'' 7 p.m. Thursday. I thought nothing would ever top
the rapid-fire sarcasm fests of ``Buffy,'' but Nicole (Tammy Lynn
Michaels) has officially dethroned ``Angel's'' Cordelia as the
queen of putting everyone in their collective places. Detractions:
Too many so-out-there-they're-ridiculous characters, such as the
Pat-like science teacher and the spaz kids. Cheerleader Mary Cherry
(Leslie Grossman), a Dallas native, sports an over-the-top Southern
accent that's more Alabama than Texas. Josh is basically Dawson in
California. And as much as I love Nicole, her hair is so 1996 Faith
Hill. Need to rethink that one. But, love the theme song.

   ``Dawson's Creek'' 7 p.m. Wednesday. So I haven't kept up with
this much. I'm not sure who Joey and Dawson are currently dating or
what Deep Thoughts issue they're discussing. So I don't cry if I
miss it, but when I do catch it, I am quickly sucked in. Something
about these teen-agers talking all grown-up, like even grown-ups
don't talk. OK, so maybe I still have one guilty pleasure.

MARDI GRAS FAVORITE IS KING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't long ago that Mardi Gras was considered a distant
party in a very peculiar place. For those of us who live, say,
north of Baton Rouge, it was a secret that every Louisiana hamlet
with an iced-down washtub and a beer distributor to fill it had a
Mardi Gras event.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us didn't even know that other countries, for Pete's
sake, had Mardi Gras. We thought only pagan cities like New Orleans
could host such a knee-crawling festival.
</P>
<P>
   Now, everyone has a Mardi Gras celebration. Galveston has a big
one. There are thousands of smaller events.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the New Orleans Mardi Gras is one of the biggest parties
in the world, as we've seen on ``COPS,'' the TV show that goes to
the Big Easy each year to show us new and inventive ways to wrestle
drunks off the street and make them like it.
</P>
<P>
   This giant beer bash is obviously subsidized each year by the
junk jewelry industry, the people who make mounds of worthless
shiny beads; and by local bakeries that turn out tons of king
cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Mardi Gras is observed just before the Christian period of Lent.
Lent is a 40-day fast, so the celebration of Mardi Gras is a last
desperate chance to sinfully gorge on rich foods, loud music and
really goofy behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Mardi Gras actually means Fat Tuesday, which is what you will
look like the day before Ash Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most historical accounts show that the festival originated
during the second century in Rome. It was a celebration in honor of
Venus, the goddess of love, and Bacchus, the god of wine,
fertility, wild behavior and really spicy food that keeps you up
late at night.
</P>
<P>
   From Rome, the carnival spread throughout Europe, and king cakes
showed up. Then to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   European Christians celebrated the 12 days after Christmas. The
culmination was called ``Epiphany,'' or ``Twelfth Night,'' and
recognized the three wise men bearing gifts to the Christ child.
One of the most popular customs was the baking of a special cake in
honor of the three kings.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line, someone stuck a dried bean, or a coin,
or even a small baby doll in the cake. Whoever chomps down on the
little prize gets to host the King Cake party the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The cakes were originally kind of a simple coffee cake, or
brioche, with a little colored sugar sprinkled on top. But Mardi
Gras is about excess, and the king cakes have joined the party.
</P>
<P>
   Now, New Orleans bakeries send out thousands and thousands of
cakes that are filled with such goodies as cream cheese, chocolate
brownie and pecan praline sauce (by the way, folks in Louisiana say
praw-leens, not pray-leens. It has to do with living in such
oppressive heat and humidity.)
</P>
<P>
   You can mail-order your king cake, or as we get closer to Ash
Wednesday, the local grocery stores and bakeries like La Madeleine
will stock up on a few. If you'd rather make your own, here's a
recipe offered by the Junior League of Lafayette, La. It is a
traditional recipe, without filling.

</P>
<P>
   KING CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8
</P>
<P>
   Brioche dough:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup lukewarm water, 110 to 115 degrees
</P>
<P>
   2 packages dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   4 1/2 to 5 1/2 cups sifted flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup lukewarm milk
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs
</P>
<P>
   4 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup PLUS 2 tablespoons butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   Dime, dried bean or miniature doll
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon milk
</P>
<P>
   Sugars:
</P>
<P>
   Green, purple and yellow paste food coloring
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar (12 tablespoons)
</P>
<P>
   Icing:
</P>
<P>
   3 cups confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup lemon juice, strained
</P>
<P>
   3 to 6 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   2 candied cherries, halved
</P>
<P>
   Soften yeast in water. Combine flour, sugar, nutmeg and salt in
mixing bowl. Stir in lemon peel. Make a well in center and pour
into it the yeast mixture and milk.
</P>
<P>
   Add eggs and egg yolks, and with a large wooden spoon gradually
incorporate dry ingredients into liquid ones. Beat in butter and
continue beating until dough forms ball. (Mixing of the dough can
be done in a food processor.)
</P>
<P>
   Place ball on floured board and incorporate more flour if
necessary, by sprinkling it over ball by the tablespoon. Knead
until smooth and elastic.
</P>
<P>
   Brush inside of large bowl with 1 tablespoon softened butter.
Set dough in bowl and turn it so as to butter entire surface. (At
this point you can refrigerate dough overnight.) Cover bowl and set
aside for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Brush a large baking sheet with remaining butter. Punch dough
down on lightly floured surface. Knead, then pat and shape dough
into a cylinder about 14 inches long. Place on baking sheet and
form into a ring. Press bean or doll into dough so that it is
hidden. Set aside again to rise. When ready to bake, brush the top
and sides of the ring with the egg-milk mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Bake cake in middle of oven at 375 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes,
or until golden brown. Slide cake onto wire rack to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the colored sugars by squeezing a dab of green paste
into the palm of one hand. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar over the
paste and rub your hands together to color the sugars evenly. Set
aside and repeat process with green, then twice with purple and
yellow. (Do not mix sugars.)
</P>
<P>
   When the cake has cooled, prepare the icing. Combine the
confectioners' sugar, lemon juice and 3 tablespoons of water in a
deep bowl and stir until the icing mixture is smooth. If it is too
stiff to spread, beat in 1 teaspoonful water at a time, until
desired consistency is reached. With a small metal spatula, spread
the icing over the top of the cake, allowing it to run down the
sides. Sprinkle the colored sugars over the icing immediately,
forming a row of purple, yellow and green strips, each about 2
inches wide, on both sides of the ring. Arrange 2 cherry halves at
each end of the cake, pressing them gently into the icing.

THE BIRDS: EVEN HITCHCOCK COULDN'T ENVISION DOWNTOWN NIGHTMARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Fort Worth is using humanitarian tactics to
fight an air assault by birds, and most days it seems the birds are
winning. The proof: bird droppings all over downtown, sometimes in
heavy concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   The counterattack: Five nights a week, Downtown Fort Worth Inc.
sends out two crews with power washers to fight the losing battle
of blasting sidewalks. Every few months, parks workers fire
anti-bird firecrackers skyward from shotguns to clear birds
temporarily from the Water Gardens, the Fort Worth Convention
Center and Burnett Park.
</P>
<P>
   What's a city to do? Especially when the birds seem so smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``They send in scouts to find the best places. It seems to be an
organized effort on the part of the birds to make this their
habitat,'' says Todd Holzaepfel of Downtown Fort Worth Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the poop patrol battles on. Every night when the sidewalk
tables are full, Coffee Haus Sundance Square manager Joe Vano sends
an employee out every hour upon the hour to clap boards together to
scare the birds away from coffee drinkers, who complain that
sometimes the birds are amazingly good shots. Monthly, Bank One
facilities manager Janet Loftin spends $5,100 to power-wash bird
waste from windows and sidewalks of the glass office building at
Fifth and Throckmorton streets, and still the layers of waste
accumulate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Downtown Fort Worth Inc. and city officials are looking
into a grape-scented chemical the birds find unpleasant that goes
by the commercial name of Rejex-it. The effectiveness of the
product is debated. Hairnets for trees are being researched, but
they are expensive_ $1,500 to $3,000 per tree _ and work only until
the tree grows through them far enough to provide new perches.
</P>
<P>
   The crafty birds are mostly grackles, the black birds that
arrive in the fall and used to leave in the spring, although they
appear to be staying longer and in larger numbers, say Holzaepfel
and others who have been fighting the birds.
</P>
<P>
   No one's found the magic bullet, particularly one that doesn't
work like a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't send someone out on downtown streets with a shotgun
to scare them. We can't poison them. Then it becomes an issue of
where the birds will die and who will pick up the carcasses,''
Holzaepfel says.
</P>
<P>
   Bird droppings alone present a health hazard. Rodney Beaman,
president and general manager of Power Pest Elimination in Fort
Worth, contracted the respiratory disease histoplasmosis after
exposure to bird poop. He was out of work for nearly a month with
pneumonialike symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is contracted by people who scrape up bird droppings
and breathe in the dried particles, Beaman says. It is particularly
dangerous for people with immune systems compromised by other
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanup costs are difficult to estimate. Downtown Fort Worth
Inc., on contract to the city, spends $180,000 a year on two
power-washing crews, which are also required by contract to clean
bus shelters five nights a week. In the worst season for bird
droppings _ fall and winter _ the crews might spend half their time
cleaning up after grackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to do eradication, but we may have to,'' says
Dee Hardin of the Parks and Community Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law does allow for the killing of nuisance birds by the
owners of the trees, Holzaepfel says. Most downtown trees are owned
by the city.
</P>
<P>
   Bird killing is considered a ``draconian measure'' that
Holzaepfel says Downtown Fort Worth Inc. would rather not pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Fort Worth Inc., city officials and businesspeople are
expected to meet within weeks to discuss options.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the assault continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are slipping on wet bird poop and people are coming
in to dinner at the Reata with bird poop in their hair,'' Loftin
says. ``It's just not a pleasant experience.''

WITH THE RIGHT ADDRESS, ACCESS TO A NEW PORTAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Soon, the residents of some of New York's more
expensive co-ops and condominiums will have their own free Internet
portal combining Web access, all-news radio, discount shopping,
reviews and the chance to bid against their peers for tables at top
restaurants like Daniel, Lespinasse and the Four Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Web has sites of all kinds, but EdificeRex.com
(www.edificerex.com) is the first real-estate-based portal for New
Yorkers, according to its developer, the Insignia Financial Group.
Insignia calls EdificeRex the first ``building-specific portal
designed to create a unique online community for New York's
apartment dwellers and offer all New Yorkers a distinct view of the
city.'' It is designed for residents in upscale apartment
buildings; they will receive passwords that allow them to use the
interactive offerings. Anyone who has Internet access through a
service provider will, however, be able to cruise the site.
</P>
<P>
   Insignia Financial Group is the parent of Insignia Residential
Group, which manages about 65,000 co-op and condo apartments in the
city, and Douglas Elliman, the largest residential sales and rental
brokerage firm in the city. Other management companies, including
Milford Management, Related Cos. and Witkoff Group are also
participating in the project, which will initially be available to
85,000 to 90,000 apartment dwellers, most of them in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The auction for tables at the most popular restaurants in the
city is one of the portal's main features. ``We did focus groups
while we were preparing this, and we found that the biggest
complaint that people have about hot restaurants is the inability
to get a reservation,'' said Andrew L. Farkas, the chairman of
Insignia.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas said that some of the most popular restaurants in the
city had been persuaded to make available a few tables each day in
the prime time slot of 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   To participate, a person will enter a name, a credit card number
and a bid, starting at $25; bids will increase in $5 increments.
The bidding will run from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., with the winning
bidders getting the tables that very night. The amount bid for a
reservation does not count toward the cost of dinner. But the
restaurant is not adding it to its profits either. Auction proceeds
are to go to charity.
</P>
<P>
   The system will also allow members to order a car service online
with the proviso that if takes more than 20 minutes from order to
pickup, the service is free. Those in a hurry to get to the
Hamptons can book a seat on Liberty Helicopters, with a guaranteed
seat and 10 percent off the price for reservations made seven days
in advance.
</P>
<P>
   At another spot on the site, Farkas said, network members will
be able to order deliveries from restaurants that usually do not
deliver. He said similar arrangements had been made with wine and
liquor stores.
</P>
<P>
   Each apartment in the network will have its own account and home
page. The apartment page will display an image of the building,
headlines from New York newspapers and weather and traffic reports
that will be updated every 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The system will allow submission of the work orders online and a
review of the status of previously submitted orders. It will also
display a You've Got a Package icon and a voice message (the voice
is Farkas') if a delivery has been made. Building-specific
documents, like leases, bylaws, alteration agreements and floor
plans, are all available on line.
</P>
<P>
   A secure section of the system called The Board is reserved for
the members of building boards so they can communicate with one
another and their managing agents.
</P>
<P>
   For the public, the noninteractive services that EdificeRex
offers will include an online magazine called The Dish, which
promises to deliver ``the word on the street before it's spoken.''
The Money will provides stock quotes, financial planning advice and
a philanthropy supplement with a calendar of charitable events,
estate planning tips and opportunities for volunteer work. The Arts
will include staff-written reviews of artists, musicians and
filmmakers, along with recommended reading and DVD lists.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising for a portal sponsored by a real estate company,
there is a real estate section that will list recent sales and
prices and tips on how to sell or rent a home.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas said EdificeRex would not accept advertising and was
being offered as an amenity to residents of buildings in the
network. He said an editorial staff of up to 15 people was being
assembled provide editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time we can deliver a true differentiating
product in property management,'' Farkas said. ``It will enhance
the value of the apartments.''
</P>
<P>
   As to letting walk-ups and other less exclusive buildings join
the network, which would give their residents full access to the
portal's services, Insignia executives said that requests to join
by less expensive properties would be judged ``on a case by case
basis.''

COURT HEARS CHALLENGE TO HMO'S COST-CUTTING INCENTIVES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill.)   (nk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Grappling for the first time with the complexities
of managed health care, the Supreme Court raised a blizzard of
questions Wednesday about a patient's challenge to a health
maintenance organization that offered financial rewards to doctors
as an incentive to hold down costs.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing arguments for an hour on issues that could affect
more than 160 million Americans in employer-sponsored health plans,
the court appeared skeptical about letting patients sue HMOs for
offering such bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The questions, raised by eight of the nine justices, reflected a
variety of legal concerns: Why should the court get into the
details of how a health plan is designed? What is the difference
between acceptable and unacceptable financial incentives to
doctors? Is it conceivable that Congress, which has encouraged the
development of HMOs since 1973, intended to limit one of the
standard techniques they use to control costs?
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the court wanted to know, what exactly does the
patient in this case, Cynthia Herdrich, want as a remedy? She
belatedly received the care she needed, after her appendix ruptured
in 1992, and she won damages of $35,000 in a medical malpractice
suit in Illinois state court.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the justices wanted to know, if the HMO or its doctors
have a ``fiduciary duty'' under federal law, does that mean they
have a duty to act in the best interest of Herdrich _ or that they
must conserve the assets of the health plan for all the people who
get coverage through the same group?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, ``what's in the
best interest of a particular plaintiff could be against the
interest of a class of beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument in the case, Pegram vs. Herdrich, No. 98-1949, came
as Congress was considering legislation that would set new
standards for managed care and make it easier for patients to sue
HMOs. President Clinton strongly supports such legislation. In
addition, lawyers across the country have filed at least 16
class-action suits alleging that HMOs skimped on care and misled
patients by failing to disclose the techniques they use to control
costs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Supreme Court on Wednesday, the lawyer for Herdrich,
James P. Ginzkey, had an answer to every question asked of him. But
he sometimes seemed to lose his way in the legal swamp surrounding
the statute at the heart of the case, the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA.
</P>
<P>
   The law, prompted by abuses in the operation of pension plans,
also defines the obligations of the people who run
employer-sponsored health plans. Under the law, such trustees must
act ``solely in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries'' of a health plan.
</P>
<P>
   The issue before the Supreme Court is whether Herdrich, having
won a jury verdict in state court, should be allowed to pursue her
claim that her HMO violated its duty to her under the 1974 federal
law.
</P>
<P>
   Ginzkey said Herdrich's HMO was riddled with conflicts of
interest. The same doctors own the health plan, treat patients,
decide whether to pay claims and are eligible to receive bonuses as
a result of cost savings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a standard plain vanilla HMO'' Ginzkey said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked Ginzkey, ``Why should the
courts get into this slippery slope problem, when Congress has
designed a scheme based on private funding of health care through
HMOs that are privately owned, and there are inherent incentives to
keep costs down?''
</P>
<P>
   Ginzkey conceded that some financial incentives to doctors were
acceptable, and he said he was not asking the court to outlaw all
such payments. But, he said, incentives are unacceptable if they
have such ``an undue influence'' on a doctor's decisions that they
adversely affect the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said that standard, based on
the concept of undue influence, was ``extremely vague.''
</P>
<P>
   A decision in the case is expected by July.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, a leading advocate for patients' rights, said,
``Even if Ms. Herdrich loses, the patients' rights movement may
win.'' Injured patients may be forced to pursue remedies in state
court, where they have recently had some success in winning damages
for substandard care, he said.

SITES HELP `LEAPLINGS' BRIDGE BIRTHDAY GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 By JOYCE COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People born on Feb. 29 know just what to expect when others hear
about their singular birthday. Many people don't believe them. Some
exclaim, ``You poor thing!'' Others say, ``Lucky you.''
</P>
<P>
   Raenell Dawn knows she's lucky. Born on Feb. 29, 1960, she leads
the Honor Society of Leap Day Babies, a group of people born on
that distinctive day. The group functions primarily through its Web
site, www.leapdaybabies.com.
</P>
<P>
   When Dawn got a computer, she did a Web search on leap year. ``I
found technical information,'' she said. ``I didn't find anything
fun at all.''  &UR;  &LR; She decided to remedy the situation with the Web
site, which is filled with leap year tales and trivia. As the big
day approaches, there has been a burst of activity at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Wondering what to name your leapling? How about Leapa, Leapanne,
or Leaptoria? Haven't figured out what a leapling is? According to
the ``leaptionary'' at Dawn's Web site, it is a newborn leap day
baby. Dawn, who lives near Salem, Ore., signs her correspondence
with ``Leapest regards,'' which, the leaptionary says, are deeper
than ``Deepest regards.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also publicizes Dawn's crusade to have Feb. 29 denoted
on calendars as Leap Day. ``The day is a holiday that celebrates
the calendar,'' she said. ``It should be in print, just like
Groundhog Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Web visitors are encouraged to relate their leap year stories.
One person expressed dismay at the lack of a birthday horoscope.
Another got out of a speeding ticket because the trooper shared his
Feb. 29 birthday. Another wrote that her birth certificate was
doubly peculiar, listing the day of her birth as ``Thuesday.''
Plenty of people grumble about computers that consider their
birthdate nonexistent when they need to enter it on computer forms.
</P>
<P>
   The site also announces leap year celebrations around the world,
like the Worldwide Leap Year Festival, held in Anthony, Texas,
which calls itself ``Leap Year Capital of the World.'' The
quadrennial festival began in 1988, when Mary Ann Brown, born on
Feb. 29, 1932, decided that Anthony, a farm town, needed a
promotional tool. The Chamber of Commerce, shared with neighboring
Anthony, N.M., is anticipating 10,000 visitors. Details of this
year's festival are at www.leapyearcapital.org. The four-day
celebration culminates in a parade, a dinner and fireworks. Graham
Nash of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young will entertain _ it's a
birthday present to his wife, Susan.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site of the astronomy department at New Mexico State
University in Las Cruces also posts a festival schedule
(astro.nmsu.edu/(tilde)lhuber/leapyear.html). The department's
systems analyst, Lyle Huber, includes links to several pages
explaining the origin of leap year and the history of the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Huber has received messages from people wondering
about February 2000. ``Because it was the centurial year,'' he
said, ``some people thought it would be a super leap year,'' with
30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are very misinformed,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Huber also links to www.mystro.com/leap.htm, run by John
Strohsacker of Baltimore, born Feb. 29, 1968. Strohsacker's is
considered the original leap day site. Four years ago, he said, his
e-mail came primarily from leap day babies who had never met any
others. This year, he is getting technical questions, including
some from computer programmers concerned about glitches.
Strohsacker includes links to sites about population
(www.census.gov) and time, including the site of the Royal
Observatory in Greenwich, England (www.rog.nmm.ac.uk).
</P>
<P>
   Some sites, including Strohsacker's, have lists of famous people
born on Feb. 29, but many of the people are not all that famous _
Herman Hollerith, for example, the inventor of the electronic
tabulating machine. But Strohsacker's list also includes the
composer Gioacchino Rossini, the astronaut Jack Lousma, the
football player Fran Tarkenton and the band leader Jimmy Dorsey.
</P>
<P>
   Additional links about time are provided by Andrew Starr, who
has ``always enjoyed offbeat holidays'' (emailman.com/leapday).
Starr, a lawyer working near Kansas City, Mo., also highlights an
explanation of the ``leap second.''
</P>
<P>
   An especially good account of leap year comes from The Straight
Dope by Cecil Adams (www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mleapyr.html).
Most people know that years divisible by four are leap years, but
there are exceptions. For example, there was no leap day in 1700,
1800 or 1900, but there is one this year.
</P>
<P>
   And for those really looking ahead, Adams points out another
exception: The year 4000 and its later multiples _ 8000, 12000,
etc. _ will not be leap years.

   Q. What are extension conflicts on a Macintosh? Can they hurt my
Mac? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Extensions'' in the Macintosh world refers to small pieces
of software that add to the Mac's basic functions. They include
printer and modem drivers and software for networking and
multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   Problems arise when the computer code that makes up the
extension or code in one of the system's Control Panels conflicts
with something else in your system. Conflicts can keep your
Macintosh from booting properly _ often right after you have
installed a new hardware device or a program.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that you are having extension problems, reboot the
Mac while holding down the Shift key so the extensions won't load
during start-up; if the machine doesn't crash, as it was doing
before, odds are you have a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   You may have to uninstall whatever you just installed, or call
the manufacturer for help. If you have a likely suspect, try
rebooting with the space bar held down so you can get to the
Extensions Manager, then turn off the extension or Control Panel
you think is problematic.
</P>
<P>
   A good general guide can be found at the Macintosh Extensions
Guide page (www.madison-web.com/ext). If you have persistent
problems, trouble-shooting programs like Casady &AMP; Greene's Conflict
Catcher (www.casadyg.com) can help. J.D. Biersdorfer &QL;

<P>
   Last year, if you had set out to buy tickets to a hot event like
a World Series game, a Backstreet Boys concert or the local
premiere of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' chances
are you would have joined in the traditional rituals of ticket
buying: the around-the-block line, the stampede or the keypad race
to get through on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the lottery system now commonly used for selling
tickets has helped reduce the number of all-night camp-outs at
ticket windows, getting tickets to the most popular concerts, shows
and sporting events remains a test of the will or the wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, however, any pain associated with buying
entertainment tickets can be mostly a matter of the wallet. There
are ticket vendors, auction markets and scalpers galore on the Web.
And you can purchase tickets online for an amazing range of events
and venues, from World Wrestling Federation matches and Nascar
races to the Louvre, ``The Lion King'' and the San Diego Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Bypassing the box office to buy entertainment tickets online
makes a lot of sense. It's not like buying books or clothing _ you
don't need to glance at a book's cover and a few pages or finger
the goods for texture, peruse them for style and find a certain
color. You just need to know where you will be sitting and how much
you will pay for the privilege. (If you're buying from an
unlicensed broker, you also need to know that the tickets are
legitimate. One way is to see if the seller is listed on the
www.natb.org site of the National Association of Ticket Brokers.)
Many sites now offer not only seating charts but also photos that
show your actual vantage point. And of course, there's the
convenience factor, which is particularly important when the event
you will be attending is out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the sale of entertainment tickets has become
one of the fastest-growing segments of electronic commerce. In
1999, online brokers sold some $300 million worth of tickets.
According to Forrester Research, the market is expected to grow to
nearly $4 billion by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been a boon to traditional vendors like
Ticketmaster, the giant of the ticketing business, which sells
online through a separate company called Ticketmaster Online-City
Search. The percentage of the company's total sales attributed to
online transactions has been growing steadily, from 12 percent in
the second quarter of 1999 to 18 percent in the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Some places and artists sell tickets through their own Web
sites, allowing fans to avoid extra fees. Last year, for example,
the Cranberries sold tickets to some of their shows exclusively on
their Web site. A growing number of classical music and dance
companies, like the New York City Ballet, the Houston Opera and the
San Francisco Symphony, are also selling tickets through their own
sites.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller performing groups, though, the high cost of software
or technical support can be prohibitive. (Selling tickets online
usually requires an electronic sales-tracking system.) Nor can
smaller groups afford the kinds of links and advertising they need
on the Web to reach a wide audience. As a result, most
entertainment tickets are sold online through sites operated by
large vendors like Ticketmaster Online. The brokers connect the
organizations or venues selling the tickets to the brokers' systems
through either equipment established on site at each vendor's place
of business or through Web-based systems that allow access by
vendors using Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Web would seem to offer opportunities for cutting
costs, online brokers' fees are seldom cheaper than those than
tacked on at regular outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster Online has said that ticket buyers will soon be
able to print their tickets at home after buying them online. These
tickets, which will be letter-size sheets of paper imprinted with
bar codes, will be accepted in place of traditional tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Just about any printer will be adequate, said Tom Stockham, a
spokesman for Ticketmaster.com, and if the paper jams, the ticket
can be printed out again. You won't be able to use the same ticket
more than once, however, because the system allows only the first
person who shows up with the encoded ticket to get in.
</P>
<P>
   The system may deter scalpers from using it to buy tickets,
Stockham said, because it will be harder to convince buyers that a
sheet of paper with a few lines on it is a real ticket.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Ticketmaster Online continues to dominate the
Web-ticketing business for live events, a number of competitors
have cropped up, including fast-growing Tickets.com, which recently
announced that it would be the online broker for tickets to the
2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. Tickets.com offers tickets from
some 4,000 venues worldwide. It also offers links to events and
venues for which it does not act as broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll connect any consumer to any event,'' said Tim Kelly, the
company's president.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which came under fire from competitors for offering
tickets to some high-demand events at high resale prices , is
phasing out its site's links to so-called secondary-market sellers,
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The online movie-ticket business is also about to experience
some competitive jostling. A new company called MovieTickets.com is
set to challenge Moviefone, which has been the dominant online
seller for film tickets. MovieTickets, a joint venture between AMC
Entertainment and Hollywood.com, has announced that it will begin
selling tickets online during the Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There is also room in the Web ticket market, it seems, for the
niche seller _ the gatherer of ``low-hanging fruit,'' as Andrew
Dreskin, president of TicketWeb, put it. TicketWeb, which began in
1995, established itself as an alternative broker with tickets to
trendy nightclubs, festivals and such oddball events as the Burning
Man Festival, which centers on a wooden statue of a man that is set
on fire on the last day. Its fees are considerably lower than
Ticketmaster's, partly because its ticket-selling clients tap into
the system online and do not need any special software to use
TicketWeb's servers and database. The company has been growing at a
rate of 400 percent a year, Dreskin said, and it has gathered a
number of prestigious clients, like the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   Another company called CultureFinder, which went online mainly
as a search engine for cultural events, has grown into a major
source for buying tickets to museums, concerts and shows.
CultureFinder.com is particularly useful for travelers. The site
offers comprehensive listings of events, including free events, as
well as nutshell descriptions of the offerings. Users of
CultureFinder purchase tickets online and pick them up at the box
office.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone searching for tickets to a hot attraction will probably
be out of luck using a regular online broker. ``One of the things
that doesn't work well online is selling tickets for big events,''
like Super Bowl games or Backstreet Boys concerts, said Seema
Williams of Forrester Research. ``They sell out in minutes, and the
volume is so high their systems can't handle it.'' And that is
where the resale, or secondary, online market comes in. Such sites
have proliferated, although some states, including New York, have
strict regulations regarding scalping.
</P>
<P>
   While the authorities in New York and elsewhere have recently
cracked down on ticket brokers who skim tickets to sell on the
secondary market, Web scalping has remained something of a gray
area. The eBay auction site recently incorporated state laws into
its requirements for selling entertainment tickets. For example,
eBay forbids resales of tickets at prices more than $2 above their
face value for any entertainment event held in New York. For events
held in Louisiana, in case you are looking for something to do at
Mardi Gras, the allowed markup above face value is zero.
</P>
<P>
   Such restrictions do not seem to faze online resellers like
Frontrow.com, Tixx.com or Ticket Dog. For them, the sky seems to be
the limit on prices (for sky box tickets, you might as well be
buying tickets to the moon). People who wanted tickets to this
year's Kentucky Derby could have joined Millionaire's Row, courtesy
of the online scalpers, for a minimum of $4,000 _ or waited until
the day of the Derby, when they could buy tickets to the infield at
the gate for $35 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Here are a few hints on how to make sure that you get more than
you pay for from free Internet service. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AVOID HIDDEN COSTS _ Some free ISP's, especially local and
regional providers, advertise ``free service'' or ``no monthly
fees'' but actually charge a hefty set-up fee or make users
purchase their software.
</P>
<P>
   CHECK SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS _ Before downloading a free ISP's
software, make sure that your system is compatible with it. Most
ISP's list system requirements, sometimes on a Frequently Asked
Questions page.
</P>
<P>
   READ THE FINE PRINT _ Some free ISP's terminate sessions if
users do not click on a banner advertisement within a certain
number of minutes; others monitor use or require users to fill out
surveys on a regular basis. Look at the user agreement and any
disclaimers on the site.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Here are tips for buying tickets online &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Try searching for tickets on your favorite search engine by
typing in ``tickets'' and adding the name of the show, artist or
sports team you're looking for. (Example: ``tickets Spurs'' or
``tickets Springsteen.'') You'll get a range of sellers, some
legitimate and some scalpers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check out the Web sites devoted to your team, musician or
group. A number of sites devoted to rock groups have areas for
ticket trading, and you might get lucky. But be aware that those
sites are often invaded by scalpers.
</P>
<P>
   _ To save money on shipping and extra fees, buy from a broker
working directly with the venue, so you can pick up your tickets
there. You'll usually need to present the credit card you used to
purchase the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're not sure about a broker's reliability, check with
the National Association of Ticket Brokers (www.natb.org) to see if
the broker is listed and if the broker is bonded. If you're buying
tickets on eBay, you can check the seller's customer feedback
rating. And check eBay's regulations for selling entertainment
tickets because scalping may be regulated in your area.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check the location of the tickets offered for sale against a
seating chart (most larger venues have one on their own site or on
the broker's site).
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're buying high-demand tickets online, find out when the
tickets go on sale (often it's Saturday morning). Go to the
broker's Web site ahead of time and fill out the order form. Be
ready to hit the button again and again until you get through. Be
prepared to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; online ticket sites &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TICKETMASTER: www.ticketmaster.com _ Sells tickets directly for
a variety of live events, which are searchable by city or venue or
by the categories of sports, music, arts and family. Payment is by
credit card, and convenience, handling and delivery charges (the
latter when the tickets are purchased less than two weeks in
advance) are extra.
</P>
<P>
   TICKETWEB: www.ticketweb.com _ Tickets can be purchased directly
online by credit card. Affiliated with the groups and venues for
which it sells tickets, the site adds a modest service charge to
the cost of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   CULTUREFINDER: www.culturefinder.com _ Allows you to search for
cultural events by city and date and buy tickets for a modest
service fee. Tickets are picked up at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   TICKETS.COM: www.tickets.com _ Although its selection of sports,
shows, concerts and other cultural events is not as extensive as
Ticketmaster's, it includes links to other ticket sellers. It also
includes an auction site. Fees are similar to Ticketmaster's.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIEFONE: www.moviefone.com _Allows you to select a theater,
movie and specific show time for purchase, then pick up your
tickets at the theater by swiping your credit card in the Automatic
Ticketing Machine in the lobby. The surcharge (usually $1.50 per
ticket) is extra.
</P>
<P>
   TIXX.COM: www.tixx.com _ A large reseller not affiliated with
any venue or group. Surcharges can be substantial. Tickets for some
events may be ordered online by credit card, but for others, you
are directed to order by phone or e-mail.

 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is an example of something that passes for humor down at
the mean hardware store in my town: Next to the cash register where
the cranky old clerks sit and ignore customers all day is a sign
that says ``Complaint Department Take a Number.'' Beneath the sign
is a plastic replica of a hand grenade with a card that says ``No.
1'' and is attached to the firing pin.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week, I was the only customer in the store. I
waited for five minutes while one of the clerks played solitaire on
a computer 2 feet away and pretended not to see me.
</P>
<P>
   I am not easily intimidated except in hardware stores filled
with highly unfamiliar merchandise like valve seat retrofit kits.
It's confusing enough to choose the right wood filler for the
bookcases in my daughters' room. I don't need the added stress of
rude clerks.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, I decided to buy the supplies for my bookcase
project at CornerHardware.com (shop.cornerhardware.com). It's one
of a few online stores, along with companies like Hardware.com
(www.hardware.com), Amazon.com (www.amazon.com) and OurHouse.com
(ourhouse.com), that recently started selling a wide selection of
hardware online.
</P>
<P>
   With inventories that range from 25,000 to 45,000 items, the
biggest online stores can offer a selection that can rival that of
a typical Home Depot warehouse store (Home Depot plans to begin
selling online later this year). But the online stores don't
subject customers to encounters with those forklifts that terrorize
the shoppers in the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at CornerHardware.com, the first thing I saw was a
scale drawing of a deadbolt lock, which dissolved before my eyes to
reveal the inner mechanism. Unable to look away, I stared at the
complicated schematic of strike plates and cylinders with the same
queasy fascination I would normally reserve for observing
open-heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I realized that I was looking at nothing more
threatening than a set of animated instructions for one of the
site's many ``How-To Home Improvement Made Easy'' projects. So I
relaxed enough to click on the ``Paint and Supplies'' and search
for paintbrushes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, I still found myself confronting 42 mind-numbing
choices. Did I need the ``select best interior brush'' with the
polyester and nylon bristles and the beavertail foam handle and the
brass-plated ferrule for $2.68? Or would I be better off with the
``premium brush series'' with the polyester and natural Chinese
bristles, the beavertail wood handle and the nickel ferrule for
$4.51? And what exactly is a ferrule?
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, I noticed a picture of a friendly looking person in the
corner of the page next to an invitation to ``talk to a live
customer agent.'' After I clicked on the button, a live chat
feature appeared on the screen: ``DavidG has arrived to help you!
DavidG says, How may I help you?''
</P>
<P>
   In the message box next to DavidG's message, I typed, ``I want a
paintbrush to paint bookcases with latex paint, and I want the
brush to be angled and I don't want the bristles to fall out while
I am painting. Which one should I buy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me take a look,'' DavidG responded. Within seconds, he
typed, ``I would use a synthetic bristle brush. My favorite is a 2
or 2{ inch. Here is the brush I use most often, and properly cared
for will last a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   I bought it on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   After a lifetime of fearing hardware stores, I suddenly felt as
if I were in the scene from ``The Wizard of Oz'' where Dorothy's
house lands in Oz and the world suddenly changes from
black-and-white into a beautiful Technicolor.
</P>
<P>
   All DavidG knew about me was that I was a ``guest'' with
questions, which made me feel quietly liberated. Despite the
specificity of our conversation, the interaction was as
comfortingly anonymous as confessing to a priest.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew that I had so many pent-up hardware-related questions?
As they poured out, DavidG patiently recommended a specific putty
for my bookcases (you want a small quantity, he advised frugally),
a wood floor cleaner that he uses at home and replacement parts for
track lighting. A ferrule, by the way, is the metal band connecting
the handle to the bristles.
</P>
<P>
   Encountering a subject expert like DavidG made me fantasize
about a life in which I could solicit similar high quality advice
about all the other things gnawing at me that day. Wouldn't it be
great if I could just type, ``Hey, DavidG, do you think Thornton
Wilder really deserved a Pulitzer Prize for `The Bridge of San Luis
Rey'?'' Or: ``DavidG, should I worry about overhearing the baby say
to her doll, `Here, you want more glass of wine'?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, I tried to describe the experience to Jack Gifford, a
professor of marketing at Miami University in Ohio. ``For most
people, their comfort level in a hardware store is not very high
because they have not been socialized to know about the things that
are for sale there, and most of these stores provide very
inadequate personal assistance,'' Gifford said. ``But when you get
online, there's no one looking at you saying, `Dummy, you don't
know.' They just give you the answers for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Free. How long can that last?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these online companies are living off venture
capitalists who are paying for the person sitting there giving you
advice,'' said Eugene Fram, a professor of marketing at the
Rochester Institute of Technology. ``At some point those costs are
going to come home to roost. But for now, get online and ask about
anything you want to know about.''
</P>
<P>
   When I phoned Richard T. Takata, the chief executive of
CornerHardware.com, he promised to continue providing instant
online advice. As it turns out, CornerHardware.com hires a Boston
company called eSupportNow to provide instant online advice; DavidG
is one of the 23 eSupportNow workers who provide 24-hour customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't cost us anywhere near the 13 percent of revenues
that brick-and-mortar hardware stores invest in sales help and
benefits,'' Takata said. ``We pay for the service on a per-call or
per-chat basis, so over time it will be very economical for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Other online hardware sellers offer customer coddling, too.
Hardware.com, for instance, has a toll-free phone number; when I
called, a service representative talked to me for 15 minutes about
what features to look for in an iron. At OurHouse.com, you can
e-mail project questions to the site's Mr. Fix-It, who responds
within a day.
</P>
<P>
   So to the clerk at my local hardware store: Take a number.

<TEXT>
News Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON (Feb. 23) - State Sen. Allyson Schwartz
is broadening her pool of support to include backers from where she
wants to go - inside the Beltway.
<P>
   Arriving in Washington D.C. Tuesday night, Schwartz's mission
here was to convince Democratic party purse-holders she has what it
takes to wrest U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum's seat away from him in
November - that is if she wins the April 4 primary. In addition to
having a full schedule of private meetings, Schwartz pumped-hands
and networked at two separate Democratic Senate Campaign Committee
fundraisers that cost $5,000 a plate to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, in an interview before embarking on her Washington
blitz, confirmed she was in town to raise funds, but also to set
herself apart from her five fellow Democratic candidates, most
notably Pittsburgh's Rep. Ron Klink and Tom Foley, Pennsylvania's
former secretary of labor and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said her political stands on ``access to quality

<TEXT>
News Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON (Feb. 23) - Pennsylvania state Sen.
Allyson Schwartz is attempting to broaden her pool of support to
include financial backers from where she wants to go - inside the
Beltway.
<P>
   Arriving in Washington D.C. Tuesday night, Schwartz's mission
here was to convince Democratic party purse-holders she has what it
takes to wrest U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum's seat away from him in
November - that is if she wins the April 4 primary. In addition to
having a full schedule of private meetings, Schwartz pumped-hands

   Schwartz, in an interview before embarking on her Washington

herself apart from her five fellow Democratic candidates, most
notably Pittsburgh's Rep. Ron Klink and Tom Foley, Pennsylvania's
former secretary of labor and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said her political stands on ``access to quality
healthcare, education, safety, environment ... are in sharp
contrast to Ron Klink and certainly to Tom Foley.'' While some may
argue it is difficult to see differences between the candidates on
the core Democratic issues, she is the only ``pro-choice''
candidate who supports no restrictions on abortions.
</P>
<P>
   There are just five weeks left before Pennsylvania's Democrats
decide on their senatorial candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign committee's Vice-Chairwoman, Sen. Patty Murray
D.-Wash. said while Schwartz will have to wait until after the
primary to tap into the funds raised today, what she will take back
to Pennsylvania is almost as good as money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about national recognition of the candidate, `` Murray
said. ``If she wins the primary this money will benefit her.
There's a lot of women and men who are interested in having women
get the financial backing.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said if Schwartz won the primary, she would consider
going to Pennsylvania to support her bid for the six-year office -
a sentiment echoed throughout the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider Rick Santorum one of the most vulnerable incumbent
Republicans in this election cycle. Once our candidate is
identified the DSCC will provide its full support,'' said David
DiMartino, a committee spokesman. ``We'll do everything that the
law allows to beat Rick Santorum.''

A UTOPIAN WITH A TWINKLE AND AN IDEA: ONLINE DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANLY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's difficult to find a year that was not interesting for Jim
Warren, but 1977 was as interesting a year as any.
</P>
<P>
   That was when his commune broke up because everyone got married,
and the year he accidentally made a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   So he bought some land and built a house. It became a place for
many things: the headquarters of the first West Coast computer
fair, the office of a rabble-rousing community newspaper and the
command center for Dr. Dobb's Journal of Computer Calisthenics and
Orthodontia (considered the first software magazine). If you could
place the cradle of electronic democracy in real space, it would be
there.
</P>
<P>
   From his house in Northern California and his Macintosh, Warren,
long a promoter of utopian communities, became one of the first to
forward the notion that cheap electronic communication could foster
a truly educated citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, he proposed through his columns that
technology could electrify the republic. Largely because of his
efforts, California became the first state to require that
legislative information be published online, and some other states
soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   After government technology administrators told legislators that
making computerized legislative information available to the public
would cost millions of dollars, Warren argued that the project
could be done through the Internet for a fraction of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   He helped draft legislation to that end, then ran an online
campaign that notified several thousand people of legislative
action on the bill and encouraged them to get in contact with
legislators at every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the grandfather of it all,'' said Graeme Browning, author
of ``Electronic Democracy: Using the Internet to Influence American
Politics'' (Pemberton Press, 1996). ``He was thinking about it long
before the expensive, overproduced Web sites and the million-dollar
campaigns on the Internet were even thought of.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren's home base, a three-story glass-and-wood marvel that he
designed, sits on 40 acres in the mountains of San Mateo County,
reached by winding roads traveled these days mostly by Saabs and
BMW's. Neil Young is one of the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   There's the third-floor shower, with four shower heads and a
view. (``I've never had more than eight people in there,'' Warren
said.)
</P>
<P>
   On the lower deck, overlooking the ocean, there's the Jacuzzi,
which seats 12. Another bathroom offers a view of San Francisco
from an elevated tub, and a basement room holds a photo lab and an
offset printing press. (``What every backwoods cabin should have,''
Warren said.)
</P>
<P>
   As his housemates dropped by _ he lives with about a half-dozen
people, including two former girlfriends, a computer geek, his
caretaker and their children _ he settled into the kitchen and
started his story in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   He was 28 then, had a master's degree in mathematics and
statistics from the University of Texas at Austin and had spent
five years as a high school math teacher in his hometown of San
Antonio. He headed for California, looking for a change, and landed
in the Bay Area ``about two weeks before the free speech movement
exploded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He took a job as chairman of the math department at a Catholic
women's college, but the arrangement did not last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was throwing these huge nude parties at my house,'' Warren
said, a practice his employers found ``rather incompatible'' with
the school's philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Losing that job forced him to look for another line of work. A
friend who valued Warren's volunteer work teaching at the
Mid-Peninsula Free University gave him a job as a programmer at
Stanford Medical Center to guarantee that he would have sufficient
income to continue teaching.
</P>
<P>
   During those years, Warren earned more master's degrees: one in
computer engineering from Stanford University and another in
medical information science from the University of California at
San Francisco. He also worked as a research assistant on a project
at Stanford University called Arpanet, an experimental computer
network that became the precursor to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Homebrew Computer Club in Menlo Park, where a
group of hobbyists got together to swap code.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was a young man named Steve Jobs, who presented to
the club one of the first demonstrations of his new invention, the
Apple computer.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident, Warren said, that the personal computing
movement was born in the Bay Area. Its goal was to place computing
power into the hands of individuals, rather than to allow it to
remain exclusively the domain of corporations and the government.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the hippie and antiwar and utopian movements in the
Bay Area, I think, were key contributors to why microcomputing took
off in the Bay Area,'' Warren said. ``Why? Because we were willing
to share, rather than lock it up under patent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, Warren started editing Dr. Dobb's Journal, a
job that paid $350 per month. In 1977, he decided to put together a
computer fair as an outcropping of the Homebrew Computer Club.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the computer industry's great successes, the fair
started as a fiasco. Warren secured a location, advertised the fair
from coast to coast and then found he could not get the hall.
</P>
<P>
   He and his partner, Bob Reiling, scrambled to find another
location. The San Francisco Civic Auditorium was available, but for
$13,000 per day, a staggering sum to a man who grossed less than
$5,000 a year. But Warren ran some quick figures on a napkin and
figured that they might be able to break even. All he wanted to do
was get people together to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen thousand people showed up. Much to Warren's surprise,
the enterprise, the West Coast Computer Faire, turned a substantial
profit from the first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It printed money,'' Warren said. ``It just printed money.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, he sold the fair to the Prentice-Hall
publishing company for $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he had time to pursue politics. He ran for office
and was elected as a trustee to the local community college board,
lost an election for county supervisor and fought the local
planning department when zoning laws kept him from beginning
another commune. He also published newspapers, wrote computer
columns and eventually fused the worlds of politics and computing.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Browning, at the time a writer for The
National Journal, said she, along with others, was entertained by
the passionate anger Warren directed in his e-mail newsletter,
GovAccess, and his Boardwatch magazine columns toward
computer-illiterate elected officials. Years before the inception
of the World Wide Web, he was outraged that nearly all
congressional offices did not have e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   But now that politicians are hiring public relations firms to
spread the news of their passion for the Internet, Warren is more
annoyed than ever with the way politicians are using it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web pages don't count,'' he said. ``It's like putting a
brochure on the counter. That's not outreach.''
</P>
<P>
   He had envisioned a world of what he calls ``electronic precinct
walking,'' in which campaigns would turn staff members loose in
online forums to discuss issues with voters. He mounted campaigns
in 1992 and 1996 to try to get presidential campaigns to engage in
online debates before the primaries, which has still not happened.
</P>
<P>
   The current campaigns have staged online forums, but only when
the public goes to Web sites the candidates' staffs control.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the counterpart of having someone pick up literature in
your campaign headquarters,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   He saw the resistance of campaigns to engaging the public in
open forums back in 1996, when one campaign's staff members told
him that they did not want to participate in an online debate
because they could not control the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know who was going to ask something and couldn't
control what comments people were going to make,'' Warren said. But
seeking out voters in forums ``benefits the public in that it is
not a controlled message,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Warren has not agitated for online debates in this election
year, and he has not unleashed his usual torrent of e-mail messages
railing at the backwardness of those in power. But Warren says he
is available if anyone wants help. He does not care whether the
candidate is conservative or liberal, just as long as the goal is
to get information to people.
</P>
<P>
   And his price for such advice? Passing up the chance to join the
wave of profiteers crowding the computing world now, he said it
would not be the first time he had worked without a paycheck.

   John McCain is campaigning in Washington state Wednesday, fresh
off his big wins in Tuesday's Michigan and Arizona primaries. He
said he's building a ``governing coalition'' with Democratic and
independent voters, and that more Republicans should join in and
``enjoy the ride.'' Meanwhile, George W. Bush, stumping in Southern
California on Wednesday, told NBC that he'll eventually be the
Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   BENEFIT FOR OLDER VOTERS: GORE CALLS IT `MEDI-COVERAGE'
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore traveled Wednesday to the retirement community of
Deerfield Beach, Fla., to make his call for a bigger drug benefit
protecting the catastrophically or chronically ill elderly. He
hopes to dominate this year's political debate with the proposal.
Eyeing bigger potential budget surpluses, Gore plumped up his
campaign proposal for Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. He
dubbed the proposal ``Medi-coverage'' and declared it the ``third
great pillar'' in American health care, after Medicare and
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   IS THAT LIKE PLAYING IN THE WEED-EATER BOWL?
</P>
<P>
   Starting Wednesday, Bill Bradley is spending six crucial days
and a good deal of money in Washington state in hopes of winning a
Feb. 29 ``beauty contest'' where not a single Democratic convention
delegate will be selected. Bradley aides told Newhouse News Service
their man feels he needs to generate some momentum prior to Super
Tuesday, March 7, and believes that the nonbinding Washington state
contest offers him his best shot at grabbing some attention.
Bradley is currently trailing Al Gore in Washington by nine to 14
points, according to two recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK WHO'S GOT MORE DELEGATES NOW
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the two wins in Michigan and Arizona, John McCain has
taken the lead in the national delegate race. He picked up 52
delegates in Michigan, plus all 30 delegates from Arizona. That
gives him 90 delegates in all. George W. Bush has 67 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   PARTY BUILDING OR PARTY BORROWING
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and independents have been crossing over and voting in
greater numbers in Michigan's open Republican presidential
primaries. Here are the percentages of voters in the last three:
1992: Republicans, 70; Democrats, 4; independents, 26. 1996:
Republicans, 62; Democrats, 10; independents, 28. Tuesday (2000):
Republicans, 48; Democrats, 17; independents, 35.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN WITHIN MARGIN OF ERROR IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   A new poll Wednesday found that John McCain has caught up with
George W. Bush in New York, a key state in the big March 7 round of
voting. The poll from Marist College's Institute of Public Opinion,
taken before Tuesday's votes were counted, found Bush supported by
46 percent of New York's likely Republican voters and McCain backed
by 43 percent, a statistical tie given the poll's margin of error.
The New York primary is for Republicans only.
</P>
<P>
   BAY STATE BATTLERS
</P>
<P>
   It's John McCain and Al Gore in Massachusetts now. A new
University of Massachusetts polls shows that McCain holds a 58
percent to 34 percent lead over George W. Bush among likely
Republican voters, while Gore has expanded his lead over Bill
Bradley to 50 percent to 35 percent. In October, Gore trailed
Bradley by 8 points. The new survey (5 percentage point margin of
error) was begun after Bush was declared the winner of Saturday's
South Carolina primary. Massachusetts' primary is March 7.
</P>
<P>
   MOVING OVER TO THE MCCAIN SIDE
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's lead in Massachusetts apparently is based on his
strong showing among independents. The director of the University
of Massachusetts poll, Lou DiNatale, says McCain's lead reflects
the unprecedented switch in party registration by Democrats to
Republican this year. Secretary of State William Galvin announced
that as many as 30,000 voters have moved to the Republican or
independent rolls in the weeks since McCain stunned George W. Bush
in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   NON-REPUBLICANS MADE THE DIFFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's open GOP primary came down to a test of two disparate
political groupings. Exit polls showed that half of the Michigan
voters were non-Republicans _ independents and Democrats who voted
in far larger numbers than in the 1996 open primary. Two-thirds of
John McCain's vote came from non-Republicans, and two-thirds of
George Bush's vote came from bedrock Republicans. The National
Journal's Hotline notes that if only Republicans and independents
had been allowed to vote, Bush would have won 50 percent to 44
percent.
</P>
<P>
   SHOULD HE HAVE TO FALL ON HIS SWORD?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Michigan Gov. John Engler should have picked a less toxic
material when he boasted he was ``solid asbestos'' for George W.
Bush. Engler made that claim in December, when Bush was leading
John McCain 2 to 1 in Michigan polls. Engler spared no effort, but
his efforts fell flat. ``I may give the McCain organization a lot
of credit on this one, and I may have to take a lot of the blame,''
Engler said on MSNBC. ``I might have made a big strategic error''
in not countering McCain's appeal to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   NANCY, WITH THE LAUGHING FACE
</P>
<P>
   George Bush has most of the Republican endorsements, but there's
one that John McCain is trying hard to get in the next two weeks _
one that will help to make the case that he's the real Reaganite.
The Weekly Standard, a conservative political magazine, reports
that the McCain camp is working to get Nancy Reagan to make a
television ad backing the Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
   RACIAL BALANCE FOR KEYES
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes may be the first black candidate in a contest of
national importance whose support among whites and blacks was just
about the same. Keyes, an outspoken conservative, won the votes of
about 7 percent of the blacks who voted in the Michigan primary.
His support among voters overall was not much less than that.
</P>
<P>
   KEYES HASN'T HAD ENOUGH YET
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes isn't giving up his quest for the nomination.
Spokeswoman Connie Hair told the Arizona Republic: ``We're
absolutely staying in the race. We firmly believe Alan Keyes offers
the only alternative on moral issues. ... He isn't getting the
attention because he is black and conservative. ... He doesn't fit
the stereotype of a black liberal candidate. And the Detroit News
noted that Keyes may have played an influential role in McCain's
win by siphoning off conservative votes that may otherwise have
gone to George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   THE BRADLEY CREDO
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, speaking at Adelphi University in Long Island,
explained why he is running. ``I'm not a flashy man,'' he said.
``I've never been one, either on the floor of Madison Square Garden
or in the U.S. Senate.'' But he said his passion for the issues
``is deep in my heart and soul. I show it not by shouting or making
a fist, but by the consistency of my beliefs, and by my
never-ending fight to turn those beliefs into reality.'' And he'll
need all of that and more to catch up to Al Gore before the
make-or-break Super Tuesday contests March 7.
</P>
<P>
   RALLYING WITH A MESSAGE OF TRUST
</P>
<P>
   Needing a come-from-behind rally, Bill Bradley unfurled a new
stump speech pegging Al Gore as a political chameleon who cannot be
trusted. ``What do we really know about Al Gore?'' Bradley asked,
trying to imprint the message on voters in time for the March 7
Super Tuesday primaries: ``Al was anti-choice. ... Al was also a
reliable vote for the National Rifle Association ... and a
dependable vote for the tobacco companies throughout his
professional career.'' On tighter gun control, abortion rights and
stricter campaign finance laws, Bradley repeated over and over:
``It's what I believe, it's what I've always fought for, and it's
what I'll do as president.''
</P>
<P>
   DEFEND HER STATE, TAKE OUT BRADLEY AT THE SAME TIME
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman chided Al Gore for saying that
``racial profiling practically began in New Jersey.'' But the
Republican was quick to also take a shot at Bill Bradley, who
narrowly defeated her to win his third Senate term. Gore made his
comment during the Democratic debate in Harlem. Whitman wrote to
Gore that she understood he was ``trying to make the point that
Senator Bradley did little, if anything at all, to address the
problem of racial profiling during 18 years as a United States
senator. On that point you are absolutely on target.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTHING LIKE CONFETTI AND BALLOONS
</P>
<P>
   First, George W. Bush put a line in his stump speech that
sounded suspiciously like John McCain's complaint about soldiers on
food stamps. Then he started tooling around in a bus like McCain's
Straight Talk Express, but fancier. Now, the Bush campaign is
replicating another idea that, while hardly new, has been used to
good effect by McCain: confetti and balloons. After noticing how
often and well McCain's picture played in newspapers and magazines
because of his frequent use of confetti, streamers and balloons,
the Bush camp lately has been trying to do same thing.
</P>
<P>
   NOT HOME BAKING COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton makes no apologies for wrapping herself in
President Clinton's legacy as she campaigns for Senate in New York.
She says she's had a significant impact on her husband's policies,
as well as major accomplishments of her own. In an interview with
the New York Daily News, she declared that she has been a player in
the administration with an important role on issues from welfare
reform to the president's popular economic agenda. ``I think that,
in the course of our life together, we've been partners in so many
ways,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   PLAY THE APOLLO, THEN TAKE THE SHOW ON THE ROAD
</P>
<P>
   Describing the rambunctious presidential debate on racial issues
at the Apollo Theater in Harlem as a valuable exercise for voters,
Hillary Clinton said she'd like to debate Republican rival Rudy
Giuliani on the same topics and in the same setting. Then she
suggested that the two embark on a debating tour across New York.
``Wouldn't that be fun?'' she told reporters in Tonawanda, outside
Buffalo. ``It would be fun to do. Stand up in all sorts of settings
all over the state.''
</P>
<P>
   DO YOU `PUSH-POLL'? ANSWER TRUTHFULLY, WE'RE POLLING YOU
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani's Senate campaign accused Hillary Clinton's camp
of engaging in manipulative telephone calls to spread negative
impressions. Clinton's campaign immediately responded that the
charges were untrue, and that the mayor was a hypocrite. The charge
was based on an article in this week's New York magazine, which
reported on a Westchester County resident being ``push-polled,'' a
practice in which callers posing as pollsters ask questions in such
a way as to spread negative and often false information about
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   NELSON GETS INTO NEBRASKA RACE
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic Gov. Ben Nelson said Wednesday he'll run for
the Nebraska seat being vacated by Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey.
Kerrey, who is not seeking a third term, and other top Nebraska
Democrats had urged Nelson, a 58-year-old Omaha lawyer, to seek the
seat, the only statewide elected office not held by a Republican.
No other Democrats are running. Nelson lost a Senate bid in 1996 to
Republican Chuck Hagel.

   SCOTUS-HEALTH (Washington) _ The Supreme Court raised a blizzard
of questions on Wednesday about a patient's challenge to the
fundamental principle of managed care that rewards doctors who hold
down costs. After hearing arguments for an hour on issues that
could affect more than 160 million Americans, the court appeared
skeptical about letting patients sue HMO's in federal court for

   SCOTUS-HAWAII (Washington) _ Voting for office of Hawaiian
affairs has been limited by state law to descendants of native
Hawaiians, but the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday, 7-2, that this
violates the Constitution, which prohibits voting discrimination on
the basis of race. There was no immediate indication that the
ruling has practical implications beyond Hawaii, but it shakes
things up in that state. Plus a roundup of other rulings, including
a unanimous one saying that the equal protection clause can apply

Michigan and Arizona left many of his staunchest supporters and

that they were no longer certain he would make it to the

<P>
   REPUBS-CALIF (Los Angeles) _ For John McCain, the California
primary is a glittering dream and a surreal nightmare. From the
beginning, the Arizona senator's improbable quest was to win the
primary election here in his neighboring state, inherit the western
cowboy mantle of his political hero Ronald Reagan and become the
Republican Party's all but inevitable nominee. The big catch is
that McCain might win more total votes than his rival George W.
Bush in the nation's most populous state, and yet lose all 162 of
California's Republican delegates, 15 percent of the total needed
for the nomination. That is because only the votes of registered
Republicans will count toward selecting delegates, which are doled
out winner-take-all, though the names of all candidates will appear
on the same ballot regardless of party, and voters of any party may
pick any candidate. By Todd S. Purdum.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faster than you can say Regis Philbin, your eardrums are
rattling with the cheesy, synthesized theme music that opens every
broadcast of the trivia quiz show phenomenon ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.'' Seconds later the familiar voice of Philbin, the
television program's host, is urging contestants to answer
multiple-choice brain teasers like:
</P>
<P>
   What was the gunslinger Doc Holliday's profession? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A.Banker &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B.Dentist &QL;
</P>
<P>
   C.Plumber &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.Chemist &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The questions tend to be tougher as each correct answer _ 15, to
be exact _ moves players toward the million-dollar question. (The
correct answer to the above question is B.) This, however, is not
the ABC network television program, but a digital reflection of it
that has been repackaged and crammed onto a CD-ROM for personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The computer game provides no studio audience to cheer you to
victory as audiences do on the real thing, but there is canned
applause here and there.
</P>
<P>
   Players on television can occasionally get ``lifeline'' help
from the audience or a friend, but the game player can get no such
help with sticky questions. The game does offer some canned fake
telephone calls that can lend some guidance. The biggest difference
is that there isn't a million bucks at stake, only the possibility
of bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   Jellyvision, the game design team responsible for the wildly
successful computer game ``You Don't Know Jack'' has created a
fairly faithful simulation of ``Millionaire'' for the PC. The major
elements are there: lots of multiple-choice questions, instant
gratification for getting them right and a sudden end to the action
for getting one wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Players are even treated to loads of recorded voice tracks of
Philbin's wisecracking, good-natured banter. When a player lost in
the early going on the computer version of ``Millionaire,'' the
Philbin voice-over seemed delighted to announce, for instance, that
the player was leaving the game empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know we don't see many of those,'' the recording chirps,
referring to the zero on a virtual check that was made out in the
player's name and flashed on the screen. ``It's such a lonely
number, even lonelier than one, and it's so fat. A big, fat zero.''
Philbin's voice gains in volume and cadence as he adds, ``That's
what you got.''
</P>
<P>
   Who Wants To Be a Millionaire is an example of how computer game
designers try to capture the sizzle of something hot on television
or in the movies and refashion it for PCs or game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months there has been an avalanche of computer games
that can trace their short ancestry to television shows and movies.
But many of these games fail to make the leap from one medium to
another.
</P>
<P>
   Computer games have a long and twisted history of gobbling up
pulse-quickening Hollywood creations only to spit out forgettable,
dull shadows of the originals. There are notable exceptions, of
course, like the long line of successful Star Wars computer games
that culminated in last year's stunning Star Wars Episode I Racers,
distributed by Lucas Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The impulse for game designers to take advantage of well-known
television shows and films is understandable. Traditional game
makers have, for example, been churning out low-tech board games
based on programs like ``The Mickey Mouse Club,'' ``The Mod Squad''
and ``Wheel of Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest challenges for a new computer game is to
find an audience among players with fickle tastes. Luring players
is often easier when a game is built around well-recognized
characters, settings and established concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the marketing and communications jobs faster,'' said
Jim Simmons, producer of a new game by SouthPeak Interactive called
Wild, Wild West: The Steel Assassin. ``Instead of it being in a box
on a shelf tied to characters and worlds no one had ever heard of,
we didn't have to deal with any of that. We had a great starting
point: characters were well-defined with well-defined
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   But translating well-known television shows and films into
computer games is fraught with creative constraints and traps.
Teen-age libidos aside, what else can explain why computer games
based on the movies' swashbuckling archaeologist Indiana Jones
never approached the success of the swashbuckling archaeologist
Lara Croft, dreamed up exclusively for the Tomb Raider series of
computer games?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This month's top 40 games poll conducted by and published in
Computer Gaming World listed no game based on a television show or
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The designers of Wild, Wild West were faced with the tough task
of basing a computer game on a film that last year fumbled its
translation from a popular 1960s television series. The game is a
plodding, action-starved rendition of a bad movie.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, SouthPeak's recent reworking of the
television series ``The Dukes of Hazzard'' into a computer game _
The Dukes of Hazzard: Racing Home _ for the PlayStation game
console is a good example of how to marry the strengths of one
medium with those of another.
</P>
<P>
   The game has all the main characters, including the General Lee,
the cherry-red 1969 Dodge Charger in which the Dukes race along the
roads of Hazzard.
</P>
<P>
   SouthPeak was able to get many of the actors from the old show
to do their characters' voices for the game, a detail that Wild,
Wild West, which is filled with dialogue, could have used.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dukes game excels most in its basic design. It is a
racing game with a plot that feels as if it could have been gleaned
from a lost episode. There is a palpable tension in driving the
General Lee to town, avoiding capture and racing the clock. The
game may soon be coming out in a PC version, pushing its graphics
even harder.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, store shelves and discount bins are filling up
with television- and movie-based computer games. Are some worth a
spin in your computer or game console? It's hit and miss.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few others to consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Austin Powers: Operation Trivia. A miss.
</P>
<P>
   Although this game captures the look and sound of the two
hilarious movie spoofs of 1960s spy films, the game simply uses the
movies' zany psychedelic iconography to market a pop culture trivia
game. Worse, the game has little to do with the real spirit of
Austin Powers and his battles with his chief nemesis, Dr. Evil.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sabrina the Teen-age Witch: Brat Attack. A hit.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wild, Wild West, Sabrina, based on a television series, is
heavy on solving problems and light on action. But the Sabrina game
is intended for a different audience, a much younger group, ages 8
to 12, made up primarily of girls. The puzzles are clever, and the
look of the game, which combines traditional-looking animation for
characters and computer-generated imagery for objects and
backgrounds, is enjoyable to watch and manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Star Trek Deep Space 9: The Fallen. A hit.
</P>
<P>
   This long-awaited game taps into the long-running space-opera
franchise for characters, plot structure and inspiration for a
dark, violent game. Based on an enhanced version of the highly
acclaimed Unreal Tournament game engine, the game play in previews
has proved to be engaging and entertaining. &QL;

 &HT;     BUSH-McCAIN FIGHT CENTERS ON WHO DETERMINES THE NOMINEE  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON_ Key questions in the fiery battle between George W.
Bush and John McCain are who owns the Republican Party and who is
entitled to take part in the selection of its presidential nominee?
</P>
<P>
   These issues are not new but are more important now than in
recent years because independents and Democrats provided the
winning tallies for McCain in New Hampshire and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who moved sharply rightward in the Feb. 19 South Carolina
showdown to shore up his support among stalwarts of the religious
right, argues that only doctrinaire Republicans, who presumably are
adherents to his philosophy of ``compassionate conservatism,''
should determine the GOP's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   If people who are not officially aligned with the Republican
Party had been banned from voting in Michigan, Bush said quite
correctly, he would have won.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain contends that the votes of independents and
Democrats, which he won overwhelmingly in New Hampshire and
Michigan, are indispensable to a Republican nominee because he
cannot win the presidency without them.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential hopefuls claim Ronald Reagan's legacy of
attracting non-Republican support. But so far McCain has been the
chief beneficiary of the votes of individuals who used to be
described as ``Reagan Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls indicate that Bush lost support among
independents and Democrats nationwide when he embraced the
religious right and ultra-conservative southerners who appeared to
accept the racial tenets of the old Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   During the South Carolina primary campaign, the Rev. Pat
Robertson, a Bush supporter, claimed that the nomination of McCain
as president would ruin the Republican Party because the religious
right would not vote from him in November.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson is old enough to remember that similar predictions
about the demise of the GOP were made in 1964 when
ultra-conservative Barry Goldwater was nominated for president and
a number of leaders of the party's moderate wing refused to support
him.
</P>
<P>
   Election Day proved a disaster for Republicans that year.
President Lyndon Johnson carried 61 percent of the popular vote and
Goldwater only 39 percent. The crisis was compounded within the GOP
because it also lost 38 seats in the House and two in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the disaster was short-lived. Four years later the
Republican Party rebounded to win the presidency with Richard Nixon
at its helm.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, some observers predicted the end of the Democratic
Party following the 1972 nomination of George McGovern, an
anti-Vietnam candidate who carried only one state, Massachusetts,
while Nixon won the other 49. In 1974, Nixon was forced to resign,
and in 1976 Democrat Jimmy Carter was elected President.
</P>
<P>
   From 1932, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was first elected
president, until 1952, when Dwight D. Eisenhower won that office,
the Democrats controlled the presidency. During 16 of those 20
years, they also controlled the two houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans never gave up. With Alfred M. Landon in
1936, Wendell Wilkie in 1940 and Thomas E. Dewey in 1944 and 1948,
they fought vigorously, but in vain, to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Then they nominated Eisenhower, the charismatic military hero of
World War II, and won the presidency with the help of independents
and Democrats, many of whom had, in previous elections, voted for
Roosevelt and Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson knows that. He also knows that scare warnings, such as
those he has been voicing on television and in recorded telephone
messages to voters, can sometimes win elections. One has to wonder
whether his Christian faith is as strong as his Republican faith.
</P>
<P>
   Internecine warfare has long been part of the American political
system _ for instance, between liberals and conservatives,
internationalists and isolationists, integrationists and
segregationists and proponents and opponents of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their vicious personal assaults on each other, Al Gore
and Bill Bradley, in their fight for the Democratic presidential
nomination, have differences that are largely ones of degree.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley has asserted that Gore's word cannot be trusted
and has branded him a ``conservative,'' he basically agrees with
the vice president on the issues that are important to the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the current Republican contest recalls the 1952
effort of an outsider, Eisenhower, to wrest the nomination from the
commandant of old guard, Ohio Sen. Robert A. Taft, who was known as
``Mr. Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ike, McCain is a onetime military hero with an ingratiating
grin, who is pounding at the gates of the temple of the Republican
hierarchy. Until Eisenhower resigned as supreme commander of NATO
forces in Europe and returned home to campaign, it was anticipated
that Taft would carry the GOP banner into the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There were two defining issues in that campaign. One was Ike's
internationalism versus Taft's isolationism. The other was the fact
that Ike looked like a sure winner against the Democrats, and the
stodgy Taft did not.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is in his third term in the Senate, is far more
knowledgeable about domestic affairs than Eisenhower was and he
knows now that he must strengthen his appeal to Republican regulars
as he enters several closed primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a far more engaging personality than Taft. But he is
today's undisputed candidate of the right wing. Having narrowed his
political base, he now must try to broaden it.

 &HT;    DESPITE INFLUENCE, U.S. REAPPEARS AS A VILLAIN IN LEBANESE EYES
 &HT;    With photos.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ As Lebanese-American relations turned openly
bitter last week, a transplanted Texan could see both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ghaleb teaches linguistics to the elite of Lebanon's youth
at the American University of Beirut. On one of her office walls is
a huge orange University of Texas banner, on another hangs a
picture of the Austin city skyline. Her students study in English
and wear American-styled clothing.
</P>
<P>
   But AUB students last week were among the leaders of three days
of protests against American support for Israel. They were sparked
by Israeli attacks on Lebanese power plants and marked another low
in relations between Lebanon and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're burning the American flag, it hurts,'' said
Ghaleb, a 54-year-old who was born in Lebanon when her father was
in the U.S. Army, but was raised in Garland, Texas. She received a
Ph.D. from UT.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``No matter where we go as Americans, we seem to
screw up. Israel isn't the only country in the world, why is it
that they are so favored?''
</P>
<P>
   Students _ mostly peaceful _ were tear-gassed by Lebanese police
near the entrance of the fortress-like American embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes were mild reminders of the anarchic 1980s, when
bombings at a U.S. Marines barracks and the U.S. Embassy here
killed more than 240 people. Even the peaceful, grassy, campus of
AUB was dragged into the violence, with school officials kidnapped
and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's anger came in response to American official's
failure to condemn the Israeli air strikes, which injured about 15
and prompted electricity rationing around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Israel struck in response to attacks by Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas that killed seven Israeli soldiers in the strip of
southern Lebanon that Israel occupies along its northern border.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Hezbollah is seen as a popular resistance to foreign
occupation. The group _ which is not connected to the government _
acts mostly under Syrian and Iranian influence, and Lebanese are
tired of being punished in Israeli reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Local anger reached a peak when U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, in initial statements, said that Israel was
trying to ``send a message'' to Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese had hoped Americans would criticize attacks on civilian
facilities. Albright's comments lead to a series of meetings
between U.S. Ambassador David Satterfield and Lebanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Kandil, head of Lebanon's media regulation agency, said
in an interview that in one meeting President Emile Lahoud warned
Satterfield that Israeli strikes could prompt attacks by individual
Lebanese around the world against Jewish targets.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials later called for Israeli restraint, which seemed
to mollify Lebanese officials.
</P>
<P>
   The tension comes after the 1990s saw improved ties between
Lebanon and the United States. But, students at AUB said they are
tired of lingering American misconceptions of Lebanese _ as either
terrorists, or backward _ as well as American military backing of
an Israeli army that occupies part of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   They were shocked when it appeared the United States was
condoning Israeli attacks on civilian sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrific,'' said Yarob Marouf, a 24-year-old Syrian
computer graphics student at AUB who protested at the embassy.
``It's an insult to us. Not only to our humanity, but to our
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not against the American people. We think the Americans
are being tricked. They pay their tax dollars so we can get
killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ghaleb, too, feels most Americans do not understand Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   She has been coming to Beirut as an adult since 1963. She
studied at AUB and met her Lebanese husband. When the Lebanese
civil war brought anarchy in the mid-1980s, she returned to Texas
for eight years and got her Ph.D. in philosophy from UT.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to Beirut in 1993. There was a ban on American
travel to Beirut at the time, but she was one of the first to
receive an exemption.
</P>
<P>
   She said she feels safe. Attacks against Americans have stopped
and there is little street crime. She just faces occasional
homesickness, which she treats with visits to the Starbucks coffee
shop or Johnny Rockets, two of many American franchises that have
opened here in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Two of her four grown children are in the United States _ Aline
Ghaleb is a doctor in Temple, Texas. The other two are in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Ghaleb said Lebanon could be an important U.S. ally, possibly
re-establishing its status as a vital economic hub on the
Mediterranean Sea. For now, she said, the recent U.S. statements in
support of Israel just ``rubbed salt in the wounds'' of the air
strikes.

SCREEN MATES FOR FUN OR PROFIT

<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something decidedly tranquil about sitting back and
watching sheep contentedly frolic and graze. And if you're stuck in
the office and can't get to the country, watching a little cartoon
sheep scamper around your computer's screen and head-butt your
icons can be relaxing in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   The Esheep, as the playful ovine fellow is sometimes known, is
part of a genre of digital trinkets called screen mates or screen
buddies. Not quite a full screen saver, like After Dark's Flying
Toasters or the flag-flapping Windows logo, screen mates provide a
quick shot of amusement and desktop distraction without covering up
the whole screen.
</P>
<P>
   Cute little animals are generally free popular screen mates.
Besides sheep, dogs and cats abound, as well as human characters
drawn in the style of Japanese animation style known as anime.
Other widely circulated screen mates include an animated orange and
a digital depiction of the Mona Lisa. If you search Yahoo
(www.yahoo.com) for ``screen mates,'' you'll get a list of links.
The Virtual Pet Shop also has many screen mates that can be
downloaded (www.virtualpetshop.co.uk).
</P>
<P>
   The programs are small enough to be unobtrusive message
attachments and can be downloaded quickly from Web sites. Along
with chain letters and redneck jokes, screen mates are a favorite
tidbit to pass along from friend to friend _ a noncommercial form
of the ``viral'' marketing style that has proved effective on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Screen mates are also turning up as free offerings from
commercial sites. The site for Lipton's Brisk Tea (www.brisktea.com
_ look for the Briskmates link) provides a free Bruce Lee screen
mate that echoes the look of the product's television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet just isn't about the Web anymore,'' said Kyle
Shannon, a co-founder of Agency.com, a Web site development company
that produced the Lipton Brisk Tea site. ``What these little things
do is allow you to take some sort of brand message, or funny
characters or some little piece of entertainment, and have that
live beyond the Web site. If the content is good enough, people
will send it to one another as an e-mail attachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon predicts that screen mates will become more than amusing
diversions. By linking a screen mate to a Web server, the little
cartoon character could walk around the desktop providing weather
forecasts and stock quotes. ``I see the future of these things
becoming quite ubiquitous and specialized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether for fun or profit, screen mates show no sign of going
away. Even though the thrill of a sheep or walking citrus on your
screen may quickly fade, new users discover the screen mates every
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little piece of entertainment for the Internet _ which
is notoriously about short-attention-span theater,'' Shannon said.

COMPUTER COLUMN: BATTLING COOKIE MONSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In my neighborhood in the physical world, it is customary to
welcome new neighbors with a housewarming gift, perhaps a plate of
cookies. It never occurred to me, however, to implant surveillance
equipment in the cookies so I can monitor my neighbors' habits and
sell that information to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why I'll never be as rich as the folks at
DoubleClick Inc., who have attracted billions of dollars from
investors, advertisers and Web sites in part by using software
cookies _ small computer files that Web sites insert into your
computer _ to gather information about the online habits of tens of
millions of Internet users, often without their knowledge or
informed consent.
</P>
<P>
   But with a little knowledge, a computer user can block this
information gathering by refusing cookies or using software to
create online anonymity. Or the user can visit a Web site set up by
the company to opt out of the information circus.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick, which describes itself as the world's largest
Internet advertising company, is not the only cookie pusher on the
Web, and it is certainly not the worst. And online cookie pushers
are benign and well behaved compared with direct marketers who
begin building consumer dossiers on children from their birth
announcements and school records, who know within 24 hours from
your credit card records that you bought underwear at
Bloomingdale's and who will sell that information to almost anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Most commercial Web sites use some form of tracking mechanism to
gather information about visitors: when they log on, where they
come from, how long they stay, what they see, what they click,
where they go when they leave. The information is supposed to be
anonymous _ just the recorded actions of a computer, not of a
person with a name.
</P>
<P>
   It is the potential to combine online information gathered by
DoubleClick and its fellow Web weasels with offline personal
information gathered by the direct-marketing pack rats that gives
some people the creeps.
</P>
<P>
   Although it once promised that it would never do such a thing,
DoubleClick now plans to match the supposedly anonymous information
gathered from cookies in your computer with your name, address,
telephone number, age, sex, income level and history of purchases
at retail, catalog and online stores. All that personal information
is contained in a vast direct-marketing database that DoubleClick
bought last year. (Asked about the apparent double-cross, a
spokesman for DoubleClick said this week that the company ``never
said never.'')
</P>
<P>
   As a result of its plans, DoubleClick is being investigated by
the Federal Trade Commission and the attorneys general of New York
and Michigan, and it is the defendant in several class-action
lawsuits accusing it of unfairly and deceptively gathering and
selling personal information about consumers.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. DoubleClick feeds your computer a welcome
cookie the first time you click on an advertisement on one of about
1,800 popular Web sites where it provides the advertisements. It
does so automatically, unless you reconfigure your browser to
reject cookies.
</P>
<P>
   If you use a recent version of Internet Explorer, go to the
Tools menu, click Internet Options, then the Security tab. Setting
security on ``high'' will block cookies. From Netscape Navigator's
Edit menu, choose Preferences, then Advanced, and then set your
cookie options.
</P>
<P>
   Once the cookie is in your computer, it allows DoubleClick to
track everything your browser software does or sees on a
DoubleClick-affiliated site. If you go to a site that uses one of
DoubleClick's competitors, like RealMedia, which is used by The New
York Times on the Web, another cookie takes over.
</P>
<P>
   What The New York Times Web site does with this information is
outlined in a privacy statement at the bottom of the Web page. Real
Media does not allow consumers to opt out of its tracking program,
and it says it does not target consumers based on personally
identifiable information, but the company says it will ``inform you
of how to opt out if our policy changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, the cookie file itself does not gather or store
any personal information about the user. But in real life, some
sites record user names and e-mail addresses in the cookie file.
Most do not.
</P>
<P>
   To view the cookie files on your computer, search your hard disk
for files named ``cookie'' and open them with a word processor. You
will see an assortment of digital tags that let the Web site
identify your computer as a unique visitor. At the other end of the
connection, the Web site uses the tags to create a record of what
advertisements, articles and services your browser has seen. The
tags by themselves are supposed to be anonymous.

   The sticky part would come if DoubleClick were to link your name
routinely with your browsing habits and to provide that
information, even indirectly, to other companies. That is exactly
what it plans to do, but, it says, only with your permission.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick said the cookie information alone allows it to
provide targeted advertisements to the computer and to track them
so the same tedious advertisements do not show up time after time.
It does that without knowing your name.
</P>
<P>
   It's the next step that's new. By linking the supposedly
anonymous online information it gathers through cookies with
personal information drawn from its vast direct marketing database,
DoubleClick said, it will be able to focus in on consumers with
laserlike precision. DoubleClick has not sent out any
advertisements based on personal information, but it plans to do so
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For example: Joe lives in Westchester County, N.Y., has a fat
income, has a history of buying a new car every three years and is
due for another one, and he spent an hour yesterday clicking around
on Autobytel.com, where he lingered for 29 minutes looking at Ford
Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Car dealers in his area would probably pay handsomely to send
advertisements to Joe's computer screen and to have his phone
number and home address. Joe may in fact appreciate such personal
attention. DoubleClick says it will not provide personal data
directly to the dealer but will use the information itself to send
advertisements to Joe. Once it learned that the FTC was looking
into its practices, however, Doubleclick promised that it would
never link the data it gathers about a user's visits to online
health, sex, child-related or financial information sites to the
personally identifiable database. And it promised that it would
never share any personally identifiable information with merchants,
advertisers or Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   What if Joe does not want to be tracked so intimately? No
problem, DoubleClick says. He can ``opt out.'' (Perversely, that
entails putting an ``opt out'' cookie on your hard disk.) But the
company said that most consumers appreciate the convenience of
targeted advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick has established a Web site (www.privacychoices.org)
that it advertises as a national resource for consumer privacy
information. It might be unfair to think of this as the equivalent
of a cigarette company's offering to become a national resource for
health issues, but I found such thoughts unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, DoubleClick includes a resources page that
includes many links to privacy organizations that have criticized
the new policies. DoubleClick also offers a button that consumers
can click to opt out of its surveillance program, although the
consumer will have to do this for each browser and each computer
used. Remember, however, that if the cookies are deleted, you will
not be able to use Web sites that require registration, like The
New York Times on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Many, if not most, of DoubleClick's competitors do not give the
user the option of opting out.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to opt out, go to Privacychoices.org, or follow the
links on the site to the Electronic Privacy Information Center
(www.epic.org), which has tools consumers can use to safeguard
their privacy online. Other sites worth visiting include the Center
for Democracy and Technology (www.cdt.org), and Junkbusters

   A Narcissus by Another Name
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently brought into bloom some Chinese sacred lilies from
a garden center. To my surprise, one turned out to be a double,
which I've never seen before. Have I a chance of propagating this
oddity? I usually throw these bulbs out.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Chinese sacred lily probably arrived in the Orient from
somewhere in the Middle East, said Dr. August De Hertogh, a
professor of horticultural science and a flower bulb specialist at
North Carolina State University in Raleigh. ``The reason it's
sacred is because it's for New Year,'' he said. ``New Year is a big
flower day in China.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason it is called a lily is less clear, unless the name
comes from its powerfully sweet fragrance. Like paperwhites, these
flowers are actually a type of tender narcissus (N. tazetta) sold
for indoor forcing. They are slower to bloom than paperwhites,
bloom less profusely and flop more, but they smell much better.
</P>
<P>
   Your bulb could be a unique mutation. But it is far more likely
that somewhere between the grower and you, a true double was mixed
in with the singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they came from Israel, which is highly likely,'' De Hertogh
said, ``they could be Constantinople, a double with a ruffled white
perianth and fringy yellow petals in the middle.'' Israeli growers
often plant different narcissuses quite close together, he
explained, making it easy for a bulb to stray into the wrong lot.
</P>
<P>
   To propagate it, plant it in well-drained soil, put it where it
will stay cool (50 to 60 degrees) and get the brightest light
possible. Feed with half-strength fertilizer every two weeks or so
until the foliage starts to die back in late spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the foliage yellows, cut it off, quit watering and store
warm, 77 to 86 degrees, for four months, to simulate a
Mediterranean summer,'' De Hertogh said. ``In late September, water
and start again.''
</P>
<P>
   The central bulb will flower next year if its nutritional needs
are met; the daughter bulbs will take two to four more years. For
faster and more reliable gratification, double (and single) Chinese
sacred lilies will be available next fall from Old House Gardens
(536 Third St., Ann Arbor, Mich. 48103; 734-995-1486; catalog $2)
and Brent &AMP; Becky's Bulbs (7463 Heath Trail, Gloucester, Va. 23061;
877-661-2852; free catalog). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Art of Drying Herbs
</P>
<P>
   Q. How should one dry herbs and hot peppers? How long does the
flavor last? Can you tell by the color when they are no longer of
value?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you are not feeling romantic, you can use a commercial
dehydrator. If you want the warm sense of accomplishment that
accompanies the low-tech approach, all you need is an attic or
other dark, dry, very warm (but not hot) area that gets plenty of
air circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Most herbs have the strongest flavor right before they start to
form flower buds. They should be freshly picked and completely dry.
The hot peppers should be thin-fleshed types, like cayenne and Thai
hot, fully mature and starting to turn color; they need not be
completely red.
</P>
<P>
   For herbs, use rubber bands to tie loose bunches of eight stems
or so. For peppers, use a needle and button thread to string them
through the stems, leaving small spaces between. (If doing more
than a few peppers, protect your hands with plastic gloves.) Hang
in the chosen spot and keep checking. Herbs are ready when brittle,
peppers when leathery, in roughly 3 to 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Strip herb leaves from the stems, but leave them whole. Clip
peppers from their strings. Store in dark, airtight glass jars in a
cool, dry place for up to a year. If you plan to eat them, don't
hang dried herbs or peppers in the kitchen, where they will gather
greasy dust and be degraded by light, heat and steam.
</P>
<P>
   Color is indeed a clue. A pale look presages pale taste. But be
careful: taste and heat are different qualities. Peppers can be
white with age and still pack a fearsome wallop.

REPLACING INSULATED GLASS WINDOWS 
</HEADLINE>

 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most competent do-it-yourselfers can replace an ordinary pane of
glass in a window sash without difficulty. A replacement pane can
be easily cut to size at the local hardware store or home center,
and the actual installation is usually a straightforward matter.
</P>
<P>
   Not all windows are that easy to reglaze. Many modern windows
have insulated glass, and the replacement procedures can be more
involved. That is because insulated glass consists of two panes
separated by a barrier of air or inert, colorless gas. The gas
serves as an insulator and is locked between the glass panes by a
seal around the edges of the glass sandwich. Since insulated glass
is a combination of elements joined together, it is called an
''insulated glass unit.''
</P>
<P>
   If the seal on an insulated unit deteriorates, moisture will
eventually seep into the glass envelope and condense on the glass.
Quality-brand windows are usually under warranty against seal
failure. If a condensation problem develops, the manufacturer
should provide a free replacement with the installation done by a
professional. Should someone accidentally break the glass, the
warranty is voided and the homeowner is responsible for replacing
the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Because insulated glass is a sealed unit, you cannot cut it
without damaging the seal. Instead, you must order a replacement to
the exact dimensions of the original; this includes thickness as
well as the length and width. Unfortunately, home centers and
hardware stores do not stock insulated glass. It must be specially
ordered from the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers will not accept orders directly from homeowners.
Instead, you will have to go to a glazier who does residential
glasswork and have him place the order. You will need to provide
the dimensions for the replacement unit and include the
manufacturer's numerical code on the aluminum spacer between the
panes of glass. This number is important because it gives the
manufacturer data about your particular insulated glass unit.
</P>
<P>
   You must remove the unit from the sash to measure its dimensions
accurately. It is held in place with stops around the inside edge
of the sash. (A few manufacturers make window sashes that are
constructed around the unit. To remove the insulated glass unit,
the entire sash must be disassembled. Usually, this is best left to
a professional.)
</P>
<P>
   The stops are mounted to the sash with wire brads and fixed with
silicone sealant. It is essential to cut the seal around the stop
before attempting to remove it; otherwise you could break the stop.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, use a sharp utility knife and run the blade around
the stops where they contact the glass. To avoid damaging the
stops, make a series of passes with the knife rather than one deep
cut. Remember to keep the free hand clear of the knife as you draw
it around the sash. Use a stiff putty knife to gently pry the stops
away from the sash. Insert the knife between the sash and the stop,
not between the stop and the glass, and work the stops loose. When
you free the stops, the holding brads will still be projecting
through. Pull them out of the stops with a pair of end nippers.
</P>
<P>
   As you remove the unit, check to see if there are any rubber
spacers around the recesses of sash. If so, put them aside; you
will need them when you install the replacement. If this technique
sounds like a lot of trouble, you can bring the entire sash to the
glazier and let him remove the insulated glass and take the
necessary measurements to place the order.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a week or more for the replacement to arrive from
the manufacturer. In the meantime, you can install a temporary pane
of ordinary window glass in the sash.
</P>
<P>
   Do not attempt to seal the new insulated glass in the sash with
ordinary glazier's compound or window putty. Instead lay a
quarter-inch bead of silicone caulk (this is available in
cartridges at hardware stores and home centers) in the sash recess.
The caulk will cushion the glass against the sash and provide a
watertight barrier against outside moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Position the replacement glass unit in the sash by placing one
end in the recess then gently lowering the entire unit. Next, wedge
the spacers in place between the unit and the sash. These should be
positioned so the unit is centered in the sash opening.
</P>
<P>
   With the insulated glass unit properly seated, position the
stops around the edges. Use a lightweight hammer to drive one-and
a-half-inch brads through the stops into the sash. Work carefully
to avoid damaging the glass. Drive the brads at an angle so the
stops wedge against the glass and the sash. Use a nail set to
countersink the brads, then fill the holes with wood filler. &QL;

FOX _ AND REALITY TV _ BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reality just rose up and bit reality programming in the behind.
</P>
<P>
   Learning that its ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?''
bridegroom might not be the choice cut of humanity he seemed to be,
the Fox television network quickly canceled a condensed repeat of
last week's special and swore off any future matrimonial stunts.
</P>
<P>
   Fox acted after learning that the groom, 42-year-old Rick
Rockwell, was on the receiving end of a judicial restraining order
nine years ago, after he allegedly threatened to harm a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   So there's one more lovely gift for Darva Conger, 34, the
emergency room nurse who met and promptly married Rockwell two
weeks ago in Las Vegas, for the two-hour Fox special that was
televised February 15.
</P>
<P>
   Now, like Bart Simpson, Fox executives are standing at the
blackboard and writing, over and over again, that they will arrange
no more marriages between complete strangers, even during sweeps
months.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's attraction to the marriage special is understandable
enough. The fickle TV audience is sick of formulaic comedies and
dramas. The quicksilver success of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' on ABC seemingly proved that viewers are receptive to
unpredictable formats that tantalizingly mix real people with large
sums of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' powerfully
underscored the point. Whatever else it was, the special was a
mesmerizing specimen of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   When it aired, its ratings climbed each quarter hour. Obviously,
people were watching and calling their friends _ hurry, turn on
Fox, you won't believe this show. By the time it was over, the
audience totaled 23 million people, which these days is monster hit
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Without a rerun or sequel, ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multi-Millionaire'' passes into TV lore with the frozen image of
Rockwell planting a wet one on Conger's lips, while the instant
bride trembled and looked like a deer caught in headlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' is an admittedly
brazen piece of larger trend toward outrageous reality shows.
</P>
<P>
   There are the big-money quiz shows, of course _ ``Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire'' on ABC, ``Greed'' on Fox and the revived
``Twenty-One'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   There are stunt shows _ UPN recently entered the field with ``I
Dare You!'' _ as well as the ``world's wildest'' and ``world's
scariest'' varietals that Fox perfected and now wants to distance
itself from.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the more bizarre imports from Europe and Japan,
refurbished for American television.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has two in the works. ``Survivor,'' scheduled for the
summer, involves stranding 16 people on an uninhabited Pacific
island; the contestants will eliminate each other by ballot until
the last one wins $1 million. The other is ``Big Brother,'' in
which volunteers will endure three months in a home equipped with
24 cameras and 59 microphones, including in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   But reality shows are risky programming, and surely Fox's
experience this week is sending a cautionary chill through TV
networks accustomed to manipulating the outcomes of scripted shows.
Human nature is a formidable variable; modern TV executives
distrust variables.
</P>
<P>
   The warning signs were out there. ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' has run into a few spats with contestants over
correct answers to big-money questions. Perhaps more illustrative
is MTV's predicament last year with its pioneering reality
franchise, ``Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   In its eighth season, set in Hawaii, MTV ran into a problem with
one of the young strangers it placed in a beachfront house. Her
name was Ruthie. She was 21, and she was a drunk.
</P>
<P>
   In the season premiere, Ruthie's new housemates had to summon an
ambulance for her because of alcohol poisoning. At another point,
she drunkenly got behind the wheel of a car. And later she got into
a fight with several other cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real World'' executive producer Mary-Ellis Bunim, fearing that
she was ``watching a train wreck,'' finally intervened and broke
MTV's hands-off rule to force Ruthie into a rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
   MTV was lucky. What if the drunken driving had resulted in a
fatal crash? What if Ruthie had died after her drinking binge?
</P>
<P>
   It can't be escaping the networks' notice that with the movement
toward reality shows, they are taking chances with human behavior
in history's most litigious society.
</P>
<P>
   Fox can drop a hundred anvils on Homer Simpson's skull, and
he'll never file suit. It can kill off whomever it wants on
``Beverly Hills, 90210,'' and the victim exists only on the docile
pages of a script.
</P>
<P>
   One misstep on a reality show, though, and alarms clang in the
offices of dozens of alert attorneys. Imagine how many lawyers
already are coveting a peek at the papers Darva Conger signed
before she donned a wedding gown on ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multi-Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   So the networks have unearthed a genre that can attract huge
audiences and restore the kind of water-cooler buzz that network TV
seemed to have lost.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be too bad if they pull off the bow and ribbon and find
they've pulled the lid from Pandora's box.

FIREWOOD FOR THOSE WITH MONEY TO BURN

(DW) 
 By KIMBERLY STEVENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  NEW YORK _ The only wood Nancy Friedman will burn in her
fireplace is apple or cherry. Absolutely nothing else will do.
``The aroma is wondrous, and the sound is like a bowl of Rice
Krispies,'' she said. ``The snap, crackle and pop is amazing to
listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman usually has a roaring fire going by 6 a.m. in her
Manhattan hearth, and she is particular about using wood with
character _ dare she call it personality? ``A clean, well-seasoned
piece of apple wood burns quickly and evenly, and the scent is
soothing,'' she said. ``You can tell the difference immediately.''
She and her husband, David Friedman, a psychoanalyst, enjoy the
morning paper by the warm blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Like a connoisseur of fine wine, a true firewood aficionado
cares about the origin of the blaze, and is not bothered by the
fact that this passion will quickly go up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the high price of fire wood dampen her spirit: a sack
of ``character'' wood ranges from $12 to $20 for eight to 10 logs
of apple, ash, birch, cherry, mesquite or maple. ( Friedman's is a
sack-a-day house.) What firewood aesthetes want to know is, Does it
crackle or hiss? Will the spark of a match light the fire in a
single stroke? Does it come from the woods of Vermont or from Long
Island? These are a few details that distinguish just any old fire
from an artful display.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had many of the same clients for years, and they
understand even the most subtle differences,'' said Dimitrios
Gatanas, an owner of Dimitri Nurseries here. He recommends good
solid hardwoods like ash for those who enjoy a fire on a regular
basis. ``Jackie Onassis burned ash wood in her fireplace,'' he
said. ``It was the only wood she would use.''
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive wood he sells is birch, $9.99 for six logs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these woods, and most timber species in the Northeast,
are not endangered, said Richard Z. Donovan, the director of Smart
Wood, an independent auditor of forest practices. But the consumer
may want to ask the supplier where the wood came from, to make sure
it is from a forest habitat that is not endangered. ``It is the
habitat that is affected most by cutting and logging,'' he said.
``In an ideal world we'd all be buying certified firewood, but it's
going to take some time before we see those days.'' In a certified
forest, cutting has been approved.
</P>
<P>
   Gatanas said he receives his wood from upstate New York, and
added that he trusts his supplier, though he does not know
specifically where the wood comes from.
</P>
<P>
   Gatanas' scope of delivery has expanded from the Upper East Side
and the Gramercy Park neighborhood. ``I have all these young Wall
Street types lighting fires in TriBeCa and Battery Park City,'' he
said, maintaining that this is clearly not the crowd buying a
last-minute bundle of wood at the deli. ``Some of them like to drop
the names of the woods they are burning to kind of show off,'' he
said, chuckling. ``And why not? Having a nice fire going when you
have friends over makes a nice statement. Take it a step further
and it becomes almost a hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Or an obsession. The subtle _ and not so subtle _ differences
separate lovers of the flame. ``I would break a chair before I
would use a Duraflame log,'' Stuart Cameron, the owner of
Artistmanagement, said. ``I can smell those things the minute I
walk into an apartment building. They are toxic and disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the smell of good quality hardwood that he finds most
intoxicating. Cameron, who works out of his home, says that the
season's first wood delivery is a thrilling moment. He'll receive
10 to 15 deliveries of well-seasoned mixed hardwood this year.
``This may sound silly but I'm actually particular about the way
it's cut, too,'' he added. ``I like the foot and foot-and-half
logs. Those are the only two lengths I order.'' Cameron, who has a
fire going all day and all night, views it as a form of meditation.
</P>
<P>
   A whiff of apple wood can easily transport Dagney Duval, an
owner of Plant Specialists in the Long Island City area of Queens,
back to her childhood in Washington state. She lights a fire in her
apartment four days a week, for aesthetic reasons, as well as for
cooking on occasion. Her fireplace is counter height in her
kitchen, where she and her friends most like to gather.
</P>
<P>
   Duval knows that the best wood is cut in winter, when the tree
is dormant, and then stacked, evenly, and left to dry for at least
a year, though some connoisseurs prefer two. Then it will burn well
and light easily. She says that there are many bogus-wood delivery
services and that it is worthwhile to research thoroughly before
ordering. ``You really must be a seasoned wood buyer to detect a
piece of wood that hasn't seasoned properly,'' she said. Telltale
signs: look for soft green underneath the bark and damp moist feel.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies will mix conifer wood in with hardwoods like oak
and maple, which can be dangerous because the high sap content of
the logs can cause chimney fires. Diseased, insect-infested wood
can cause a slew of problems. One woman claimed it took months and
three visits from an exterminator to recover from a delivery, which
was infested with carpenter ants.
</P>
<P>
   Nazim Hamid, the manager at Plant Specialists, says that for
some clients, firewood is a cultural choice. ``Wealthy Texans will
burn mesquite because it reminds them of home,'' he said. ``The
same way the Irish community will buy Irish peat for Christmas
because it's part of their tradition.'' Irish peat is a compressed
soil that is sold by the block and burns just like  &UR;  &LR; wood.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is concerned with the particulars. ``I don't think
any of my clients are that nutty about the fires in their
fireplaces,'' Gary Paul, an architect, said. ``I just happened to
catch Martha Stewart talking about firewood and it was so
unbelievable. Creating a gift package with 19 perfect logs and the
dried orange peels to make it smell just right. Absurd!''
</P>
<P>
   He had a suggestion for backup kindling in a pinch: the
Nantucket doughnut. It is made from a few sheets of newspaper
rolled the long way and tied in a series of knots. ``That's the
only really interesting trick I know when it comes to starting a
fire,'' he added. ``And what's wrong with just plain old
nondescript firewood?''
</P>
<P>
   That's a question only a pulp psychologist could answer.

   ``Wonderful Town: New York Stories From `The New Yorker' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Edited by David Remnick with Susan Choi &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Collected short stories &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $26.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York, New York. It's a wonderful town.
</P>
<P>
   And it's been a wonderful backdrop for numerous short stories
that have appeared in The New Yorker literary magazine and are now
compiled in ``Wonderful Town,'' edited by David Remnick.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published to commemorate the magazine's 75th
anniversary, contains 43 short stories that offer something for
every reader.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick, the current New Yorker editor, has included a diverse
set of stories, some from well-known authors such as Vladimir
Nabokov, John Updike, Ann Beattie, Dorothy Parker and the
quintessential New Yorker, Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Also included is a very familiar literary character roaming the
streets of New York: Holden Morrisey Caulfield. He's on Christmas
vacation from Pencey Preparatory School for Boys and goes skating
at Rockefeller Center with Sally Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   With so many stories to consider for inclusion in ``Wonderful
Town,''_ Remnick notes in the foreword that it was difficult to
whittle down his initial list _ the editor has created an anthology
that works cohesively, although not perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   I question Remnick's choice of John Cheever's well-known ``The
Five-Forty-Eight'' as the first story in the anthology. Although an
excellent short story about a man being stalked, it doesn't exactly
make readers (who may never have been to New York) want to continue
reading _ at least this reader, who's used the Long Island
Railroad. (It's really not that bad.)
</P>
<P>
   Since the anthology is not chronological, readers might want to
peek at the last page of each story before reading it to set the
year. In some cases, it's helpful to know the context in which the
story was published.
</P>
<P>
   But despite this annoyance, the overall anthology is inviting
not only to New Yorkers but also to those who have never visited
the city that never sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun rose somewhere in the middle of Queens, the exact
moment of its appearance shrouded in uncertainty because of a cloud
bank. ... Seagulls settled on the water. A newspaper truck went
from building to building dropping off heavy bundles of, for the
most part, bad news, which little boys carried inside on their
shoulders. Doormen smoking a pipe and dressed for a walk in the
country came to work after a long subway ride and disappeared into
the service entrances. ... With the morning sun on them, the
apartment buildings far to the west, on Lexington Avenue, looked
like an orange mesa. The pigeons made bubbling noises in their
throats as they strutted on windowsills high above the street.''
(Excerpted from ``Over By the River,'' by William Maxwell.)
</P>
<P>
   A wonderful town, indeed.

GOLF COURSE DOG IS PART CHOW, PART RETRIEVER, ALL ROYALTY

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Elie probably doesn't remember what brought
her to the city-run animal shelter in the spring of 1995. She was
nearly a year old then, a large mixed-breed dog with gigantic paws,
which hinted that she would become larger still.
</P>
<P>
   The sign on her cage said ``very, very friendly.'' She was more
than friendly, but her amiable personality might not have been
enough to save her from the inevitable and unhappy fate of hundreds
of such animals, if not for Glen and Janice Holt.
</P>
<P>
   The Holts were looking for a dog, and Elie was waiting for a
family, idly perusing the line of would-be owners who sauntered
down the concrete aisle. She let the crowds pass, her intelligent
eyes scanning each face, her brain filtering a thousand tiny
nuances, her great wet nose sifting and sorting myriad scents; and
then she spied the Holts. She got up and walked toward them,
pushing her big square nose to front of the cage.
</P>
<P>
   By that action, Elie may have changed her destiny _ or perhaps
she was always meant to be a favored member of the community, and
it was the Holts' good fortune to be part of the karma.
</P>
<P>
   A dog was to be Janice's birthday present. But at 43, with her
youngest son just gone off to school and all her routines turned
upside down, she didn't feel like celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   No, on that April day, Janice longed for something else. She
wanted a warm and wriggling puppy to pamper. She was looking for a
Pomeranian, a fluffy, cuddly lap dog; but she smiled at Elie and
stroked her thick, tawny coat.
</P>
<P>
   Elie smiled back, her pink tongue lolling from her mouth, her
dark-rimmed eyes shining in expectation. The cage door was opened,
and Glen bent down to run his hands over the dog. Elie nosed his
fingers and gamboled in a gesture of play.
</P>
<P>
   In that instant, the Holts chose Elie. She pranced away from her
doom that day, her head held so high it was hard to imagine that
she'd ever been too worried. All animals taken from the pound are
spayed or neutered before adoption, so Elie would never have her
own pups. It didn't matter; she had her own family, a man and a
woman, people who admired her unique beauty _ friends who
understood and appreciated her independent nature.
</P>
<P>
   She was welcome in the house, of course, but Elie was never
meant to be a house dog. Part chow chow and part golden retriever,
she roamed the big yard and the verdant field that separated the
Holts' property from the rolling greens of Glen Garden Country Club
in east Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she stretched out on the front lawn and allowed the
many neighborhood children to smooth her coat or pull her ears. She
was patient and kind, but sometimes, when she tired of the
children's company, she would amble along the club's boundaries,
raising her great head to sniff the air and watch the golfers as
they worked their way across the fairways.
</P>
<P>
   She was the gentle ruler of the entire realm, but her estate was
growing.
</P>
<P>
   No one remembers exactly when Elie expanded her kingdom to
include all of Glen Garden Country Club, but most will agree that
she began to spend her days there about three years ago, lolling
under the flagpole, rolling on the putting greens, following
golfers around the course.
</P>
<P>
   Elie knows the club is closed on Mondays, so she doesn't usually
go on that day, but the rest of her days are routine. She waits
until Glen has gone to work as a telephone repairman and Janice has
driven away to her job; then Elie reports to ``work'' at the club.
In raw weather, she keeps a vigil in the pro shop. She stays until
dusk and returns home about the same time the Holts arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Elie, ever patient with people, doesn't allow any dog
interlopers. She is the dog of the day, every day, and all other
canine trespassers are quickly chased away.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone was afraid of Elie in the beginning, because of her
massive head and mighty jaws, she quickly put them at ease. Club
members soon began to call her ``Bogie'' and ``Fairway'' and
``Girl.'' It wasn't until Glen came over to play golf one day that
they learned her real name.
</P>
<P>
   Elie exhibits perfect course etiquette, never chasing a ball,
never disturbing one in play. If she walks onto the putting green,
she steps daintily around the golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   Members bring her treats from the kitchen. Some golfers cook an
extra piece of meat for Elie when they prepare their own dinners
and deliver it to her the next day. They buy her cookies from the
vending machine. Her favorite is called Ruger, two thin wafers
reminiscent of an ice cream cone, with vanilla cream sandwiched in
between.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Davis, a teacher and golf coach at Bowie High School in
Arlington, and Debbie Owen, of Weatherford, have become Elie's
special friends. On a recent afternoon, Elie stretched out under
the flagpole waiting for Pat. Other golfers pulled their carts
close and pated their legs, coaxing her to climb aboard. Elie
looked them over, an agreeable but rather aloof expression on her
face. She remained under the pole, serenely waiting for her friend.
</P>
<P>
   As Pat's van rolled up the drive, Elie became animated, wagging
her tail and smiling as she ambled toward her friend. She accepted
cookies from Debbie's hand, but she wanted to ride the golf cart
with Pat alone.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always so. ``She wouldn't ride on a cart at all until
last summer,'' Pat said. ``It was a hot afternoon, and she'd
already walked around the course with other golfers. She got out on
the back side and she just laid down like she couldn't go another
step. We forced her into the cart and held her there; now she rides
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elie won't ride with just anyone. She is confident that she
can make life turn out as she pleases. She can have everything she
needs by simply being herself. She can afford to be very
discriminating about her drivers, and so she is.
</P>
<P>
   She likes Pat and will even go visit the groomer or the vet in
Pat's van. The members chip in to pay for Elie's beauty routines.
</P>
<P>
   When Glen wants to play golf, he is always welcome to play on
Elie's membership, said Tom Willhoite, the club president. ``Elie
is definitely a member of the club,'' he said, and stopped. He
chuckled. ``No. She owns the place,'' he said, and there is
admiration in his voice. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   If microchips were cities, inhabitants would see a virtually
constant show of fireworks, with electrons zooming through
microscopic roads and throwing out momentary flashes of light.
</P>
<P>
   It is a natural effect that scientists have known about since
the 1980s. As electrons speed along paths of wires in computer
chips, they run into millions of tiny gates called transistors.
Each one either allows the electron to pass or stops it in its
tracks. As transistors switch between open and closed states, they
pulse light for a matter of picoseconds, or trillionths of a
second.
</P>
<P>
   The light is too faint and transient to be seen by the
unassisted eye. But researchers and chip makers are using highly
sensitive optical equipment to study these fireworks shows, and
they are putting the data to good, and potentially profitable, use.
</P>
<P>
   When electrons move too fast or too slowly, they can cause
errors in the chip. In fact, Travis Eiles, an optical scientist at
Intel, the world's largest chip maker, said that five or 10 bad
transistors in a group of millions could slow chip speed by 25
percent if they were in the critical path of electricity flow.
</P>
<P>
   Using a method developed in 1996 by two researchers at
International Business Machines' Thomas J. Watson Research Center
in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., chip makers can now take pictures of the
light pulses, allowing them to track electrons as they flow around
the chip and through transistors. Pulses that come too late or too
early, or are too bright or faint, flag a problem that chip
developers can address.
</P>
<P>
   The process, called Picosecond Imaging Circuit Analysis, or
PICA, has been adopted by IBM's microchip labs as a tool for
debugging new chip prototypes, and the results have been positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a problem that could have taken weeks to months to
diagnose down to on the order of literally days,'' said Mark
Papermaster, director of development for IBM's Power4
microprocessor. ``What's novel is that I'm able, with this tool, to
see within our chips, to be able to follow through logical signals
that are switching from circuit to circuit and traverse across the
microprocessor.''
</P>
<P>
   The instruments needed for PICA include a microscope, a detector
that can count photons and a computer to handle the data. The
hardware alone can cost in the range of a half-million dollars, not
including software and set-up time.
</P>
<P>
   And even with very high magnification and an extremely sensitive
detector, PICA detects fewer than 1 percent of all emitted photons.
Nearly 95 percent of the photons never make it out of the chip. But
the process works well enough that IBM announced in November that
it would allow Schlumberger, an international technical company, to
license PICA technology to other chip makers.
</P>
<P>
   Chip developers test their prototypes for problems with a
variety of tools. When chips were larger, probes could be
delicately positioned to test individual transistors for errors.
But the current generation of chips, in general, is too complex for
this technique, necessitating more precise tools, like electron
beams.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is touting PICA as a powerful method for testing chips that,
unlike the other methods, is completely nonintrusive. Without
probing, PICA lets developers watch large areas of the chip and
then zoom in on trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tool that we have is really great at localizing problems
when you really don't know quite where you're looking,'' said Jeff
Kash, an IBM researcher who is one of the inventors of PICA. ``We
can literally look at thousands of devices in a single shot. Often,
the failure really jumps out at you in the image.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimizing and detecting problems in chip circuitry are
necessities for manufacturers. In October, according to news
reports, Toshiba agreed to pay around $1 billion to settle a class
action lawsuit that said its floppy-disk drives were faulty. And in
September, a defective chip led Western Digital to recall 400,000
hard drives and offer rebates to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   The financial incentive to make flawless chips has led
manufacturers to increase their focus on diagnostics and debugging
in the hope that they can create chips that can be developed and
brought to the marketplace quickly and without incident.
</P>
<P>
   But although IBM promotes PICA as a revolutionary process in
chip development, not everyone in the industry is equally
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like PICA,'' said Eiles, of Intel. ``I love those images,
but it's not what's needed in a debug environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Eiles said PICA's process took too long, as many as 10 hours or
more for each analysis. ``It has only one flaw,'' he said, ``but I
think it's a huge flaw: it takes extremely long to collect data for
probing microprocessors. The light that gets emitted is not very
much. It doesn't pick it up most of the time. It's like trying to
find stars just barely outside the capability of a telescope.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel has developed and licensed its own debugging method, which
uses infrared light to test individual transistors.
</P>
<P>
   Eiles said chip debuggers usually had a good idea about where
bad transistors might be found, making PICA's ability to study
large areas of the chip unnecessary. But Kash, of IBM, said he
believed that both methods could co-exist in the marketplace,
perhaps even as complements.
</P>
<P>
   Risto Puhakka, an executive at VLSI Research, which does market
studies for the microchip industry, said the new debugging tools by
IBM and Intel might signal an end for older technologies.
``Overall, this shows that there is one technology maybe running
into its limits,'' Puhakka said. ``There is always something new
coming up. That's what this industry's famous for: killing its
babies and finding something new.''

`10TH KINGDOM' ISN'T PERFECT, BUT IT'S CREATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 10 hours, the NBC miniseries ``The 10th Kingdom'' will have a
longer life than some of the ``ongoing'' series NBC launched last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone keeping score, we are happy to report it's
considerably more engaging than ``The Mike O'Malley Show,'' which
disappeared faster than jumbo shrimp at a network cocktail party.
But it's not as good as ``Freaks and Geeks,'' which has twice been
pulled from the schedule because NBC can't bring itself to give a
good show time to find an appreciative audience.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, installments two and five of ``The 10th Kingdom''
will occupy the Monday night space recently vacated by ``Freaks and
Geeks,'' a charming drama about kids who don't quite fit in at high
school. It may be a coincidence, but there's some irony at play
here because if ever there was a show about people struggling to
survive in an unforgiving environment, it's ``The 10th Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   So, are we to assume that if a miniseries about outsiders is a
success, then a regular series about outsiders might return to the
schedule? Of course not. NBC doesn't think that way. But if a
10-hour miniseries pulls down ratings sufficiently robust to make
NBC execs take notice, ``The 10th Kingdom'' may indeed change the
way networks think about how they schedule programming. For one
thing, it may get them to consider the British model of a limited
series _ a program with a set run of 12 or 20 episodes _ and quit
relying on the notion that a show is a failure if it can't last
beyond one season.
</P>
<P>
   It is the rare series that can maintain excellence beyond three
or four years anyway. Even shows produced by the imaginative David
E. Kelley tend to hit the creative-exhaustion wall after two or
three seasons. Sometimes a tired show gets a jump-start with the
departure of one or two characters and the addition of others. This
has helped ``Law &AMP; Order'' survive and prosper for nine-plus
seasons with a style that stresses story over character and prompts
bored actors to bail out every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   But many ``successful'' series continue in production long after
the well of innovative energy has run dry. It's the sad legacy of
the American TV model: Milk an idea for as long as advertisers and
viewers might support it, not for as long as the creative idea can
be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   To impute from this that ``The 10th Kingdom'' is the epitome of
creative excellence is not entirely correct. Creative, it is.
Excellent, it is not quite. But ``The 10th Kingdom'' is
entertaining, imaginative and involving for most of its five-night
run. Best of all, it is different.
</P>
<P>
   As Robert Halmi Sr., the pied piper of TV classics, says: ``Why
does television ... have to follow and imitate things? Why not go
out and utilize television for what it's for, to experiment and to
entertain in a way that has never been done before? What's wrong
with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Mr. Halmi, nothing at all. And ``The 10th Kingdom''
deserves some credit for doing exactly what Halmi suggests. A
sprawling fairy tale for adults and older children _ Halmi
originally wanted it to run 14 hours _ it borrows from just about
every story we heard as youngsters: ``Alice In Wonderland,''
``Little Red Riding Hood,'' ``Hansel and Gretel,'' ``Cinderella,''
``Snow White,'' ``Rumpelstiltskin'' and ``Rapunzel.''
</P>
<P>
   It follows a young woman and her father on an unintended journey
into a fantastic dimension replete with elves and dwarves, fairies
and trolls, magic mushrooms and poison apples, imposing castles and
spooky forests.
</P>
<P>
   In a role that probably took some guts to accept, Kimberly
Williams is annoying yet somehow captivating as Virginia, a
``nobody'' from New York City who stumbles through a magic mirror
in Central Park into the world of the Nine Kingdoms. (The realm was
created after Snow White, Cinderella and Riding Hood became great
queens, but it's now under the influence of an evil queen recently
escaped from the Snow White Memorial Prison.)
</P>
<P>
   The queen, played with sweet venom by Dianne Wiest, is
threatened by the presence of Virginia and her dim-witted dad,
Tony, though it's not immediately clear why. The queen enlists
another escapee, a wolfman named Wolf, to track Virginia and Tony,
who are traveling with a dog who is really a prince and the
rightful heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   As Virginia despairs of finding her way back to New York _
dubbed the 10th Kingdom by trolls who happen to pay a visit _ Wolf
(Scott Cohen) and Tony (John Larroquette) keep the story light with
smirky performances that are forgivably over the top. Heck, it's
hard not to chuckle at the whole premise, and adults who have a
hard time suspending disbelief will check out of ``The 10th
Kingdom'' long before Sunday's first installment is over. While
ambitious and full of special effects, it is an amusing film that
doesn't take itself too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   More likely to stay put are those who wonder, as writer Simon
Moore (``Gulliver's Travels'') did, what a Brothers Grimm fairy
tale might look like with adult players in the traditional kids'
roles. They will spend five nights enjoying the allegory, smiling
at the oddball homages to countless bedtime-story conventions, and
absolutely howling at scenes of trolls grooving to the strains of
``Saturday Night Fever'' and of Larroquette singing along to
``Whiter Shade of Pale'' while falling asleep in the Deadly Swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Wiest, the addition of the usual big-name guest stars
doesn't add much, but it doesn't detract. Rutger Hauer is macho as
ever as an evil huntsman with a talented crossbow. Camryn Manheim

<TEXT>
<P>
   Women have long joked that if men had PMS, there would be a
federal holiday every 28 days. Many men fail to appreciate the
degree to which normal reproductive hormonal changes affect women's
health and outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the basics of sex, the day-to-day, year-to-year
ramifications of being female are a mystery for many men, leading
to frustration for both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the need for men to better understand women,
physicians Bruce Bekkar, M.D., and Udo Wahn, M.D., have developed a
ground-breaking class for men at Kaiser Permanente Medical Group in
San Diego, Calif., that spotlights women's reproductive changes.
</P>
<P>
   The two obstetrician/gynecologists believe that until male
partners raise their level of awareness and patience in this area,
relationship bonds will continue to be challenged, with little hope
of Mars helping Venus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a common experience of hearing women complain that
when they went home with a problem like an abnormal Pap smear or a
bladder infection, that they try to talk to their partners, and
they wouldn't listen to them, they couldn't even have a
conversation about it,'' says Bekkar.
</P>
<P>
   BRIDGING A GAP WITH HUMOR AND LISTENING
</P>
<P>
   Bekkar and Wahn find that a humorous approach is effective in
breaching the topic. ``We're not trying to turn them into junior
gynecologists. But if we can make them comfortable with these
topics _ really for the first time in their lives _ then when their
wives want to talk to them about a problem they're having, then
they're not so uneasy about it,'' says Bekkar.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of listening and caring is taught. The open
forum, which includes participants sharing their sometimes woeful
experiences, is useful for any man wanting to know women better,
particularly those in committed relationships, says Wahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a wide spectrum of guys that come from all different
working classes,'' he says. ``When they come to the class, they are
just glued to us. They are just yearning for the information.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour class is offered once a month and is free. The book
that Bekkar and Wahn penned, ``Your Guy's Guide to Gynecology: A
Resource for Men and Women'', (North Star Publications, 2000) lead
to creation of the class.
</P>
<P>
   MATURE MARRIAGE STRESS
</P>
<P>
   Among the participants are men who have known the same women for
years but are baffled by the onset of their mid-life changes. Allan
Roudebush attended the seminar to better understand some of his
wife Marilyn's hormonal struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The menopause and PMS subjects are tough to talk about because
we're in the dark,'' says Roudebush.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn says though they've been married for many years, her
uncomfortable symptoms _ and her husband's response to them _ could
have become obstacles to communication if not properly addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just the mood swings and he would say, `What's going
on?' `I don't know!' I said. I was hoping that he'd be a little bit
more understanding and patient with some of the symptoms that I'm
having. And so I was real pleased when he went and came back and I
just felt that I had more support there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahn says it takes courage for some men to show up, but most are
grateful for the unique opportunity: ``It's really good for them
because they hear other guys talking about some of these issues and
concerns that arise at home, which they may not talk to their
friends about in other settings. By the end of the evening,
everybody is all chummy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   COURSE CONTENT
</P>
<P>
   The course covers a lecture with slides on basic female
reproductive anatomy, how it works and what changes occur during
the transitional periods of puberty, pregnancy and menopause. The
monthly menstrual cycle is reviewed, and the range of normal and
more extreme experiences are discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Men's experiences with the biological effects on emotions are
shared. Laughter during the meeting doesn't mock the plight of
women's struggles. Rather, say the lecturers, it reflects the depth
of tension between a couple, only one of whom is fully experiencing
the troublesome symptoms that the Bible calls a curse.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Roudebush says a little bit of knowledge goes a long way
toward smoothing some of the tension. ``Sensitivity is a thing that
all us men have a problem with,'' he says. ``Even though the issues
are different, there's a lot of likeness in what we go through as
we mature.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE ACTIVE ROLE
</P>
<P>
   The facilitators suggest actions so men's feelings of hurt can
be replaced with action. Knowing a woman's monthly cycle and some
common PMS food cravings, for example, can help husbands and
boyfriends delicately steer partners toward less volatile foods or
toward healthy activities like walking together. ``Salty foods,
sweets _ chocolate in particular _ caffeine and alcohol will all
make her PMS worse,'' says Bekkar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the worst thing that a guy can say is `Honey, it's
all in your head.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It is a growing, although invisible problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, an explosion in the number of wireless
devices _ cellular telephones, satellite television dishes and
pagers, to name just a few _ has led to crowded airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the range of radio frequencies, which lie between
audible sound and infrared radiation on the electromagnetic
spectrum, has been able to accommodate all the increased uses.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, though, ensuring that different devices can be
used without interference from others is a high-wire act achieved
only through technological advances and the careful management of
the radio spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Different uses are allotted different portions of the usable
spectrum, from relatively low frequencies (measured in thousands of
hertz, or kilohertz) to high-frequency microwaves (measured in
billions of hertz, or gigahertz). The result is a crazy quilt of
frequency bands reserved for a variety of civilian and military
applications, like conventional AM and FM radio, television, ham
radio, mobile phones, aircraft and ship communications, and
navigation systems. Some frequency bands are left unused to avoid
interfering with radio astronomy and other scientific efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The International Telecommunication Union, a U &UR; . &LR; N &UR; .
 &LR; organization that is the intergovernmental rule-making body for
the radio spectrum, used to review how radio frequencies were used
every 20 years. Since 1992, though, it has stepped up its reviews
to every two years to keep up with the demand.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the agencies responsible for managing the
spectrum have never been busier. They are the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, which handles
the parts of the spectrum reserved for the government's use, and
the Federal Communications Commission, which keeps watch over
private use.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you make more of the spectrum available, more people want
to use it,'' said Norbert Schroeder, a program manager in the
office of spectrum management at the national telecommunications
agency. Decisions about how to use the spectrum hinge on practical
questions _ what it is possible to do _ as well as on public
policy, international regulations and economics, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has come to play a crucial role. ``It is only because
of the developing technologies that the spectrum has become
available at the higher frequencies,'' Schroeder explained.
</P>
<P>
   But tapping into ever-higher frequencies has its own problems.
The signals at higher frequencies are more easily obstructed by
buildings and other structures. To use these frequencies, which
start around three gigahertz and are mostly in the microwave part
of the spectrum, it is necessary to use relays to strengthen and
retransmit the signals or to build very big antennas. Both
solutions are expensive, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Hatfield, director of the Federal Communications
Commission's office of engineering and technology, said an
alternative approach was to use the lower frequencies more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, technology can help. Digital systems are making it
possible to compress signals, reducing the width of the frequency
bands needed for some transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the frequency bands allocated for two-way radios
for taxis and the police used to be 50 kilohertz wide. Now they are
12 kilohertz, and technology is becoming available that could
reduce them further, to 6 kilohertz.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are trade-offs. ``With the smaller bands, you lose
transmission power,'' Schroeder said. ``But system design can
overcome these problems by using relays or repeaters that
rebroadcast the signals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing frequencies is another way to manage the demand. The
radio broadcasts of the Voice of America, for example, share
frequency bands that are used by the military for training.
</P>
<P>
   Reallocating what is already in use is a possibility. The part
of the spectrum used for UHF (ultrahigh frequency) television
channels 60 to 69 ranges from 746 to 806 megahertz. That band is
not in use in some parts of the country, so part of that chunk of
the spectrum in those areas is being sold at auction to companies
that want to provide wireless Internet communications for personal
digital assistants, cell phones and personal computers. Other parts
are being reassigned by the Federal Communications Commission for
use by the police and other public safety agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even with changes and technological developments, spectrum
management remains difficult. One strain on the system is
unlicensed use. The spectrum from 902 to 928 megahertz, for
example, is occupied by signals that do not need to be licensed,
like those coming from cordless phones and keyless security systems
for doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People a lot of times are using radio spectrum without
realizing it,'' Hatfield said.
</P>
<P>
   And equipment that makes no use of radio frequencies can also
cause interference. ``The spectrum is a natural resource that can
be polluted,'' Hatfield said. ``A person turning on a hair dryer
can cause snow on the TV next door.''

WHAT WE NEED _ AND DON'T _ IN PRESIDENTIAL RACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few random observations from the presidential primary races:
</P>
<P>
   Voters, although disillusioned with politics, don't want to be.
They hate being cynical but are almost afraid to be idealistic.
</P>
<P>
   How else would we explain the unprecedented numbers that turned
out in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan? Or the
unexpectedly high votes for candidates perceived as ``reformers''?
Folks would like to believe in democracy's redemption.
</P>
<P>
   People despise negative campaigns, but such campaigns, when
coyly done, often work for the perpetrator. Voters are conditioned
by years of media bombardment to believe scandalous allegations
against political figures. Sad, but true.
</P>
<P>
   Clever campaign consultants use surrogates to sling the
crummiest allegations. That distances the candidate from the
sleaze. Some surrogates need no prodding to unleash outrageous
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, a Bob Jones University professor published
malicious allegations over e-mail, saying that Sen. John McCain
spent his life ``drinking and womanizing'' and ``chose to sire
children without marriage.'' It's that sort of thing that keeps
many good people out of politics. Gov. George W. Bush probably
didn't know about this libelous attack and surely wouldn't have
sanctioned it.
</P>
<P>
   Money counts this year as never before. Increasingly it's money,
not ability, that defines who can and cannot run for office. And
it's big givers, with government favors to ask, that define who
gets the money.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen huge corporations have quietly maneuvered to buy in with
the new president, whichever candidate triumphs, by cynically
contributing to all four finalists. Those political handouts, in
the multi-millions, raise the ultimate question: Who will own the
president?
</P>
<P>
   One obvious _ in fact, insuperable _ campaign advantage for the
candidate with money is that his campaign can blitz a state in the
closing days with blanket media coverage, levying allegations
against his opponent. The latter, if underfinanced, has no way to
disprove the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   All four major candidates, I believe, have hurt themselves by
unnecessary attacks on their competitors during TV debates. First,
between McCain and Bush in South Carolina and then Monday night in
New York between Al Gore and Bill Bradley, the discussions
descended almost to the childish level of ``You're another!'' or
``So's your old man!''
</P>
<P>
   Such peevish criticisms belittle not only their target but even
more the accuser, making him look petty and petulant. Worse, they
denigrate the system. They detract from the serious substance that
the public wants.
</P>
<P>
   Televised debates have rendered a huge public service, but
arbitrarily limiting candidates' answers to 30 or 60 seconds does
listeners an injustice. As president, one of these four will have
to deal judiciously with matters of complexity that simply cannot
be reduced to 30-second sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are entitled to measure their next president upon
intellect, not glibness. To assume, as commercial TV producers tend
to do, that the public attention span is only half a minute long is
to insult people's intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   CNN and other networks deserve congratulations for sponsoring
debates. Those debates are the only antidotes to buying the
presidency outright by making it a contest of which candidate can
afford the necessary paid media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The public, after all, owns the airwaves. It is through public
indulgence that broadcasting stations are licensed in the first
place. Every other civilized democracy strictly limits spending and
gives candidates free time to air their views.
</P>
<P>
   America's history of participatory democracy is far too rich to
let our hallowed electoral system degenerate into a contest of
hucksterism and crude character assassination fueled by lobbyists'
money.
</P>
<P>
   What is it that folks look for in a president? Substance.
Character. Experience, knowledge, conviction. Add two other
precious assets: a sense of humor and a sense of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we forget the greatness of our heritage, we might reflect
upon an incident from the presidential campaign of 1912, regarded
in some scholarly quarters as the most substantive political
contest in American history.
</P>
<P>
   There were three candidates: Republican President William Howard
Taft; Democratic challenger Woodrow Wilson; and former President
Theodore Roosevelt, who had just organized the Progressive or
``Bull Moose'' Party.
</P>
<P>
   As Roosevelt was preparing to leave his hotel in Milwaukee one
evening to speak at the convention center, a fanatic drew a gun and
shot the former president in the chest at close range. People
swarmed the would-be assassin and disarmed him.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt's first outcry was a plea to the crowd not to harm his
assailant. Doctors insisted that the injured candidate, with the
bullet lodged in his upper torso, must lie still and be taken
immediately to a hospital. Roosevelt refused. ``After my speech,''
he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   He'd advertised that he would speak. People had come in
considerable numbers. They were entitled to be satisfied, and he
had a commitment to keep, Roosevelt explained. He would not relent.
</P>
<P>
   Mounting the platform, he pulled his speech from an inner coat
pocket. It was soaked in blood. The audience quieted as Roosevelt,
in a slightly less vigorous voice than usual, spoke for 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, the bullet was removed from near the right
lung, and a broken rib was tended. Roosevelt was remanded to
recuperate for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a surprise: Wilson and Taft voluntarily suspended
campaigning out of respect to their honorable opponent until he was
ready to resume.
</P>
<P>
   What would we give for that kind of nobility, civility and
wholesome sportsmanship in politics today?
</P>

<P>
   David Hyrenbach felt no pain running on his knee four days after
doctors operated on it. That's because he exercised on a treadmill
with his lower body inside a pressurized fiberglass chamber that
reduced his weight.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber offers new possibilities, say researchers, by
allowing patients to exercise without bearing too much weight too
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt light,'' says Hyrenbach. ``When I was running on the
treadmill with the pressure on, it almost seemed like I had no
body. My feet were just going with no weight bearing down on them.
It was really gentle on my knees, and I felt like I could keep
going for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   By doing the opposite, the chamber could offer astronauts
negative pressure for their workouts. People feel lighter when
researchers pump air into the chamber, and they feel heavier when
air is sucked out.
</P>
<P>
   By making astronauts feel heavier in the microgravity or
weightlessness of space, the chamber could prevent deconditioning,
or loss of strength. And athletes could use negative pressure in
the chamber to feel heavier and increase their endurance as they
work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically the chamber works on the same principle as a
piston,'' says its designer, Alan Hargens, professor of orthopedics
at the University of California, San Diego. ``If you increase the
pressure inside the chamber, it lifts up the patient and reduces
their ground reaction forces.''
</P>
<P>
   TWINS TEST DEVICE
</P>
<P>
   In collaborative studies conducted by UC San Diego and NASA,
researchers are probing the healing benefits of the treadmill
chamber while they explore its potential for astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, two sets of identical twins in their 20s will
spend 30 days in bed at UCSD Medical Center. They can't get up even
to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose is to determine whether patients who must lie down
in bed for long periods will benefit from exercising in the chamber
under negative pressure. One twin from each set will refrain from
exercising, and the other will exercise while lying down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is possible because a specially designed square chamber
encloses the lower body as the patient lies in bed,'' explains
Hargens.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers call it the supine treadmill, and they lower the air
pressure inside to help the bedridden patient gain a feeling of
more weight in his or her legs.
</P>
<P>
   MORE WEIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Exercising the lower body inside the supine treadmill chamber
may ultimately allow bedridden patients to maintain cardiovascular
fitness. The negative pressure allows them to feel the kind of
weight in their legs and feet that people feel while standing.
Researchers also hope the Twin Study will show how the chamber can
help astronauts stay in shape in the microgravity of space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Results of this study will potentially establish a scientific
basis for the use of exercise within the LBNP chamber (lower body
negative pressure) to maintain aerobic fitness in space,'' says
Hargens.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by Tamarack R. Czarnik, M.D., who
specializes in aerospace medicine, prolonged exposure to
microgravity causes physiological problems, including the
redistribution and loss of fluids.
</P>
<P>
   ``In space, body fluids rapidly redistribute evenly, shifting to
the upper body and head (similar to hanging upside-down on a gym
bar),'' says Czarnik. ``About 1 liter of fluid is lost from each
leg; this results in what astronauts call `bird legs.' Excess fluid
in the head results in puffy faces, nasal congestion and may be
involved in blunting crewmembers taste sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardiac and skeletal muscles begin to lose conditioning, and the
density of minerals in the bones decreases. ``This deconditioning
is currently fought (with variable success) only by one-to-two
hours a day of aerobic and resistance exercises, with resultant
hull vibrational stress and contamination of the cabin environment
by sweat droplets,'' says Czarnik.
</P>
<P>
   EXERCISE TIPS
</P>
<P>
   Even for people who don't contend with the limitations of
bedrest, surgery or microgravity, exercising regularly presents
real hurdles. According to the U.S. surgeon general, more than 60
percent of American adults are not physically active on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association says regular physical activity
for 30 minutes or more a day, most days of the week, is essential
for health. People recovering from injuries or health problems
should talk to their doctor before beginning an exercise program.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA offers the following exercise tips:
</P>
<P>
   _Warm up, especially if you're recovering from an injury.
Running in place and breathing deeply for a few minutes helps.
</P>
<P>
   _Cool down. Before seeking the comfort of the shower after
exercising, take a few minutes to cool down.
</P>
<P>
   _Wear the proper gear. Dress for the temperature and be sure to
wear appropriate supportive underwear, especially jogging bras for
women.
</P>
<P>
   _Proper shoes are also very important. Running shoes should bend
at the ball of the foot and have a thick heel wedge.
</P>
<P>
   _Drink fluids. Drink a pint of water about 15 minutes before you
start exercising.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two men hardly know each other, but the gods
could have put them on parallel paths. They were born a year apart
at the start of World War II, both from middle-class Massachusetts
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, they built remarkably successful careers in
public roles. In 1996, both resigned for new challenges in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Now, their paths cross for the first time, on an issue taking
place some 2,500 miles from their birthplaces _ the Clinton's
administration's $1.6 billion plan to fight the drug crisis in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   They are Barry R. McCaffrey, the drug czar from Taunton, Mass.,
and William D. Delahunt, the congressman from Quincy, Mass. They
are two Roman Catholic Irishmen, each with a head of snow-white
hair, a healthy-sized ego, and the stamina of a person half their
age.
</P>
<P>
   Each believes he knows best how to tackle the exploding drug
business in the most troubled country in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Each believes the other is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to today's war on drugs, where the epicenter isn't in
the humid fields of coca in Colombia or the dens and living rooms
of drug users in any American city or town. It's here in the
nation's capital, and it is unfolding in faceoffs between people
like McCaffrey and Delahunt; cigar-smoking Colombia generals and
gutsy human rights investigators; shiny-shoed lobbyists and
placard-waving protesters warning of an endless war, perhaps
another Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has begun hearings. The administration and the
Republican congressional leadership both are pushing for a deal
soon, an uneasy alliance but one that enhances chances of passage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are no guarantees on the outcome, expected in the
next six weeks, nor even on the makeup of an emergency aid package.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is arguably America's most daring gambit in its nearly
three-decade-old war on drugs, a potential alliance with a military
that not long ago had been widely discredited due to human rights
abuses and a fight that some fear could somehow evolve into
something much larger than a US support role.
</P>
<P>
   That observation comes from retired Lieutenant General William
J. McCaffrey, 85, an English High graduate, former inspector
general of the Army, and father of the drug czar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all sorts of hazards ahead on this one,'' the elder
McCaffrey said one day last week in his Alexandria,Va., home.
``Everyone needs a little wisdom now as you're working your way
through the minefields.''
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on who will be doing the navigating _ his son or
Delahunt.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, 57, the youngest four-star general in US
history, a man who served four tours of combat duty, has seized the
lead role in selling the administration plan that bears hallmarks
of a military strategist. His idea is to give the Colombian
military enough airlift capability to support three US-trained
antidrug battalions in a push into the heartland of drug
cultivation, the guerrilla-controlled Putamayo and Caqueta regions
south of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt, 58, the Norfolk County district attorney for 21 years
who made his mark with the innovative ways he handled domestic
abuse and civil rights cases, has assumed the role of the
anti-McCaffrey, one of the leading behind-the-scenes organizers of
Democrats and moderate Republicans who oppose a military solution.
His idea is to send a blitz of diplomats to push the peace process
between the government and the guerrillas, put more money toward
new crops and a better judicial system, and spend much more
antidrug money on treatment of addicts at home.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how each man arrived at his position offers a
telling glance into the force of their character. And it indicates
how the complex situation in Colombia can inspire divergent
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt, the son of an office secretary and a sales manager for
US Rubber Co., has always wanted to see things for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his election to Congress in 1996, he readily
accepted an invitation from Representative John Conyers Jr., the
18-term Michigan Democrat, to accompany him on a trip to Haiti. The
visit inspired Delahunt. He took an interest in other international
issues, focusing in particular on Venezuela and Colombia _ in part,
he says, because he saw long-term economic opportunities for local
companies in both places.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia fascinated him for another reason closer to home: As a
prosecutor he had helped send hundreds, if not thousands, of people
to jail on drug charges. Now he had a chance to explore the drug
problem at its root.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 21 years of seeing people destroy themselves and destroy
those around them, it really makes this more personal for me than
for others,'' he said in a recent interview. ``I've seen the
abuser, I've seen families, I've seen friends, I've seen victims of
the abusers. It's such a human story, not just about dollars and
cents.''
</P>
<P>
   He first traveled to Colombia early last year, and has returned
twice since, including one risky visit deep into territory
controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the main
guerrilla group known as the FARC. To date, he has been the only US
congressman to meet with them.
</P>
<P>
   For Delahunt, the first two trips convinced him that the
solution in the drug war didn't rest solely with a military push.
The country was too big, he believed, and the guerrillas too
well-financed and equipped as a result of the taxes they levy on
the drug trade. A solution, he thought, could come only as a result
of a deal ending the nearly 40 years of civil war. But how could
the United States help facilitate a deal?
</P>
<P>
   That was on his mind last month when he traveled to Colombia for
a third time and spent a day in the heart of the southern
coca-producing region. On a flight from Bogota over the
snow-covered Andes Mountains, Delahunt peppered a US embassy
official with questions about the dangers to Americans in the war
on drugs. Between 100 to 200 US military officials are in Colombia
each day, US administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a plane shot up yesterday full of holes,'' said the
official, who asked not to be identified, referring to an OV-10
aircraft used to spray pesticides on illicit crops. ``We take fire
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The official described the routinely risky missions for US and
Colombian officers in which they randomly check coca or poppy
fields after spraying them. ``We go in with several helicopters. We
pick out a field, and 50 Colombian jungle commandos go first and
secure the border and all four corners. We then go down and take
samples and rate the damage. A gunship is flying low overhead in
case guerrillas come near, and then we get the hell out of there,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have anywhere near enough assets to fight this war?''
Delahunt asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' the official said. ``Not even close.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt's plane landed at the Larandia military base, near the
southern town of Florenzia. There, Colombian military officers
briefed him on fumigation, coca production, new types of coca
imported from Peru, and the profile of the typical coca farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who owns these large tracts of coca fields?'' Delahunt asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are squatters, growing coca on state land,'' said
General Ismael Trujillo, Colombia's antinarcotics director.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those who grow coca on their own land, the
congressman asked. ``Sanctions may have an effect on them,''
Delahunt said.

   ``Wonderful Town: New York Stories From `The New Yorker' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Edited by David Remnick with Susan Choi &QL;

<P>
   Collected short stories &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $26.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York, New York. It's a wonderful town.
</P>
<P>
   And it's been a wonderful backdrop for numerous short stories
that have appeared in The New Yorker literary magazine and are now
compiled in ``Wonderful Town,'' edited by David Remnick.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published to commemorate the magazine's 75th
anniversary, contains 43 short stories that offer something for
every reader.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick, the current New Yorker editor, has included a diverse
set of stories, some from well-known authors such as Vladimir
Nabokov, John Updike, Ann Beattie, Dorothy Parker and the
quintessential New Yorker, Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Also included is a very familiar literary character roaming the
streets of New York: Holden Morrisey Caulfield. He's on Christmas
vacation from Pencey Preparatory School for Boys and goes skating
at Rockefeller Center with Sally Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   With so many stories to consider for inclusion in ``Wonderful
Town,''_ Remnick notes in the foreword that it was difficult to
whittle down his initial list _ the editor has created an anthology
that works cohesively, although not perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   I question Remnick's choice of John Cheever's well-known ``The
Five-Forty-Eight'' as the first story in the anthology. Although an
excellent short story about a man being stalked, it doesn't exactly
make readers (who may never have been to New York) want to continue
reading _ at least this reader, who's used the Long Island
Railroad. (It's really not that bad.)
</P>
<P>
   Since the anthology is not chronological, readers might want to
peek at the last page of each story before reading it to set the
year. In some cases, it's helpful to know the context in which the
story was published.
</P>
<P>
   But despite this annoyance, the overall anthology is inviting
not only to New Yorkers but also to those who have never visited
the city that never sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun rose somewhere in the middle of Queens, the exact
moment of its appearance shrouded in uncertainty because of a cloud
bank. ... Seagulls settled on the water. A newspaper truck went
from building to building dropping off heavy bundles of, for the
most part, bad news, which little boys carried inside on their
shoulders. Doormen smoking a pipe and dressed for a walk in the
country came to work after a long subway ride and disappeared into
the service entrances. ... With the morning sun on them, the
apartment buildings far to the west, on Lexington Avenue, looked
like an orange mesa. The pigeons made bubbling noises in their
throats as they strutted on windowsills high above the street.''
(Excerpted from ``Over By the River,'' by William Maxwell.)
</P>
<P>
   A wonderful town, indeed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two days before Christmas, several senior Clinton
administration officials gathered in the office of National
Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger to discuss an unusual idea for
the Colombian drug-fighting package.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Budget and Management suggested taking $100
million from the $1.3 billion in Colombian aid and earmarking it
toward treatment of US addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Around the room, almost everyone said no. But OMB officials
persisted, believing that the $100 million might boost chances of
the bill's passage as well as give a rare opportunity to put extra
money into treatment for US addicts. They wanted the input of Barry
R. McCaffrey, the US drug czar.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, McCaffrey turned them down, too.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, he said the $100 million wouldn't
help pass the Colombian aid package.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is silly. It's minor politics,'' McCaffrey
said. ``This is the Andean ridge program. We are going to have
intellectual clarity and integrity in what we are doing. This isn't
a puck we are slapping around. I want them (Congress) to look at
this and examine it on its own merits . . . and not throw
sweeteners in there.''
</P>
<P>
   But for advocates of more treatment, McCaffrey's decision once
again underscored the gap between his rhetoric and his budget
priorities. While McCaffrey has eloquently and forcefully called
for more money for drug treatment, advocates say it is telling that
a plan for substantial new dollars for treatment came from outside
the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McCaffrey's major focus domestically in the drug war
has been on prevention, including an unprecedented $1 billion
five-year media campaign that places in-your-face antidrug ads on
prime time television. Recent disclosures that his office reviewed
TV scripts as a way of vetting messages on drugs drew widespread
criticism, but McCaffrey has since taken the offensive, saying his
office didn't censor any script and that fighting for antidrug
themes is what his job is supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from the days of ``Just Say No,'' the Nancy
Reagan-embraced abstinance theory that had such little impact on
hard-core addicts. But under McCaffrey, there have been many
changes in the drug policy office, including a huge funding
increase.
</P>
<P>
   In four years, his budget has gone from $13 billion to a
proposed $19.2 billion next year. While treatment dollars have
increased by 26 percent over that time, the share of the overall
budget devoted to treatment has decreased slightly, to 18 percent
from 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when President Nixon declared war on drugs in 1971
he put two-thirds of his funding into treatment. The results were
dramatic. Between 1971 and 1973, national crime rates dropped, the
number of drug-related arrests fell, the number of federal inmates
decreased, and record numbers of addicts sought and received
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the war on drugs has shifted to punishing offenders,
border surveillance, and fighting production at the source
countries.
</P>
<P>
   With 50 federal agencies controlling parts of the drug budget,
the drug czar has few chances to alter the funding equation.
</P>
<P>
   In rare cases, his office receives discretionary funds. After
taking office in 1996 and pledging to ``focus as a priority . . .
reducing consumption'' among hard-core users, McCaffrey received
$250 million in reallocated Pentagon funds. His decision at that
time was to put $202 million of it into interdiction efforts in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he extols the virtues of comprehensive solutions,
however, he stops short of calling for treatment for all addicts
who want it _ an unsuccessful initiative attempted by his
predecessor, Lee Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCaffrey wants some odd number of (Blackhawk) helicopters in
Colombia, but that has nothing to do with what we are doing here,''
said Michael J. Kineavy, director of Boston's employee assistance
programs in the Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Services. ``There's
a huge disconnect from what I see in the streets and what is
happening in Washington. One of the key issues for us is treatment
on demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't back treatment on demand, McCaffrey said,
``We have. We are. We're doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Facts show otherwise. Federal figures indicate that only 2.1
million of the nation's 5.7 million addicts received treatment in
1997.

FUN

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERICOACOARA, Brazil _ Jericoacoara is a famous beach resort in
a country filled with superstar shores.
</P>
<P>
   Never heard of it?
</P>
<P>
   That's OK. Its celebrity is really among Brazilians, backpackers
and the hippies who wandered into this fishing village in the 1960s
and never left. The latter are today's innkeepers and
restaurateurs, welcoming a new generation of converts to Jeri
(pronounced Jerry), as this town on the remote northern coast of
Brazil is called.
</P>
<P>
   Jeri coddles visitors with a constant breeze, comfortable
accommodations and lobster dinners at fast-food prices. One regular
visitor describes it as a place where stress melts away and
spirituality blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   But despite cult status among beachcombers, the village hasn't
grown much over the years. In Jeri, whose permanent population
numbers about 2,000, you won't find paved roads, street lights or
even stop signs. Roosters and cows roaming the main thoroughfare
set the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   And it's unlikely you'll find a North American. For Jeri lies in
Ceara, a poor, drought-plagued state that is short on natural
resources _ unless you count seafood and sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly the size of Louisiana and Mississippi combined, with a
population of 8 million, Ceara has long been popular with Brazilian
vacationers, who flock here for its 340 miles of coastline and 300
annual days of sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   It has several appealing aspects, too, for North Americans, not
the least of which is that so few of us have set foot here. The
antithesis of Rio de Janeiro _ a tiny state that's home to 7
million ``cariocas'' and the girl from Ipanema _ Ceara welcomed
only 17,000 Americans last year.
</P>
<P>
   That number is sure to rise, given the state's lovely landscape,
the dollar's strength against Brazil's battered real and the Ceara
government's escalating campaign for international tourists.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that Conde Nast Traveler magazine recently
dubbed Ceara one of the hottest destinations of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Jericoacoara's remoteness is part of its appeal, and getting
there can be half the fun.
</P>
<P>
   Our journey to Jeri from Ceara's capital, Fortaleza, includes a
one-hour flight, a bus ride, a river-ferry crossing and a
three-hour, bone-rattling ride across a dune desert.
</P>
<P>
   As if in a scene from a Mad Max film, we set out across the
dunes, many as tall as 90 feet, clinging to the roll bar of a dune
buggy. The route is peppered with tree-ringed lagoons, cacti,
sky-scraping palms and dusty villages where free-roaming pigs have
the right of way.
</P>
<P>
   We arrive in tiny Gijoca sweaty, sandy and sunbaked, in states
ranging from exhilaration to exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Full recovery from this style of travel dictates priorities.
They are, in order: an icy beverage, a hot shower, a cool pool and
someplace restful for that post-plunge nap.
</P>
<P>
   Thank heavens for Pousada Jardim do Paraiso, a 10-room hideaway
in Gijoca run by handsome French expatriate Laurent Michel.
</P>
<P>
   Michel's laid-back guest house _ actually several small chalets
scattered under palm trees _ is named for Paradise Lake, the
crystal-clear water that licks the property.
</P>
<P>
   Michel arrived in 1987 much the way we did, via dune buggy. As
fate would have it, his buggy broke down.
</P>
<P>
   It would be romantic to say he never left, but it was several
years _ some spent in France _ before Michel began building his
life on the shores of Paradise.
</P>
<P>
   It started in 1993 with his open-air restaurant, where he
adapted his mother's Brittany recipes to Brazilian produce and the
catch of the day. Eventually he added the chalets, their
whitewashed, thatch-roof design inspired by his time in the
Caribbean as a merchant marine.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other ``pousadas'' are scattered on white beaches around
the lake. Three boast restaurants, and most are owned by Italian or
French innkeepers who, like Michel, enjoy the climate, tranquillity
and relaxed pace of life of Ceara's western coast.
</P>
<P>
   Life is good, Michel says through an interpreter. His needs _
good music, good sailing and ``easy-living'' guests _ are filled.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his guests hail from the Brazilian capital of Sao Paulo,
Switzerland and Portugal. They pay $30 per couple for a night in
one of his chalets. Spotlessly clean, the chalets have private
baths (shower only), mini-fridges and electric fans (for the rare
times when a breeze isn't coming off the lake). A buffet breakfast
is included in the room rate.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much to do in Gijoca, but that's the point.
Hammocks and lounge chairs are scattered at water's edge. A
lake-side bar means you don't have to trudge 60 feet back to the
restaurant for a beverage. The water is warm and inviting, and
since the lake is mostly free of motorboats, you can soak until
you're pruney.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning dozens of day-trippers, some of whom have ridden
more than 200 miles by bus from Fortaleza, make their way to
Michel's beach. But by 5 p.m. they've dispersed, and once again the
place is a quiet paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Gijoca, Jeri is downright metropolitan. It has
dozens of ``pousadas,'' a post office, nightclubs and cafes and a
few gift shops selling handicrafts, hammocks and outrageously
priced sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   But at heart Jeri is still a fishing village. Its wide beige
beaches are a parking lot for dozens of ``jangadas,'' the ancestral
fishing vessels of northeastern Brazil.

<P>
   ``Guarding the Holy Fire'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Roger Steer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baker, $25.99 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roger Steer may have a surprise for American evangelicals who
assume that the situation at home is better than that in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as a history of Anglican evangelicalism, ``Guarding
the Holy Fire'' is only partly about events in the Episcopal
Church. But Steer makes it fairly clear that he sees evangelicals
in that denomination as quite a bit more beleaguered than their kin
in England.
</P>
<P>
   The author structures his account around personalities rather
than events, from John Wycliffe in the 14th century to George Carey
in the 20th. Although the American edition is subtitled ``The
Evangelicalism of John R.W. Stott, J.I. Packer and Alister
McGrath,'' the subject matter goes far beyond those three names _
including, for instance, the newly retired Bishop John Spong and
the Episcopal Synod of America. The book has also been updated
somewhat, but not rewritten, to reflect events since the 1998
Lambeth Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Steer's 350-page volume is divided into short chunks to aid the
reader. ``Guarding the Holy Fire'' provides a sympathetic, easily
accessible overview of its topic. &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   News flash: Michelle Tumes rocks. Literally. Electric guitars
and drums, an upbeat sound, the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   That is, Michelle Tumes rocks for one song. ``Do Ya,'' a
humorous critique of the Australian singer's accent, freckles and
buck teeth with the underlying message that self-esteem comes from
a relationship with God, not outward appearance, is included to
prove that she doesn't always ``float around and write really
serene music.''
</P>
<P>
   But fear not, Tumes fans. The rest of the album is filled with
the kind of serene, ethereal music that characterized her debut
effort two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That album, ``Listen,'' produced three No. 1 songs. This one
should do at least as well because it repeats the formula:
beautiful voice, beautiful sound, beautiful lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Tumes finds inspiration for her songs in her Christian heritage
_ ``Deep Love'' is derived from the hymn ``Oh, the Deep, Deep Love
of Jesus;'' from her experiences _ ``With the Angels'' is her
testimony of possible encounters with angels; and from readings _
``Immortal'' came from studying 19th-century Pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best cuts is ``Chant,'' a lovely piece inspired by a
visit to an Orthodox church, with simple, heartfelt lyrics: ``Now
lay aside all cares/Lay aside all cares/Lay aside all worldly
care/All worldly cares.'' &QL;

JERICOACOARA, Brazil: of northeastern Brazil.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Jangadas'' _ traditionally two or three pieces of timber
lashed together and topped by a single mast _ were first used by
Brazilian Indians to navigate the seas and fish. Today's
``jangadas'' appear more seaworthy but are still little more than
rafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jericoacoara'' is an Indian word meaning ``sunbathing
alligator.'' The alligators _ if there ever were any _ are history,
but the sunbathing continues. Like local fishermen, vacationers
focus their time on the Atlantic Ocean. Days are spent exploring
the beach on foot, bike or the bony back of a scrawny horse.
</P>
<P>
   A livelier pastime is sand surfing, which involves riding a
plank down a sandy cliff. (Remember you have to climb back up the
dune when you're done.)
</P>
<P>
   But even adrenalin junkies learn to pace themselves, for there
is little natural shade here. Lying a few degrees south of the
equator, Jeri bakes in the full voltage of the sun. Lingering just
a few minutes longer than the life of your sunscreen can be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, even the hardiest sun lovers have taken refuge
from the heat, retreating to a palm-sheltered hammock or a spot
under an umbrella at a seaside cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Around 5 p.m., Jeri begins to stir again. Heat-induced sloth
fades with the sun. The fishermen have returned to shore,
distributed their catches and abandoned their boats to the
ever-widening beach.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of children and dogs arrives at the beach. Gaggles of
girls giggling and gabbing stroll up and down the shore in a ritual
familiar to teen-watchers everywhere. A seaside bar cranks the
volume on its stereo, seeming to ignite an impromptu soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   Jeri is readying for sunset and the daily celebration that
attends it. Many visitors and locals will head to the top of Sunset
Dune, an enormous fixed sand cliff on the edge of town. Others will
make their way to Pedra Furado, an interesting surf-side rock
formation with a large sunset-framing hole.
</P>
<P>
   Still others will gather on the beach to watch the capoeira, an
acrobatic folk dance that traces its roots to the martial arts of
African slaves forced to work in Ceara's once-vast sugar-cane
fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cearenses'' are said to ``play `capoeira'.''
</P>
<P>
   The dance involves two combatants who gracefully kick, joust and
tumble as close to each other as possible without touching. The
dance is hypnotic, its effects heightened by its traditional
accompaniment: the beating of a drum, the plucking of a
``berimbau'' (a stringed instrument that looks like a fishing pole
embedded in a coconut) and the clapping of spectators who form a
circle around the dancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capoeira's'' rituals are practiced by males and females,
seemingly without age restraints. It is not unusual to see a boy of
4 or 5 playing ``capoeira'' with an older woman.
</P>
<P>
   While the ``capoeira'' is transfixing, the dance most commonly
associated with Ceara is the ``forro.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``forro'' is to Ceara what the samba is to Rio, and their
differences vividly illustrate those between the Brazilian states.
The samba is sexy and exotic; the ``forro'' is energetic but
earthy. In the ``forro,'' the dancers' feet rarely leave the
ground. Think polka, which is not much of a stretch since ``forro''
bands include an accordion.
</P>
<P>
   For a village, Jeri has many good restaurants. At Espaco Aberto,
Brazilian staples such as rice and beans are flavorful, the fish is
fresh, and the pasta is a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Cearenses' foods are influenced by the seasonings of the
Brazilian Indians, in particular the use of oil from the palm tree.
A typical meal is grilled fish with coconut milk or garlicky boiled
shrimp, which residents eat with the tail and all.
</P>
<P>
   Often the shrimp is dredged at the table in farofel, or manioc
flour. Manioc is a foundation of the Brazilian diet. Manioc flour
is used in dishes such as stuffed crab, and manioc strips are fried
and eaten like French fries.
</P>
<P>
   At Taverna Cantina and Creperia, a second-story terrace
overlooking the beach is the perfect place to indulge in
caipirinha, Brazil's national drink.
</P>
<P>
   Caipirinha's main ingredient is cachaca, a potent and popular
sugar-cane liquor. Taking its name from an African word for liquor,
cachaca tastes most like a member of the tequila family. Depending
on the brand _ there are hundreds in Brazil, varying from pricey to
pennies a bottle _ cachaca's potency is 50-70 proof.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant serves specialties such as the Champignon, a
crepe stuffed with mushrooms, ham and mozzarella, and the Jeri,
which bulges with bacon, dried tomato and a locally produced soft
cheese. Dessert is sweet crepes filled with cashews and chocolate
syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Meals can be painfully slow for high-gear Americans. It is not
unusual for an hour to pass between ordering and your first course.
Better to view the pace not as lagging but as leisurely.
</P>
<P>
   Force yourself to quit watching the clock. Better yet, toss the
watch and lose yourself in Brazilian paradise.

NOT ALL DRUGS ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOGOTA _ At Sigmund Freud Park on the National University
campus, minds are often altered on heroin.
</P>
<P>
   In the dance clubs near the beaches of Cartagena, hips grind to
a mix of ballenato music and Ecstasy pills.
</P>
<P>
   And inside the decrepit slums of Cartucho, in the heart of the
capital, children in tattered clothes puff on cigarettes laced with
a cocaine derivative called ``basuco.''
</P>
<P>
   As Colombia struggles to end decades of battles against drug
cartels and insurgents, it is confronting a new war within its own
borders. Drug consumption is growing steadily, from modern
apartment buildings to the most remote jungle hamlets, and the
government now admits that something must be done about it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a relatively new phenomenon that both infuriates and
embarrasses the country's leaders, who for years have blamed
Colombia's drug problems on the overwhelming demand that comes from
the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And while most of the cocaine and heroin grown and processed in
this country remains destined for export overseas, officials here
can no longer hide the growing demand at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug consumption here is something we realize we have to
address immediately,'' said Gabriel Merchan, director of Colombia's
national office on drug policy. ``It's another painful price that
our society has to pay for narcotrafficking, but if we commit
ourselves now we can stop it from growing further.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is not alone among Latin American countries to face a
new drug-consumption dilemma. Other countries that have become
players in the region's booming narcotrafficking industry _ whether
as producers or gateways into the United States _ have seen rising
levels of drug abuse among their own citizens, most notably Mexico,
Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Although Merchan and other officials insist that the drug-abuse
problem is only a fraction of that found in the United States and
Europe, Colombia's war on drugs may prove to be trickier in a
country where supplies are cheaper and more addictive because of
their purity.
</P>
<P>
   A gram of 70-percent-pure heroin sells for as little as $10 at
Freud Park. Ecstasy pills, a synthetic drug popular in the United
States since the 1980s, can be had for $3 each. And a half-gram of
basuco powder, a byproduct of cocaine processing that contains
traces of gasoline, ether, and sulfuric acid, can be bought for
just 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a bitter taste that at first makes your stomach ache
and gives you diarrhea,'' said Jaime Carbajal, 33, a recovering
basuco addict who now works for a drug treatment center in Bogota.
``But your body adjusts quickly and it makes you feel calm, not
strong, but not weak, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Current drug-consumption statistics for Colombia are hard to
find. Most officials rely on two government-funded studies _ one
conducted in 1992, the other in 1996 _ to gauge the trends.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2 percent of Colombia's 35 million citizens said they
took some illegal drug the previous year, according to the 1996
report, nearly double the rate in the first survey. Among
respondents, marijuana had been consumed the most, followed by
cocaine, basuco, and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 government survey of children and young adults, released
two weeks ago and using a different methodology, found that 5
percent of Colombian men and women between the ages of 10 and 24
are regular consumers. In the United States, that number is roughly
3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sad consequence of a country with a large
narcotrafficking industry,'' said Klaus Nyholm, director of the
United Nations Drug Control Program office in Colombia, which
sponsors nearly two dozen drug-fighting programs.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Colombia's heaviest drug consumption is not in
Bogota, a metropolis of 7 million people, or in the remote fields
that process cocaine and heroin, but in the rolling hills that
produce the country's other famous product: coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Along a miles-wide corridor on the western slopes of the Andes
Mountains, cadres of field workers _ mostly men who spend months at
a time moving from farm to farm _ smoke large quantities of
marijuana. The demand for the plant in the region has created
thriving drug markets in Pereira, Manizales, Armenia, and other
towns along the coffee belt.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating Colombia's drug-use problem is its worsening
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a model among Latin American countries for its
steady prosperity and thriving middle class despite years of civil
war, Colombia is now in the midst of one of its worst recessions in
70 years. A growing number of businesses and investors have taken
their money out of the country mostly because of the escalating
violence involving government troops, leftist guerrillas, and
right-wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a complicated situation that it's hard to know where
to start,'' said one drug-treatment worker in Bogota who requested
anonymity. ``Do you stop the drug traffickers first, or the civil
war, or create more jobs for people? There's only so much money
that government can spend and people are losing patience.''

</P>
<P>
   The heating contractor says that I need larger radiators in each
room, but I don't want to spend the money since I rent this house.
</P>
<P>
   Installing auxiliary electric heaters would cost too much to
run. Can you suggest anything else I can do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Insulating the outside walls would be the most effective, but
chances are you don't want to spend this money on a rented house.
</P>
<P>
   However, you can increase the efficiency of the radiators to
some degree _ thus adding slightly to the amount of heat they will
radiate out into the room _ by installing a reflective shield in
front of the wall behind each radiator.
</P>
<P>
   You can make such a reflective shield by gluing heavy duty
aluminum foil to the front of a sheet of foam insulation board or
heavy corrugated cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can buy a ready made shield of this kind at many hardware
stores and home centers.
</P>
<P>
   The reflector will not only direct more heat out into the room,
it will also minimize the amount of heat lost into the wall behind
the radiator.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a tall chimney on the outside of my house.
</P>
<P>
   It is cleaned and inspected by a professional chimney sweep each
year to make sure there is no buildup of creosote on the inside. He
also uses a vacuum to clean the bottom of the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of this, every time we have damp weather and there is
no fire in the wood burning stove there is a strong odor of
creosote in the house.
</P>
<P>
   We installed a chimney cap, but this did not help. Have you any
advice to offer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since you mention a stove, it is obvious that there must be a
horizontal section of stove pipe that goes through the wall into
the chimney and it is possible that this is where creosote has
accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible that the chimney has no proper flue or liner
on the inside, and this could mean that creosote is soaking into
the exposed bricks.
</P>
<P>
   A third possibility is that the chimney sweep may not be doing
as thorough a job as he could.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a vacuum, a special long wire brush must be worked up
and down inside the chimney when cleaning it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The 40-year-old ranch house we recently moved into has
settlement cracks and the brick face on the back seems to be bowing
out.
</P>
<P>
   Now we notice that the cracks are getting worse and the kitchen
floor slopes slightly toward the center of the house.
</P>
<P>
   We crawled down into the shallow crawl space under the house and
found that the main I-beam running the length of the house rests on
small piles of wood shims that sit on top of four concrete
footings.
</P>
<P>
   We can see that these shims are being compressed by the weight
and so we tried to find jacks that are short enough to fit under
the beams, but can't find any.
</P>
<P>
   What can we do to fix this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Something should be done to shore up that I-beam and the
floor above it, but it sounds to me as though this is not really a
do-it-yourself project.
</P>
<P>
   I think you should call in a professional to examine the
premises and determine the best way to accomplish this.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My asphalt shingle roof is only 10 years old and some of the
shingles are curling up. What causes this and what can be done to
fix it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Although asphalt shingles sometimes curl as they age, as a
rule this should not occur on good quality shingles that are only
10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   When it does happen it is usually due to the fact that
lightweight or poor quality shingles were installed, or that the
installation was not properly done.
</P>
<P>
   Curling is not always a serious problem, but this depends on how
severe the condition is. If it is bad, check on your roof's
guarantee. It may be covered.
</P>
<P>
   If it is not, then you can try cementing the curled edges down
with roof cement on a hot sunny day when the shingles are warm and
pliable. Unfortunately, this is not always permanent.

 LA GABARRA, COLUMBIA: ... aid plan.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the first challenges for authorities will be to update
the government's outdated estimates for the amount of coca grown
here. Officially, the La Gabarra region contains about 8,000 acres
of coca. Most residents and farmers, however, say the figure is
closer to 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason these programs haven't arrived yet is that La
Gabarra remains a volatile zone in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Marxist guerrillas controlled La Gabarra as if it
were an independent state, dictating who entered and exited the
area, painting Che Guevara graffiti on walls and creating a tax
system that allowed them to collect a portion on all the coca that
was grown and processed on nearby farms.
</P>
<P>
   But paramilitary squads launched a massive surprise attack last
May, pushing the guerrillas they didn't kill deep into the jungle
or up the Catatumbo into Venezuela. Then they killed or evicted
farmers and residents suspected of being guerrilla sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Sister Sofia began collecting bodies, about 50 of
them from that attack. Three months later, the paramilitaries swept
through the town again, looking for guerrilla infiltrators and
killing another 30 residents. They currently are in control of the
La Gabarra region, but the guerrillas still operate in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Because of protests by human rights groups over the August
massacre, the Pastrana government sent in 500 soldiers and a unit
of the National Police. The troops remained until late last month,
leaving behind 80 police officers who patrol La Gabarra's unpaved
streets twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mayor here, no school system, banks, or courts. The
top government official is Marceliano Castiblanco, the 32-year-old
police captain who sometimes performs civil marriages. But his main
concern is looking out for his officers, who have bunkered
themselves in foxholes and behind sandbags outside a storefront
next to Holy Trinity Church, a block from the convent where Sister
Sofia and five other nuns live.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the police presence, paramilitary troops dressed in
civilian clothes walk confidently through the village, the butts of
their 9mm pistols jutting from their baggy jeans. Nearly everyone
knows where they live.
</P>
<P>
   By themselves, the police can do little to stop them, since they
provide the only protection against the guerrillas who lurk nearby,
waiting for their chance to reclaim the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're either waiting for the next guerrilla attack or for the
next (paramilitary) massacre,'' said one officer who requested
anonymity. ``There is tension here all day and all night.''
</P>
<P>
   By seizing La Gabarra, the paramilitaries have also taken
control of the area's lucrative cocaine industry, which centers
around an outdoor market that operates every weekend at a bend in
the Catatumbo.
</P>
<P>
   Canoes filled with large white bags arrive from the local coca
farms. The bags, which contain coca paste, are sold to drug cartel
buyers, who form one long and orderly line.
</P>
<P>
   Before each sale, a spoonful of paste is held over a burner and
melted to check for its purity. Every transaction is recorded in a
spiral notebook and conducted under the watchful eyes of armed
paramilitary troops, who take a percentage from each sale.
</P>
<P>
   This type of tax system was begun by the FARC to help fund its
operations and has been duplicated by nearly every rebel group.
Experts say these taxes now account for up to 50 percent of all
guerrilla and paramilitary funds and offer strong proof that
Colombia's civil war and its war on drugs have become one and the
same.
</P>
<P>
   The system also shows how the country's narcotrafficking
industry has evolved over the last two decades. When the government
first began its joint eradication operations with the United States
in the early 1980s, marijuana was the main target. But in the
mid-1980s, as American forces were successfully eliminating coca
crops in Peru and Bolivia, the plants were brought to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   That gave rise to the notorious cartels like those in Cali and
Medellin, and to drug lords like Pablo Escobar, who were known for
their violence, kidnappings, and cold-blooded efficiency with which
they ran their operations.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, authorities dismantled the cartels, culminating with
Escobar's death in a gun battle with police at one of his hideouts
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But in breaking up the cartels' vertically-integrated
businesses, the government also opened the way for hundreds of
smaller organizations to step in and take over different pieces of
the drug-trafficking operation. It also allowed insurgent leaders _
many of whom had previously fought against cartels like Escobar's _
to pick up where the drug lords left off.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the middle of his 40-acre coca field outside La
Gabarra, Luis, a 57-year-old farmer, isn't sure who he'd rather
sell to.
</P>
<P>
   When the guerrillas controlled the area, he could count on
getting about $1,500 for each kilo of cocaine paste he sold at
market, even after the rebels collected their tax. It was just
enough to pay his 60 farm workers and to feed his family of six.
Now, under the paramilitary system, he gets roughly $900.
</P>
<P>
   But even worse, Luis said, is the anxiety that fills their lives
_ fear that the paramilitaries will order them off their land or
raise the tax, fear that guerrillas will return and take revenge on
him for paying the paramilitaries. And the new fear: that
fumigation and rapid intervention by US-trained forces will
dramatically escalate the violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sister Sofia, Luis is doing something he'd rather not do.
For a moment, it's enough to make him reconsider coca farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that growing coca is bad and it causes problems not
just here but all around the world,'' said Luis, a former
carpenter. ``I'd much rather grow fruit. But if I can't make money,
then we die. And I'd rather die producing something than die
starving.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Sofia's mother has been so worried about the danger
around her daughter that she once called the mother superior,
begging that Sister Sofia be reassigned to a safer place. The
daughter refused.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, she will be reassigned, perhaps to a quiet girls
school like the one in Bogota where she used to teach. Maybe then,
after three years in La Gabarra, she can start to heal, can start
to forget the endless war that drugs have brought to this remote
village.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this has had an effect on me psychologically and
spiritually,'' she said while walking along the dirt road from the
cemetery back to the town square. ``I've had to deal with a lot and
it's taken some enthusiasm out of me. But I know it's the same for
everyone else who lives here.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Exceptionally mild air for late February will cover most areas
from the east slopes of the Rockies to the Atlantic seaboard on
Thursday as an unusually vigorous jet stream directs mild, moist
air from the central Pacific to the heart of North America. Arctic
air will retreat into far northern Canada. In the West, the moist
air will rise along the west slopes of the mountains resulting in
recurrent, locally heavy snow from the northern Sierra to the west
slopes of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawling high pressure from the Carolinas to the central
Atlantic Ocean will keep the East Coast States mainly dry and
unseasonably mild. Sunshine will be plentiful near the Middle
Atlantic and Southeast coasts. However, sunshine will be limited
across the interior Northeast as a weak front stalls over central
New England and New York.
</P>
<P>
   A steady flow of moist air from the south will promote cloudy
skies over a large area from the eastern Dakotas to the Great Lakes
and Ohio Valley. Converging winds near a weakening zone of low
pressure will produce a broken area of showers from the southern
Great Lakes to the Tennessee Valley. Patchy drizzle will linger
across the northern parts of the Mississippi Valley and Great
Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will spread north along the west slopes of the Rockies as a
moisture-laden disturbance moves northeast from Arizona. Areas of
heavy snow will be common in the mountains from eastern Utah early
Thursday to Wyoming and Montana on Thursday night. Meanwhile, a new
disturbance will send rain toward the central California coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Warm in the Icebox &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the mercury surged to 58 degrees at International
Falls, the Minnesota town which has earned the nickname ``the
nation's ice box.'' The reading was the highest ever measured there
during the month of February. The previous record was 55 degrees
set on Feb. 2, 1991. Mild winter weather is uncommon in
International Falls, where the average high temperature remains
below freezing from mid-November to mid-March. Winter nights are
often frigid, with temperatures typically falling below zero from
mid-December through the end of February.

<P>
   LA GABARRA, Colombia _ The rusted gates to the cemetery were
locked, so Sister Sofia entered by crouching carefully between two
strands of barbed wire, making sure she didn't snag her white
cotton habit.
</P>
<P>
   As she straightened herself, the 31-year-old nun looked around
the knee-high grass. Her large brown large brown eyes fixed on four
fresh mounds of reddish soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the ones we buried, and this is where we put them,''
she said in a calm, soft voice, as if to keep from disturbing these
sleeping souls.
</P>
<P>
   On another small hill, three naked branches were planted upright
in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a married couple here,'' the nun said, her voice
quivering slightly. ``One stick is for the husband, the other for
the wife. The third is for the baby she was carrying. She was six
months pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   When she took her vows to become a Franciscan nun 12 years ago,
Sister Sofia expected to be a teacher, helping to sharpen the minds
of Colombian children. But much of her work over the past year has
been with bodies, not souls. Almost daily, she retrieves corpses
from the banks of the Catatumbo River or from the muddy road that
leads into this remote northern village near the Venezuelan border.
When she buries them, only rarely is she aware of who they were or
how they got caught up in the constant violence that pervades these
jungle hills.
</P>
<P>
   Like most everyone else in La Gabarra, Sister Sofia's life is
dominated by Colombia's brutally entwined conflicts _ the booming
trade in cocaine and heroin and the 40-year civil war that is
largely financed by drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Years of government neglect and chronic poverty have turned
rural areas like these into fertile ground for producing much of
the cocaine and heroin that is sold in the United States. It also
makes these residents more vulnerable to the unwanted attention of
leftist guerrillas or right-wing paramilitary groups fighting for
control of the lucrative bounty from coca fields.
</P>
<P>
   To help restore peace to places like La Gabarra, Colombian
President Andres Pastrana and the Clinton administration are
lobbying the US Congress for $1.6 billion in aid _ most of it in
military equipment and additional training _ to stop Colombia's
drug supply and to strengthen South America's longest-running
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be easy. Despite two decades of antidrug
interdiction by US and Colombian authorities, Colombia's drug
business is booming. Figures soon to be released by US drug
officials are expected to show that Colombia produced 520 metric
tons of cocaine last year, more than triple the original estimate
of 1998's harvest.
</P>
<P>
   In Bogota and Washington, the generals fighting the drug war say
they need US-made Blackhawk helicopters, better surveillance
technology, and more American-trained units who can swoop into
places like La Gabarra and eradicate its coca fields. But their
strategy focuses primarily on left-wing guerrillas _ not the
right-wing paramilitaries who control and tax the open and
flourishing drug trade in towns like La Gabarra.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Clinton administration plan say the Colombians
need the hardware and expertise if they are to find and eliminate
drug fields and break up the cartels that transport 85 percent of
the cocaine into the United States and a growing amount of heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer to see less consumption in the United States or
in Europe, rather than to have more helicopters,'' said Rosso Jose
Serrano Cadena, Colombia's national police chief who oversees most
of the country's antidrug efforts. ``But we have an obligation to
do all we can with the best equipment and personnel we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   The US-Colombia strategy is to push primarily into the south of
the country, prime coca-growing territory controlled by the
15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the largest
insurgent group, also known as the FARC. Planners expect a minimum
of 10,000 people will be driven from their homes by the new
operation, if it is approved.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, US advisers have helped the Colombian police and
military identify fields and laboratories where harvested plants
are processed into drugs. Then crop-dusting planes, provided by an
American subcontractor, fumigate the fields. Days later, a special
team of government engineers and scientists is flown in, flanked by
armed troops, to inspect poisoned fields.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia last year received about $300 million in antidrug
funding from the United States, and American authorities are
present in almost every aspect of the country's antinarcotics
operations. At any one time there are roughly 200 to 300 US
personnel in Colombia, according to one senior official. They
include military trainers, as well as agents from the FBI, Drug
Enforcement Administration, Justice Department, Treasury
Department, National Security Agency, and the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the United States is currently providing $5 million
for crop substitution and other social and economic projects
administered by the Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the current antidrug strategy say that more money
should go toward programs that foster rural economic development, a
better court system, and basic government services. Fumigation,
they add, only worsens a bad situation for many peasant farmers who
resort to growing coca and poppy _ the flowering plant used for
heroin _ either for economic survival or because they have been
coerced by a rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   ``All fumigation does is displace poor people who are already
living under extremely difficult conditions,'' said Ricardo Vargas,
director of the Colombian office of Accion Andina, an umbrella
group of antidrug activists in the Andean region. ``Once their
field is lost, they'll simply find another place to try again.''
</P>
<P>
   Month by month, more of them are coming to La Gabarra.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Located a few miles from the Venezuelan border in an oil-rich
swath in the state of Norte de Santander, there are only two ways
to get here: by canoe along the Catatumbo River, or a spine-shaking
10-hour drive _ most of it over rocks, mud, and thick, wet clay _
from the city of Cucuta.
</P>
<P>
   The area was once a hub for banana and mango farmers. But over
the last five years, it has become the center of one of the
country's fastest-growing coca-producing regions.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, La Gabarra's population swells from 2,000 people to
nearly 10,000. Young males, wearing knee-high black rubber boots,
descend from coca fields in the surrounding hills and arrive in one
of the dozens of canoes that taxi them along the Catatumbo River.
</P>
<P>
   They come to the village to ``rumbear,'' the local slang for
``partying,'' which usually involves two days of heavy beer
drinking, several games of pool, and two nights with some of La
Gabarra's 500 prostitutes. In one weekend, a worker can easily
spend most of his week's salary, about $250.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the coca farms, the workers perform backbreaking and
often noxious tasks. Those who pick the leaves are known as
``scrapers,'' for the way they harvest the leaves off plants with
their bare hands. Meanwhile, ``chemists'' assigned to the rustic
processing labs are exposed to large quantities of cement dust,
gasoline fumes, and sulfuric acid that are used to make the cocaine
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody around here consumes cocaine, probably because everyone
knows the kind of things that go into it,'' said one 20-year-old
farm worker who goes by the nickname, ``Diablo.''
</P>
<P>
   Fumigation and other government-sponsored eradication programs
haven't begun here yet, although Colombian and American officials
say this area will be targeted under the new aid plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
   With a knock on his apartment door, Jorge felt salvation was at
hand. A friend appeared bearing gifts: two $10 bags of heroin.
</P>
<P>
   After the friend left the Boston apartment, Jorge put four small
white rocks onto a spoon, dissolving the drug in a quarter-teaspoon
of water. With his needle, he drew in the liquid heroin. And then
he picked up a belt and wrapped it around his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   With his left hand, he took the loaded needle and gently pricked
the soft underside of his arm until he found one of his shriveled
veins. He emptied the narcotic into his blood. The belt fell,
unfurling like a snake at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd thank God for this,'' said Jorge, after a long silence
during a cold afternoon this month. ``But I don't know if it's him
I should thank. Should I thank God to bring me something evil? I
can't thank God. Should I thank the devil?''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the power of drugs that users embrace the devil on the
wings of a high. For a high, they would risk custody of their
children, sell their daughters' bodies, and steal from the mother
who gives them refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Drug culture has existed as long as human civilization. In
21st-century America, despite falling crime rates and reports that
indicate a leveling off of first-time drug use among the young,
there are still 5.7 million known drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems that the drug problem has been receding, that is
largely percepton. The drug problem has shifted away from the
sleek, white-collar culture of recreational cocaine users in the
mid-1980s to today's legion of hard-core addicts in the underclass,
where addiction compounds endemic poverty, despair, and violence.
</P>
<P>
   In just two years, from 1995 to 1997, the number of Americans
with severe drug addictions jumped 23 percent. This group cost
American society $110 billion a year, a figure compiled by federal
researchers that accounts for drug-related diseases, traffic
accidents, and lost productivity on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Congress is considering a Clinton administration plan that
would open a new, and some say, perilous front in the drug war in
hopes of making drugs less available to Jorge and other addicts _ a
$1.6 billion, two-year package that relies heavily on military
force to attack the source of coca and opium poppies in Colombia,
which produces 85 percent of America's cocaine and 65 percent of
its heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Congress began holding hearings on an ambitious
proposal to give Colombia 30 UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters to deploy
drug-suppression troops into remote areas of that country and
state-of-the-art APS 145 radar to interdict drug shipments leaving
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians who live around coca and poppy fields warn that even
if US-backed forces poison hundreds of thousands of acres and burn
drug labs to the jungle floor the demand for drugs from the United
States will ensure that the $500-billion-a-year global industry
finds a new foothold elsewhere along the Andean spine.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers and addicts contend that the best way to attack
demand is by devoting more money to treatment, just as President
Nixon did on June 17, 1971, when he declared drug abuse ``public
enemy No. 1 in the United States.'' He earmarked two-thirds of new
antidrug funding to treatment. Since the early 1980s, however,
treatment has accounted for less than a third of federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's drug budget remains at that level,
with the vast majority of the money aimed at stopping the supply of
drugs and only a small portion going to help wean people like Jorge
off them. Barry R. McCaffrey, White House drug czar and a former
general who commanded the infantry division that led the ``left
hook'' attack on Iraqi forces in Operation Desert Storm, contends
that a robust effort to knock out drugs at the source will help
save the lives of American youths.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's first drug czar believes antidrug missions in
Colombia will do little to change balance of the drug war. ``We
have a phenomenally large border, and as long as demand is there,
and as long as people in other countries have economic situations
that make trafficking attractive, you are going to have drug
trafficking,'' said Jerome H. Jaffe, whom Nixon hired to head his
drug-fighting efforts. ``That is something that is an absolute
reality. To do anything, you have to bring down demand.''
</P>
<P>
   And fighting demand means fighting drug use on a
person-by-person basis. Antidrug work is a tedious daily campaign
of encouragement, tough love, and therapy that is different for
every addict. A year in recovery does it for some, a decade for
others. For still others, it never works. The drugs win.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   If you step into Brianne Fitzgerald's size-8 1/2 red-and-black
Arche boots for a few days, the first thing that you'll realize is
that her patient list of drug addicts is made up of people in great
pain who are crying out for help _ and have been for years,
sometimes decades.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Fitzgerald is a nurse, a South Boston resident
who lived for years in the western suburbs, a divorced mother of
four children, including three sons who play fullback on three
different football teams (Boston College, Northeastern University,
and the New York Giants) and a daughter who trains for marathons in
her off hours on the hills of San Francisco. They comprise a
determined family, but perhaps none more determined than Brianne.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in Newton, Mass., the oldest of eight children. Her
father was an alcoholic. He worked as a bookkeeper for Texaco. Her
mother held jobs as a nurse and fashion model. ``I became a
caretaker very early on,'' Fitzgerald said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   She married at 21 and almost immediately began having children,
eventually settling into a comfortable life in Wellesley. But she
wanted something more, and at 33, she answered a newspaper ad for a
job in a ``clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be an inner-city methadone clinic for heroin
addicts. She got the position. Soon she was spending her mornings
pouring methadone into cups for a line of addicts whose last names
began with the letters A to L and her late afternoons preparing
dinner for six in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I did before going to work was take off my
diamond ring,'' she said, her hands still ringless.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, spanning a divorce and a move into the city, she
stuck with her work with addicts, attracted by the stark difference
from her early upbringing, lured by ``living on the edge a little
bit,'' and buffeted by the knowledge that she could make a
difference in some people's lives. Not all. But some.
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, she drove her 1998 blue Toyota Corolla to East
Boston to see a patient. Fitzgerald works for Neighborhood Health
Plan, an HMO that has made the determination that the most
effective _ and cost-efficient _ care for high-risk patients is to
send nurse practitioners on home visits.
</P>
<P>
   On Meridian Street in East Boston, Fitzgerald parked and walked
up a flight of stairs in an apartment building to visit Diane
Amaral, 42, a recovering heroin and cocaine addict, who had lost
custody of her four children years ago because of her addiction.
</P>
<P>
   As Fitzgerald carried her heavy black Bottega Venetta bag over
her shoulder and a Zip-lock bag containing four homemade double
chocolate chip cookies in her hand, Amaral started shouting from
above.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just cracking up in here!'' she said, as Fitzgerald walked
into her apartment, closed the door, and handed over the cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Amaral ignored her. ``I'm beat up,'' she said, pacing in her
kitchen. ``I'm tired. Maybe I should just die. At least I would die
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to go to the hospital?'' Fitzgerald asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No! No! I just want something for my pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaral's hands hurt so much that she was sleeping only a few
hours a night. She was not sure why they hurt but the pain was
unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will try to help you,'' Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Amaral shouted for another 10 minutes and put her face in her
hands. ``My head, my head,'' she said, weeping.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald had to leave. She set up an appointment for Amaral at
Lemuel Shattuck Hospital in Boston; perhaps a doctor would
prescribe something for her pain. As Fitzgerald left, Amaral ran
after her, mumbling apologies, and handed her a small present, a
honeysuckle mist-scented drawer sachet from Victoria's Secret.
``Thank you, Brianne, thank you,'' Amaral said in a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   In her car, Fitzgerald looked weary. ``Where do you begin?'' she
asked. ``You'd think I'd be burned out, too. I grew up in an
alcoholic family, so I'm no stranger to helping addicts. I learned
the hard way in this job, though. When you work harder than the
addicts, you get real disappointed because then they don't get
clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mobile phone rang. It was a former patient, an ex-heroin
junkie named Walter Applegate. They set a lunch date at a deli in
South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after she arrived, Applegate walked in, the picture of
health. Baby blue eyes. A barrel chest that filled his sweatshirt.
``I lift weights four times a week,'' he said. ``I weighed 105
pounds when I was doing heroin. Now I'm 190.''
</P>
<P>
   By his estimate, he was in and out of 70 treatment centers
during the 15 years he was an addict, and six of those years were
spent in prison. Now a plumber, he said he finally got sober on
Labor Day 1995. ``It was the consequences,'' he said. ``I just
didn't like losing my home, my boy, my family.'' He hasn't seen his
15-year-old son in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was using, it came down to seeing my son or getting
high. I would rather get high,'' he said matter-of-factly, his
strong hands gripping a steak sandwich. ``I know as long as I stay
sober, I'm going to see him again. I know I can be a good father.''
</P>
<P>
   He kept shifting in his seat as he spoke, eyes darting around
the restaurant. He seemed on edge. ``You OK?'' Fitzgerald asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, yeah, yeah,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't so sure. How could she be? Over time, she has learned
not to trust quick assurances.

   A Splash of Color For Palm's New PDA. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a week or so to go until its IPO, Palm Computing started
this week with a flurry of activity, including a name change. The
company is now known as Palm Inc. After the name change, it
announced the long-awaited color model: the Palm IIIc.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm IIIc's color screen allows it to compete in the one
area where Windows CE devices had the edge. The IIIc comes with 8MB
of memory, and its rechargeable batteries last about two weeks.
That is comparable to the earlier III and V models, which is
considered remarkable because color displays are a much greater
drain on battery life.
</P>
<P>
   One application for the new color Palm allows it to display
photos. Club Photo, of San Jose, Calif., is providing a new version
of its Album To Go product for the IIIc. Photos downloaded from
either a computer or Club Photo's Web site can be shown in color.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak will be coming out this spring with a new digital camera,
the PalmPix, which will attach to several Palm models. The pictures
can be viewed on the Palm screen and downloaded to a desktop. Palm
also announced a new non-color unit called the IIIxe, with 8MB of
memory. It will sell for $249, which just happens to be the price
of the Handspring Visor Deluxe. The IIIc will retail for $449. &QL;

   Online, the Heart Doesn't Need to Be A Lonely Pumper &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One can look into the heart for love or truth, but there are
also veins, valves, arteries and blood to be seen. February is
Heart Month, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Maryland
offers an animated heart at www.biointeractive.org, with pumping
muscle, opening and closing valves, and blood flowing from chamber
to chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes explanations of electrocardiograms and
blood pressure, plus an image that can be rotated to see the heart
from different views. &QL;

   The End of Free-PC Program Is Windfall for Early Subscribers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When eMachines ended its Free-PC program earlier this month,
many people were not surprised. For the past year, analysts had
questioned whether anyone could make money by giving away computers
in exchange for their attention to on-screen advertisements. But
for the first batch of people who flocked to the Free-PC offer, the
deal turned out to be even better than advertised.
</P>
<P>
   The 25,000 people who had received free Compaq and Dell
computers in exchange for allowing advertising on their computer
screens and their shopping habits to be tracked are allowed to keep
the computers _ and the accompanying warranties _ without having to
pay a cent. They are also off the hook regarding the advertising
and shopping requirements.
</P>
<P>
   A section of the eMachines Web site (www.e4me.com/fpc/fpc.html)
offers instructions on how to uninstall the viewbar that was
intended to flash commercials. The company promises to destroy the
credit-card information that was collected from each user.

   In a Survey, Americans Voice High Hopes for Cellular Phones &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans are optimistic and imaginative about the ways they
think cell phones will be used in the future. At least that's the
conclusion of a new survey of 1,013 cell phone users and non-cell
phone users conducted by Yankelovich Partners, a market research
firm in Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Some two-thirds of the respondents said they believed that
wireless phones would someday be used for remote e-mail access and
for getting directions using Global Positioning System technology.
Nearly as many (63 percent) expected people to browse the Web with
cell phones. And 59 percent said they believed that people would
take pictures digitally and send them to others. More than half (57
percent) said they expected people to conduct video conferences
with their phones.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankelovich study was conducted on behalf of Blanc and Otus,
a public relations firm, and its client, LetsTalk.com, an online
retailer of cell phones and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study failed to mention just how far into the
future the respondents thought the enhanced services would
materialize. As it turns out, the question wasn't asked. ``We
wanted to know what wireless phone features people foresaw in the
future regardless of timing,'' said Bret Clement, a spokesman for
LetsTalk.com.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Richard Siber, an analyst at Anderson Consulting in
Boston, the findings support the idea that consumers are expecting
such advanced services to show up on cell phones, which Siber said
was an interesting finding in itself. &QL;

   E-Vectra Desktop PC Is Smaller and Simpler &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Help Desk just got a little help: a new series of desktop
PCs that are smaller and simpler. Announced earlier this week,
Hewlett-Packard's new e-Vectra computer is about the size of a
hard-cover dictionary, about 75 percent smaller than the average
desktop PC. The computer, aimed at the business market but also
designed to appeal to home users, is expected to arrive in stores
by this summer, with street prices for the low-end models estimated
to start at about $549.
</P>
<P>
   The e-Vectra weighs about eight pounds. When unhooked from its
monitor and keyboard, it can fit inside a laptop computer case for
easy transport.
</P>
<P>
   While the external benefit (reclaiming work-station real estate)
is obvious to any user, the internal composition of the e-Vectra
may benefit systems-support personnel. The e-Vectra is designed to
eliminate the problem of someone's having to wade around inside
computers that have varying configurations for fixes and upgrades.
It comes with an external power supply that can be replaced without
opening the machine. The hard drive can be swapped out of the case
in 30 seconds, the company estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Like Apple Computer's iMac, the e-Vectra has no floppy drive.
The small e-Vectra motherboard also has no PCI or ISA card slots,
but the streamlined configuration is intended to simplify
maintenance and diagnostic time.
</P>
<P>
   The e-Vectra will be available with either a Pentium III or a
Celeron processor; Windows 98, 2000 or NT; and an optional CD-ROM
drive. The computers, which come with an 8.4-gigabyte hard drive
and Ethernet capability, can hold up to 256 megabytes of RAM and
sport a full complement of standard PC ports on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Overworked systems support professionals who can't wait for the
e-Vectra can admire an online demo at www.hp.com/desktops/epc.

   PAINFUL VANITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether the latest trend is stiletto heels or platform soles,
women's feet seem to be at the mercy of fashion. But we pay a high
price for vanity, says Dr. John Early, assistant professor of
orthopedic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Of the people who have foot problems, 90 percent are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men don't usually suffer from this kind of foot discomfort,
because they refuse to wear uncomfortable shoes,'' says Early.
``Women, however, are willing to sacrifice their comfort for
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing high-heeled shoes for extended periods can result in
painful and sometimes debilitating foot and ankle problems;
cramming toes into narrow pointed-toe shoes can cause deformity;
and the constant friction of ill-fitting shoes causes corns and
calluses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-CANCER FOOD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strawberries, whole wheat, cabbage and beans are among the top
10 anti-cancer foods, says a new report in Time Inc.'s ``Health''
magazine. Other foods making the top 10 because they are
consistently found to be protective in studies of diet-cancer
links, or because they represent families of known cancer-fighters
include tomatoes, oranges, garlic, tea, carrots and spinach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single most important thing most Americans can do is to
eat more fruits, vegetables and whole grains,'' says John Potter,
director of cancer prevention at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that a few simple changes in the way most
people eat could cut the risk of cancer in general by one-third,''
Potter says. ``For colon and lung cancers, the right foods could
slash the risk in half. Nothing else we know of, besides not
smoking, will make as big a difference in your cancer risk.'' &QL;

 WASHINGTON: ... Delahunt said.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Very few people have land titles,'' said Maria Ines Restrepo
Canon, director of the National Plan for Alternative Development.
``And those who do live in areas where there are no health clinics,
electricity, or schools. We prefer to find alternative development
for them. We don't put them in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt asked the base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jorge
Amor, about cracking down on paramilitary forces, who have a long
record of human rights abuses and of ties with the Colombian
military. ``Will you fight them?''
</P>
<P>
   Amor stiffened. ``If I am ordered to do it, I will do it,'' he
said. When Delahunt asked about the guerrillas, the commander
noticeably relaxed, but then made an observation that chilled
Delahunt:
</P>
<P>
   ``The FARC have borrowed many techniques from the Viet Cong,''
he said. ``They have paths just like the Ho Chi Minh Trail. You
can't find them in the jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt, the color drained from his cheeks, thanked the
commander as his party prepared to leave. Once in the air, the
congressman's large frame slumped against the plane window. The
comparison with Vietnam was deeply troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bottomless pit,'' he said, looking out at a driving
rain. ``We've got to be real careful and real thoughtful here.''
</P>
<P>
   He now had more questions than answers. But two hours later,
back at the Bogota military airport, he revived after a comment by
Ines, the alternative development director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to see how people live in the country,'' she said.
``The only alternative those people have is to grow illicit crops
or join the guerrillas. I don't know if General Trujillo shares my
view.''
</P>
<P>
   The general looked at her. ``Yes,'' he said finally, ``I
agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt's eyes widened. A Colombian general was on his side.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, the son of a children's book librarian and a US
general, is possessed with an air of certainty. ``I'm often
wrong,'' he has said more than once, ``but I'm never in doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   But he had reservations when President Clinton offered him the
job of drug czar more than four years ago. He was commander in
chief of the US Southern Command, then based in Panama, and he
loved the military life. Vietnam shaped him forever as an infantry
commander, leaving him with an indelible sense of duty to his
country and imbued with physical courage. In Vietnam, he was
wounded several times, including once when he almost lost the use
of his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never learned to duck. He gets wounded every time he's
around fire,'' said his father, who advised him to take Clinton's
offer. ``As an honorable man, you obey the commander in chief. I
told him, `You don't have much of a choice. If it comes out badly,
that's life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At about that time, McCaffrey also expressed doubts publicly
about the benefits of antidrug programs in Latin America, noting in
a speech to the Heritage Foundation in Washington that the supply
of drugs on the streets hadn't dropped because of interdiction
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past year, he has not publicly expressed a trace of
doubt about the Colombian plan. He has been at the forefront of the
administration's policy for a military solution to Colombia's drug
nightmare. More than once, he has been too far in front. Last fall,
for instance, he announced support for a billion-dollar-plus
package of antidrug funds before the White House had agreed to it.
That raised expectations in Colombia for a fast deal, and when no
proposal was forthcoming last year, Colombian President Andres
Pastrana suffered political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Little seems to deter McCaffrey, however. He travels constantly.
He works until 1 a.m. on a regular basis, relying on five hours of
sleep a night. His personal staff works nearly as long. And he has
established a comfortable office environment for himself, which is
to say a military culture.
</P>
<P>
   Time is measured on the military clock. Staffers write IPRs, the
interim progress reviews so favored in the service. McCaffrey
thinks of people as being commanders, line guys, or staff guys,
terms with military definitions. He barks orders. He penalizes
those who don't perform to his standards by not talking to them for
a month or more.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he also inspires awe because of his talent for
marshalling so many numbers and facts in his mind and his ability
to captivate audiences with forceful and colorful speeches that lay
out every detail of the complex problems in fighting drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to relish the Colombia fight. ``What I would suggest,''
he said in an interview, his right arm pumping to make the point,
``is these people are three hours flight away from us. There are a
bunch of them. They are important to our economy. They're a
democracy. My purpose is to reduce the drug threat to the American
people. But I would also argue that we would enhance the chance of
peace in doing this Colombia package.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey and other officials dismiss comparisons with Vietnam.
A senior official last month said American personnel would not be
endangered, adding that ``the blood shed will be (that of) the
Colombians.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said it is logical to support the Colombian military
effort. ``I don't believe there is any disagreement among
knowledgeable, serious people that if we are going to defend the
American public from a wave of cocaine and heroin coming out of
Colombia, we better stand with the Colombians on the Andean ridge
in the coming three years,'' he said. ``And we've got to say it
publicly so the peace process is more likely to work than not.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, McCaffrey was to testify on Colombia before a Senate
committee and then leave for a three-day trip to Colombia. He plans
to return to Washington with even more facts to support his case.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt, meanwhile, has been meeting regularly with Democrats
and Republicans to discuss amendments concerning human rights and
more money for alternative crops. He also may have a chance to
question McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met him,'' Delahunt said. ``I presume we'll meet
now.''

   A web site, Old-houses.com, recently featured this announcement:
``The Schoharie County Planning and Development Agency is offering
free, to a qualified individual who can relocate it, a
2,948-square-foot historic home/inn in Fulton, N.Y.'' At the Web
site Buildingmovers.com is another enticing offer: ``Small Hotel $1
Must Be Moved.'' And this message: ``Free House, You move it, you
own it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are logistical queries like ``How do you transport a
39-foot geodesic dome?'' or ``Can a log cabin be airlifted?''
</P>
<P>
   Once an oddity, house moving is gaining appeal, partly as a
result of advertising and publicity on the Internet and partly as a
result of some highly visible moves. Last year, for example, the
208-foot-tall lighthouse at Cape Hatteras, on the Outer Banks of
North Carolina, was moved half a mile on rails, back from the
water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be kind of a creative thing people did,'' said R.J.
Soens, a broker at the Avalon Real Estate Agency in New Jersey.
``Now, it has become an alternative for people that want a home but
don't have the economic means to buy one.''
</P>
<P>
   Or to buy the kind of home they want. Last October, Peter and
Sheila Hughes of Stone Harbor, N.J., were able to get a home way
out of their price range by moving it. The house cost only $1, and
in total, including a one-mile move and reconstruction costs, the
couple spent $100,000 for a five-bedroom house worth twice that.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Anderson, 37, a court reporter in Minco, Okla., ``didn't
want to go the mobile-home route,'' she said, so she bought 30
acres ``out in the boonies'' and acquired a house 14 miles away,
which she then moved.
</P>
<P>
   Even the house made famous by ``The Blair Witch Project'' can be
bought and moved. In the spring, the Maryland Department of Natural
Resources is expected to post an announcement asking for salvage or
relocation bids on the house, near Burkittsville, Md. (known
locally as the Griggs House).
</P>
<P>
   The decrepit Blair Witch House, made famous in the low-budget
movie last year, is no one's idea of a dream house. Nonetheless, a
filmmaker might want to snatch it up for a scarefest sequel, and
fans have been trying to remove the house piece by piece since the
film opened.
</P>
<P>
   Many houses are up for grabs because of the current building
boom. Hughes, the general manager of Atlantic Capes Fisheries Inc.,
got his home from a local businessman who wanted to build another
on the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that a house with a lot of character, rather than
being torn down, is being put to use by someone who can appreciate
it,'' said the former owner, who refused to give his name and
passed his comments along through Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   While demolition is still the norm, having a house moved off the
property can actually save a homeowner money, around $13,000 in
demolition costs for a large house.
</P>
<P>
   Often called ``house recycling,'' house moving can be an
environmentally helpful option for developers. Two years ago, for
example, when the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission built an
expressway that cut right through a residential area it owned in
Finleyville, it gave its renters the option of buying their homes
and moving them down the road and out of the expressway's path.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the apparent interest, it is hard to know just how many
people follow through with moving a house. For one thing, a house
move is a major undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing that can happen is you buy a house because it
looks great _ you say, `This is a terrific deal' _ and then realize
it is too wide to go down the street, you have to take down 600
power lines, and you can't get it under the bridges,'' said Robert
L. Williams, the author of ``Houses to Go: How to Buy a Good Home
Cheap'' (Breakout Productions, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   The most affordable moves involve short houses (i.e. ranch or
colonial-style matchboxes) or short distances. Regulations,
including permit requirements for highways and railroad crossings,
vary by state, making interstate travel a challenge. Among house
movers, Massachusetts is known for being the only state where there
is no charge for moving overhead wires. So many houses are on the
move on Nantucket, where there are few trees to get in the way,
that a local paper warns drivers of the routes they will take.
</P>
<P>
   A cross-country move is nearly impossible these days, unless
disassembly of the house is involved. David R. Dow, a professor at
the University of Houston Law Center, liked his house in Texas so
much he hoped to relocate it to Colorado. But, he said, ``I can't
make the move make economic sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Nontheless, improved hydraulics has made it much easier to
handle short-haul moves. (Not that the business is anything but
macho: the International Association of Structural Movers gives out
awards annually for tallest, longest and heaviest moves.)
</P>
<P>
   Members of the association spend much of their time lifting
houses or moving them back onto their foundations (after the
basements are pumped out), skills that were in demand last year in
regions that suffered hurricane and flood damage.
</P>
<P>
   A routine house move involves digging around the foundation,
cutting openings in the foundation walls, inserting steel beams and
jacking up the building. Dollies are shoved beneath the house, and
then a truck yanks it off its foundation and onto a flatbed
trailer. Once at its destination, the house is lowered onto a new
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the width of a planned route, the house is either
transported in sections or left whole. ``The biggest thing about
building movers is that they take great pride in being able to move
entire structures _ we really enjoy tight moves,'' said Kenneth D.
Jordan of Ellsworth, Maine., who once moved a Victorian house 90
miles on a barge.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of getting a whole house moved in one piece is not
having to pack any boxes. ``We tied the cabinets and fridge closed
with a string, took a couple pictures off the wall, and left the
cat sleeping in the computer chair,'' said Shelley Wain of
Finleyville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The cat was still sleeping when the house arrived at its new
location 500 yards away. Wain, 34, the owner of a crafts store, was
one of the renters who took the option offered by the Pennsylvania
Turnpike Commission to buy and move her home out of the new
expressway's path. She documented the move with a camera, then
posted the pictures on her Web site, along with a detailed text.

<P>
   Fitzgerald visited Jorge the next morning. He wasn't hiding his
pain. He was in withdrawal from heroin, chills running through his
body as he lay under covers in his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dying, man,'' he said, his eyes vacant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want to do?'' she asked, bending her 5-foot-10
frame and sitting down next to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of using drugs. I want to go into treatment. I tried
calling all day yesterday and I couldn't get through.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald made several calls and found a place for him in a
detox center. The two made arrangements for her to drive him there
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``How bad do you want to get clean?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do, I do, Brianne.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You better be here,'' she said. ``I'm counting on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hours after she left was when Jorge's friend appeared
with his gift of heroin. Jorge, 37, who asked to be identified only
by his first name, injected half of the heroin into his veins that
afternoon. ``I need some tough, tough love,'' he said, lighting up
a half-smoked Newport 100s cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   He used the last bit of heroin at 7:30 the next morning, an hour
before Fitzgerald arrived. ``When you're sick and going into detox,
you need something for the day you go,'' he said in her car,
explaining why he got high. ``Because you get really cranky and
frustrated if you don't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped to stay in treatment for at least several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is you need longer treatment,'' Fitzgerald told
him.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge said he wasn't sure he could do that. He said he needed to
help support his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't start to set up roadblocks, Jorge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They hugged each other goodbye at the center. ``I pray to God
I'll do good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald turned reflective as she drove away. ``I don't
envision myself doing this forever. I need a backup plan,'' she
said. ``We all need a backup plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of her frustrations were related to her patients; Amaral,
for instance, was calling her daily in despair. And, more
importantly, she has seen them time and again relapse into their
addictions, even when all signs pointed toward recovery. This is
her never-ending war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But the national priorities in the drug war also have had an
impact on her, especially with the emphasis on locking up addicts.
Nearly 1.6 million drug addicts were arrested nationwide in 1997
for a variety of crimes. That is up from 1 million in 1991. At the
same time, only 37 percent of hard-core addicts received treatment
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money we are spending fighting this war on drugs is a
joke. It's a bottomless pit,'' she said. ``I liken it to the
Vietnam War: We're doing it for years, and the casualties keep on
mounting. We put them in jail. That's how we kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald also believes the Colombian effort won't work.
``People just laugh at it,'' she said. Even if it did result in
driving up prices and reducing supply, she said it wouldn't drive
down the number of hard-core addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the price rose, the crime rate would rise. And somebody
would make a cheaper drug. The answer has to start locally,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her patients have been in and out jail. She saw two in
the course of two days: Lee Boone, 47, of Charlestown, wMass., ho
injected heroin into his groin so frequently that his veins
collapsed and he lost his right leg; and Billy Ketchum, 45, who
used drugs for 30 years, once working as a ``lieutenant'' in a
Colombian drug ring where he could earn $15,000 for four days of
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have shot up a million dollars worth of heroin,'' said
Ketchum, who now lives in a faith-based home for recovering addicts
in Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He closed his eyes and said with feeling: ``I used heroin as my
lover, there was no other. James Brown said he sold his wife for a
$5 bag. Well, I sold my life for a $2 bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone was overjoyed to see Fitzgerald, who in recent years
visited him in an active drug house, a risk that she shudders at
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saint Brianne!'' he exclaimed and motioned for her to sit in
his living room. He has been off heroin for five months, receiving
a daily dose of methadone in a clinic, a substitute addiction but
one that has allowed him to function on a much higher level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got something to show you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boone pulled out his wallet, and as his eyes welled up, he held
up an automatic teller card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I. . .have. . .a. . .bank. . .account,'' he said slowly as two
streams of tears fell from his chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee,'' she said, moving toward him, ``look at you!''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sudden, tender moment of joy. And a fleeting one.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Fitzgerald picked up Iayania Norwood, 23, a recovering
addict who first used crack cocaine with a family member, and the
two of them went to visit another patient, Cassander Johnson, 36.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had been refusing to attend a group therapy session with
other recovering addicts, and Fitzgerald feared she might relapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me very nervous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go. I'm OK. I just get bored,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Norwood challenged her: ``The liquor store's right up
the corner. You're going to go there, aren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right up the corner in fact,'' Johnson said, smiling.
``If I take a drink, I take a drink. I suffer the consequences. So
what?''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald grew angry: ``Last time you took a drink, what
happened? One of these times, Cassander, I'm not going to be there
to pick up the pieces. You're playing with fire. You won't stay
sober.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald put her head in hands. Now her eyes filled with
tears. Johnson wouldn't budge, and Fitzgerald said she would tell
people in Johnson's halfway house about her fears of a relapse.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson yelled at her: ``Why do that? I'm not even going to talk
to you now!''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald and Norwood left. ``This is what I hate about my
job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald needed a break. She went to dinner that night with
her Wellesley girlfriends. ``We were talking about waxing eyebrows,
menopause, all the girlfriend things,'' she said. ``It was nice. I
got an escape, and they live vicariously when I tell them my
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The following week, she learned she was wrong about Cassander
Johnson. She didn't relapse that weekend. Diane Amaral, meanwhile,
finally agreed to go to a hospital, where doctors are monitoring
the effects of different medications.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jorge, he remains in treatment. Two days after arriving
at the detox center, he sat in an empty cafeteria, which was set
for lunch with Lay's chips and Swiss creme sandwiches on white
plates. On the wall was an old window shade, on which was written
``The Twelve Steps,'' the famous recovery process.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 9 urges, in part, to ``make direct amends to people''
whom you have harmed. Jorge said he must make amends to his mother,
because he once stole her gold necklace, gold rings, and a bracelet
in order to buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Then he remembered another incident, on the Boston Common,
nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I snatched a pocketbook from a lady,'' he said, scratching a
several-day growth of beard. ``My friend grabbed her and threw her
to the ground. And I stomped her on the chest. I left my footprint
on her. I really hurt her. She finally let go of the pocketbook. We
ran right into police on horseback and were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at court, the lady said she didn't want to press charges.
I was shocked. I said to her, `I'm very sorry. I have a drug
problem.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``She said to me, `Get help.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge shook his head. ``It takes a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald walked in, plopping her Bottega bag next to Jorge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You going to stay in treatment?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm going to stay, Brianne,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better,'' she said.

<P>
   Wain is such a fan of house moving that she has made a video
showing two houses, including her own, being successfully moved.
She also shows what can go tragically wrong. A third house from the
Turnpike Commission's site collapsed into rubble, killing one of
the house movers. Still pictures of the moves and of the accident
are posted incongruously on Wain's Web site dedicated to
handicrafts (www.patternpage.com/house.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Movers themselves usually have three kinds of insurance:
general/public liability, auto liability and a cargo policy. If a
house does not survive the trip, the home owner does not have to
pay the movers but will probably still have to pay for any permits
or wire moving.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said his move, which involved slicing the house into a
top half and a bottom half, like a layer cake, was hard on his
nerves. (Even while the house was in pieces, he had to continue
paying the mortgage.) Then, after the house was dissected and
before it was moved to his property, it sat exposed to the wrath of
Hurricane Floyd. Miraculously, it was unharmed, he said, and the
pieces fit together perfectly when the two halves were reattached
on the new site.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Elliott of Monroe, Wash., was less fortunate. Her
deconstructed house was ``cut up so badly that it couldn't be put
back together again,'' she said. Eventually, half of it had to be
torn down. Two years later, Elliott, a systems manager at Boeing,
and her husband are still working with contractors to rebuild the
house. Yet, sometimes, disassembling a building is the only answer.
Peter Bickford, a banker who lives in East Harlem, had an 1860
Canadian barn reassembled on his property in East Hampton, N.Y., by
Steve Mack of Steven P. Mack Associates in Ashaway, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a bargain home is delivered in parts or whole, once on
site, it's essentially a shell. ``Basically, it's like building a
house,'' said Mary Jane Copeland, a graphic designer in her 30s.
All kinds of expenses she had never considered arose.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland bought a house in Bennett, N.C., in the central part of
the state, and moved it to Moncure, N.C., 40 miles away. The mover
offered her the house and the move in a package deal at a cost of
$15,000. But building a new foundation cost $5,000, putting in a
well cost another $5,000, clearing land was $2,000, putting in a
septic system $5,000, attic insulation $1,000, wiring another
$3,000 and so on.
</P>
<P>
   She secured a construction loan in advance, but that took some
shopping around. When she presented her proposal at one bank, the
loan officer ``started stuttering when I told him about it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one fringe benefit to house moving: the surreal
spectacle of seeing an entire house move down the road. As Hughes,
the New Jersey man who moved the five-bedroom house said, ``It's
just awesome.''

   PAINFUL VANITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether the latest trend is stiletto heels or platform soles,
women's feet seem to be at the mercy of fashion. But we pay a high
price for vanity, says Dr. John Early, assistant professor of
orthopedic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Of the people who have foot problems, 90 percent are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men don't usually suffer from this kind of foot discomfort,
because they refuse to wear uncomfortable shoes,'' says Early.
``Women, however, are willing to sacrifice their comfort for
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing high-heeled shoes for extended periods can result in
painful and sometimes debilitating foot and ankle problems;
cramming toes into narrow pointed-toe shoes can cause deformity;
and the constant friction of ill-fitting shoes causes corns and
calluses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-CANCER FOOD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strawberries, whole wheat, cabbage and beans are among the top
10 anti-cancer foods, says a new report in Time Inc.'s ``Health''
magazine. Other foods making the top 10 because they are
consistently found to be protective in studies of diet-cancer
links, or because they represent families of known cancer-fighters
include tomatoes, oranges, garlic, tea, carrots and spinach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single most important thing most Americans can do is to
eat more fruits, vegetables and whole grains,'' says John Potter,
director of cancer prevention at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that a few simple changes in the way most
people eat could cut the risk of cancer in general by one-third,''
Potter says. ``For colon and lung cancers, the right foods could
slash the risk in half. Nothing else we know of, besides not
smoking, will make as big a difference in your cancer risk.'' &QL;

   CHICAGO _ Melanie Loucks had furniture issues. Her roommate was
moving out of their two bedroom, two bath loft downtown and taking
all her Ikea foernitueren with her. That left Loucks, a 23-year-old
theater student at Columbia College here, with rooms to fill. On
the El, she had seen an advertisement for Crate &AMP; Barrel's new
younger, hipper sister store: CB2. So she went. This is what she
bought:
</P>
<P>
   One ``really neat'' metal bed frame, Loucks said. Matching night
stands. Three or four lamps. A kitchen table that folds out to seat
eight, three bookshelves, one of which she is using in the kitchen
for all the pots and pans she also got, a new chair for her little
office space, three nesting tables, a rolling file cart, two side
tables to go with the couch, a matching coffee table and ``tons of
candles and little stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The tab: about $2,000. Her mother supplied the plastic.
</P>
<P>
   There are 44 million shoppers like Melanie Loucks out there:
consumers age 20 to 34 with an estimated $125 billion to burn, not
to mention Mom and Dad's money. Some 50 percent of them are married
with children and 46 percent own their own homes, according to a
1998 Yankelovich Monitor survey.
</P>
<P>
   Crate &AMP; Barrel, Target, Williams-Sonoma and upstarts like
Furniture.com are waking up to these tantalizing statistics and
going after Generation Nest.
</P>
<P>
   They are introducing new divisions and hiring trendy designers.
They are gazing into their Magic 8 Balls for an answer to the most
vexing question about a demographic group that loves to buy but
hates to be sold:
</P>
<P>
   What do they want? Three things, at least: 1) cool, 2) cheap, 3)
nonparental. Does that narrow it down?
</P>
<P>
   ``We started for somebody really young,'' said Barbara Turf, who
began as a part-time sales clerk at Crate &AMP; Barrel in 1968 and is
now its president. But in recent years, she said, ``We left the
twentysomethings to shop at the Lechters and the Targets.'' Her own
22-year-old son would not shop there because he thinks of it as his
mother's store, and not just because she works there. Hence the
need for what fashion people call a bridge line. CB2 is to Crate &AMP;
Barrel what CK is to Calvin Klein, DKNY is to Donna Karan or
perhaps the best analogy, Old Navy is to the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Turf denies being influenced by the latter example _ a store so
successful it is now eating into sales of its parent company's
flagship stores. But Kurt Barnard, who owns a forecasting firm for
retail trends, said Crate &AMP; Barrel ``should pay royalties to Old
Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   CB2's 6,000 square feet stand on the north end of North Lincoln
Avenue. The store is in the middle of a middle-class neighborhood
with encroaching hipness _ sort of the Chicago equivalent of
putting a Kmart in Astor Place. But with parking. If CB2, which
opened last month, flies here, expect one in New York later this
year or early next.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of CB2 merchandise is for sale at the Crate &AMP;
Barrel on Madison Avenue. Manhattanites might be able to buy much
of the rest of it or its equivalent elsewhere, but not without
considerable cab or MetroCard expenditure. CB2 is one-stop
shopping, edited to essentials, from brightly colored extension
cords ($2.99) _ a big seller _ and plastic salad bowls ($7.99) to
that totem of the first apartment, the futon sofa ($999).
</P>
<P>
   With its wavy corrugated ceiling, pulsing techno music and
international airport-style signage, CB2 is skating on the thin ice
of self-consciousness. A photograph in a furniture trade magazine
posed models as a Gen-X squire in goatee, goofy fur hat and geek
glasses with his consort in front of the new store. Employees get
name tags printed daily with the date, weather and a quotation:
``There are no words in the dictionary that rhyme with orange,
purple or month.''
</P>
<P>
   But last Thursday the youngish browsers checking out its
design-y wares _ Italian tables, Chinese wall clocks, Canadian
trash bins _ in mod materials like plastic and rubber seemed
pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the use of colors,'' said Kevin Fischer, 32, a banker,
who came in with two friends from Champaign, Ill., for the day.
``It all looks like it would look great in a loft. It's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Amber Richards, who works in a vintage clothing store in
Champaign and was wearing a bright yellow '70s ski jacket, approved
of the ``new retro'' look. ``It's all nice and clean,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Ford, 31, who owns a record store in Champaign, was
looking for flatware but didn't see any she liked. None of the
three bought anything, but on his way out the door, Fischer said
two things: that the store had no bathroom for customers and ``I'll
be back for the bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another browser, Latoyna Humphrey, 29, offered this review:
``Target is better.''
</P>
<P>
   But Target is also trying to grab the eyes and wallets of
amateur decorators. Earlier this year, Target started carrying
ready-to-assemble pieces by Blu Dot, the Minneapolis-based makers
of neo-retro furniture. The collection includes an Ikea-like coffee
table, end tables and CD rack, from $25.99 to $79.99.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Target struck a deal with Philippe Starck
to design items ranging from a bicycle to clothing and furniture.
Anyone who wants her home to look like the lobby of an Ian Schrager
hotel will be able to in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Target's product line is catching up to its knowingly
hip ad campaign. Who would have thought Blu Dot and Target's red
dot would go together? To fit their designs into Target's lower-end
price point, Blu Dot used melamine panels instead of wood, said
Charlie Lazor, a Blu Dot designer and partner, and light boxes to
make the insides glow, ``because light is free.''
</P>
<P>
   Blu Dot is now working on a second, ``poppier and funkier''
collection for Target, Lazor said. He and his partner, John
Christakos, both in their mid-30s, are busily engaged in the
elusive business of figuring out what Xers want and need. As
Christakos said, ``That age group is throwing tradition to the wind
even more than our own.''
</P>
<P>
   One frequently bandied-about statistic asserts that 70 percent
of Americans between ages 20 and 30 move an average of once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to design things that can be used in lots of different
situations,'' Christakos said. ``They are more transient and more
design-savvy than we are. They've been exposed to much more
interesting visual things, from MTV to snowboarding and
skateboarding culture, and the graphics and design of that world.
They are more visually astute and demanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazor said of his generational juniors, ``Their cultural
landscape is media-derived, whereas ours may have been defined by
our parents' house or something we saw in a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be something in a music video,'' he said. ``Images
are flying around at such rapid speed now, and that's people's
reality, especially younger people.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Nomadic and mediacentric. No wonder the defining shelter
magazine for this generation is Wallpaper, whose pages present
furniture, travel and food in an archly modern design that is
anything but wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, possessions were purchased to last a lifetime
like jobs and marriages. Now, that seems as antiquated a notion as
cloth diapers. Plastic furniture is both portable and disposable.
But stylish.
</P>
<P>
   Inspecting CB2, Amber Richards put it this way: ``A few key
pieces people keep, but they change everything else. They change
with the rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes their ephemeral tastes that much harder to pin down.
Crate &AMP; Barrel said it did not rely on focus groups or market
research in developing CB2, but rather relied on its young buyers
or assistants as arbiters of cool.
</P>
<P>
   The rainbow of extension cords and translucent surge protectors
at CB2 are the opposite of the geezer attitude toward the coursing
veins of media life: Don't hide, flaunt.
</P>
<P>
   One reason this generation has been the neglected middle child
is its punyness next to the baby boom. Now, the echo boom. There
are 44 million Xers, versus 77 million boomers and almost as many
teen-age Generation Ys.
</P>
<P>
   One industry analyst, Jerry Epperson, of Wachovia Securities in
Richmond, Va., observed that until recently, as furniture buyers,
``the X'ers have been a disappointment, because there aren't that
many of them.'' He added: ``They're waiting longer to get married.
They typically have lower incomes than baby boomers did at the same
age. Their impact has been slower to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   That some of these erstwhile slackers are now cybermillionaires
may have something to do with the new eagerness to sell them coffee
tables. Sometime next year, Williams-Sonoma, which owns Pottery
Barn, will get into the X act with a division of stores to be
called Elm Street.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, home furnishings sales are only about
two-tenths of 1 percent of the total market, about $220 million
projected for 2000, said Michael May, an analyst at Jupiter
Communications, a New York Internet research firm. Expectations are
high.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, a group that includes Ronald Lauder and Carl
Levine, former head of the furniture department at Bloomingdale's,
will introduce a home furnishings Web site called
PoshandSticks.com. Michael Berman, a co-founder of George magazine,
will start a Web site in May whose purpose is to feather the first
nest fully, from how to get a cable modem to finding a futon sofa.
Berman said, ``There are a great many sites that sell furniture,
but none of them is skewed to this market.''
</P>
<P>
   The smart ones will stock up on bright yellow extension cords.

CHRISTOPHE PILLET   SEEKS   THE NEXT WAVE,   NOT A STAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Japan, Italy, France)  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Christophe Pillet has a dream that stretches like a
beach. And there's furniture in it. And the relaxation and ease of
the sea and the sky reside in the forms of the furniture, like the
sounds within shells. Pillet, a 40-year-old French designer,
studied at the National School of Decorative Arts in Nice, so he
could surf after classes.
</P>
<P>
   At his atelier apartment in the 11th Arrondissement, he
displayed a drawing of his dream, a design for an ideal home
commissioned by Interni, a Milanese magazine. He would like to
think that it is also part prediction: that objects like chairs and
sofas could have a resonance more important than their individual
design. In his drawing, furniture is a part of an environment of
natural elements like waterfalls and moving clouds and cultural
influences, too: from heroic architecture of the 1950s to James
Bond movies from the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see existing pieces of furniture,'' Pillet said, looking
at the paper, then at his living room. ``But they are part of the
perfume of this way of life, a way to imagine living it.''
</P>
<P>
   The designer said that a change in design is now arriving, based
in attitudes about objects, not the objects themselves: that design
will become less a question of style and what to live with, and
more an issue of how to live. Pillet, a student with the Memphis
group in the 1980s, then an assistant to Philippe Starck for four
years in the 1990s, thinks that the star system of design
celebrities like his mentors will change, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many objects,'' he said. ``What's the use of making
one more chair? We have millions of chairs, and among them, you
have thousands that are perfectly good. We have to propose a
different situation. A designer is no longer a specialist of
objects; he is a specialist of a way of living.
</P>
<P>
   He explained: ``These are big words, but for example, if you are
lazy, you have a very lounging atmosphere _ this is the concept of
the designer. You design objects that materialize this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pillet, who broke his leg in a motorcycle accident, sat talking,
his leg on a pillow. Two crutches rested like jousting sticks on an
Arne Jacobsen dining table. His mother, a handsome woman in a
yellow pullover, served tea in Chinese bowls. ``No, I'm not
interested in designing a better, better-looking pair of
crutches,'' he said. ``I just want them to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his prediction that modesty will prevail in the world of
design, Pillet is the leading French member of the global band of
furniture and product designers in their 30s and 40s _ including
Tom Dixon, Jasper Morrison and Constantin Gricic _ who are
influential in setting the styles in furniture and product design
right now, because their names have pulled down the big contracts
with the companies that will show them off at big spring shows like
the Milan Furniture Fair in April. Pillet has been asked to design
shoe shops in Italy, eyeglasses in Japan, a chain of carwashes
throughout Europe and the next generation of microwave ovens for
Whirlpool, whose market includes 170 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Pillet's ``Sunset Lounge,'' a subtly curved settee that looks
like the cool smile after sex, was used as the icon of the
International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York in May 1999.
He is also one of ``Starck's Kids,'' as he called himself in a 1999
book of the same name, written with Pascale Cassagnau. Pillet, by
profession prepared to reinvent anything, including history, said
he believed that there was life, even interest, after the
flamboyant Starck, whose surrealistic spin on the everyday object
has led the public's thinking on design for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My admiration for him is more his comportment,'' he said.
``Starck revolutionized the state of mind of design, more than the
inner quality of the objects. He turned it into a glamorous star
system. But when I think, among all the objects he produced, there
is not much you can remember, historically.''
</P>
<P>
   If Starck's witty tools become curious artifacts rather than the
household language of design, it is because the world is changing,
Pillet said, and with it a new acceptance toward design. The light
of day would dim the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The structure and mentality of design is changing very, very
fast,'' he said, ``because design is now very linked with music,
with fashion and with everyday culture, globally.'' Pillet said a
new generation was creating a new audience for it, and consuming it
differently. ``In the past, design was really an independent
cultural territory, with a social value, of having money, of having
taste, to show who you were,'' he said. ``Now, it's very
mainstream. You have design everywhere. It's normal. It's Nikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jones, head of global product design for Whirlpool,
asked Pillet to work on the Macrowave project, which he said
involves redesigning and repositioning the microwave oven as an
appliance for ``Gen Y and echo boomer consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a completely different approach, to get a different
design outcome, for a different generation,'' Jones said. ``I
wanted to tap into designers who were up-and-comers, not household
names we could have gone to, like Michael Graves. Christophe fit
that definition. When you get into the echo boomers and Gen Y, the
star-designer philosophy is more of a negative than a positive. In
fact, it's a negative in spades. It was important to go to someone
like Pillet.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Pillet said that it was his laziness that provoked him
into attending design school, he has distilled his thinking into
several durable pieces of design. The ``Sunset Lounge''; ``Agatha's
Dream,'' a breeze-shaped wooden chaise; and a new sofa, ``Nat's
Sofa,'' introduced at the Paris Furniture Fair in January, which in
its irreducible parenthetical profile encompasses most of the 20th
century in French furniture design, could be classics. Pillet's
commissioned collections have stayed at the higher end of the
market with few exceptions and are popular with cognoscenti, not
general consumers. ``Sunset Lounge'' is $1,908; Cappellini, its
manufacturer, has sold 24 at its New York store in eight months _
brisk sales for contemporary design, it said. The ``Terrace
Chair,'' designed for a bar in Paris, is $120 and is produced in
the thousands. (MORE) nn

PARIS: in the thousands.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The interest in ambience and the integration of various design
disciplines is not incidental to the young French cultural scene
right now.
</P>
<P>
   The new French pop music, or the ``French new wave,'' which with
its 1960s sleek movie-score production pastiches is making its mark
internationally in clubs, fashion shows and music videos, is a
phenomenon that involves style from several spheres. Part slacker,
part science fiction, with its nylon uniforms, crushable hats and
moon-goggle glasses, it is a look as much as a sound, featured in
new magazines like Self Service, which features both _ a fact not
lost on younger designers like Pillet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sampling, to assemble music, is very close to what I do,''
Pillet said, speaking of how he layers his design with influences
that include comic strips and cocktail lounges, rather than direct
historical references.
</P>
<P>
   The CDs in his apartment included a compilation of Astrid
Gilberto, the Brazilian bossa nova diva whose warm, flat voice
might have suggested the low wave and samba-like rhythm of
``Agatha's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of broad humor or desire for happiness, like a walk on
the beach, could prove more professionally powerful than ironic
statements or wit in new design. It is not an accident that the
Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris is rediscovering Jean Royere,
the king of court jesters in French 1940s design, whose
cartoon-balloon furniture and interiors lent a light heart and
luxury to even the Shah of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Or that Pillet, who has never designed a car, is designing a
chain of fast-food-style carwashes instead, called ``Blue
Elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really fun,'' he said, excited about the new
assignment, imagining a world de-dramatized by design, rather than
the reverse. ``It's like a cross between architecture and
dispensers.''

Israeli attacks on civilian Lebanese targets. Americans were just
beginning to feel welcome in Beirut again, but this harkens back to

   AUSTIN, Texas _ He can't sleep. It's 5:30 on another morning
when there's not a reason in the world for Odis Axel to be awake,
and yet there he is. Habit, he nods. One day, he's a working man, a
cab driver, on the job for more than 50 years. Then _ it seems to
surprise even him _ he retires. After a half-century of rising
before first light crept across the skies, Axel has a chance to
rest. He doesn't quite want it. He's been retired a short time now,
his driveway empty of his cab, Austin Cab Co. No. 48, and it still
doesn't seem right. ``Let me tell you something crazy,'' Axel
begins, hands slapped on both ears, head down. ``I got up one
morning and got my shirt on and _ I always make my coffee _ and I
got a cup of coffee. And I went to the door and said, 'Where's my
cab?!''' His 73-year-old shoulders quiver with his laughter.
``Yeah, I miss it.'' American society in these high-tech boom days

that approximately 10 billion doughnuts are consumed in the United
States annually. That's enough doughnuts for every man, woman and
child in the United States to eat three dozen a year. (Do you
digest your share annually, or is someone making up for your
inadequacy?) There's an adage that defines the basic philosophy of
life in terms of a simple breakfast pastry. Look at a doughnut. See
the hole? You're a pessimist. See the dough? You're an optimist.
It's simple. To the point. No room for waffling. That's the beauty
of doughnuts: You either focus on the central void or you are
riveted on the glorious, glaze-encrusted circle of soft dough that
yields its sweet yeasty pleasures bite by bite. Doughnuts. Life.
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference. (Rice, Austin

&HT;     DIRECTOR OF `MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE' WANTS PEOPLE TO LAUGH AT HIS
NEW FLICK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ John Frankenheimer can fill three dozen bagsful
with the hum and bumble of life and have enough left over to throw
on top of the bed and roll around in, laughing hard.
</P>
<P>
   The director of ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' ``Birdman of
Alcatraz,'' ``Grand Prix,'' ``Black Sunday'' and his latest, the
crime film ``Reindeer Games,'' has worked with Burt Lancaster,
Ingrid Bergman, Sir John Gielgud and Richard Burton. He has rubbed
racing elbows with Phil Hill and Dan Gurney. He filmed Robert
Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. He watched three generations
of the best and worst of Hollywood come and go. And he was close to
being crushed by a train and a race car and came out on the other
side, ready for more.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer, who turned 70 on Saturday, knows he will be most
often connected to ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' a film listed on
every best-of-the-century poll taken of American movies.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked 10th among the world's best movies by the American Film
Institute, it drew praise from Rolling Stone: ``The Manchurian
Candidate'' is described as ``much more than a paranoid thriller
about brainwashing ... it's a sharp satire of political extremism,
a workout for Frankenheimer's kinetic gifts and a showcase for the
best performances that Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey and a
devastating Angela Lansbury ever gave onscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Manchurian Candidate'' has been called Frankenheimer's one
shining moment, and in a phone interview from Los Angeles he said,
``They're still saying that. I guess it's nice. Most people never
get to make one like that, but I've had more than one shining
moment. `The Train,' `Black Sunday,' `French Connection II,' I
could go on and on. That wasn't my whole career, by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer said he has tried to bring his eye and ear to the
movies, a brand of directing he once described as
``semi-documentary hyper-realism. Basically, it's a wide-angle lens
with a big head in the foreground and a depth of focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer, who grew up in New York, was only 32 when he
directed ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' but ``I'd done 152 live
television shows by then, working with a tremendous number of
talented people,'' he said. ``I felt very comfortable doing
`Candidate.' I didn't feel intimidated or overawed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie came out in 1962, one year before President John F.
Kennedy was killed. Because the plot involved an assassination
attempt on a presidential candidate, Sinatra and Frankenheimer _
they co-produced the film _ agreed to take the movie out of
circulation, keeping it from the public eye until 1989. To have one
of his best works unseen for so many years was something he was
willing to accept
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody would've wanted to see it, all those years it was out
of circulation, anyway. I don't think it affected my career, one
way or the other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer said he has had more than his share of top actors
to work with, but given four names at random (Fredric March,
Sinatra, Burt Lancaster and Gary Sinise) Frankenheimer singled out
March and Sinise as a cut above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fredric March was a great actor, and Gary Sinise has it,
too,'' Frankenheimer said of his star in ``Reindeer Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster and Sinatra ``were very good, but (March and Sinise)
bring so much to the role. They do things you just didn't think
were possible. They're three notches above anybody else. Robert De
Niro does that. Angela Lansbury did that in `Manchurian
Candidate.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sinise, playing a larcenous, somewhat stupid and honestly evil
truck driver in ``Reindeer Games,'' ``is one of the best actors
I've ever worked with in my life,'' Frankenheimer said. ``His part
in `George Wallace' ... that was so unforgettable, so visceral. He
raises the bar whenever he walks on the set.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games'' also features Charlize Theron and Ben
Affleck, who seems too good-looking to play a convict. There's a
sense of ``Huh?'' when Affleck's unmarked, smiling face appears in
prison next to womply, razored lifers, but Frankenheimer defended
the casting choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Ben Affleck for that role, very badly. Why the hell
would you want to put some ugly guy in there? I wanted to see a
young Jimmy Stewart in that part, someone women and men could
relate to, not some hardened criminal. Burt Lancaster played
convicts, you know, and he was a hell of a lot better looking. And
Tyrone Power, probably the best-looking man who ever lived, played
convicts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games,'' Frankenheimer's 28th film, was written by
Ehren Kruger. There are plenty of twists and turns as a bunch of
low-lifes bully Affleck into helping them with a mid-winter casino
heist. ``I just loved the script,'' Frankenheimer said. ``I thought
it was smart. I never saw any of that stuff coming. I loved the
dialogue, and I loved those characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer also liked the gallows humor of the movie, which
leaves people laughing in the darkest parts, even as blood hits the
screen. ``The difference between this and `Manchurian Candidate'
was that people didn't know if it was OK to laugh,'' the director
said. ``I blamed myself in '62 _ I wanted people to laugh. Well, I
got it right this time. Here, it's OK to laugh.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ He can't sleep. It's 5:30 on another morning
when there's not a reason in the world for Odis Axel to be awake,
and yet there he is. Habit, he nods. One day, he's a working man, a
cab driver, on the job for more than 50 years. Then _ it seems to
surprise even him _ he retires. After a half-century of rising
before first light crept across the skies, Axel has a chance to
rest. He doesn't quite want it. He's been retired a short time now,
his driveway empty of his cab, Austin Cab Co. No. 48, and it still
doesn't seem right. ``Let me tell you something crazy,'' Axel
begins, hands slapped on both ears, head down. ``I got up one
morning and got my shirt on and _ I always make my coffee _ and I
got a cup of coffee. And I went to the door and said, 'Where's my
cab?!''' His 73-year-old shoulders quiver with his laughter.
``Yeah, I miss it.'' American society in these high-tech boom days
boasts of 28-year-old retirees, millionaires thanks to computer
tasks most of us little understand. But the work of putting foot to
accelerator, hand to steering wheel, car onto street _ that we know
well. (Daniel, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

 0224-COX &HT;    Wrestling grapevine
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ric Flair pulled his name from consideration for the
governorship of North Carolina. According to published reports,
Flair said professional and family responsibilities would keep him
from pursuing his dream. Flair, 50, has a $2 million, three-year
contract with WCW, which is owned by Time-Warner. ``There are a lot
of family issues. I can't work for Time-Warner and earn a living as
a wrestler and have success if I run for governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Flair also was in the limelight at Sunday's ``Superbrawl''
pay-per-view. His brutal match with Terry Funk was the equal of
their classic 1989 match and was the highlight of an above average
WCW show. Given the strange events of last week _ Scott Hall being
held in Germany because flight officials would not let him board
the plane _ stranger things may be afoot after the pay-per-view.
Hall took part in the main event finale with Jeff Jarrett and Sid
Vicious. At the end of the match he was hit over the head with a
guitar by Jarrett and then powerbombed by Vicious. After the match,
he lay on the mat for nearly 30 minutes while EMTs worked on what
appeared to be an injured neck. Rumors were hot this week that
Hall, who has reportedly undergone drug and alcohol conseling in
the past, would be fired. The neck injury, if not real, could
provide the two sides with a chance to cool off and for Hall to try
and get his problems under control. If it is real, it will put
another high-priced character on the WCW sidelines (Bret Hart,
Sting, etc.). WCW reportedly lost $10 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Money trouble is one reason WCW doesn't want to get involved
with Chris Candido and Tammy Sytch. The duo has had a long history
of substance problems, the latest bout resulting in a suspension
from ECW. After appearing at a February ``Nitro,'' Candido and
Sytch were not allowed in to the Feb. 14 ``Nitro'' because they
could not produce documents that said they were no longer employed
by ECW.
</P>
<P>
   WCW recently had to eat crow when Sabu's ECW contract was found
to be valid, a week after WCW announced it had signed him. Oops.
</P>
<P>
   Luna Vachon is out looking for work. She was fired for a second
time by WWF after attacking a WWF employee. Vachon was fired the
first time after a fight with Sable and Mark Mero while they taped
interviews for the ``St. Valentines Day Massacre'' pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   Headed for the unemployment line could be ECW announcer Joel
Gertner. He has burned most of his bridges with his poor attitude
and work ethic. If they wanted to put more money into it, Cyrus
would be a great replacement, but he'll have to be flown in from
Canada for the shows.

FROM SWEET TO SELFISH: GIRLS INTERPRETED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a meeting to discuss Oscar coverage, some Life &AMP; Arts
staff members decided that we should do a week-by-week look at the
Big Six categories: Best Picture, Best Director and the four acting
categories. We decided to start with the ``lowest'' award, but
there was some debate as to which award that might be. On the
official Academy Awards Web site (www.oscar.com), the acting awards
take precedence over director. We decided, however, that Best
Director is more important than the supporting-acting awards. Which
is why we're starting with Best Supporting Actress.
</P>
<P>
   The irrational subjectivity of that becomes clear when you
realize what a strong field this year's Best Supporting Actress
nominees comprise.
</P>
<P>
   Empathy played well in this category. Toni Collette is supremely
empathetic as the troubled mother of a haunted little boy in ``The
Sixth Sense.'' It was a pleasant surprise to see the academy
recognize this, since she was upstaged by co-star (and co-nominee)
Haley Joel Osment and by the movie's twist ending. Samantha Morton
earned a nod for her performance as a sweet, mute woman who puts up
with a jazz guitarist who takes her for granted in ``Sweet and
Lowdown;'' because she's the only person who can't interrupt his
motor-mouthed self-absorption, she's actually able to see through
to his pain. And Chloe Sevigny, the type of actress who always
looks as if she's lost in a pleasant daydream, is touching as a
woman who falls for an impostor in ``Boys Don't Cry'' _ and, once
the ruse is revealed, remains committed because she knows that the
emotions remain real.
</P>
<P>
   The other two nominees provide a flip side to the empathy, with
Angelina Jolie and Catherine Keener as women who are looking out
only for themselves in, respectively, ``Girl, Interrupted'' and
``Being John Malkovich.'' Jolie walks away with ``Girl,
Interrupted'' as a sociopath whose charm and mischievous nature
belie a cold-hearted cruel streak. Keener was first among equals in
``Malkovich's'' ensemble as a scheming woman who finds a way to
take advantage of just about anything _ including a passageway
inside a character actor's head.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie and Keener have shown plenty of range in the past year,
each playing more selfless women (Jolie in last spring's ``Playing
by Heart,'' Keener in the current ``Simpatico'') who end up
benefiting from their selflessness. And each, having risen up from
the ranks of premium-cable TV (Jolie) and independent films
(Keener), has more familiarity than the competition. Collette and
Sevigny also have some indie-film cred, but Keener is a busier,
more versatile actress. Morton, despite having a few movies under
her belt, is more of an unknown _ but she's in a Woody Allen movie,
and Allen's movies have historically done well in this category.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's a wide-open race, Jolie would appear to have the
edge, having come off a Golden Globe win for ``Girl, Interrupted.''
Having an Oscar-winning pedigree _ dad Jon Voight won in 1978 for
``Coming Home'' _ can't hurt. She's my bet for who'll take home the
statue, but if I were able to vote, I'd pick Sevigny, who gives a
heart to the otherwise dark and mean ``Boys Don't Cry.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ At first, one might mistake him for an
ordinary professor, quietly ambling into class in a tweed blazer,
stepping casually behind the podium and adjusting his wire-rimmed
spectacles to peruse the syllabus patiently while his students'
chatter slows to a hush.
</P>
<P>
   He distributes a group of photocopies and, with a friendly but
earnest ``OK, guys, let's get started,'' the distinguished
52-year-old begins his lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Just like any ordinary professor.
</P>
<P>
   But most ordinary professors don't make slasher movies.
</P>
<P>
   John Carpenter, director of horror movies like ``Halloween'' and
sci-fi flicks like ``Escape From New York,'' is currently teaching
a class on movie violence to 145 film students at the University of
California Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Reality: Violence and Sexuality in Film'' is a frank,
10-week look at how sex and violence are used in movies, how they
are perceived by audiences and why some groups would like them
eliminated from modern films.
</P>
<P>
   ``This class is important because you guys have got to think
about what's going to happen if they start censories,''
Carpenter told students during a recent Monday night lecture, ``and
if that's the kind of world you want to live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter isn't the first big-screen bigwig to teach a course at
the university _ Billy Wilder and Frank Capra are rumored to have
taken to the podium years ago _ but he's the first in a long time.
He accepted the job after receiving an invitation in January from
the chairwoman of the film studies department, Constance Penley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues of violence and sexuality in the media are very much on
the public agenda,'' Penley said. ``I thought that our students
could learn a great deal from someone who has lived these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As the maker of creepy thrillers like ``Christine,'' ``The
Fog,'' ``The Thing'' and, more recently, the gory ``Vampires,''
Carpenter has often been called upon to defend his choices, and
does so without shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``His films are violent, they are popular, they are critically
admired,'' said Penley, who confesses to being a huge fan. ``John
Carpenter is the master at taking these genres that you think have
been done to death and making them completely fresh and
aesthetically exciting and socially provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   Film students agree. Carpenter's class, a late addition that
wasn't even on the university's printed schedule, filled up in just
a few days, and about 60 students were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Gentile, a 24-year-old film major, had high expectations
when he signed up for the course, and he hasn't been disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're next-generation filmmakers,'' he said of his classmates,
``and this is an issue we need to bring out on the table and
discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   And discuss they do. Though Carpenter has made a name for
himself creating the kinds of films that censorship proponents want
hacked to bits, in class the director wants to show both sides of
the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a gigantic bent, but I'm not going to teach it that
way,'' said Carpenter, a first-time teacher who attended film
school at the University of Southern California. ``I want to
present the issues in a way that the students think them through
and they don't just take my side, the filmmaker's side, because
it's cool. I want them to think for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter has fired up class discussions about filmmakers'
responsibilities, the First Amendment, copycat crimes, the
Columbine High School massacre and the Hays Code and Legion of
Decency, ethics guides from the 1920s and '30s that condemned the
depiction of ``sympathy for criminals,'' ``lustful kissing'' and
other so-called vulgarities in motion pictures.
</P>
<P>
   He even brought in a study that claimed prolonged exposure to
violent images creates antisocial behavior, and argued _ almost
convincingly _ that the media is entirely to blame for the problems
of today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, there's a crime wave in the '90s,'' he
shouted at the students, adding that he was even afraid to be in
the room with some of them, who have seen way too much sex and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Though his argument evoked giggles, it also provoked thought,
with several students questioning the science behind the study and
challenging him to turn off the television if he doesn't like what
he sees. Some even booed him _ a response Carpenter endorses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day of class, we were hurling cliches at each
other,'' he later admitted, ``and I said that if I used the word
`desensitized,' I wanted them to boo me.''
</P>
<P>
   Penley has attended a few of the classes and calls Carpenter's
teaching style brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very low-key, but he knows how to play devil's
advocate,'' she said. ``It's clear that he has opinions on violence
and sexuality in film, but he doesn't hit you over the head with
his opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Film major Jaclyn Barber, 20, likes the way he randomly asks
students for their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very personal,'' she said. ``You don't feel intimidated
even though he's a director.''
</P>
<P>
   But like any college class, there are students who just don't
take the bait, no matter how engaging the instructor or subject
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are back there talking about their days,''
Carpenter said. ``They're different than the kids when I was going
to college. We had an idealism that they don't have. Students today
are very cynical, and that cynicism is something that has to be
overcome to get you to think.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the students will earn grades in the course with a
six-page essay explaining the reasons for and against censoring
movies, and stating their opinion on the matter. To help them form
an opinion, Carpenter is screening several controversial and
intriguing films during the class, including ``Crash,'' ``Fight
Club,'' ``Natural Born Killers'' and ``In the Realm of the
Senses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to talk about my movies because there's not
much to say about them,'' Carpenter said. ``They are what they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The students jumped into a discussion last week about ``good
violence'' versus ``bad violence.''
</P>
<P>
   To jump-start the debate, Carpenter showed the gut-wrenching
opening sequence from Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' in
which soldiers storm the beach at Normandy, followed by a scene
from Quentin Tarantino's ``Reservoir Dogs'' in which a police
officer is gruesomely tortured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the violence itself, it's the context it's put in and
who you identify with,'' Carpenter said, pointing out that
Spielberg goes to great lengths to make his violence palatable,
whereas Tarantino doesn't bother.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know war is violent, right?'' he said. ``So this
violence is OK. It's very difficult to think of Tom Hanks as
someone who's evil. He's such a nice guy. He's got nice teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Levity aside, censorship is an issue Carpenter takes seriously _
and one he has thought a lot about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anyone to impede on my ability to make horror,''
he said. ``But if any of us directors really believed the work we
put on screen would cause someone to kill somebody? We'd stop it in
a heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, who is currently preparing a horror movie that he
will film this summer, finds teaching a welcome change from the
rigors of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making movies is not fun,'' he said. ``It's working like a
coal miner. This is a lot more fun.''

PLOT TWIST TURNS BROWN ESTATE INTO ZINFANDEL BEST   SELLER

   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Deneen Brown says books and wine have one
big thing in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never read all of the good books or taste all of the
great wines,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Since the release last fall of Brown Estate Vineyards' first
wine _ a 1996 Napa Valley zinfandel _ Brown has had little time to
enjoy a favorite pastime: cozying up by the fireplace and enjoying
a good book. And things have only been busier since the 1997
zinfandel generated major buzz at the Zinfandel Advocates and
Producers (ZAP) tasting in San Francisco last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually focus on Sonoma for great zinfandels, but when I
first tasted the Brown Estate a couple of weeks before ZAP, I was
really blown away by the luscious berry and pepper flavors,'' says
Les Ferguson, wine consultant at Traverso's gourmet market in
Sonoma County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson says he immediately ordered the wine, and since the ZAP
tasting has seen what few bottles of it he could obtain fly off the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of locals who went to the tasting have been calling
trying to get their hands on the wine,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Shewbridge, a San Francisco Bay Area civil engineer,
attended the ZAP event and came away with a new brand to add to his
zinfandel shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was particularly impressed with the two offerings from Brown
Estate _ the 1996 and 1997 zinfandels,'' Shewbridge says. ``I found
the 1997 to have a nice red-fruit, spicy zinberry character, with a
bit of tannin and some residual sweetness on the finish. The 1996
also showed spicy red fruits with black pepper and a slight green
herb component that I thought added character.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown Estate has fans on the production side of the business as
well. Monticello Vineyards owners Jay and Kevin Corley, who buy
grapes from the Browns, praise the quality of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that we found when we made wine from their
grapes was the strong jammy fruit and spice flavors we got,'' Jay
Corley says. ``The aromas of the wine in the barrels are

   Other well-known producers who buy grapes from the Brown Estate
include Green &AMP; Red Vineyards, Grgich Hills Cellar, Vineyards,
T-Vine Cellars and D-Cubed Cellars. In fact, D-Cubed's Duane Dappen
is the winemaker for the Brown Estate wine.
</P>
<P>
   Only 700 cases each of the 1996 and 1997 Brown zins were made.
Some is available from the winery (located in Chiles Valley, an
appellation-designated area in eastern Napa Valley), Deneen says,
although allocation is limited. The suggested retail price is $20.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 vintage debuted in Northern California this month. A
few cases will be available in Southern California on March 2. More
will roll out in New York and New Jersey in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from all over the country who have heard about it or
tasted it in restaurants or at ZAP are calling wanting to buy a
case,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Deneen's brother, David, who manages the vineyard, says there
will be 1,100 cases of the 1998 vintage, which is set for release
Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have 1,100 cases for the 1999 vintage, too,'' he says,
``and then we hope to go up to 2,000 cases for the 2000 vintage.
But I doubt we'll get much bigger than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Deneen and David's parents, Bassett and Marcela Brown, bought
the property in 1981 after a family friend told them about its
availability. (Beside the home and surrounding 450 acres of land,
the property also boasts a wood and stone barn that the family is
eager to renovate.)
</P>
<P>
   The Browns had been hunting for property for several years
starting in the late 1970s, Deneen recalls, and even returned to
Jamaica for a year, where her father was born, in hopes of finding
property there to farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father had this idea for a long time that he wanted to buy
a farm to have something the whole family would be a part of,'' she
says, smiling. ``When we went to Jamaica, he thought it would be
good to get a farm there, but the political situation at the time
didn't favor us buying property.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown returned with his family to Los Angeles and resumed his
career as a physician.
</P>
<P>
   A teen at the time, Deneen says that after her father purchased
the Napa Valley property, she told school friends she was going to
be a winemaker. `They kind of gave me weird looks, but that's
really what I wanted to do,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Growing grapes and making wine was not initially what her father
had in mind for a family business, she says. Bassett saw at best a
small family farm. However, he knew the land was ideally suited for
growing grapes since it was located in Napa Valley. So grape
growing became a family affair that initially started on weekends,
holidays and vacations.
</P>
<P>
   The first grapes were planted in 1985. Today 37 acres are
devoted to zinfandel, 8.5 acres to cabernet sauvignon and 4.5 acres
to chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't as focused as Deneen,'' says David about the
launching of the vineyard project. ``When I graduated from high
school I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life. I came out
to the ranch and got involved in the planting.''
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of years of working the vineyards, David decided
to go to college, where he studied behavioral science and minored
in biology and chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farthest thing from my mind was the vineyards,'' he said,
``but by the time I graduated I really wanted to return to the
country. To wake up and walk outside and be at work is a great
life.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Deneen, the winery grew from a part-time hobby to a
full-time job soon after she graduated from UC Berkeley. Over time,
she added responsibilities to her list of things to do. Today she
says she is the official ``marketing-public
relations-bookkeeping-scheduler-vineyard helper'' for Brown Estate.
</P>
<P>
   A sister, Coral, is expected to join her siblings in the future
in a winemaking or production capacity. Mother and father help out,
too, on their frequent visits from Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are a close-knit family and the wine business lends
itself to it,'' Deneen says. ``We've all been involved in
developing the property _ from vineyard planting to restoring the
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Working in an industry that's predominately white, the family
has never seen race as an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a family I really believe could do just about anything
it sets its minds to doing,'' Dappen says. ``They've taken a
weekend project and turned it into a full-time winery.''
</P>
<P>
   Dappen agreed to work with the family when the Browns decided to
make their first wine. ``With the grapes they grow, you get more of
the powerful cherry and black cherry flavors rather than the cherry
and raspberry flavors you normally get from other Napa Valley
zinfandels,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another buyer of Brown Estate's grapes shares Dappen's respect
for the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really good people to work with,'' says Green &AMP; Red
Vineyards owner/winemaker Jay Hemingway. ``One of the big pluses is
the keen interest David takes as a farmer. As a negotiator, David
appraises his fruit realistically and is one grower who pulls no
surprises on you.''
</P>
<P>
   David is also planning to expand plantings in 2000 but hasn't
decided exactly how much or what varieties will be next. It will
likely include more zinfandel.
</P>
<P>
   David also says he will look at what it is going to take to
restore the barn. ``Wouldn't it be great as our future winemaking
facility?'' he asks.

STAY FAR AWAY FROM `THE CLOSER YOU GET'
</HEADLINE>

(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 1 1/2 stars

<TEXT>
<P>
   The people at Fox Searchlight Pictures seem to see the British
Isles as a haven for cute, cuddly, cartoonish men who want nothing
more than to be loved _ or win the lottery. Up until now, these
movies _ ``The Full Monty'' and ``Waking Ned Devine'' _ have been
charming, crowd-pleasing diversions, full of warmth, wit and boozy
good cheer.
</P>
<P>
   But the formula wears a bit thin with the studio's latest
effort, ``The Closer You Get,'' a flimsy bit of whimsy about a
bunch of Irish losers who aren't so much lovable as they are
irritating. Everybody in this movie strains so hard to be cute that
it's surprising the filmmakers didn't bring in talking animals or
dancing babies and make it even more twee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what we have is a group of annoying Irishmen, united in
their bachelorhood, their flabbiness and their thorough lack of sex
appeal. Still, some of the women in their remote, northern coastal
town find these bloated blokes appealing, but the men (being men)
are oblivious to the signals being sent. They sit in the pub, drink
their Guinness and pine for true love.
</P>
<P>
   One day, the boys decide to do something about the absence of
passion (not to mention sex) in their lives. They place a
classified advertisement in the Miami Herald, inviting single
American women, preferably beautiful, ages 20 to 21, to join them
for their annual St. Martha's Day dance. Once the dance is over,
they'll head to the church and tie the knot.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, once the town's women learn about the men's
end-around, relations between the sexes become a bit frosty. They
even decide to take up with some foreigners of their own, the
Spanish musicians who arrive to play at the dance. The third act
leads down the well-trodden, predictable road implied by the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Closer You Get'' certainly has the potential for cuteness,
but BBC veteran screenwriter William Ivory delivers mostly
repetitive, dull situations. It's not much fun watching a bunch of
mopes who don't realize the truths that the audience long ago
discovered. First-time filmmaker Aileen Ritchie's wooden direction
doesn't help much, either.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble _ headed by Ian Hart and made up of Irish and
English stage veterans and a few unknowns _ is appealing enough,
but it hardly matters. If you met these characters in a pub, you'd
find another place to drink. Meet them in a theater and you'll need
a belt or two just to dull the pain. &QL;

&HT;     TROUBLED TEENS GET A HARSH LOOK AT LIFE IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN QUENTIN, Calif. _ First stop: the dungeon. It hasn't been
used in decades, but the message is clear. Repent and reform.
</P>
<P>
   Next, a walk through the ``lower yard,'' a large, scraggly
exercise field where dozens of inmates pump iron, shoot hoops and
jeer _ loudly and profanely.
</P>
<P>
   Time now for the gantlet, a tour of one of the prison's housing
units.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets ugly in here,'' said Julius Domantay, 40, who has
spent the last 23 years incarcerated for slaying a San Francisco
liquor store owner. He's a lifer at the San Quentin state prison
but like the other inmates involved in a special program called
Squires, he is trying to make amends by steering young people away
from the mistakes he made.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekend, more than a dozen inmates like Domantay
counseled about 50 young men and women, some of them gang members,
some involved in petty offenses, a few intractable ones seemingly
destined for their own prison cell down the road. But this is the
day to set them all straight, to jar these teen-agers out of
juvenile delinquency by giving them a glimpse of the oppressive
world behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Through the ancient portal of South Block they move. Instantly,
they are engulfed by a hellish cacophony, an overwhelming din from
a cavernous wall of prison cells five stories high, a din that
assaults the senses and stuns the teens as they mutely march.
</P>
<P>
   Arms protrude from behind iron bars, stretching toward the teens
who shy away. Shadowed faces glower, contort. The doors to the
cells are locked, but in this claustrophobic hall where two men are
crammed into each microscopic cage, there's no escape from the heat
and the smell and the spit.
</P>
<P>
   From the top tier, a thin white cord suddenly swoops to the
third tier, dangling a sheaf of papers. Known as a ``fish line,''
it is the prison's informal, illegal mail system _ an inmate has
ripped his sheet to send his mail.
</P>
<P>
   The air becomes thick with obscenities, with lurid sexual
taunts. Some shout admonitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't come to prison,'' one yells. ``It's inhumane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are locked in here 24 hours a day except for
chow,'' ``Gypsy,'' a longtime inmate and Squires volunteer, said as
he shepherded a group of stunned youths down the sticky corridor.
``They like to break the monotony.''
</P>
<P>
   He led the teen-agers into the bathroom at the end of the
cellblock.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how crowded this shower is _ three or four guys to each
shower head,'' he said. ``That's how it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not enough simply to show. This counseling program
delves deeper, letting them experience firsthand the harshness of
prison.
</P>
<P>
   So a handful of inmates are removed from their ``houses,'' as
the cells are called, and the teens are locked in, two and three
per house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to this sound,'' said Domantay, slamming the door to
one cell. He stood on the outside of the bars, shouting at the
youngsters within. ``That's the last (expletive) thing you will
hear at night. Every night. You guys have to think about your
choices or you'll be in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Launched 35 years ago by a death-row inmate whose son had
started breaking the law, Squires has become a pioneering,
nationally-acclaimed program, used as a model for numerous ``scared
straight'' organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Using volunteer convicts to work directly with young people, the
program consists of two six-hour workshops, held on consecutive
Saturdays, for teens who have been referred by juvenile authorities
or are considered at risk of becoming juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   While prison authorities say they lack the resources to
systematically track those who go through the program, they say the
effectiveness can be measured through contact with juvenile
agencies along with letters and follow-up visits from those who
went through the program.
</P>
<P>
   Anywhere from 50 to 70 teen-agers attend each month. There is
currently a three-month backlog, and the prison is seeking
donations to expand the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was floored by it,'' said Ed Collins, now a San Francisco
police officer. When he was 15, caught drinking, fighting and
smoking marijuana, he was taken to San Quentin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared the hell out of me. It made me put on the brakes,''
Collins said. ``I walked into San Quentin weighing 165 pounds, I'm
thinking I'm a tough guy. Then I saw a guy whose biceps went from
here to New Jersey. He winked at me like I was a girl. I realized
if he wanted me I couldn't defend myself. I said, `I'm out of
here.''
</P>
<P>
   That day, Collins said, he turned his life around, ultimately
becoming a police officer. In 1998, while assigned to the Ingleside
station, he created a special program to help rehabilitate young
thieves, hoods, gang members and graffiti punks.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, several dozen young people gather at the Ingleside
station house for sessions that include yard cleaning and listening
to former prostitutes, domestic violence victims and abusers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also show them pictures of dead people,'' Collins said.
``You want to do drugs or play with guns, this is how you could end
up.''

STANDING UP FOR HIS FILM AND FOR REAL BLACK HEROES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c .2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ For 11 years, Phil Alden Robinson, the director of
``Field of Dreams,'' was obsessed with making a film about the
earliest days of the civil rights movement in Mississippi, but
every film studio in town rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an original look at the civil rights movement,
something people had not seen,'' Robinson said. ``And nobody wanted
to make it. They felt they could not make a profit. They said there
was no market overseas for a serious film about
African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally Turner Network Television proposed that Robinson's
proposal, initially titled ``Mississippi Project,'' be turned into
a television drama. Robinson said he was uneasy about the budgetary
and time constraints of making a television film in contrast to a
full-length theatrical feature. But the 50-year-old filmmaker, a
reticent and somewhat idiosyncratic director, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure I could do it,'' Robinson said. ``I didn't have
the confidence that I could do a good job on a television budget
and schedule. I've never worked so fast in my life.'' He laughed.
``It's the best film experience I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was ``Freedom Song,'' written (with Stanley Weiser)
and directed by Robinson, with an ensemble cast that includes Danny
Glover, who is also the executive producer. The film, which will
have its premiere on TNT on Sunday at 7 p.m., is a drama loosely
based on the lives of the grass-roots organizers _ and ordinary
people who helped them _ in small towns in Mississippi in the early
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said that what appealed to him at the outset was that
the film was about normal people swept up in an abnormal situation.
He said that he initially wanted to create a drama about Bob Moses,
the pioneer civil rights leader, after reading ``Parting the
Waters,'' Taylor Branch's book about the civil rights movement, in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Bob and told him that I wanted to make a film about
him because what he did was so inspiring, and he said, `I didn't do
anything,''' recalled Robinson. ``He said that the people who
risked their lives were the ones who housed and fed the workers,
those were the ones who were inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was right,'' said Robinson. ``These were everyday
working-class people with no particular agenda other than they
wanted to become first-class citizens, and they risked their lives
day after day.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Weitz, executive vice president of original programming
for TNT, said the network had successfully produced a number of
projects that dealt with racial issues and earned strong critical
notices, including the 1997 ``George Wallace'' with Gary Sinise.
The role of Robinson as well as Glover (the star and executive
producer of TNT's ``Buffalo Soldiers'' in 1997) in shaping
``Freedom Song'' made the project a high priority for the cable
network. It cost about $9 million and took 34 days to film, which
is at least two weeks less than many features require.
</P>
<P>
   Weitz said: ``For us, success is gauged on different levels than
a feature film or a network movie. Our success is not about a
rating in and of itself. It's about critical reviews, the quality
of the film, the fact that Danny Glover and Phil Robinson want to
work with us, which will bring on other actors and filmmakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said that as a white filmmaker, he had never heard
criticism from former civil rights workers and others about the
idea of making a film about black people. ``Actually the only
criticism I ever heard was from the head of a studio who told me a
white guy should not direct this and I'd be clobbered for it,'' he
said. ``Well, I would have been clobbered if I went off to the
library and done research on my own and then made a film without
those involved in the movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we did exactly the opposite,'' Robinson said. ``We went to
the people in the movement and said, `You tell us what happened and
that's the movie we'll tell.' And we involved them totally in the
process of creating the film.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1988 Alan Parker film ``Mississippi Burning,'' which
was criticized by former civil rights workers for what they termed
its inaccurate depiction of white FBI agents coming to the aid of
black organizers, the current television film deals almost entirely
with black demonstrators _ and black townspeople _ confronting
segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Former leaders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
(a civil rights organization that helped organize voter
registration in the South) like Moses and Chuck McDew assisted
Robinson in developing the screenplay and in production of the
movie. Moses is so enthusiastic about the film that he has asked
TNT for numerous tapes of the drama to show to the students and
teachers in his Algebra Project, a program that promotes mastery of
mathematics among poor children.
</P>
<P>
   McDew, former chairman of SNCC (popularly pronounced snick) and
one of the advisers on the film project, described the TNT movie in
a telephone interview as ``the first one ever made that captures
the spirit and integrity of the people involved in the movement.''
</P>
<P>
   McDew, who is 60 and teaches African-American history at
Metropolitan State University in St. Paul, said that for him the
significance of the drama was that it showed that ``ordinary people
did extraordinary things and can make a difference.'' He said that
Robinson had told ``the real story'' as opposed to the one told in
``Mississippi Burning.''
</P>
<P>
   McDew said, ``That was really like an old-fashioned buddy drama
of two white guys coming in and saving the trembling natives. Well,
back then the FBI was a bunch of good old boys, and to make them
heroes was ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other film directors who have moved into television to make
serious projects that Hollywood studios rejected, Robinson said
that cable was in many ways a haven for filmmakers. ``Cable is just
taking over a part of the movie business that studios have
forfeited,'' said the director, seated in a busy Beverly Hills
restaurant the other day. ``TNT treated us better than any movie
studio I ever worked with. They were very supportive. They treated
you like a grown-up. They don't yell and scream. They're logical.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson spoke from experience _ and not just with ``Freedom
Song.'' He acknowledges that his directorial credits were skimpy in
contrast to those of other directors his age, and attributes that
partly to his pursuing his interest in Somalia and in Bosnia in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   After an early television career in which he wrote for the
series ``Trapper John, M.D.,'' Robinson wrote the screenplay ``All
of Me,'' which starred Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin. He directed
the 1987 comedy ``In the Mood,'' with Patrick Dempsey. But his
breakthrough film as a director and screenwriter was the 1989
baseball drama, ``Field of Dreams,'' starring Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was then offered dozens of films to direct. But he took
the year off and, after reading the Taylor Branch book, became
consumed with the story of the early civil rights workers and the
black farmers, housewives and shop owners who risked their lives to
help them.
</P>
<P>
   The project was initially set up at Universal Studios, but was
passed on to other studios, where executives said it was too
costly. Some studios asked Robinson to create a starring role for a
white star like Kevin Costner or Mel Gibson. He refused.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Robinson directed a modestly successful comedy,
``Sneakers,'' with, among others, Robert Redford. That same year,
he accompanied the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as
an observer on relief missions to Somalia and Bosnia. That led
Robinson to write and direct five documentaries on those war zones
for ABC News' ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had another disappointing experience with film studios
_ and stars _ when a long-planned script of his, ``The Age of
Aquarius,'' about a relief worker in Sarajevo, was scuttled by
Universal when Harrison Ford dropped out of the project. Robinson,
who had waited a year for the actor, was despondent for a while.
Now he is pursuing other stars in hopes of reviving the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like `Freedom Song,' it's something I'll never give up on,''
he said. ``I get offered a lot of pictures, but they just seem like
another picture. Every once in a while a subject like the civil
rights movement or characters like the ones I met in Sarajevo grip
me. I just feel l'll never get a better story than that. It's worth
waiting for.''

FOREIGN MINISTER'S COMMENTS WIDEN ARAB-ISRAELI DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the escalating war of words between Israel and
its Arab neighbors, Israel's foreign minister on Wednesday took a
turn at fueling the animosities that have risen since peace efforts
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor of the parliament, David Levy, the foreign
minister, repeated Israel's warning that it would retaliate harshly
for any attacks on its northern borders. But he used language that
sounded as if it were straight out of the Old Testament, which some
interpreted as the elaboration of a foreign policy based on ``an
eye for an eye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kiryat Shmona burns, Lebanese soil will burn,'' he said,
speaking both in Hebrew and in ancient Aramaic. ``One thing turns
on the other, blood against blood, a life against a life, a child
against a child.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks raised an outcry from Israeli Arab and leftist
lawmakers here and created outrage in the Arab world. They were
made in the context of a special parliamentary session on recent
Arab incitement against Israel, but Levy's remarks were broadcast
in the Arab world as the latest example of incitement from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the new Israeli prime minister, had been given a
long grace period by Arab neighbors who took him at his word as a
hawk turned dove with bold ambitions to end the conflict in the
region. That grace period ground to a close when negotiations
stalled with both the Palestinians and the Syrians earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   When Barak ordered Israeli warplanes to bomb civilian targets in
Lebanon early this month, relations sunk to a low point. And a trip
last week by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to the sites of the
bombing in Lebanon created a kind of pan-Arab front against what
they call ``Israeli aggression'' for the first time in years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the peace effort is not only stuck but also mired in
recriminations and ugly words that might not be easily forgotten
even if the impasses are broken. Dennis Ross, the U.S. peace envoy,
is here this week trying to re-start talks between the Israelis and
the Palestinians, each of whom blames the other for the freeze in
relations.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides of the Israeli-Arab divide, recent words and
images from the other side have proved shocking, bringing back old
memories and adding new twists.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis have been chilled to see the old and hurtful Arab
associations of Israel's behavior with fascism and Nazism
resurfacing as an ideological weapon. The latest example, a cartoon
from a Qatar newspaper, was reprinted in Israeli newspapers
Wednesday, under such headlines as ``Not funny.''
</P>
<P>
   It depicted Barak as Hitler, wearing a swastika armband and a
Star of David medal with a skull hanging from it, as Israeli planes
bombed Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday, Levy said this and other similar
cartoons, comments and editorials were acts of ``deliberate
incitement'' carried out by the official media of Arab countries to
``spread poison and hatred for Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel rejects with disgust the filthy wave and the style used
on the radio stations in Cairo, Damascus and Beirut,'' he said.
``Anyone who describes the Israeli leadership in fascist or
Hitlerian terms, and the Jews as Nazis, should not expect that the
people of Israel will believe that he has genuine and truly
peaceful intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Arabs have been bothered by Israel's conduct, too. Many
were horrified when Barak announced his intention to bomb Lebanon
earlier this month while standing beside the Jordanian prime
minister in Amman.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, they saw what they perceive as the familiar
image of the ugly Israeli wielding threats of violence. On the
other, reflecting the new reality of partial peace in the region,
Barak stunned them by making his threat on Arab soil as an Arab
politician stood beside him without saying a word.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians and other Arabs also recoiled at Levy's recent
suggestions that the Palestinians intentionally generate crises in
negotiations because they really don't want peace. Levy was quoted
Wednesday in Israeli newspapers as saying that success in the peace
talks would threaten the Palestinians' ``identity as weak and
wretched.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Levy's comments in the parliament Wednesday came during a heated
exchange with Israeli Arab lawmakers. When Levy was explaining why
Israel bombed Lebanon _ in response to the guerrillas' killing of
soldiers by firing from villages, he said _ the lawmakers
interrupted. They said that the Hezbollah, or Party of God,
guerrillas were fighting in a war zone where they were protesting
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop yelling, stop shouting,'' Levy told them. ``In whose eyes
do you want to find favor? In the eyes of Hezbollah?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawmakers, Azmi Bishara, shouted: ``You're defaming
us! That's incitement.''
</P>
<P>
   After the back and forth, when Levy delivered his warning about
future Israeli retaliation, he appeared to be seething with anger,
and he was almost shouting.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing politicians praised him for speaking from the heart.
The chairwoman of the leftist Meretz faction, which is part of
Barak's government, called for Levy to be removed from the security
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone whose diplomatic-security worldview is one of an eye
for an eye and a tooth for a tooth is not appropriate for the
position,'' the chairwoman, Zehava Galon, said.

WEB ACCESS, MINUS THE MONTHLY BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By PETER DIZIKES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Information, as the saying goes, wants to be free. In this
spirit, a growing number of Internet service providers have begun
offering completely free Internet access: no monthly charges and no
start-up fees.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like NetZero, World Spy, Freei.net, and even Kmart
(yes, Kmart) now let anyone with a computer and a modem browse the
Web at no cost, and, through aggressive advertising campaigns, aim
to lure Web users away from fee-based services like America Online
and Earthlink. And the trend is accelerating: in January alone,
established Web names like Alta Vista and Juno joined their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Free access has been slower to catch on in the United States
than in countries like Britain, where the debut last year of
Dixon's Freeserve, run by an electronics retailing chain, was so
successful that many competitors, including AOL, now offer free
services of their own.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, though, telephone customers pay by the minute for
local calls, which means a so-called free Internet connection can
still be costly.
</P>
<P>
   Few Internet experts expect such dramatic changes on this side
of the Atlantic. Zia Daniell Wigder, an analyst at Jupiter
Communications, a New York-based company that provides research on
Internet commerce, predicts that 13 percent of Net users will gain
access via free providers by 2003 _ a healthy amount, but probably
not enough to scare AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free services are catching on,'' Wigder said, ``but they
are competing against each other, not just AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   Why has free Internet access been a greater hit in Britain than
the United States? For one thing, industry analysts say, the
British tend to spend less on entertainment. Also, established ISPs
command greater customer loyalty in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL offers a very good service that people are addicted to,''
said Bruce Kasrel, an analyst at Forrester Research, a research
company in Cambridge, Mass., that analyzes how changes in
technology affect businesses and society. ``Free ISPs will not be
the primary way people access the Internet in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, free ISPs are a burgeoning presence in the United
States, with a dozen companies offering national services and many
regional ISPs offering something like free connections (many charge
one-time set-up fees). I recently signed up for a number of the
largest providers and tested them over several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The ground rules: I ignored providers who promised free monthly
service but charged a hefty set-up fee, avoided services that could
not provide a local phone number (in my case, area code 718) and
tried to rely only on free technical support, which was sometimes
available only by e-mail. In short, my goal was to evaluate the
quality of Internet access I could get without paying a cent.
</P>
<P>
   To begin, I downloaded the software from the free ISP Web sites
using my existing provider, a regular phone line, a 56K modem and
Windows 98. Anyone who doesn't already have an Internet provider
can order the software by phone, usually for less than $10.
</P>
<P>
   Among the following free ISPs, only Freei is compatible with
Macintoshes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NetZero &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NetZero (www.netzero.net) the biggest of the free ISPs, reports
having three million subscribers, all with PCs (it does not work
with Macs). NetZero subscribers must use Windows 95, 98, NT or
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Downloading the software and answering a marketing
questionnaire, a necessary part of the sign-up process, took an
hour. After I had used NetZero a few times, an ambiguous error
message began cropping up on my computer: ``691: member ID/password
invalid OR we may have temporary system difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Since I had been using NetZero successfully, I figured that it
was the latter. But I could not be sure because NetZero does not
have toll-free technical support by phone; you must either pay for
a call to Southern California or use the service's ``platinum''
phone support, which is $14.95 per call.
</P>
<P>
   If the service is down, you obviously cannot use e-mail or
consult a Web site for help unless you have another Internet
provider. I decided to use another ISP to send e-mail to NetZero's
technical support service. All I got was a standardized response
urging me to upgrade to the latest version of NetZero.
</P>
<P>
   It was faster to register again under another name, with a new
ID and password. The error message disappeared, but I would not
want to re-register every time I encountered a problem.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero provides free e-mail, and it comes with a window for
advertisements, called the ZeroPort, that can be moved around but
not removed from the screen. The ZeroPort was only a moderate
distraction; I found it least obtrusive at the bottom of the
screen. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WorldSpy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Free Internet access,''the WorldSpy advertisements say
(www.worldspy.com). ``Our accountant isn't happy.'' Neither was I,
after realizing that WorldSpy's memory-gulping software would
occupy 8 megabytes on my hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   And there were glitches: a dialogue box kept reappearing on the
screen, the service intermittently disconnected and occasionally
when I dialed in, the WorldSpy application would start, then
enigmatically disappear from the screen.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, WorldSpy's technical support includes a
toll-free phone number, and the people there were prompt and
helpful _ although the first time I tried it, I was cut off in
midcall. A representative solved the dialogue box problem without
too much difficulty and assured me that the mysterious disappearing
application was caused by a software bug that WorldSpy was
attempting to fix.

Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of news books:
</P>
<P>
   ``ACTUAL INNOCENCE'' &QL; 
By Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer (Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In our rush to convict violent criminals and offer justice to
their victims, it's easy to overlook the plight of the innocent
man. Today, DNA tests are used before trial. Of the first 18,000
test results at the FBI and other crime laboratories, at least
5,000 absolved suspects of guilt before their cases were tried. But
what about men who were convicted before DNA testing was common
practice? Lawyers Scheck and Neufeld are founders of the
``Innocence Project,'' which fights for DNA tests for men who are
in prison. The authors present case after case in which bad
lawyering, police misconduct or false testimony by witnesses
resulted in the conviction of innocent men on rape or murder
charges. Although the book is at times overly dramatic (Dwyer, who
writes for the ``New York Daily News,'' refers to ``Barry and
Peter'' as if they are superheroes, swooping in to save the day
with their test tubes), it is a sobering reminder of the forgotten
victims of violent crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``MIRTH OF A NATION'' &QL; 
Edited by Michael J. Rosen (HarperPerennial, $15) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from us to make jokes at Yanni's expense, but we're
willing to laugh if someone else steps up to the plate. In this
case, it's ``New Yorker'' writer Kurt Andersen, who presents
himself as the man who invented Yanni _ the hair, the name
(``Zazu'' and ``Yahweh'' were contenders), the waterbed smile.
Andersen is one of 54 humorists who contribute to this anthology of
funny writing. Among the others: Roy Blount Jr., on the game of
golf (the first time he saw himself hitting a golf ball on video,
he looked exactly like a man killing a snake); Christopher Buckley
on the art of name-dropping; Garry Trudeau, who admits, copiously,
that he has smoked marijuana; Ian Frazier, who visits upon his
children the laws of the home (``Bite not, lest you be cast into
quiet time . . . '') and Dave Barry on his visit to Paris, where
there was only one empty parking space and it was under heavy
police guard at the Louvre museum. This volume is the first in a
series. Rosen invites you to submit work for future installments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``WILD MINDS: WHAT ANIMALS REALLY THINK'' &QL; 
By Marc D. Hauser (Holt, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone want to guess what that fine gentleman on the cover was
thinking when someone snapped his picture? Hauser, psychology
professor and head of an animal-research program at Harvard
University, delves into questions that have already spawned many
books and much speculation: Are animals capable of experiencing th
same emotions that we feel? Do animals simply follow rules, or do
they understand those rules and their purpose? Hauser calls
accounts of weeping elephants and altruistic dolphins ``wildly
speculative,'' as faulty as the scientific belief that animals are
``mindless and irrational, driven by instinct and overwhelmed by
their passions.'' He explores such ``animal'' behavior as making
tools, counting, calculating distance, communicating and
cooperating with others, showing compassion, and making and abiding
by rules. In the process, he discusses what sets humans apart from
other animals _ their mysterious awareness of self. We will never
understand animals, he says, until we stop trying to see ourselves
in them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``LOSING YOUR PARENTS, FINDING YOUR SELF'' &QL; 
By Victoria Secunda (Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secunda interviewed 94 men and women who during their adulthoods
experienced the deaths of one or both parents. In the process, she
discovered that ``parental death is a defining event for adult
offspring that, with regard to its impact on one's sense of self,
often eclipses the variables of marital status, career achievement,
being a parent oneself, or the cause and manner of parental
death.'' In other words, it matters, and in many different ways.
Some people feel a sense of euphoric relief when their parents die.
Others feel lost, with no one to talk to or impress. Some find that
their marriages or their relationships with their siblings are
enhanced after a parent dies. For others, those ties deteriorate.
Secunda's book is not perfect (it begins with a bit of baggage, an
overlong description of her terrible relationship with her mother),
but it is interesting in the shared experiences she discovered
among the subjects of her survey _ experiences not of grief, but of
the long-term consequences of an inevitable and life-altering
event. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WorldSpy does not include an advertising window like ZeroPort.
WorldSpy is an online retailer, and its Internet service is
intended to draw traffic to the site. Its service is compatible
with Windows 95, 98 and NT, but not yet with Windows 2000. Over
all, I had enough connection problems to give me pause about using
WorldSpy as a long-term ISP. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freei &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Setting up Freei's software is quick, provided you have Version
5 of Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Anyone using an earlier version
of Explorer will first have to download Version 5, which can itself
be a lengthy process, to install Freei. In fact, almost all free
ISPs use Explorer as the default browser, perhaps because Netscape
is now part of AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Freei (www.freei.net), based in Seattle, does not have a
toll-free number for phone support, but the service itself
presented a minimum of connection problems. Since Freei provides
access for Macintosh users with OS 8.0 or higher, Apple partisans
may choose to go here first and consult friends if technical issues
arise. Freei is also compatible with Windows 95, 98, NT and 2000. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alta Vista &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known portals on the Web, Alta Vista
(www.altavista.com), recently started offering free Internet
access. The software downloads rapidly, and Alta Vista allows users
to list several local phone numbers in the setup program. If the
modem encounters a busy signal when dialing in, it will try the
next number on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Alta Vista provided a reliable connection and has a highly
detailed trouble-shooting guide, parts of which pertain to basic
networking and protocol issues and could be useful no matter which
ISP you use. The service works with Windows 95, 98, NT and 2000.
Alta Vista also provides free technical support by phone, which in
my case included about a 10-minute wait on hold.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Juno &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An established ISP, Juno (www.juno.com) offers a choice between
its premium service for $9.95 a month and completely free access.
Among other differences, the premium service includes free
technical phone support, which costs $1.95 per minute if you choose
the free service. Premium users also have more local phone numbers
to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   But like Alta Vista, Juno's free service also allows users to
list several local numbers in case of a busy signal, and it offers
a dependable, consistent connection. It does not take long to
download Juno's software, either. In fact, the most time-consuming
part of the set-up process is answering a tedious personal
questionnaire, which is by far the longest of any free ISP reviewed
here. Juno's free service also requires Windows 95 or any later
version, including Windows 2000. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BlueLight (Kmart) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I learned that Kmart was in the free ISP business, I
pictured a cheesy service with pop-up advertisements distracting me
while I perused the Web: ``Attention, Kmart surfers. We now have a
blue-light special on garden hoses.'' As its name indicates,
though, Kmart has a sense of humor about its cyberventure
(www.bluelight.com). BlueLight does show a video advertisement
while your modem is dialing, and it includes the usual on-screen
advertising window.
</P>
<P>
   These distractions aside, BlueLight emerged as a dark-horse
winner. It took just a few minutes to download the software and to
register. The service is run in collaboration with Yahoo _ the
default home page _ and users are given a yahoo.com e-mail address.
BlueLight runs with Windows 95, 98, NT and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   I have yet to experience a single software glitch, connection
problem or curious error message with BlueLight. When I tested its
technical support by phone, I reached a representative within a
minute. Granted, that required a call to the 409 area code (Texas),
but that seems like a reasonable trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, using free ISPs generally means accepting trade-offs
like connection difficulties and limited technical support, but
that can also be true of services you pay for. You may have to
endure an advertising window, and many free ISPs monitor the online
activities of their users.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all free service providers require Windows as a platform.
And if you are using the Internet for professional reasons, it is a
good idea to try a free ISP for a while before relying upon it too
heavily. But if all that seems reasonable to you, there is one
undeniable benefit: a very nice price. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SIMPSONS: www.thesimpsons.com Free Internet access and
e-mail brought to you by the site of the long-running hit series,
but only for Windows users. D'oh! It runs with Windows 2000. &QL;

<P>
   EXCITE(at)HOME: www.excite.com Where would a major portal be

speculative,'' as faulty as the scientific belief that animals are
``mindless and irrational, driven by instinct and overwhelmed by
their passions.'' He explores such ``animal'' behavior as making
tools, counting, calculating distance, communicating and
cooperating with others, showing compassion, and making and abiding
by rules. In the process, he discusses what sets humans apart from
other animals _ their mysterious awareness of self. We will never
understand animals, he says, until we stop trying to see ourselves
in them. &QL;

   ``LOSING YOUR PARENTS, FINDING YOUR SELF'' &QL; 
By Victoria Secunda (Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secunda interviewed 94 men and women who during their adulthoods
experienced the deaths of one or both parents. In the process, she
discovered that ``parental death is a defining event for adult
offspring that, with regard to its impact on one's sense of self,
often eclipses the variables of marital status, career achievement,
being a parent oneself, or the cause and manner of parental
death.'' In other words, it matters, and in many different ways.
Some people feel a sense of euphoric relief when their parents die.
Others feel lost, with no one to talk to or impress. Some find that
their marriages or their relationships with their siblings are
enhanced after a parent dies. For others, those ties deteriorate.
Secunda's book is not perfect (it begins with a bit of baggage, an
overlong description of her terrible relationship with her mother),
but it is interesting in the shared experiences she discovered
among the subjects of her survey _ experiences not of grief, but of
the long-term consequences of an inevitable and life-altering
event. &QL;

MASSMUTUAL ACQUIRES HONG KONG INSURANCE COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making its first foray into Asia, MassMutual Financial Group is
acquiring a Hong Kong insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   MassMutual, a major national life insurance company with $206
billion in assets, is seeking to profit in Asia's recovering
markets by acquiring and expanding the operations of CRC Protective
Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of MassMutual's agreement to buy CRC Protective from its
owners, HKCB Bank Holding Co. Ltd. of Hong Kong and Protective Life
Corp. of Birmingham, Ala., were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert O'Connell, chief executive of MassMutual, based in
Springfield, Mass. but with operations around the world, said the
agreement represents MassMutual's ``most significant international
move to date.''
</P>
<P>
   MassMutual joins a stampede of US financial institutions
entering Japan and other Pacific Rim countries in the wake of a
banking and currency crisis that swept the region and devastated
local economies _ leaving lots of bargain acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling Asian financial institutions are selling off
operations to US companies, which can use their financial muscle to
enter new markets ripe for profits as economies recover.
</P>
<P>
   At HKCB Bank Holding, nonperforming loans plunged the company
into the red, according to reports in the South China Morning Post.
It returned to profitability last year, though its nonperforming
loans remained high.
</P>
<P>
   CRC Protective Life represented ``an opportunity to acquire a
freestanding, profitable company that's already established in Hong
Kong,'' O'Connell said. CRC Protective, he said, will provide ``a
foundation for expanding'' in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines,
and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   CRC Protective, which will be renamed MassMutual Asia, has $100
million in assets and currently sells life insurance in Hong Kong
and in the Chinese territory of Macau, a former Portuguese colony
that recently opened its doors to CRC Protective.
</P>
<P>
   Elroy Chan, CRC Protective's chief executive, will be in charge
of MassMutual Asia and expansion to other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
   MassMutual's overseas push began more than three years ago; it
has established operations in Argentina, Bermuda, Chile, and
Luxembourg. In December, MassMutual purchased the Argentine
subsidiary of Jefferson-Pilot Corp. of Greensboro, N.C., and folded
it into its own Argentine unit.
</P>
<P>
   MassMutual Asia will also sell sell investment management and
other services from MassMutual's existing menu, as well as its
Oppenheimer mutual funds, O'Connell said.

 &HT;    Masochism grows tired for Chapman
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone please call the police. Obviously somebody stole the
``Fast Car'' Tracy Chapman contemplated using to drive herself out
of a bad situation, and the kinetic spirit that powered it. Last
time we saw soul music's dreadlocked pop star, it was 1995 and she
was standing in the doorway, bags packed, asking her other half to
``give me one reason to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   The lilting singer's fourth album lets us assume she turned
``right back around.'' But why? On ``Telling Stories,'' Chapman
seems resigned to stay troubled. ``There is fiction in the space
between you and me,'' she cleverly tells her dishonest lover on the
title track. But she never says she's tired of it. ``Sometimes a
lie is the best thing,'' she concludes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and me had some history,'' begins ``Less Than Strangers.''
``Had some semblance of honesty. All that has changed now.''
</P>
<P>
   And still there's no, ``I'm tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK'' follows, where she says she's fine being ``the rock,
the shoulder you cry... I'll play it straight/While you laugh and
drink and party all night long.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, even with all of the inspired musicianship accompanying
this hopelessness, you're tired of it.

 &HT;    Atlantans are developing a taste for in-store restaurants
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The flourless chocolate cake was flawless, according
to Lenecia Blue of Atlanta. And the pork tenderloin and caramelized
onion sandwich was delicious, said Sandy Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Marcie Schultz raved about the lobster club on a toasted
brioche.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a furniture store.
</P>
<P>
   The three friends were lunching at Horizon Pacific Home in
Atlanta, which a few weeks ago joined a growing number of retail
stores that are adding food service to their customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come to a beautiful furniture store, they want to
take their time,'' said HPH store owner Peter Spirer. ``I wanted to
give them a place where they could have a glass of wine while they
consider their purchases. If Mom wants to shop, Dad can bring the
kids here for a peanut butter sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   Shopping and dining have long been great companions. For
decades, ladies lunched at the Magnolia Room while shopping at
Rich's department store downtown. Until two years ago, midday
shoppers and office workers crowded the Formica counter in the
downtown Macy's for chicken potpie and chats with friendly
waitresses.
</P>
<P>
   What's left at the downtown Macy's is fast-but-fancy hot dogs
and a deli counter, much more in step with the in-store dining of
today _ fast food, often well-known chains, in smaller spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, companies began to believe that restaurants were
not a good use of retail space,'' said Britt Beemer, retail analyst
and chairman of America's Research Group, based in Charleston. ``In
the last five years, as more and more companies look alike in their
merchandising, stores have added restaurants to set them apart, to
be tiebreakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Beemer said the goal is to attract time-pressed consumers, and a
recent survey conducted by his firm showed that 44 percent think
restaurants in retail stores are a ``great'' idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are starved for time, so if they can get some
shopping done and feed the kids in the same place, it's a plus,''
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Worthington of Atlanta said saving time is what brings
him to the Home Depot a couple of times a week. Last week, he
dropped by during his lunch hour to pick up some wallpaper paste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was a Fuddrucker's here, so this works out
perfectly,'' Worthington explained as he munched on a chili dog.
``Sometimes it's the other way around. I come by to eat at
Fuddrucker's, but then I almost always end up buying something in
the store.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of win-win situation that is likely to fuel more
partnerships between restaurants and retail stores, Beemer said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's Home Expo at Perimeter Center has a Proof of the
Pudding outlet. Some Kroger stores, like those in Decatur, Ga., and
Alpharetta, Ga., have Popeye's outlets. Another area Kroger is home
to Chai Peking, a kosher Chinese restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom at Perimeter Mall in Dunwoody, Ga., houses the Pub, a
full service restaurant. And the new Target in Atlanta has both
Pizza Hut and Taco Bell outlets. Ed's IGA on Clairmont offers the
Collard Green Cafe. And that's just a sampling of the stores that
combine shopping and supping.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the new classic is the bookstore/cafe combination. ``A
cafe contributes to the ambience and invites shoppers to stay
awhile, read a book or magazine,'' said Nicholas Hrenko, regional
manager for Barnes &AMP; Noble cafes.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble originally partnered with Starbucks. Now, many
stores have their own cafes that serve Starbucks coffee but also
offer sandwiches and fresh baked goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the store at Perimeter Center, we bake cookies and muffins
and scones right in the middle of the store. When the smell of
brownies and cinnamon scones fills the store _ it's incredible,''
said Hrenko.
</P>
<P>
   The cafes have also provided a natural place for book clubs and
community gatherings, like the ``coffeehouse sessions'' with live
music at the Perimeter store Friday nights. ``It brings people into
the store, and it keeps them there longer, which means they are
more likely to buy something,'' Hrenko said.
</P>
<P>
   Spirer is finding his new cafe also is a draw. Kiesha Smith of
Atlanta recently brought two friends in for lunch, not shopping.
She had been introduced to the cafe by another friend, who
suggested it as a place to get a glass of wine. ``It's not often I
go to a furniture store to drink,'' she admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Myers brought friends Blue and Schultz to Cafe HPH for lunch
after discovering it while shopping one evening. She loved the
20-foot-tall wood columns that set off the space, yet leave it open
for viewing. ``It's so dramatic. You see the store, yet it's
intimate. I knew I wanted to come back,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   And when the threesome finished lunch, they fanned out across
the store. ``See,'' said Spirer, ``they're shopping.''
</P>

 &HT;    All dressed up and everyplace to go
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ Gucci's design chief, Tom Ford of Texas, doesn't
do ``understated.'' He does, however, take great pains to make his
collections understandable.
</P>
<P>
   As is his seasonal ritual, Ford invited editors to join him for
a continental breakfast at the Four Seasons Hotel on Tuesday
morning to explain the fall-winter wear he'd unveil that night. He
wound up stating the obvious: the latest looks from Gucci are
indeed as ``dressed'' as he contends.
</P>
<P>
   Though some of the padded-knee pants and padded-elbow jackets
alluded to the Bugatti motorcyclist lifestyle, this collection was
far from casual. Broad-shouldered coats with militaristic details
(broad belts, gold buttons) served as the axis, while form-fitting
separates revolved around them.
</P>
<P>
   As Ford elaborated: ``Skirts are short. For evening they're 6
inches above the knee and 4 inches above the knee for day. Shoes
are lower, but the heels are very sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else that could've gone without saying: ``There's lots
and lots and lots of black.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a smattering of gold, orange, camel and ruby red broke the
dark mood Ford seemed to be in while sketching. Knitwear was a
virtual nonentity, but lots of blouses (and evening gowns) were
shown with exaggerated ruffles at the neck and cuff. Cleavage ran
deep. And no expense was spared on materials; the best of his
leathers looked gold-dipped, and fur coats were done in plaid or
Donegal tweed patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Ford didn't even bother sending his models out for a finale. He
simply came out to take a bow, as if enough had been said.
</P>
<P>
   PRADA: Miuccia Prada hammered the final nail in geek chic's
coffin with the dainty and daringly sheer assortment of dresses and
separates she showed for fall. She put monochromaticism and drab
colorations behind her, and brought an array of floral and striped
patterns to the fore. Most outfits feature fur stoles tied around
the shoulders, and necklines plunged to the extreme. Her holiday
season gowns looked like tinsel thrown by the fistfull. And her
shearling coats had the drape and belted style of bathrobes.

`THE TERRORIST' HAS A BIG HEART
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A simple film of striking beauty and hypnotic power, ``The
Terrorist'' demonstrates the supreme value of a good story and an
assured filmmaker. The movie, budgeted at a paltry $50,000, was
shot on location in 17 days with a cast consisting entirely of
non-professional actors.
</P>
<P>
   Santosh Sivan, one of India's most acclaimed cinematographers,
who co-wrote and directed the film (and acted as his own director
of photography), makes the most of his meager resources, however,
delivering a powerful statement on the emotional cost of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist of the film's title is a wide-eyed, 19-year-old
young woman named Malli (Ayesha Dharkar), who has spent most of her
life in the jungles of South India training to be a revolutionary.
She's had plenty of practice to hone her skills, and her aptitude
for murder lands her a prized assignment. She's to travel to the
city and kill a politician, known only as the VIP. It's a suicide
mission, one she's honored to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Smuggled to the city by a sweet-faced jungle sprite named Lotus
(Vishwas, in a heart-rending performance), Malli takes a room with
an old farmer, Vasu (Parmeshwaran), who's unaware of her job. Vasu
is something of an agrarian philosopher, a decent man unlike anyone
Malli has ever met. His kind-hearted actions prod Malli to reflect
on her feelings for the first time in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Terrorist'' doesn't dwell on politics. Sivan is more
interested in human drama, and he tells Malli's story in a
remarkably delicate and simple fashion. He's aided by the
mesmerizing work of Dharkar, who is in nearly every frame of the
movie. Watch Dharkar's eyes as Malli becomes more confused about
her destiny. She is utterly spellbinding.
</P>
<P>
   The film was inspired by the events surrounding the 1991
assassination of Indian prime minister Rajiv Ghandi, who was killed
by a suicide bomber. Such acts defy explanation, but Sivan attempts
to find one by burrowing in on the fragile logic of someone who
chooses to be a martyr for a cause. It's a fascinating and
harrowing journey, a gem of economy and elegance. &QL;

 &HT;     COURT EXAMINES WHETHER HMOs CUT COSTS AT PATIENTS' EXPENSE  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on the
vexing question of whether HMOs' financial incentives to cut health
care costs unduly harm patients. But early in the arguments, the
justices appeared wary of even deciding the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the courts get involved in this messy business'' of
deciding whether some financial incentives go too far? Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor asked James Ginzkey, the attorney for a woman
who sued her health maintenance organization because it offered its
doctors bonuses to keep costs down.The woman, Cynthia Herdrich of
Bloomington, Ill., sought treatment in March 1991 from the HMO, the
Carle Clinic Association, for a painful stomach condition.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of scheduling her immediately for a diagnostic
procedure, the HMO forced her to wait eight days so the procedure
could be performed more cheaply at one of its own facilities.
</P>
<P>
   During the delay, Herdrich's appendix ruptured and she
contracted peritonitis, requiring emergency surgery. She sued Carle
for medical negligence, and a jury awarded $35,000 in compensatory
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Her suit also claimed that the HMO had breached its fiduciary
duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA),
which governs company-provided health plans like Herdrich's. A
fiduciary duty arises when one person in a business relationship
has knowledge and experience far above that of the other person _
such as a doctor dealing with a patient _ and requires the expert
to treat the other person fairly and honestly.
</P>
<P>
   Herdrich alleged that doctors in her plan received a year-end
distribution paid out of money saved by minimizing the use of
diagnostic tests performed at outside facilities. It amounted to an
undisclosed physician incentive to withhold treatment, her lawyers
argued. Herdrich's claim that Carle broke its fiduciary trust was
thrown out by a U.S. District Court judge, but a divided panel of
the Seventh Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago
reinstated it in 1998.In deciding Herdrich's case, the Supreme
Court will need to answer two central questions:_ Whether plans
that give doctors bonuses for not ordering tests force them to
choose between health care and profits._ Whether patients can sue
their HMOs under federal law over their managed-care policies.
Currently, federal law blocks most such suits.The case could also
affect the growing debate on the managed-care industry.
Class-action suits have been filed against virtually all major
HMOs, including Aetna, Humana Group Health Plan Inc., Cigna, Kaiser
Permanente and PacifiCare Health Systems.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, a House-Senate conference committee is scheduled to
consider two versions of a ``patients' bill of rights.'' The House
version would allow people to sue HMOs. The Senate version would
not.
</P>
<P>
   During the high court argument, several justices appeared
unlikely to let people sue HMOs over their financial set-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter said all HMOs attempt ``to hold down
health costs because unless they do so, the HMO is going to go out
of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia said: ``It doesn't matter if it's the
doctors or the HMO administrators who are making the decisions
because they all have the same incentive to hold down costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia added that ``if in his zeal to cut costs,'' a doctor
causes a patient to receive inadequate care, that person can sue
him for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer told Ginzkey that such financial
incentives to cut costs were ``the scheme that Congress
authorized'' in 1974 when it passed the ERISA.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care seeks to contain employee health-care costs by
capping payments to physicians, restricting choices of doctors and
hospitals and letting administrators determine how much care
patients should receive. In 1988, 71 percent of patients with
insurance were covered by traditional fee-for-service plans, with a
generally unrestricted choice of doctors and hospitals. Ten years
later, only 14 percent were in such plans.
</P>
<P>
   Carter G. Phillips, the lawyer for Carle, argued that his
organization has a ``typical HMO financial structure'' and that
allowing a lawsuit against it would make all such organizations
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no exaggeration to suggest that the future of medical
care in its delivery and its regulations'' would be seriously
affected by this case, Phillips said. ``If Carle's setup violates
(federal law), then all managed care does as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ginzkey said he was not asking the court to outlaw all
physician incentives. He said lawsuits should be allowed when such
financial bonuses reach ``the level of undue influence'' so that it
affects patient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients need to know if a doctor has a direct incentive not
to give them the very best care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A decision in the case is expected by July.

RELIEF GROUPS RESPOND TO LOOMING FAMINE IN ETHIOPIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ At least 8 million Ethiopians are likely to
suffer hunger or starvation this year, a crisis that could rival
the 1984-85 famine that killed at least 1 million people, U.N. and
independent relief officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aid experts hope that this time the world will not wait until
television images of bone-thin children dying in the dust of
another prolonged drought prompts an outpouring of help _ too late
for most of those suffering the greatest need. On Friday, the U.N.
World Food Program will announce an appeal worldwide to raise about
$50 million in emergency aid. Save the Children announced Wednesday
that it had opened an Ethiopian famine fund.
</P>
<P>
   A joint U.N.-private organization reconnaissance mission is
planned next week for the hardest hit regions of Ethiopia, a
country of about 60 million people. About 2 million people are
thought to be in most immediate need of emergency help, which can
take weeks to arrive because of poor transportation and a lack of
warehouses and centers for distribution. Airlifts may have to be
considered, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The world's response to the 1984 Ethiopian famine was enormous.
Live Aid rock concerts alone raised about $70 million. But by the
time much of the aid reached Ethiopia, beginning in mid-1985, many
thousands of people had perished.
</P>
<P>
   Aid experts fear that if the crisis they see developing this
year has to reach visible proportions again before there is
substantial action, all their advance planning will be meaningless.
``By then it's too late,'' said Jay Zimmerman, director of the
Ethiopia field office of Save the Children, who spoke at a news
conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some places, even if you could get food in tomorrow,
they're past the point of recuperation,'' he said. A region-wide
shortage of water and food has already struck the southernmost
parts of the country bordering Somalia and Kenya, he said. Drought
conditions are expected to move north in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer medical agency Doctors Without Borders has
reported that in one affected southern district, Gode, it is
already too late to set up feeding centers, as people have
scattered in search of water, food and medicine, and often die as
they move.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Lewis, the World Food Program's country director in
Ethiopia, speaking in a telephone interview from Addis Ababa, the
capital, said that the Ethiopian crisis has been building for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have enough food for everybody to get full rations
in 1999, so that's the legacy that we've inherited as we go into a
bad year,'' she said. ``This country is just so prone to being at
the mercy of the weather anyway, so even in good years there's a
need for food aid. This year we're just seeing a cumulative effect.
That's why there are so many people on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and other experts said that international organizations
felt more confident that they could cope with this crisis in part
because there has been more cooperation from the Ethiopian
government since the fall of Mengistu Haile Mariam's regime in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   But the government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi faces a
national election in May, at what could be the worst time of
scarcity for the southern regions of Ethiopia, which are
politically marginalized. With national food stocks reduced
everywhere to the lowest levels since 1984, there will be political
pressure on the government to supply proportionately more food to
more important parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Ethiopia is home to pastoral people, Zimmerman said.
Their livelihoods depend on animal flocks that provide cash crops
and food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty or 90 percent of their cattle and sheep are dead,'' he
said. ``When the cattle begin dying, that's like a stock market
crash for pastoralists. Now that their cattle are gone, they have
no assets, or milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman said that animal carcasses thrown into rivers and
wells are contributing to the spread of diarrheal diseases, already
a problem in drought areas as people forage for food. Towns are
being crowded with migrants from the countryside who strain their
already thin resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four percent of Ethiopians are malnourished to the point
of stunting, he said, adding that ``Ethiopia has never really
recovered from the 1984 drought.''

`BROWN'S REQUIEM' MOVES AT DEADLY PACE FOR FILM NOIR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Feb. 25. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Odd as that may sound, it figures in the genesis of ``Brown's
Requiem.'' It's the first novel written by the self-styled demon
dog of crime fiction James Ellroy (``L.A. Confidential'') and the
feature directing debut of adapter Jason Freeland. Working on this
tale of alcoholic detectives, endemic corruption and golf
apparently had a therapeutic effect on both the author and the
auteur's struggles with their own addictions.
</P>
<P>
   And not unlike a personal growth regimen, the resulting movie
has its worthy aspects but is rather parched and tedious. Employing
several elements that worked better in the neo-noir masterpiece
``Chinatown'' does not invite kind comparisons, either.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rooker, still best known as the title psycho of ``Henry:
Portrait of a Serial Killer,'' gives good, hard-boiled narration as
troubled gumshoe Fritz Brown. An ex-LAPD officer who was drummed
off of the force because his drinking problem didn't mix with a
department image-cleanup campaign, he's bitterly sober now,
repossessing cars for a living and running a cruddy little P.I.
agency on the side.
</P>
<P>
   An obese, eccentric caddy named Fat Dog (``Mad TV's'' William
Sasso) hires Brown to check out his 17-year-old sister Jane (Selma
Blair), a piano student who's living with elderly sugar daddy Solly
K (Harold Gould). Brown discovers that Solly's involved in
something that requires bribing Cathcart (Brion James), the police
captain who got him fired. Then Brown gets beaten by thugs for
associating with Fat Dog. He knows better than to continue with the
case _ ``A lifetime in L.A. taught me to never take anything at
face value, except money,'' the voice-over goes, wised-upedly. But
by then, of course, it's personal.
</P>
<P>
   Rooker does a number of scenes with a bandanna bandage wrapped
around his temple; it's not as cool as Nicholson's nose stitches.
Brown also has a younger, alcoholic cousin to co-depend on and feel
guilty about. He's alternately folksy and brutal, vulnerable and
sarcastic, on and off the wagon. But despite these and other
attempts to engage us, this flawed knight errant never really makes
us care about him or about the haphazard array of fine moral points
he supposedly holds dear.
</P>
<P>
   There is a whole lot of walking and talking to various lowlife
types. A road trip to Baja finally results in some gunplay and a
corpse with a detachable arm. But by then the movie has been too
dreary for too long to drum up much excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Well-crafted in its low-key manner, the main fault with
``Brown's Requiem'' is its dirgelike pacing. I know that's how a
requiem is supposed to be, but guess what? Movies operate on
different rhythms than music does.
</P>
<P>
   Glad Ellroy and Freeland are feeling better, though. &QL;

FORTALEZA STRIVING TO ATTRACT INTERNATIONAL TRAVELERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Accent mark needed over a in Ceara) 
 
By SYD KEARNEY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORTALEZA, Brazil _ The Brazilian state of Ceara owes its
popularity among travelers to its more than 340 miles of coastline.
The western portion is popularly known as the ``sunset coast,''
while the eastern shore is called the ``sunrise coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceara's capital, Fortaleza, connects the two.
</P>
<P>
   A coastal community of 2 million inhabitants with luxury
resorts, cultural attractions and a happening night life, Fortaleza
could be Cancun if not for its lack of neon, its colonial landmarks
and the refreshing absence of the English-speaking hucksters
</P>
<P>
   The Ceara government has been laying the groundwork in Fortaleza
for an international tourism push with the construction of a new
airport (opened two years ago), cruise ship terminal and marina (to
be complete in 2003) and a $30 million arts and cultural complex
that debuted in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Fortaleza, which takes its name from a fort first constructed
here by the Dutch in 1639, has 190 hotels with another 19 under
construction. Among them are a Holiday Inn and Melia properties.
</P>
<P>
   Because Fortaleza is the air gateway for travel in Ceara, most
visitors will spend some time in the city. It offers plenty of
diversions; here are just a few:
</P>
<P>
   _ The $30 million Dragao do Mar Cultural Center is the focal
point of Fortaleza's revitalization project. The sprawling complex
includes two theaters, exhibit space and a planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   A current presentation on the ``vaquero,'' the Brazilian cowboy,
is part of a larger exhibit exploring Ceara's hinterlands or dry
lands. Cattle arrived in Fortaleza about 1534, but the herds and
their caretakers were pushed to the dry lands when sugar cane
production became the primary industry along the coast.
Leather-clad cowboys still play a prominent role in the interior
regions of Ceara.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the cultural center is about $2.25. Additional fees
are required for the planetarium and film screenings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Constructed in 1908, the 800-seat theater Jose de Alencar
Theater features ironwork imported from Scotland, cane-backed seats
from Austria and tile from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is named for de Alencar (1829-1877), a novelist
whose popularity in Brazil has been likened to that of Mark Twain
in the United States. The names of de Alencar's characters adorn
the balconies of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is open daily for tours. Admission is about 60
cents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Themed nights are a tradition in Fortaleza. For example,
Wednesday is Cowboy Night, and hundreds of people turn out at Clube
do Vaqueiro for western-flavored fun that includes rodeo
performances. Each Thursday, revelers jam the restaurants along
Futuro Beach for Crab Night. Patrons sit at long picnic tables,
smashing well-seasoned crabs with wood blocks and swaying to the
music of loud and lively rock bands.
</P>
<P>
   With every Monday comes Pirate Night, a rollicking party at the
enormous, open-air Pirate Bar on Iracema Beach. Young and old don
bandanas and dance the ``forro,'' the traditional folk dance of
Ceara.
</P>
<P>
   The party draws as many as 2,000 guests, who feast on fried
cheese balls, boiled shrimp and copious amounts of alcohol.
Admission to Pirate Night is about $6.

   HAMPTON, Va. _ ``Up, Jasmine, up!'' the trainer said, using
sheer force of will to urge the 400-pound Bengal tiger to try her
signature trick. Jasmine paused a bit _ milking the crowd as usual
_ then at long last reared to her seven-foot height, then hopped on
her hind legs right across the cage. The crowd of 6,200 in the
Hampton Coliseum, which had been holding its breath, offered
thunderous applause.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking a bow, the trainer, Sara Houcke, extended her
slender fingers and dropped a meat treat into the palisade of 30
sharp teeth that was Jasmine's gaping mouth. Then she gave the
tiger a big hug. As she ruffled Jasmine's fur, the tiger was
actually purring, as if this predator were an outsize tabby cat.
</P>
<P>
   Houcke _ her name is pronounced hook _ is blond, 22, and the
star of the 130th edition of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP;
Bailey Circus. In an era when circuses are routinely picketed by
animal-rights activists, her gentle, low-key performance is being
served up as the animal-friendly, gender-forward entertainment for
the arena age.
</P>
<P>
   In one respect Houcke is nothing more or less than a headliner
performing in a touring show that is the only live entertainment
regularly seen by millions of Americans every year. But she is also
the embodiment of the improbable adaptability of the circus, an
ancient celebration of the interaction of humans and animals that
has somehow managed to remain relevant to the ticket-buying impulse
of U.S. audiences since the 18th century. Last year the Ringling
show, which has spanned three centuries now, played to 27 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh generation of a European circus dynasty, Houcke is
taking the center ring without relying on the classic props of the
testosterone-happy tiger trainer. Bullwhips are out, as are white
chairs, pistols loaded with blank rounds, flaming hoops and
gimmicky multistage pedestals. Her performance is the antithesis of
the classic rapid, slick, trick-bound tiger show. With supreme
assurance this 5-foot 10-inch 140-pound trainer goes one on one
with her eight cats in a slow dance, as intimacy underlines her
vulnerability to the overwhelming 8-to-1 majority.
</P>
<P>
   Not since another blond _ Gunther Gebel-Williams, the electric
lord of the rings who retired from performing 10 years ago _ has
Ringling made such a fuss over a tiger trainer. Not only is Houcke
on the cover of the new Ringling program, but her image is the
centerpiece of Ringling posters and a multimillion-dollar
television advertising campaign for the Blue Show _ one of its two
separate circus units _ that is wending its way north to Madison
Square Garden, its traditional opening-night arena, on March 16
after performances in the Meadowlands in New Jersey and at the
Nassau Coliseum in Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   After Gebel-Williams arrived in the United States from Germany
on Jan. 6, 1969, ``his act was considered revolutionary, because he
rejected the `fighting style' of training,'' said Greg Parkinson,
executive director of the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis.
``Gunther's style then became the standard across the globe.''
Although the charismatic Gebel-Williams never cast the cats as his
enemies, he was the epitome of the dominant male in the center
ring, encouraging tigers to jump through flaming hoops and ascend
elaborate pedestals.
</P>
<P>
   Now the advent of Houcke ``is the biggest departure from
Gunther's European style of presentation over the last 30 years,''
Parkinson said. ``Billing her as the star of the show takes
Ringling into new territory.'' It is also dangerous territory.
Given tigers' unpredictability, betting the circus on Houcke is a
high-stakes gamble.
</P>
<P>
   To the audience, Houcke's style ``looks very easy,'' said
Gebel-Williams, 65, the avatar of tiger training, now a Ringling
vice president. ``But to be gentle with the cats, this is quite
difficult. It is easier to control them with authority rather than
being gentle. You can never forget that these are tigers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark and I are concerned for her safety,'' Gebel-Williams
added, referring to his son, Mark Oliver Gebel, who presents tigers
and elephants on the Red Show, the other touring unit. ``I keep
telling her she needs to be more of a tough guy with the cats.'' So
far Houcke has ``only a scratch or two from playing with them,''
she said, adding that the tigers purr to her ``and I purr back,''
adding: ``If they aren't purring, I know I should stay away. I'm
very sensitive to their moods.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are moods. The big cats have maimed or killed many
trainers, most famously Alfred Schneider, who made circus history
in 1925 by presenting 40 lions at once. A lion named Othello killed
him in 1941. (Lions are less popular in circuses these days.)
Richard Chipperfield, one of Houcke's predecessors on the Blue
Unit, was severely injured in 1998. At a publicity session Arnold,
a normally well-behaved 350-pound tiger Chipperfield had raised
from a cub, suddenly took a large bite out of his skull;
Chipperfield, 24, has still not fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the mauling his 28-year-old brother and tiger-act
partner, Graham Thomas Chipperfield, used a shotgun to kill the
tiger in its cage. After an investigation Florida officials
declined to press animal-cruelty charges against the brother, who
retired from Ringling. Of Richard Chipperfield, Houcke said: ``You
just can't think about that. I trust the tigers. They trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ringling is clearly trying to make the most of Houcke in the
show. In addition to her tiger presentation, she directs a ring of
five elephants and bids the crowd welcome and farewell from atop a
pachyderm. ``I view Sara as an icon, associated with our circus for
a lot of years to come,'' said Kenneth Feld, Ringling's producer
and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held Ringling show, which brings in some $600
million in annual revenue, ``has a core audience composed of moms
and their children,'' said Tim Holst, vice president for talent and
production. ``What better time to have a woman tiger trainer?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Houcke makes her entrance in a shimmering white suit as she
stands atop a lumbering six-ton elephant (not an insurmountable
challenge for one who did acrobatics atop a galloping camel at age
11). Her tiger extravaganza in the 15-foot-high steel-mesh cage is
the centerpiece of the show's first act, in which she emerges
Venus-like from a mirrored ball. Transported aloft by a trapeze,
she is deposited in the 45-foot-wide tiger cage, so she can welcome
the cats to the center ring.
</P>
<P>
   She arrays the five male and three female cats by uttering
commands in English and German. Houcke offers the tigers beef
treats by hand from a sequined beige bag, instead of rewarding the
cats with food at the end of a long stick, as generations of
trainers have done. ``The interesting thing about her style is that
she stays back, and the cats come to her,'' said Holst. ``It shows
a relationship, and a calmness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ringling publicity machine has dubbed her the ``Tiger
Whisperer,'' a nod toward Robert Redford's film portrayal of a
trainer who had a gift with horses. She smiled when asked about
that designation, then said, ``After being with tigers for 24 hours
a day, you really can understand what they are saying, and you feel
what they're feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We  &UR; whuffle &LR;  together,'' she said, describing the chuffing
sound cats make. She described it as a backward whistle, sort of a
sighing intake of the breath. ``Perhaps I'm the tiger whuffler,''
she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the spotlight Houcke's far-from-glamorous days with
the cats begin before 7 a.m. when she feeds them, cleans their
cages and cuts up 80 to 120 pounds of beef and 20 pounds of
chicken. She does this herself (though two cat wranglers help her
transport the tigers) for training continuity, ``since you can't
just see them in the cage and that's it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If Houcke is the first contemporary female Ringling tiger
honcho, the circus has presented tiger-training women before, most
notably Mabel Stark, a star in the 1920s and '30s who kept on
mesmerizing audiences in other shows until the 1960s, despite being
maimed 18 times.
</P>
<P>
   Holst said he had long sought a woman for the tiger cage, and
Houcke said that independently she had been wondering about working
with cats. At a meeting three years ago in Massy, France, where she
was presenting a solo horse act, the two had a tiger chat. Holst
invited her to join the Red Unit as a zebra trainer last year;
soon, at Ringling's behest, she began honing her tiger skills with
Josip Marcan, a veteran Hungarian trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Houcke had never before worked with cats, she had the
example of her great-uncle, Gilbert Houcke, a legendary European
tiger trainer. Her great-great-aunt Sarah Rancy, for whom she was
named, ``performed with tigers in the 1930s,'' Houcke said. ``I
guess it's in the genes.''
</P>
<P>
   The inheritance is multigenerational. Houcke's father, Sacha _
whose wire-walking ancestors were touring Europe in circus wagons
in the 18th century _ was performing in a circus as a Cossack rider
when he met the woman who would become Houcke's mother, an
English-born dancer, in a casino show in Beirut. The two married
and while they were touring in Torquay, England, Sara was born in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 4 months Sacha put her on a horse, and by age 2
Houcke had made her debut before a circus audience in Switzerland,
taking the role of a child in a haunted-house clown act. At 6 she
rode her first elephant in the ring and by 16 was performing an act
with dolphins and seals.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Judith Benson, is divorced and now working for the
Ringling one-ring circus, Kaleidoscape. Houcke's 16-year-old
sister, Karin, has not yet evinced any tiger-training ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Houcke speaks four languages, and her English has the slightest
pan-European accent. Performers who know her say that Houcke goes
her own way. ``When I was 17, I was offered a chance to work in an
act with a pygmy hippo and buffaloes,'' she said, ``so I went on
the road by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   During interviews she was ready with a bubbly smile and a
self-deprecating laugh, but if Houcke were to inspire a Mattel doll
it would be Tongue-Stud Barbie. (Hers is made of surgical steel.)
Not only is her navel pierced, each ear is adorned with three
diamond studs. Rejecting the circus train, Houcke pilots her own
40-foot Travel Supreme house trailer.
</P>
<P>
   She had a relationship with a significant noncircus other for
four years, ``but life is easier now that I don't have a
boyfriend,'' she said. ``I am my own person, making my own money,
and a lot of guys seem to want to be the dominant one. But I won't
give up the circus for any man.''
</P>
<P>
   And she will not leave the tiger cage because animal-rights
protesters criticize her profession. ``I couldn't possibly mistreat
the tigers,'' she contended. ``I love them. They are my everything.
If they felt mistreated, well, I am alone in the ring. They could
do anything they wanted to do.''

   Location: The state of Ceara, covering about 90,000 square
miles, is on the northeastern Atlantic coast of Brazil. It boasts
more than 340 miles of coastline. The capital is Fortaleza, with a
population of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Varig Airlines offers weekly nonstop service
between Miami and Fortaleza. Flights (61/2 hours) depart Miami at 9
p.m. Tuesdays and Fortaleza Wednesday mornings. Contact Varig at
800-468-2744.
</P>
<P>
   When to go: Ceara is attractive year-round, with an average
daily temperature of 85 degrees. Brazil's summer is our winter, so
its warmest months are December-March. High season in Ceara is
typically December, January and July, when Brazilian schools are in
recess.
</P>
<P>
   Language: Portuguese is Brazil's primary language. Ceara gets
few North American visitors; English signage is not widespread in
Fortaleza and rare outside the metropolitan area. Restaurant menus
are more likely to offer French or Spanish translations. Even the

BARRED FROM IRAQ, POPE MAKES `VIRTUAL PILGRIMAGE' TO BIBLICAL SITE
THERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This was budgeted earlier as POPE-INTERNET) 
(bl) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Unwilling to surrender his dream of beginning a Holy Land
pilgrimage in Iraq, Pope John Paul II made a ``virtual pilgrimage''
Wednesday to Ur, the ancient city that is traditionally held to be
the birthplace of Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   ``With us, the Jews and Muslims also view the figure of Abraham
as a model of unconditional submission to the will of God,'' the
Roman Catholic leader said at his weekly general audience, which
was refashioned Wednesday into one of the most unusual ceremonies
held at the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Oak branches displayed behind the pope's throne lent a Middle
Eastern look to the ceremony, as did flames rising from three
copper pots. Next to a stone symbolizing the altar where Abraham
prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac, Vatican aides placed a copy of
a 15th-century Russian icon by Andrei Rublev depicting the three
angels who visited Abraham. The pope and others also watched a film
of biblical sites.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old pope, who leaves Thursday for Egypt to pray at
the top of Mount Sinai, where the Bible says Moses received the Ten
Commandments and which is now is home to a sixth-century Orthodox
Christian monastery, long hoped to make his first foreign trip of
the Holy Year to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In late March he plans to visit holy sites in Israel and in the
Palestinian-controlled territories.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who according to Vatican aides has a deep mystical
attachment to the biblical chronology of his pilgrimage, wanted to
begin in Ur because he intended to use Abraham, who is revered by
Muslims, Jews and Christians alike, as a symbol of reconciliation
among the three monotheistic faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Political reality intervened. Prolonged negotiations with the
government of President Saddam Hussein broke down before Christmas,
and the pope was forced to renounce the visit to Iraq. Wednesday,
he did what he could to recreate the spiritual aura of a trip
there.
</P>
<P>
   During the service, the Vatican broadcast on a huge screen a
solemn travelogue of holy sites, beginning in the Middle East with
scenic shots of Ur and the surrounding desert, moving on to
biblical paintings by Marc Chagall and ending with sixth-century
mosaics at San Vitale, a church in Ravenna. The pope watched on a
small monitor next to his armchair.
</P>
<P>
   Using a gold shell as a scoop, the pope poured incense into a
copper pot that was then placed on the rock that the pope said
signified both the sacrifice of Isaac and the place in the desert
where Christ offered to sacrifice himself.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No modern pope has visited Egypt, but the pope's desire to
spread an ecumenical message there may also be hampered by the
political and religious realities of the Middle East. The
overwhelming majority of Christians in Egypt are members of the
Coptic Church, who make up about 10 percent of Egypt's population
of 62 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hostility between Christians and Muslims reached a nadir at the
New Year, when clashes between Muslims and Copts in El Kusheh, a
village in Upper Egypt, left 19 Christians and 2 Muslims dead.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the pope angered Israeli authorities by signing a
treaty with the Palestine Liberation Organization guaranteeing the
rights of Christian religions in Palestinian-controlled territory
and warning that unilateral decisions on Jerusalem were ``morally
and legally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to pay a courtesy call on Mohamed Sayed Tantawy,
the Sheik of Al-Azhar and the highest authority to Sunni Muslims,
who are a majority in Islam. But no ecumenical events with Muslim
clerics are planned, and few at the Vatican expect a major
breakthrough in Christian-Muslim dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican is counting on the symbolism of John Paul's first
visit to the Holy Land to help spur ecumenical understanding with
other Christian churches, but the trip is not expected to make
significant progress in mending the rift between Rome and the
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   The pope will meet with Pope Shenouda III, the Coptic patriarch,
and hold an ecumenical prayer service that will include
non-Catholic Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Regular dialogue between the Vatican and the Coptic church came
to a halt in 1992, as a result of local disputes between Copts and
Coptic Catholics, a small minority branch who are loyal to Rome.
Some church experts hope the visit will at least help retrigger
those stalled talks.
</P>
<P>
   On Mt. Sinai on Saturday, John Paul II will pray at the church
of St. Catherine, but the monks there are Greek Orthodox, separate
from the Coptic Orthodox and even more wary of Rome and its claims
of papal authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a lot of cooperation among minority Christian
churches working within a Muslim majority,'' said the Rev. John
Long, an American Jesuit who has long been involved in efforts at
dialogue between the Vatican and Orthodox churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pope has put so much effort into ecumenical dialogue,''
Father Long said. ``We don't know if other popes will give it the
same priority. It's a bit sad that his initiative has not been
seized more by other churches.''

`THE HOOK': WHAT PEOPLE WILL DO TO SEE THEIR BOOK IN PRINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the things that might occur to you about the title of
Donald E. Westlake's grim new thriller, ``The Hook,'' its intended
meaning is maybe the least obvious. The book is not really a sequel
to Westlake's elegantly brutal previous novel, ``The Ax,'' about an
executive who has been downsized from his job in the paper industry
and sets about to murder those more qualified than he is for a new
position. So ``The Hook'' is not about being fired.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does this title mean a longshoreman's tool, or the gadget
once employed to drag a failing vaudevillian off the stage, or even
the bent piece of metal used to catch a fish (at least not
literally). What Westlake really means is the development in a
story plot that catches your interest, that makes up your mind to
continue reading a book. And curiously, the hook in this sense is
what's best about this new thriller and at the same time what turns
out to be wrong with it.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins this way. Bryce Proctorr, a brand-name
novelist, is doing research at a mid-Manhattan library on a book he
is having trouble getting interested in, even though he has been
paid a million-dollar-plus advance for it. What's distracting him
is his embroilment in a nasty, expensive divorce from his second
wife, Lucie.
</P>
<P>
   As Bryce leaves the library he runs into Wayne Prentice, a
fellow novelist he hasn't seen in some 25 years. How is Wayne
doing? Well, he's one of the mid-list guys whose falling sales have
ground him down. He has even tried writing under a pen name and
taking the free ride offered first-time novelists, but this is not
working any more and he can't even place his latest book.
</P>
<P>
   They decide to have drinks together, and Bryce is inspired by an
idea, a plot really. If Wayne will show him the new novel and he
likes it, he'll submit it to his editor as his own, after a little
touching up. In exchange, he'll give Wayne half his advance,
$550,000. OK?
</P>
<P>
   Gulp. OK
</P>
<P>
   There's only one condition, Bryce adds. ``My wife must be
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Wayne goes for this proposition. Backed up by his
own wife, Susan, who's getting tired of his meager income, he
contrives to meet Lucie Proctorr, takes her out to dinner and, in a
sudden shocking scene, beats her to death. The deal goes forward
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The novel then seems to take off in several intriguing
directions. First, a police detective begins to sniff around, an
aspiring novelist no less, and we wonder if and how he is going to
catch Wayne and Bryce. Then, in a development worthy of Patricia
Highsmith (``Strangers on a Train'' and ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley''), Wayne begins to enjoy being a surrogate for Bryce. He
buys the expensive Central Park West apartment that Bryce lived in
with Lucie, and he begins a new novel, ``The Shadowed Other,''
exploring the theme of duality.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the story focuses on Bryce's troubled reaction to the
murder, particularly his inability to imagine an act that he did
not commit. In a clever ending that's both surprising and
inevitable, the novel satisfyingly resolves all its many themes.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, the more troubled Bryce is by the guilt and
writer's block brought on by the death of Lucie, the more we have
to wonder about Wayne, who appears to suffer no aftershock at all
and who is able to go on blithely with his writing and his marriage
to Susan.
</P>
<P>
   The more tortured Bryce becomes by his inability to focus his
thoughts, the more vividly you recall the scene in which Wayne and
Lucie return to her apartment after dinner. Over glasses of wine
she asks him if Susan is any good in bed.
</P>
<P>
   ```Very,' he said, and put his wine glass down on the table next
to the dynasty horse, and punched Lucie as hard as he could in the
stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Where do such violence and anger come from, you wonder as you
read the detailed description of the murder that follows. Why does
Wayne never have any reaction other than not to want to talk or
think about it? Is the author saying something with this
implausibility, that while some people suffer remorse of
conscience, others have no conscience at all?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the novel doesn't stand up to such questions. It's a
diverting entertainment that delivers a second hard punch at the
end. But it's troubling that Wayne is so unbelievable. The problem
is that what he finally amounts to is a hook. Little more than the
novel's hook.

<P>
   Last year was such a good movie year _ for the most part _ that
it's a shame that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
only allows five nominations in each category. So we kind of feel
bad about saying that there are winners and losers in the Oscar
nominations, because in our hearts, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' and
``Three Kings'' were winners. That doesn't mean that they were in
Oscar's heart, as the following comparisons show. These aren't
predictions, just opinions on who gained and who lost from Oscar
nominations. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST PICTURE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules:'' Proof that academy voters read John
Irving novels, its seven nominations are likely to boost its so-far
modest ($22.7 million) box-office take. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loser &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley:'' An indication that academy voters
don't read Patricia Highsmith novels (or New York Times essays
calling it the perfect movie to end the century), its Best Picture
snub is unlikely to return it to top 10 status. &QL; 
BEST ACTOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sean Penn: Although he has criticized his peers, he was still
recognized for playing an unconventional guitarist in Woody Allen's
``Sweet and Lowdown.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loser &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey: Because he aggrandizes himself, he was ignored for
playing an unconventional comedian in Milos Forman's ``Man on the
Moon.'' &QL; 
BEST ACTRESS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore: A busy year, a British accent and a strong ad
campaign netted her a nomination for the underappreciated ``The End
of the Affair.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loser &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winona Ryder: Slowing down, playing younger and earning
pre-release buzz didn't net her a nomination for the
underappreciated ``Girl, Interrupted.'' &QL; 
BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jude Law: He squeezes in for ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' even
though lead actor Matt Damon, who was better, didn't get
nominated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loser &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cooper: He misses out despite acclaim for two
performances, in ``October Sky'' and ``American Beauty.'' &QL; 
BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Morton: Her performance as a mute woman in ``Sweet and
Lowdown'' benefits from Woody Allen movies' track record in this
category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loser &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Diaz: The best performance of her career, as a put-upon
woman in ``Being John Malkovich,'' gets passed over in favor of
co-star Catherine Keener. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST DIRECTOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spike Jonze: Colleagues pick him for his quirky, creative
``Being John Malkovich,'' despite ignoring the movie in the Best
Picture category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loser (tie) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frank Darabont: His ``The Green Mile'' wins the annual Best
Picture Nominee That Directed Itself Award. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David O. Russell: His ``Three Kings'' didn't score a single
nomination, despite receiving some of the best reviews of the year.

 &HT;    STUDENTS SKIP DRUG QUERY ON STUDENT-AID FORM
 &HT;    BY ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than 100,000 applicants for federal college
aid in the coming school year didn't answer a question about
whether they have been convicted recently of drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the students were trying to hide a conviction, federal
and college officials said Wednesday. Instead, most of the
one-fifth of the first 500,000 applicants who left the answer blank
on their aid applications were confused, they said.
</P>
<P>
   So many skipped the new question that the Education Department
has decided to let colleges promise federal grants or loans to
students who didn't answer it.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the steady flow of billions of dollars in student aid
that will eventually go mostly to colleges and universities could
have been imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who did answer the question, fewer than 1 percent
admitted to a recent conviction for possessing or selling illegal
drugs, Education Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 104 questions must be answered on the four-page
``Free Application for Federal Student Aid,'' which is filled out
each year by more than 8.5 million applicants for $50 billion in
federal grants and loans.
</P>
<P>
   The question reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``28. If you have never been convicted of any drug offense,
enter '1' in the box and go to question 29. A drug-related
conviction does not necessarily make you ineligible for aid; call
1-800-433-3243 or go to http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/q28 to find out how
to fill out this question.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the toll-free number leads to a voice-mail menu that is
supposed to help the applicant decide whether to write ``1,''
``2,'' or ``3,'' in the box. At the Web site, applicants can
download a worksheet or answer a number of questions on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question and the worksheet worked well when we
pilot-tested it with different groups of students,'' said Greg
Woods, chief operating officer of the Education Department's Office
of Student Financial Assistance Programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the context of the entire form, it was apparently
confusing,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a phone survey of 1,500 applicants who skipped the
question produced such excuses as, ``The item talked about drugs,
and I figured it didn't apply to me,'' or ``It mentioned a
worksheet and I went on to the next question, and forgot to go back
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   After July 1, a student cannot receive federal financial aid
within one year of a first conviction for possessing illegal drugs
or two years of a first conviction for selling them. The ban is
lengthened for subsequent convictions, but can be wiped out for
anyone who completes a rehabilitation program that includes at
least two unannounced drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   The department will send a stern letter to those who skipped the
question, telling them that they could be prosecuted if they fail
to report a recent drug conviction, Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't our intent to get them confused,'' said Chris
Donesa, chief of staff for Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., a leader in
successful drive to include the provision in the Higher Education
Act of 1998. ``We would like to work with the department to clarify
the form.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that a lot of students either didn't
understand the question or didn't want to answer it,'' said Dan
Lara, spokesman for the House Committee on Education and the
Workforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of ambiguity in the law, and that is reflected
in the regulations'' drafted by the department with the help of
many higher education associations, said Becky Timmons, director of
government relations for the American Council on Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew there might be kinks, but we had no idea there
would be so many,'' Timmons said. ``We ended up with worries about
the fact that some applicants might not distinguish between a
conviction and a bust that didn't lead to a conviction.''

   REPUBS (Washington) _ Gov. George W. Bush's twin losses in
Michigan and Arizona left many of his staunchest supporters and
financial backers shell-shocked on Wednesday, and some conceded
that they were no longer certain he would make it to the
nomination. The outcome set off a frenzy of recriminations from
inside and outside the campaign, including members of Congress and
the Republican National Committee who had eagerly rallied behind
Bush early on. By Richard L. Berke.

<P>
   REPUBS-NY (New York) _ Sen. John McCain's victories in Michigan
and Arizona have set the stage for the first contested Republican
primary in New York state in 20 years. But McCain faced two
problems as he turned his attention East on Wednesday _ a contest
closed to non-Republican voters and, yet again, a state electoral
system designed to favor the candidates favored by the Republican
establishment, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>

   DISCRIM (Washington) _ Racial discrimination is alleged at a

<P>
   NY-DIALLO-TRIAL (Albany, N.Y.) _ The jury began deliberating in
the case of four N.Y. City police officers charged in the shooting
death of an unarmed man. Earlier in the day, the judge instructed
jurors on how they can consider whether self defense played a role
in the officer's actions. The officers say they acted in self
defense; in his charge to the jury, the judge said the panel can
consider that even in debating the lowest charges the officers face
_ namely, criminally negligent homicide. By Jane Fritsch.

</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-U.S.-SPY (Paris) _ A report commissioned by the European
Parliament on the communications monitoring network called Echelon
says that Britain and the U.S. have used the network to gain
economic advantage, intercepting billions of commercial phone
calls, faxes and e-mails. By Suzanne Daley.

<P>
   GAZA-POPULATION (Jabalya Refugee Camp, Gaza Strip) _ The
population explosion in the Gaza Strip appears to be unrivaled in
the world. Its 1.1 million residents are expected to triple by
2025. But for the young Palestinian government, with its
conservative, male-dominated Islamic society, it is sensitive
issue. Large families are not only traditional but a point of
nationalist pride. By Deborah Sontag.

   TRADE-U.S. (Washington) _ The World Trade Organization rejected
a U.S. appeal of a ruling banning offshore tax shelters that save
American exporters billions of dollars, forcing the U.S. government
to change the law or face sanctions. The decision is a victory for
the European Union, which charged that U.S. companies like Boeing,
Caterpillar and General Motors illegally reaped a $3.6 billion
windfall from the shelters in 1999 alone. (Summary from wires) By

`TORCH-BEARERS': A DINOSAUR RETURNS WITH A SPRIGHTLY GAIT 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ The cruel toll keeps mounting in the very vivid
revival of George Kelly's ``Torch-Bearers,'' which opened at the
Greenwich House Theater here Wednesday night. There's the man who
dies shortly before the play begins, and the fellow who falls
unconscious at the end of its first act. Then there are those
lesser but undeniably painful moments of injury and humiliation,
which require the administering of smelling salts and deep breaths
of fresh air. We haven't even mentioned the damage to the
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, through it all, the title characters of this Broadway hit
of 1922 keep soldiering on _ to surprisingly delightful effect _ in
the name of art. As their indomitable leader says, in a rolling
diction that seems to carve mountains from the air, ``Whenever the
torch of essential culture has been raised, there has unfailingly
been the concomitant exactment of a human life.''
</P>
<P>
   You thought bungee jumping was dangerous. Just try participating
in community theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Torch-Bearers,'' hailed 78 years ago by Alexander
Woollcott in The New York Times as ``a cruel and enormously amusing
travesty,'' would seem since to have gone the way of so much
topical parody, straight into storage. Reading this severe, frantic
satire, you can understand why: on the page, it's cluttered and
wordy, with a sour whiff of sexism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here it is looking springtime-fresh under Dylan Baker's
direction, with a glittering cast, led by Faith Prince and Marian
Seldes, generating sustained gale-force laughter. What's more, all
that mannered period dialogue, when spoken, has a spontaneous and
devastating ring of truth. It comes from characters whose
affectations may be dated but whose self-importance is definitely
not.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk up another improbable act of resurrection to the Drama
Dept., the five-year-old theater troupe whose productions of
spurned classics (Tennessee Williams' ``Kingdom of Earth,'' George
S. Kaufman and Ring Lardner's ``June Moon'') keep proving that
theatrical dinosaurs can indeed walk the earth again, and with an
infectiously bouncy step.
</P>
<P>
   The granddaddy of such recent comedies of backstage mayhem as
``Noises Off'' and ``Full Moon Over Buffalo,'' ``The
Torch-Bearers'' follows the descent into chaos of an amateur
staging of a one-act play (variously described as tragedy and high
comedy) through its rehearsal, performance and post-production
hangover by a small-town group of aspiring sophisticates.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, better known today for his later comedy ``The Show-Off''
(and as the uncle of Grace Kelly), was a man of stern, conservative
morals, and he cast an unforgiving eye on these bourgeois poseurs,
who come under especially heavy criticism for disrupting the home
life of its happily married heroine. Yet he endowed them with
authentic, achingly funny vitality and, in the person of their
director, J. Duro Pampinelli ( Seldes), he created a monster for
all seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Possessed of steel resolve, infinite vanity and no sense of
humor, Pampinelli would probably become a business or publishing
executive today. In 1922, however, she is as much a prisoner of
provincialism as Emma Bovary was, and she has turned into a
creature of baroque pretensions and bullying condescension, able to
convince her actors that their bumbling stagecraft is indeed high
art.
</P>
<P>
   The forms that stagecraft takes get tastier and tastier. It all
begins with a casual run-through in the cozily appointed living
room of Paula Ritter (Prince), who has inherited a leading role
after the husband of a cast member inconveniently died. The
rehearsal is repeatedly waylaid by everything from gossip to the
shortsightedness of the official prompter, the much-married Nelly
Fell (Joan Copeland). Above all, there's the matter of the
performers' short attention spans.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's staging here is a marvel of congested traffic patterns,
near collisions and overlapping flurries of conversations. That
scene is only an appetizer, however, for the disastrous performance
that follows at the town Horticultural Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Seen in silhouette through the scenery flats backstage (the
versatile, mood-perfect set is by Michael Vaughn Sims), the
performance proceeds with the usual stuck doors, missed cues and
forgotten lines. It's your basic backstage theater comedy, in other
words, and yet it feels painfully and hilariously new.
</P>
<P>
   This has everything to do with the extraordinary conviction
Baker's cast members bring to their parts. Even the pratfalls, and
there are many, feel natural, because no one is talking down to his
or her character or winking at the grotesquely stylized forms of
period performance.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Blazer, who looks like a John Held drawing in Jonathan
Bixby and Gregory A. Gale's nouveau-riche 1920s costumes, as the
giddy aging ingenue; Paul Mullins as the earnest would-be aesthete
whose mustache keeps falling off; Don Mayo as the barrel-chested
leading man in love with his own voice: they're all first-rate. So
are Copeland, who brings a tartly flavored vagueness to the
infinitely distractible Nelly, and Albert Macklin as the
high-strung props man.
</P>
<P>
   Seldes, who has often turned overacting into something
approaching ballet, was made for Pampinelli. Whether picking up a
fallen doorknob with a dying-swan swoop or coiling herself like a
nettled boa constrictor, she provides her own master class in the
art of going over the top.
</P>
<P>
   If Seldes is the play's satiric soul, however, it is Prince who
gives it a heart. Looking like a cream puff of a Gibson Girl, her
Paula is a bit of a ditz, with a trace of Gracie Allen's
inflections, and she is clearly a woundable woman.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dignity and pragmatism beneath the vulnerability.
Prince carefully lays the groundwork for what might have been an
unpalatable conclusion, in which Paula's skeptical husband (David
Garrison, who does well by a thankless part) systematically
deflates her delusions of glamour.
</P>
<P>
   With three acts conflated into two, the script has been pared
judiciously, especially in its hectoring final scene. Not every
conceit works, including some tricky stabs at deconstruction
through symbolic scrambling of scenery. When a false note is
struck, as when a woman falls to the floor in convulsive
manufactured sobs, it clangs loudly.
</P>
<P>
   This is because for so much of the evening, artificiality has
appeared to come so naturally to the less-than-great pretenders of
``The Torch-Bearers.'' Kelly may have viewed his characters with
contempt, but the actors playing them here give off that
intoxicating adrenaline rush afforded by even the clumsiest
excursions onto the stage. Even embarrassed or in pain, these
characters seem to be having a high time. There is no doubt that
those of us watching them are.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Looking squarely into the camera, Amer Kamal, a
Palestinian teen-ager from East Jerusalem, delivers a message to
his Israeli friend, Yaron Avni, who will soon be drafted into the
Israeli Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that you will be a good soldier who helps his society,
who helps his people and who works for the peace process,'' Kamal
says. ``I don't want to see you in the West Bank or in Jerusalem or
in the Gaza Strip running after Palestinians and killing them. I
hope you're going to stay the Yaron I know, not to change your
opinions but go for peace and help us to work for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene is from ``Peace of Mind,'' the first documentary film
shot jointly by Israeli and Palestinian youths, chronicling a year
in their lives after returning home from an Israeli-Arab summer
camp in the Maine woods. The camp is run by Seeds of Peace, an
organization that brings young Israelis together with Palestinians
and other Arab teen-agers to build friendships and discuss ways to
resolve the conflict between their peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace of Mind,'' which will be shown a few times around New
York in the coming months, had its Israeli premiere in November
after being shown at the Hamptons International Film Festival in
October. The producers say that showings are being considered by
PBS and the Human Rights Watch International Film Festival this
summer. Israel Educational Television and the Palestinian
Broadcasting Corp. are also planning to show the movie, which the
producers hope will become a teaching tool in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary was conceived by Susan Siegel, co-executive
director of Global Action Project, an educational group that has
produced youth documentaries on social issues in the United States
as well as on conflicts in Northern Ireland and the Balkans. She
said she wanted the cameras to follow the campers when they left
their idyllic surroundings in Maine and returned to the Middle
East. ``What happens when they go back home: that's the real
story,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Producers chose four Israelis and three Palestinians, trained
them to use video cameras and to work as a team, then sent them
back to document their lives after the 1997 camp session. The film,
produced and directed by Mark Landsman, took two years to complete,
and the process produced fast friendships and heated debates.
</P>
<P>
   A major challenge was how the history of the conflict should be
presented. The two sides have opposing narratives of the same
events, and the young filmmakers struggled to meld them. They
argued over terminology and historical perceptions: Were the
Palestinians expelled from their land? Or did they flee a war
started by Arab states bent on destroying Israel?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't possible to come up with a unified history, Landsman
said. ``It doesn't exist. The Palestinian youths produced their
version of history, and the Israelis produced theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   So the film shows two separate archival sequences: the
Palestinians show the displacement of their people in the 1948
Arab-Israeli war, and the Israelis depict the return of Jews to an
ancient homeland after the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   An emotional argument about terrorism almost broke up the group.
The Palestinians grew defensive when Yossi Zilberman, an Israeli
participant, called bombers from the militant Islamic group Hamas
animals. Kamal, the Palestinian, argued that although the militants
were wrong, they had sacrificed their lives for their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boiled my blood that someone from Seeds of Peace was
defending them,'' said Zilberman, 18. A heated argument ended in
tears, threatening the project's future. Sivan Ranon, 17, an
Israeli, said of the Palestinian arguments: ``It was scary to hear
your friend talking like that. Suddenly you felt that you don't
know this person.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end a sense of common purpose kept the group together.
The movie includes a scene in which Bushra Jawabri, 18, a
Palestinian, calls her Israeli friends from her home in a West Bank
refugee camp to express sympathy after a deadly suicide bombing in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant a lot to me that she called,'' Zilberman says in the
film. ``I think that this is the first step.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Hazem Zaanoun, 17, a Palestinian from Gaza, said, ``We had
strong unity between us that really served us.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also concerns about the Israelis' impending army
service, which is compulsory in Israel after high school. ``What if
they ask me to go and be in a base in the West Bank or East
Jerusalem?'' Reut Elkobi, 17, an Israeli, asks in the film. ``I
have friends over there. God, Amer lives in East Jerusalem. Maybe
one time I will have to stop him from throwing stones at me. Is
this ever going to happen? I don't know what I'm going to do if
they put me over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jawabri, who formed a close friendship with Ranon, exchanging
home visits they documented in the film, said she was concerned
about what her Israeli friend might do when she puts on a uniform.
``Although I trust her that she really wants coexistence, what if
her government asks her to do something against the other side?''
Jawabri asked. ``I don't want to see Sivan carrying a gun in front
of me, and me carrying a stone against her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranon, for her part, said that no matter how close she was to
Jawabri, her friend's dream of returning to her refugee family's
native village inside Israel remained a barrier. ``She represents a
whole population that wants to come back and live in our place, and
that's scary,'' Ranon said. ``Her dream is my nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   That contradiction is powerfully portrayed in the film's
climactic scene, in which Jawabri visits Zilberman at his home in
Kiryat Gat, a town of immigrants built next to the ruins of her
family's village, which was destroyed in the aftermath of the 1948
war.
</P>
<P>
   The camera lingers on their faces as he leads her to an
abandoned grave of a Muslim holy man, points out trees planted over
the ruins of Arab homes, and offers her shards of pottery that were
left behind. Jawabri kneels in silent prayer near the grave and
later fills a glass jar with soil to take back to the refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   For Jawabri the visit was a jolt. The arid landscape and sandy
soil were nothing like the fertile green village fields described
to her by elders in her camp. The village homes had vanished,
giving way to the apartment buildings and industries of Kiryat Gat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really sad, and I felt bad for those people who still
have their memories and still have hope of going back,'' she said.
``I now have less hope of returning. I don't want to say it's
impossible. That's too hard to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Zilberman said: ``I tell friends that we're strong enough to
acknowledge that there was a community here, that there were people
here, with the emphasis on were. There was a war. We didn't start
it, and this is the history of the place. I was quite proud to show
Bushra my town. Now it's my place.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, he said, thrashing out painful issues with his
Palestinian friends had made him more hard-headed about the odds of
a peaceful resolution of the conflict. It will take a long time for
true reconciliation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides there are reservations about the finished film.
Zilberman and Avni, 18, wrote a letter to Landsman criticizing
portrayals that they thought were unfair to the Israelis and too
sympathetic to the Palestinians. Kamal, 17, said that Palestinian
views on Jerusalem were lacking, and Zaanoun said a broader range
of Palestinian voices should have been heard, including the
militant opinions of some people he interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Zilberman said, the project proved to be a reality
check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to know each other, for better and for worse,'' he
said. ``I'm still for peace, but I'm much more realistic. I know
what I'm up against. I'm more sober. We're all more sober.''

HAWAIIAN VOTING PRACTICE RULED DISCRIMINATORY BY SUPREME COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Declaring that ``it demeans the dignity and worth
of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own
merit,'' the Supreme Court Wednesday overturned a provision of
Hawaii's Constitution under which only descendants of the original
Hawaiians may vote for the leadership of a state agency that
administers programs and millions of dollars in public money on
their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was a surprisingly lopsided 7-2 to reject the arguments
put forward by both Hawaii and by the Clinton administration that
the voting limitation was not essentially about race but about
Hawaii's unique history and the historical obligations that flow
from it. The limitation on voting for the nine trustees of the
Office of Hawaiian Affairs was challenged by a caucasian rancher
whose own ancestors arrived in Hawaii in 1831.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the state's residents claim descent from the
people living in the islands when Capt. James Cook and his crew
became the first westerners to make landfall there in 1778, an
event that led in little more than a century to the end of the
independent Hawaiian kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ancestry can be a proxy for race,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
said in the majority opinion. ``The ancestral inquiry mandated by
the state implicates the same grave concerns as a classification
specifying a particular race by name,'' he said, adding that ``the
use of racial classifications is corruptive of the whole legal
order democratic elections seek to preserve.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the
majority's ``wooden approach'' to the case ``rests largely on the
repetition of glittering generalities that have little, if any,
application to the compelling history of the state of Hawaii.'' He
said the state's non-Hawaiian majority had adopted the provision in
1978 not to demean native Hawaiians but to recognize and protect
their special heritage. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also wrote a
dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The majority's view of the issues made this one of the more
unusual race-discrimination cases ever to come before the court.
The majority based its ruling exclusively on the 15th Amendment,
which provides that the right to vote ``shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race,
color, or previous condition of servitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15th Amendment was ratified in 1870 to guarantee that the
emancipated slaves would have the right to vote. It is rarely
invoked today because there are now powerful statutory weapons
against discrimination in access to the polls and because the
wholesale racial exclusion the amendment's framers had in mind
would be an oddity today. But Kennedy observed that ``the amendment
is cast in fundamental terms, terms transcending the particular
controversy which was the immediate impetus for its enactment.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority avoided analyzing the case under the 14th
Amendment's equal-protection guarantee, another possible basis for
the decision and one that could have had broader implications,
beyond the specific context of voting, for government programs that
confer benefits on the basis of race. Nonetheless, the court's 15th
Amendment analysis was consistent with the court's current view
that there is essentially no such thing as benign discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice Kennedy was simply following through on his notion of
colorblindness,'' Shannen W. Coffin, a lawyer who filed a
friend-of-the-court brief for the Campaign for a Color-Blind
America and other organizations that oppose affirmative action,
said in an interview Wednesday. Coffin said the decision was
``consistent with the trend of the Rehnquist court seeing
discrimination and reverse discrimination as the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Limited as it was to the unusual Hawaiian program, the decision
has no immediate implications beyond Hawaii. But it may well spur
additional challenges there to programs that benefit native
Hawaiians, of which there are many, from tuition discounts to
homesteading rights, to programs specifically funded by the income
from public land administered in trust for native Hawaiians by the
Office of Hawaiian Affairs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Theodore B. Olson, the lawyer for the plaintiff in the case,
Harold F. Rice, said in an interview: ``They've got a lot of
programs over there that have now been characterized by a 7-2
decision of the Supreme Court as classifications based on race. If
I were a legislator, I'd be thinking about whether they can be
justified under strict scrutiny,'' the constitutional standard
necessary to justify official racial distinctions under the 14th
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In the majority opinion, Kennedy said that ``we assume the
validity of the underlying administrative structure and trusts,
without intimating any opinion on that point.''
</P>
<P>
   John G. Roberts Jr., who represented the state in the Supreme
Court case, said the decision was ``very narrow and shouldn't be
hard to fix,'' either by opening the elections to everyone; making
the agency's board appointed rather than elected; or by
reorganizing the Office of Hawaiian Affairs so that it is no longer
a state agency.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said the court was undoubtedly aware that had it not
confined its analysis to the 15th Amendment, ``the stakes would
have been a lot higher, and by no means limited to Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   One question in the case, Rice vs. Cayetano, No. 98-818, was
whether the decision might do anything to undermine the special
status of Indian tribes, which conduct their own elections, are
immune from some taxes, and have a hiring and promotion preference
at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which the Supreme Court has
upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that special rights for Indian tribes were based
not on race but on their political status as ``quasi-sovereigns,''
which the elections at issue in this case ``are elections of the
state, not of a separate quasi-sovereign.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, and
Clarence Thomas. Justice Stephen G. Breyer concurred in a separate
opinion, which Justice David H. Souter joined. Breyer said the
eligibility requirement of having a single native Hawaiian ancestor
_ which over the nine generations since Cook's arrival could mean
one ancestor out of 500 _ ``goes beyond any reasonable limit'' and
was unlike any membership definition adopted by any Indian tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, the plaintiff in the case, brought his lawsuit after being
denied the right to vote in the 1996 trustee election. He lost in
both the U.S. District Court in Honolulu and in the 9th U.S.Circuit
Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, which found that the voting
restriction was ``rooted in historical concern for the Hawaiian
race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Hawaiian Affairs, established under a 1978
amendment to the state constitution, administers various funds for
the ``betterment'' of native Hawaiians, defined as those with 50
percent Hawaiian ancestry, and Hawaiians, defined as those with any
degree of descent from the original residents.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A jury of four blacks and eight whites began
deliberating Wednesday in the racially charged murder trial of four
white New York City police officers who shot and killed Amadou
Diallo, an unarmed black man, in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Justice Joseph C. Teresi began the morning by
dismissing one juror, a young white woman, for talking about the
case outside the courtroom. The first alternate, a young white male
who described himself as an activist for gay and lesbian rights,
was seated instead, joining six other white men, one white woman,
and four black women on the jury.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors began their work after more than three hours of
instructions from Teresi. Several hours after they began
deliberating, the jurors asked that the testimony of two of the
officers, Sean Carroll and Edward McMellon, be read back to them.
The other two defendants are Richard Murphy and Kenneth Boss. All
four have entered pleas of not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   They also asked for a rereading of the testimony of Schrrie
Elliott, a defense witness who had made contradictory statements on
several key points.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who fired 41 bullets at Diallo, are charged with
two counts each of second-degree murder. Each officer could be
convicted of those charges or of first-degree manslaughter or
criminally negligent homicide in relation to Diallo, and reckless
endangerment of bystanders. Their minimum penalties, if they are
convicted, range from probation to imprisonment for 15 years to
life.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating the lengthy instructions to the jury for each of the
four defendants, Teresi told the jurors in a packed courtroom that
their decision should hinge on whether or not they accepted the
defense lawyers' assertions that officers were acting in
self-defense or that the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable
doubt that the defendants had not acted in self-defense but with
recklessness and with intent to kill Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi said there should be two tests _ one subjective and the
other objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should put yourself in the shoes of each defendant and you
should consider how the situation appeared to him,'' he said. The
judge said the jurors must also consider statutes governing the use
of deadly physical force. One statute, Section 35.30, says that a
police officer is justified in using deadly force to defend himself
or a third person if he is making an arrest or preventing an escape
from custody.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has argued that such a statute does not apply to
the four officers in the current trial because the policemen said
they had planned to question Diallo, not arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also instructed jurors on Section 35.15, which says
any citizen may use deadly force if he or she ``reasonably
believes'' the action is needed to defend against an attack. Part
of the statute also allows the use of deadly force if a citizen
believes another person is in the process of committing a crime
like rape or robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors tried to bar those parts of the statute. Carroll had
testified that he believed Diallo was either a robber or a rapist
when he and the other officers tried to question him.
</P>
<P>
   The judge advised the jurors that ``a person who acts in self
defense is not guilty of a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's parents, who have been in court each day since the
trial began, left the courtroom Wednesday without speaking to
reporters. But the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has accompanied the
parents, told reporters, ``They are praying for the best and
looking forward to moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, supporters on both sides of the case
carried on what have become daily demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the street, behind a police barricade, about 40
supporters of the defendants carried placards reading ``Justice for
Police Officers,'' ``Cops Don't Get Paid to Die,'' and ``Stop the
Witchhunt.''

`OPEN UP AND SAY AHHHHH' WITH MACARONI MAGIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's at least one day in your week when you have not one
spare minute to think about dinner. Getting kids from ballet to
soccer to piano, with stops in between to get materials necessary
for yet another class project, pretty much removes any hope for
thinking up a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a great recipe _ pulled from the Fort Worth Health
Department's ``Open and Say Ahhhh'' cookbook _ to make on Saturday
or Sunday to stick in the freezer, then heat up Wednesday. It's
incredibly cheesy, so a nice salad might offer some balance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MACARONI AND CHEESE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 10 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 large package macaroni
</P>
<P>
   1 stick butter
</P>
<P>
   1 pint sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1 pint heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   Dash salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   Dash white pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup salsa
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds grated Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   Cook macaroni in water with a little oil and salt. Drain and set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a pan, melt the stick of butter, add sour cream, heavy cream,
Worcestershire, salt, garlic powder, white pepper and salsa. Blend
in most of the cheese, reserving just enough to sprinkle on top of
the casserole. Add macaroni and stir well.
</P>
<P>
   Put mixture in a large, greased casserole dish, top with
reserved cheese, cover with heavy foil or layers of plastic and
freeze. Defrost on serving day and bake, covered with foil, for 40
minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 10 minutes, then
serve.

 &HT;     McCAIN'S COALITION FACES MARCH 7 CHALLENGE 
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL and DAN FREEDMAN   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain is walking a political tightrope
as he strives to expand his coalition of Republicans, independents
and Democrats in the ``Super Tuesday'' primary contests with Texas
Gov. George W. Bush on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   The feisty Arizona Republican needs the votes of traditional
Republicans who will decide the outcome in GOP-only contests in
California, New York and Connecticut. At the same time, McCain
needs the votes of non-Republicans in 10 other states that allow
them to participate in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   James W. Davis, a political science professor at Washington
University in St. Louis, says McCain faces a delicate balancing act
in the days ahead, trying to woo Republicans without alienating the
independents who can take part in contests in the smaller states.
</P>
<P>
   `McCain has to find a way to make himself more attractive to
Republicans without cutting off his links to independents and
Democrats,'' Davis said. ``That's a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   George Edwards, director of the Center for Presidential Studies
at Texas A&AMP;M University, said McCain is enhancing his appeal to
Republicans, by touting his conservative credentials and opposition
to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to win Republicans,'' said Edwards, who noted that
McCain couldn't rely on the same crossover coalition to win in the
GOP-only primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University in New
Jersey, said McCain has already begun to don the ``mantle of
orthodox Republicanism'' in hopes of winning support from
traditional Republicans in the big-state contests.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has to ``send a message to Republicans that he's the one
who can attract the crossover vote'' to help overcome Republicans'
resistance to a McCain agenda that is ``heretical to Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   States with GOP contests on March 7 include three with GOP-only
primaries; four states permit Republicans and independents to cast
ballots in the GOP primary; and six states permit votes by
Republicans, independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McCain stepped up his appeals to Republicans on Wednesday
following victories in Michigan and Arizona, by emphasizing that
his ``governing coalition'' of Republicans, independents and
Democrats stands a better chance of retaking the White House from
the Democrats in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a pragmatic viewpoint, I am electable,'' McCain said on
ABC News' ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   A new poll by the Gallup organization for USA TODAY and CNN
showed McCain ahead of Vice President Al Gore, the leading
contender for the Democratic presidential nomination. The national
poll showed McCain with 59 percent to Gore's 35 percent in a
hypothetical general election matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in California, said that the Republican-only
primaries in California, New York and Connecticut would play to his
advantage on March 7. Bush spied a ``silver lining'' in his defeat
in Michigan, noting that he ``overwhelmingly'' won 67 percent of
the Republicans who voted _ the kind of voters permitted to cast
ballots in the upcoming closed GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 13 GOP contests being held on March 7 are
winner-take-all races, in which the winner walks away with all the
convention delegates offered by the state regardless of the margin
of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the states are holding rival Democratic primaries,
however, that could entice independent voters to forego McCain's
insurgency to cast ballots instead in the race between Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   McCain powered his upset victories in New Hampshire and Michigan
with his ability to sweep two-thirds of the votes of independents
and four out of five of the Democrats who cast ballots in the GOP
primaries. Both states allowed non-Republican voters to participate
in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came back in South Carolina to overwhelm McCain on Feb. 19
by capturing 69 percent of an unprecedented GOP turnout and nearly
doubling his take of independents, from the 19 percent that Bush
garnered in New Hampshire to 34 percent in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leads McCain in delegates awarded by the six states that
have held contests since Jan. 24. Bush has 105 delegates; McCain
has 95 delegates, including 82 won Tuesday in Michigan and Arizona;
magazine publisher Steve Forbes, who has withdrawn from the race,
has two delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen states, led by California, New York and Ohio, hold GOP
contests on March 7 to select 613 delegates, or 59 percent of the
1,034 delegates needed by a candidate to win the GOP nomination at
the Republican national convention in Philadelphia in July.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Super Tuesday delegates, 288 delegates or 47 percent will
be chosen in the closed primaries in California, New York and
Connecticut where only the votes of registered Republicans will be
counted.
</P>
<P>
   But in 10 other states choosing 325 delegates, non-Republicans
such as independents can take part in states stretching from Maine,
Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island in New England, to Ohio and
Missouri in the heartland and west to Minnesota and Washington.
This means that some 53 percent of the delegates chosen on March 7
will be in primaries where non-Republicans play a role.
</P>
<P>
   Because he's the top choice of Republican voters in the
primaries so far, Bush enjoys many advantages going into Super
Tuesday. He can concentrate his efforts and campaign spending on
only two states _ New York and California _ and hope to sway those
two GOP-only primaries that will choose 25 percent of the delegates
needed to win the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is building his state-by-state organization upon the
organizations of the 175 House members, 38 senators and 26
governors who have endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls completed before McCain's victories in
Michigan and Arizona, held promise for Bush, as well. The surveys
showed Bush leading McCain in five of the seven states where polls
have been conducted in recent weeks, including California and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's campaign still has legs.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a Marist Institute survey conducted before his
victories in Michigan and Arizona showed McCain pulling almost even
with Bush in the state. The survey showed McCain trailing Bush, 43
percent to 46 percent among likely Republican voters despite GOP
Gov. George Pataki's formidable organizational support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, responding to the survey, said that he was on ``very,
very good footing, particularly among the northeastern states.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a survey in Connecticut completed Feb. 15, showed
McCain leading Bush by 13 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said McCain could still stage an upset in California,
where only the votes of registered Republicans will be counted in
the award of GOP convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   California is ``more unpredictable'' than many states because it
has ``a reputation of being a free spirit state,'' Baker said,
adding: ``If I were McCain, I'd spend more time in California than
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' campaign travel plans reflect the stakes. McCain
has scheduled forays to Ohio, Georgia and Virginia in the coming
week, before returning to California for non-stop campaigning
before the March 7 vote. McCain won the support last week of
California Secretary of State Bill Jones, who abandoned his earlier
endorsement of Bush to back McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's courtship of California will be matched by Bush, who
plans trips to Virginia, Georgia, New York, Ohio and Missouri
before returning to California before the March 7 contest.

&HT;     NAVY CHIEF WARNS OF ARREST OF VIEQUES PROTESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Navy Secretary Richard Danzig said Wednesday that
protesters occupying a military bombing range on the small Puerto
Rico island of Vieques may be arrested and forcibly removed so that
the Navy can resume training there.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the protesters are taking an ``illegal action''
and are ``trespassing'' on federal property, Danzig said any
decision to remove them would have to be made by the U.S.
Department of Justice and the government of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the prospects that we will have to take action
with respect to some protesters are significant,'' Danzig told
reporters. ``We tried to be, and continue to be, patient with
respect to that issue,'' Danzig said of the protesters. The Navy,
he said, wants a political solution to take hold and not ``inflame
the situation by the kinds of arrests that need to be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred protesters occupying a portion of the bombing
range are demanding that the Navy and Marine Corps stop shelling
the island.
</P>
<P>
   The protests began last April when a civilian Puerto Rican
security guard was killed in a bombing accident. Bombing and
shelling of the 900-acre target range have been suspended since
then, despite efforts by Navy officials to persuade President
Clinton to allow training to resume there.
</P>
<P>
   Under current plans, the Navy will not use the Vieques range
next month for the first phase of training the battle group led by
the carrier USS George Washington, which is headed for the
Mediterranean later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Cmdr. Brian Cullin, a spokesman for Danzig, said the carrier
is scheduled to undergo a second phase of training in late April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could still do that at Vieques if we are able to get access
to the live impact area,'' Cullin said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Puerto Rico, in a letter to President Clinton
last month, vowed support for ``federal efforts to assure that
trespassing or other intrusions on the range cease entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, Pedro Rossello, and President Clinton have agreed
to allow the Navy to resume limited training using ``dummy'' bombs
as soon as protesters can be cleared, while giving the island's
9,400 residents $40 million and the return of 8,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the deal calls for a referendum, likely to be held
in 2001, that will give Vieques residents two stark choices: let
the Navy stay indefinitely and resume exercises, including the use
of live munitions, and in return receive an additional $50 million;
or, direct the Navy to withdraw from the island by May 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon considers the facility crucial for training Navy
pilots, gunnery specialists and Marines in so-called live-fire
exercises using actual ammunition. However, the USS Eisenhower
battle group departed last Friday for the Mediterranean and Persian
Gulf without live-fire training on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts by the government of Puerto Rico and the White
House to work out a compromise agreement, anti-Navy protests have
continued in Puerto Rico. In one of the biggest demonstrations in
San Juan in several years, 85,000 people marched Monday to protest
the planned resumption of U.S. Navy bombing. And on Tuesday nine
people were arrested _ including a New York City councilwoman _
after they demonstrated outside the United Nations to protest the
same issue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread opposition in Puerto Rico, Danzig said that
he was confident the bombing would resume sometime before the
referendum is held and that many of the protesters will willingly
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the question is can the Navy repair the
relationships with the people in Vieques well enough in the
interval that we can resume operations there in way that would
permit effective training? I think that, yes, there is some
possibility of that,'' Danzig said.

`THE TURN OF THE SCREW':   REVISITING HENRY JAMES,   LOOKING FOR

<P>
   ``The Turn of the Screw,'' Henry James' most popular and least
typical work of fiction, returns this weekend with all its
perplexities intact. Are those well-bred but unfathomable children
in the grip of mischievous forces, or are they just mischief
makers? Is its hapless heroine, their governess, shaken by the
wickedness of the world or unstrung by her own emotional fragility?
Are a former valet and a former governess, both dead, figments of
the heroine's distraught mind or something more palpable and
malevolent?
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of this matters at all to television viewers must
depend on the chill factor. If it is not chilling, then it is
flapdoodle. Alas, you have to be highly susceptible to get much of
a tingle out of Sunday's ``Masterpiece Theater'' version.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the periodic scenes of the unstable governess running
around the stately mansion bearing a candle that does little to
lighten the gloomy staircase and corridors, the apparitions or
ghosts are not particularly spooky; they deliver baleful looks and
vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the children particularly threatening. Their main
offense seems to be that they are too polite. Jodhi May, as the
poor governess, spends most of the 90 minutes looking furtive,
suspicious and slightly demented, as well as scared of her own
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   She is also a touch too fast jumping to dire conclusions. No
sooner does she learn that young Miles has been expelled from his
school than she assumes that he is a source of corruption. ``What
else can it be?'' she asks. But who is corrupting whom, and about
what? Are the children in cahoots with ghosts? Is the devil at his
dirty work?
</P>
<P>
   Weekly churchgoing by the entire staff of the big house does not
help to clarify matters, but the governess utters a prayer that
gives the story its title. Reflecting on the nature of evil, she
concludes, ``victory depends on only another turn on the screw of
human virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   For what that means or has to do with the plot, best refer to
James.  &QL;

   ``Life Stories: Profiles From `The New Yorker' '' &QL;

   This month marks the 75th anniversary of The New Yorker, and the
venerable magazine didn't survive three-quarters of a century by
printing bad material. But what ``Life Stories: Profiles from `The
New Yorker' '' (and its companion volume, ``Wonderful Town: New
York Stories From The New Yorker)'' reminds us is just how much
exceptionally good writing the publication has given us over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Stories'' collects some of The New Yorker's best
profiles, written about some of the most interesting people of our
time by some of the finest writers. It's mesmerizing to go directly
from Wolcott Gibbs' staccato ``Time ... Fortune ... Life ... Luce''
(written in 1936 about publishing magnate Henry Robinson Luce) to
Ian Frazier's chatty, sympathetic ``Nobody Better, Better Than
Nobody'' (1983, introducing readers to Ponce Cruse Evans, better
known to her fans as Heloise II). Neither the writing styles nor
the subjects nor the profiles could be more different; yet because
each is so well-crafted, it's easy to segue from Gibbs to Frazier,
and from them to Janet Flanner on Isadora Duncan and Calvin Trillin
on Edna Buchanan and Kenneth Tynan on Johnny Carson _ 25 in all,
and an argument can be made for any one as the best of the lot.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, The New Yorker's editorial devotion to detailed,
uniquely written profiles set the course for a journalistic
generation. Hunter Thompson's 1970s story-screeds about Richard
Nixon in Rolling Stone probably wouldn't have been possible. Jack
Olsen's groundbreaking series in Sports Illustrated about racism on
American playing fields and in locker rooms might never have seen
print. The New Yorker proved that readers responded when writers
were not bound by editorial guidelines, besides the need to get
facts right and to write well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet among such scintillating company, three profiles deserve
special mention.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, John Lahr makes Roseanne Barr seem sympathetic in
1995's ``Dealing With Roseanne:'' ``By the time she was 26 she was
caring for three children under the age of four ... in a house that
occupied 600 square feet. As she later joked, `I breed well in
captivity.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Patterson is now a punch-drunk, forgotten former
heavyweight boxing champion, but A.J. Liebling made him special in
1954's ``Wunderkind:'' ``(Fighting Joey Maxim), Patterson had
wasted much time in aimless body-weaving, and often launched
himself through the air like a man trying to get through a closing
subway door before the train pulled out.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all may be Lillian Ross' 1950 sojourn in New York City
with Ernest Hemingway and his family: ``In the elevator, Hemingway
looked even bigger and bulkier than he had before, and his face had
the expression of a man who is being forcibly subjected to the
worst kind of misery. A middle-aged woman standing next to him
stared at his scraggly white beard with obvious alarm and
disapproval. `Good Christ!' Hemingway said suddenly, in the silence
of the elevator, and the middle-aged woman looked at her feet.''
</P>
<P>
   It is barely possible someone might read ``Life Stories'' and
dislike one or two of its 25 selections. But it is impossible to
imagine anyone not being entertained, and often thrilled, by most
of them.
</P>
<P>
   This is a book every dedicated reader must own.

<P>
   HAMPTON, Va. _ ``Up, Jasmine, up!'' the trainer said, using
sheer force of will to urge the 400-pound Bengal tiger to try her
signature trick. Jasmine paused a bit _ milking the crowd as usual
_ then at long last reared to her seven-foot height, then hopped on
her hind legs right across the cage. The crowd of 6,200 in the
Hampton Coliseum, which had been holding its breath, offered
thunderous applause.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking a bow, the trainer, Sara Houcke, extended her
slender fingers and dropped a meat treat into the palisade of 30
sharp teeth that was Jasmine's gaping mouth. Then she gave the
tiger a big hug. As she ruffled Jasmine's fur, the tiger was
actually purring, as if this predator were an outsize tabby cat.
</P>
<P>
   Houcke _ her name is pronounced hook _ is blond, 22, and the
star of the 130th edition of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP;
Bailey Circus. In an era when circuses are routinely picketed by
animal-rights activists, her gentle, low-key performance is being
served up as the animal-friendly, gender-forward entertainment for
the arena age.
</P>
<P>
   In one respect Houcke is nothing more or less than a headliner
performing in a touring show that is the only live entertainment
regularly seen by millions of Americans every year. But she is also
the embodiment of the improbable adaptability of the circus, an
ancient celebration of the interaction of humans and animals that
has somehow managed to remain relevant to the ticket-buying impulse
of U.S. audiences since the 18th century. Last year the Ringling
show, which has spanned three centuries now, played to 27 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh generation of a European circus dynasty, Houcke is
taking the center ring without relying on the classic props of the
testosterone-happy tiger trainer. Bullwhips are out, as are white
chairs, pistols loaded with blank rounds, flaming hoops and
gimmicky multistage pedestals. Her performance is the antithesis of
the classic rapid, slick, trick-bound tiger show. With supreme
assurance this 5-foot 10-inch 140-pound trainer goes one on one
with her eight cats in a slow dance, as intimacy underlines her
vulnerability to the overwhelming 8-to-1 majority.
</P>
<P>
   Not since another blond _ Gunther Gebel-Williams, the electric
lord of the rings who retired from performing 10 years ago _ has
Ringling made such a fuss over a tiger trainer. Not only is Houcke
on the cover of the new Ringling program, but her image is the
centerpiece of Ringling posters and a multimillion-dollar
television advertising campaign for the Blue Show _ one of its two
separate circus units _ that is wending its way north to Madison
Square Garden, its traditional opening-night arena, on March 16
after performances in the Meadowlands in New Jersey and at the
Nassau Coliseum in Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   After Gebel-Williams arrived in the United States from Germany
on Jan. 6, 1969, ``his act was considered revolutionary, because he
rejected the `fighting style' of training,'' said Greg Parkinson,
executive director of the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis.
``Gunther's style then became the standard across the globe.''
Although the charismatic Gebel-Williams never cast the cats as his
enemies, he was the epitome of the dominant male in the center
ring, encouraging tigers to jump through flaming hoops and ascend
elaborate pedestals.
</P>
<P>
   Now the advent of Houcke ``is the biggest departure from
Gunther's European style of presentation over the last 30 years,''
Parkinson said. ``Billing her as the star of the show takes
Ringling into new territory.'' It is also dangerous territory.
Given tigers' unpredictability, betting the circus on Houcke is a
high-stakes gamble.
</P>
<P>
   To the audience, Houcke's style ``looks very easy,'' said
Gebel-Williams, 65, the avatar of tiger training, now a Ringling
vice president. ``But to be gentle with the cats, this is quite
difficult. It is easier to control them with authority rather than
being gentle. You can never forget that these are tigers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark and I are concerned for her safety,'' Gebel-Williams
added, referring to his son, Mark Oliver Gebel, who presents tigers
and elephants on the Red Show, the other touring unit. ``I keep
telling her she needs to be more of a tough guy with the cats.'' So
far Houcke has ``only a scratch or two from playing with them,''
she said, adding that the tigers purr to her ``and I purr back,''
adding: ``If they aren't purring, I know I should stay away. I'm
very sensitive to their moods.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are moods. The big cats have maimed or killed many
trainers, most famously Alfred Schneider, who made circus history
in 1925 by presenting 40 lions at once. A lion named Othello killed
him in 1941. (Lions are less popular in circuses these days.)
Richard Chipperfield, one of Houcke's predecessors on the Blue
Unit, was severely injured in 1998. At a publicity session Arnold,
a normally well-behaved 350-pound tiger Chipperfield had raised
from a cub, suddenly took a large bite out of his skull;
Chipperfield, 24, has still not fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the mauling his 28-year-old brother and tiger-act
partner, Graham Thomas Chipperfield, used a shotgun to kill the
tiger in its cage. After an investigation Florida officials
declined to press animal-cruelty charges against the brother, who
retired from Ringling. Of Richard Chipperfield, Houcke said: ``You
just can't think about that. I trust the tigers. They trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ringling is clearly trying to make the most of Houcke in the
show. In addition to her tiger presentation, she directs a ring of
five elephants and bids the crowd welcome and farewell from atop a
pachyderm. ``I view Sara as an icon, associated with our circus for
a lot of years to come,'' said Kenneth Feld, Ringling's producer
and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held Ringling show, which brings in some $600
million in annual revenue, ``has a core audience composed of moms
and their children,'' said Tim Holst, vice president for talent and
production. ``What better time to have a woman tiger trainer?''

 &HT;    OHIO FINDS MORE LISTERIA IN CHICKEN NUGGETS
 &HT;    By SOFIA BASSO and ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Investigators have found more Gold Kist chicken
nuggets used in school lunch programs contaminated with Listeria, a
potentially deadly pathogen, the Ohio Department of Agriculture
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gold Kist said Wednesday it was recalling chicken
nuggets shipped to Texas and four other states. The Atlanta-based
company's statement said the recalled product was processed on the
same day as the lot sent to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether anyone has gotten sick from eating the
chicken nuggets. Government officials say Listeria is killed if the
chicken is cooked to at least 160 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gold Kist and officials at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) did not return repeated telephone calls. Federal
officials issued a brief statement last week saying they were
sending investigators to the Gold Kist plant in Alabama where the
nuggets were processed. It is not known whether the government or
the company intends to test lots produced on other days.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Kist has a contract with the federal government to supply
chicken nuggets through the federal commodities program to school
lunch programs in about 30 states.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio tests were done after several U.S. Agriculture
Department food safety inspectors in Boaz and Guntersville,
Alabama, where the chicken nuggets are produced, alleged two weeks
ago that the product was made in part from diseased birds. Although
the inspectors said the chicken nuggets posed no health risk, Ohio
officials decided to test the nuggets anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio officials said their first positive sample was taken from
an opened bag of nuggets stored at a Dayton warehouse. Although
Ohio tested 96 lots, only one was contaminated. They decided to
retest three sealed bags from the contaminated lot to rule out to
possibility that the nuggets had been contaminated after they
reached the warehouse. One of the three sealed bags contained
contaminated product, according to the state.
</P>
<P>
   It was after this second discovery of Listeria that Gold Kist
recalled product shipped to Texas, Colorado, Virginia, Maryland and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The 114,000 pounds of chicken nuggets and patties processed the
same day as the tested ones will be sent back to the Gold Kist
plant in Alabama, according to Dorothea Howe, spokeswoman for the
Ohio Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``That helps the school districts in terms of not having to sit
with that product. We can return it,'' said Howe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly not going to serve it to the schools,'' Howe
said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general at the U.S. Agriculture Department has
opened an investigation into the department's handling of food
safety inspections at the two Gold Kist plants in Alabama,
according to a report in Food Chemical News, a trade publication.
The report has not been disputed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   A week before Ohio officials discovered Listeria in Gold Kist
nuggets, Thomas Billy, head of the U.S. Agriculture Department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service, issued a press release saying
that Gold Kist chicken nuggets were ``safe and wholesome.'' The
U.S. Agriculture Department also has told school food service
officials in several states that there are no problems with Gold
Kist products.
</P>
<P>
   After the Listeria discovery, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's only comment was a one-paragraph statement saying
that the agency is ``very concerned'' and is sending investigators
to the plant and to the Dayton warehouse where the contaminated
product was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Smith-DeWaal, food safety director for the
Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest, said
Wednesday that the government has failed generally to respond to
the threat of Listeria.
</P>
<P>
   Smith-DeWaal said that although Listeria is ``one of the most
dangerous food-borne illnesses,'' the government is not requiring
plants such as Gold Kist to test regularly for the pathogen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We formally petitioned the USDA last month to ask that all
plants that produce ready-to-eat meat or poultry products test both
their plants and their products for Listeria because it is such a
serious hazard,'' Smith-DeWaal said. She said the government has
not responded.

 HAMPTON, Va.: tiger trainer?''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houcke makes her entrance in a shimmering white suit as she
stands atop a lumbering six-ton elephant (not an insurmountable
challenge for one who did acrobatics atop a galloping camel at age
11). Her tiger extravaganza in the 15-foot-high steel-mesh cage is
the centerpiece of the show's first act, in which she emerges
Venus-like from a mirrored ball. Transported aloft by a trapeze,
she is deposited in the 45-foot-wide tiger cage, so she can welcome
the cats to the center ring.
</P>
<P>
   She arrays the five male and three female cats by uttering
commands in English and German. Houcke offers the tigers beef
treats by hand from a sequined beige bag, instead of rewarding the
cats with food at the end of a long stick, as generations of
trainers have done. ``The interesting thing about her style is that
she stays back, and the cats come to her,'' said Holst. ``It shows
a relationship, and a calmness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ringling publicity machine has dubbed her the ``Tiger
Whisperer,'' a nod toward Robert Redford's film portrayal of a
trainer who had a gift with horses. She smiled when asked about
that designation, then said, ``After being with tigers for 24 hours
a day, you really can understand what they are saying, and you feel
what they're feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We whuffle together,'' she said, describing the chuffing sound
cats make. She described it as a backward whistle, sort of a
sighing intake of the breath. ``Perhaps I'm the tiger whuffler,''
she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the spotlight Houcke's far-from-glamorous days with
the cats begin before 7 a.m. when she feeds them, cleans their
cages and cuts up 80 to 120 pounds of beef and 20 pounds of
chicken. She does this herself (though two cat wranglers help her
transport the tigers) for training continuity, ``since you can't
just see them in the cage and that's it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If Houcke is the first contemporary female Ringling tiger
honcho, the circus has presented tiger-training women before, most
notably Mabel Stark, a star in the 1920s and '30s who kept on
mesmerizing audiences in other shows until the 1960s, despite being
maimed 18 times.
</P>
<P>
   Holst said he had long sought a woman for the tiger cage, and
Houcke said that independently she had been wondering about working
with cats. At a meeting three years ago in Massy, France, where she
was presenting a solo horse act, the two had a tiger chat. Holst
invited her to join the Red Unit as a zebra trainer last year;
soon, at Ringling's behest, she began honing her tiger skills with
Josip Marcan, a veteran Hungarian trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Houcke had never before worked with cats, she had the
example of her great-uncle, Gilbert Houcke, a legendary European
tiger trainer. Her great-great-aunt Sarah Rancy, for whom she was
named, ``performed with tigers in the 1930s,'' Houcke said. ``I
guess it's in the genes.''
</P>
<P>
   The inheritance is multigenerational. Houcke's father, Sacha _
whose wire-walking ancestors were touring Europe in circus wagons
in the 18th century _ was performing in a circus as a Cossack rider
when he met the woman who would become Houcke's mother, an
English-born dancer, in a casino show in Beirut. The two married
and while they were touring in Torquay, England, Sara was born in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 4 months Sacha put her on a horse, and by age 2
Houcke had made her debut before a circus audience in Switzerland,
taking the role of a child in a haunted-house clown act. At 6 she
rode her first elephant in the ring and by 16 was performing an act
with dolphins and seals.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Judith Benson, is divorced and now working for the
Ringling one-ring circus, Kaleidoscape. Houcke's 16-year-old
sister, Karin, has not yet evinced any tiger-training ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Houcke speaks four languages, and her English has the slightest
pan-European accent. Performers who know her say that Houcke goes
her own way. ``When I was 17, I was offered a chance to work in an
act with a pygmy hippo and buffaloes,'' she said, ``so I went on
the road by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   During interviews she was ready with a bubbly smile and a
self-deprecating laugh, but if Houcke were to inspire a Mattel doll
it would be Tongue-Stud Barbie. (Hers is made of surgical steel.)
Not only is her navel pierced, each ear is adorned with three
diamond studs. Rejecting the circus train, Houcke pilots her own
40-foot Travel Supreme house trailer.
</P>
<P>
   She had a relationship with a significant noncircus other for
four years, ``but life is easier now that I don't have a
boyfriend,'' she said. ``I am my own person, making my own money,
and a lot of guys seem to want to be the dominant one. But I won't
give up the circus for any man.''
</P>
<P>
   And she will not leave the tiger cage because animal-rights
protesters criticize her profession. ``I couldn't possibly mistreat
the tigers,'' she contended. ``I love them. They are my everything.
If they felt mistreated, well, I am alone in the ring. They could
do anything they wanted to do.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Sen. John McCain, the California primary is a
glittering dream and a surreal nightmare. From the beginning,
McCain's improbable quest was to win the primary election here in
his neighboring state, inherit the western cowboy mantle of his
political hero Ronald Reagan and become the Republican Party's
all-but-inevitable nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that McCain could win more total votes than his
rival Gov. George W. Bush in the nation's most populous state, and
yet lose all 162 of California's Republican delegates, 15 percent
of the total needed for the nomination. That is because only the
votes of registered Republicans will count toward selecting
Republican delegates, who are allocated on a winner-take-all basis,
though the names of all candidates will appear on the same ballot
regardless of party, and voters of any party may pick any
candidate. The coded ballots, specifying a voter's party, will be
counted twice, once for the nonbinding popular vote and a second
time by the parties for the purpose of selecting delegates to the
two conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a real shootout here,'' said Bill Carrick, a
prominent Democratic consultant in Los Angeles. ``I would think
that a likely outcome is Gore finishes first, McCain finishes
second, Bush finishes third and Bradley finishes fourth, but Bush
wins all the delegates. That creates a huge political problem for
the Republicans, because these newer, younger voters, these McCain
crossovers who could be likely Republican prospects, are going to
be angry at the party if they find out their votes don't count.''
</P>
<P>
   California is merely the biggest of a string of similar
challenges for McCain, whose strong showings in the early primaries
have depended heavily on his ability to draw Democrats and
independents to his insurgent campaign. In the next two weeks, 700
Republican delegates are at stake, and fewer than half will be
chosen in contests open to all voters. Both the New York and
Florida primaries are closed contests where voting is restricted by
party, and the biggest remaining open primary is in Bush's home
state of Texas on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is sparing no effort here and plans to spend 6 of the
next 12 days before the primary in California, beginning on
Thursday with a stop in Sacramento and a couple of fund-raisers. In
his victory speech in Phoenix on Tuesday night, the senator had
barely thanked his supporters for wins in Arizona and Michigan
before pronouncing himself ``a proud Reagan conservative'' and
telling them: ``We need you to help carry our winning message to
our friends in California, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's maverick message of campaign finance overhaul and
iconoclasm would seem tailor-made for California, where voters
consistently support ballot measures to shake up government and
rein in their elected officials. Since 1990, voters who decline to
state a party registration have grown from just over 9 percent of
the electorate to nearly 14 percent now. But as in other states,
Bush long ago locked up the support of virtually the entire elected
Republican establishment, which has not had a statewide victory
here since former Gov. Pete Wilson's re-election in 1994 and is
hungry for a winner.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Looking at it as a laboratory experiment, and imagining New
York and California as two petri dishes, you'd think McCain could
grow in them,'' said Nelson Warfield, a Republican political
consultant in Washington not affiliated with either candidate.
``But watching what actually happens on the ground is another
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest statewide poll by the nonpartisan Public Policy
Institute of California, conducted before the South Carolina and
Michigan contests, found McCain had doubled his overall standing
since January, and trailed Bush by single digits overall, but was
still drawing just over half his support from registered
Republicans. Bush still led by nearly 2 to 1 among likely
Republican voters (though in January, the ratio was 5 to 1).
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that McCain doesn't have the opportunities
that he had here in New Hampshire or South Carolina or Michigan,''
said Mark Baldassare, the institute's survey director. ``At the
same time, California will be the first big test in the nation of
how candidates will do among all voters, and it's going to give
people a sense of how well a Republican is going to do in this
Democratic state. If McCain does well in the beauty contest, I
think that would be a tremendous boost for him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's political director, John Weaver, said the campaign's
strategy in California would be ``geared to winning the
delegates,'' by ``connecting the dots between campaign finance
reform, military reform, a middle-class tax cut and paying down the
debt.'' He called California and New York, which also holds its
primary March 7, ``the bookends'' of the coming race.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The highest ranking state Republican official, Secretary of
State Bill Jones, whose daughter Andrea is McCain's national youth
coordinator, defected from the Bush camp to McCain last week,
saying the senator was the candidate best suited to winning
California for the Republicans. The McCain camp conducted a drive
aimed at persuading 35,000 Democrats and independents to
re-register as Republicans before the deadline two weeks ago.
Preliminary figures from the secretary of state's office show an
increase of 21,578 in Republican registration over the last month,
though officials said today that it was impossible to tell how many
of those were party-switchers.
</P>
<P>
   The grandest dame of California Republicans, Nancy Reagan, has
stayed officially neutral, although she has never been close to the
Bush family and remains friendly with former Reagan aides who now
support McCain, like former White House chief of staff Kenneth M.
Duberstein.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the challenges for the McCain camp are formidable. In the
recent Public Policy Institute poll, he ran strongest overall
against Bush in the areas around San Francisco and Los Angeles,
while losing badly in the inland Central Valley. Vice President Al
Gore still held an overall edge among independents, and in contrast
to Michigan, Democrats here will have a contest of their own to
settle between Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley and may be less
inclined to stray to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the nature of people who vote in primaries, in
both parties they are far more educated voters, far more loyal
voters, and they know far more about their candidates,'' said
Stephen Kinney, a veteran Republican consultant and pollster here.
``To get to them is a lot more difficult, to try to persuade them
away from where their thinking was a few months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wick, 28, an architect in Los Angeles, who voted for Bill
Clinton as an independent in the last two elections, said he
registered as a Republican for the coming primary more to vote
against Bush than as an avid McCain supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is stuff I actively like about him,'' Wick said of
McCain. ``I like his views on campaign finance reform. I like the
fact that he doesn't seem to be a slave to the ideas of his party,
and his thoughts are really his own. But if you're asking me if I'd
vote for McCain or Gore in the general election, I'd vote for
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Shrawder, 32, a private preschool teacher smoking a
cigarette outside the Networks Cafe at MTV's West Coast
headquarters in Santa Monica on Wednesday, is a registered Democrat
also considering voting for McCain. She too said it was mostly an
anti-Bush feeling that drove her, but she did not know that her
vote would not count in the selection of Republican delegates. ``I
think it's still important for people who have an opinion to
express it,'' she said before allowing that she might vote for Gore
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Bush still has more money to spend on California's expensive
television advertising, though McCain's recent fund raising has
made him more competitive. And momentum, which has been McCain's
best friend all winter, is once again with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that our campaign is similar to Douglas
MacArthur's island-hopping in the Pacific,'' said Ken Khachigian, a
veteran Republican strategist here who is working for McCain.
``Each victory depends on the previous one on your way back to the
mainland.''

   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia _ In one of the hundreds of tents thrown
up on a wind-whipped treeless plain to house Chechen war refugees
here, a handful of youngsters perched in a semicircle on wooden
stools Tuesday afternoon and revealed to a curious visitor their
fondest hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Zura, blond and girlish at age 10, was decisive. ``I want no
war,'' she said firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister Toita, a 5-year-old with piercing gray eyes, was more
reticent. ``I want to be home,'' she finally said. ``In Grozny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the war to be finished,'' said Mahl-Azni, another
5-year-old girl who had been staring silently at the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to play again with the boys on my street,'' said
Tselim, a talkative 10-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   It was left to Aslan, a raven-haired 10-year-old boy with a
deceptively shy grin, to turn the conversation 180 degrees in a
phrase. ``I would like for them to burn,'' Aslan said. ``In blue
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue fire is a Chechen idiom that means the hottest fire
possible. The objects of Aslan's desire are Russians, especially
those Russian soldiers who destroyed his home this winter in the
village of Urus-Martan.
</P>
<P>
   Russians have no monopoly on horror in this harrowing conflict.
But if the forces on both sides paused long enough to examine the
legacy they have passed on in the Chechen tent camps of Ingushetia
_ or, for that matter, in North Osetia, where Russian war victims
have fled _ it is at least remotely possible that the war in
Chechnya would end early.
</P>
<P>
   Even battle-hardened soldiers would be hard put to view the
emotional devastation wrought on children like these, some not old
enough to zip filthy jackets and button ripped sweaters, and not
wonder whether any religious absolute, any national cause should
exact such a terrible price.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 2,500 children among the 8,000 or so
residents of Sleptsovskaya's Sputnik camp, a literal city of tents
and parked railway cars not 10 miles from the Chechnya border. They
eat mostly bread and porridge and are frequently sick _ by one
estimate, 70 percent fell ill with flu this winter.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, all are disoriented and terrified by a disaster
far too large for them to comprehend, much less accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation for them, in our estimation, is critical,'' said
Lamara Ymarop, a psychologist with the Dutch charity Agency for
Rehabilitation and Development, ``because children and teenagers
are experiencing terrible psychological stress.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The forced stay out of their homes would be stressful under
normal conditions. But the majority of children and adults have
gone through bombings, and they have nowhere to go back to. They
have to live with two or three families in one space, so they have
no privacy. Many don't have information about their relatives. Some
know relatives who were killed or wounded in bombings. It can't
help but be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ymarop, who runs counseling programs for some of the most
troubled children and women, is trying to help more than 250
youngsters and 100 teenagers regain some semblance of emotional
balance. She ticked off a list of symptoms familiar to any reader
of self-help paperbacks: listlessness; inability to sleep;
nightmares; fear of separation from parents; depression;
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   These are antiseptic and abstract terms. The emotional wounds of
the Sputnik children are as real as any shrapnel injury and as
vivid as the explosions and gunpoint evictions that inflicted them.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of children arrive at Sputnik unable to hear or
perhaps to see, Ymarop said, not because of physical injuries, but
because they have shut out the terror of days in cold cellars,
awaiting the artillery shell that will finally score a direct hit.
</P>
<P>
   Some children shiver. Many cannot concentrate on lessons, or
speak except in halting bursts. Others close their eyes and duck
under tables when they hear jets approaching a nearby airport.
</P>
<P>
   They are all heartbreakingly homesick. One 13-year-old boy cries
constantly, barely eats and shuns friends. ``His kitten is at
home,'' she said. ``He doesn't know where it is, and he doesn't
know if it's all right. He refuses to play with others because he
wants to go home and look for it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ymarop pushed two colored-pencil drawings across a table. One
depicted a home surrounded by trees and birds. The other showed a
city on a hillside, helicopters and jets spitting red rockets and
bullets on it from above. In a cave at one corner, several people
huddled. Outside the cave, more were running for the entrance, and
still more lay on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked her to draw her hopes and her fears,'' she said.
``She drew what she saw when she was in this bomb shelter.
Apparently, the shelter got too crowded, and some people went home
to their houses. She said she stayed in the shelter to sweep the
floor, and that the most awful thing was when the bombing started
again and people started running back to the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children and parents weren't connected; they were looking for
each other. This neighbor'' _ she pointed to one prone figure in
the picture _ ``managed to pass her baby to people in the shelter
and was hit by shrapnel and died at the door. There wasn't space
for many to get in. And when they went out, they saw many burned
and dead people. For her, that was the most awful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the most awful thing is how the youngsters of
Sputnik deal so casually _ on the surface, anyway _ with events of
a sort that have broken people years their senior.
</P>
<P>
   During an hour's chat with six children plucked at random from
Sputnik's muddy streets, the oldest dominated the conversation.
Ten-year-old Aslan, among the most outgoing of the crowd, told a
dramatic tale when the talk turned to stories of how the children
came to be in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came two and one half months ago from Urus-Martan,'' he
said. ``It was bad. Pieces of shrapnel were flying in the air and I
couldn't go anywhere. I hid in a trench. We dug a trench in our
yard and we were hiding there. My family is OK, but my relatives
are injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Zelena, 6, became animated. ``Our house was burned,'' she said.
``My mother went to Grozny and saw it. She said they took all our
belongings.''
</P>
<P>
   Zura offered her own story: ``One girl was burned. She was
running to the cellar, and a Russian shot her in the back. She ran
to the cellar and they were in an APC'' _ armored personnel carrier
_ ``and then they waited until she came out. Then they set the
house on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Tselim chimed in excitedly.: ``When we were coming here,
soldiers in an APC wanted to crash our car. The APC rushed into the
car but we managed to turn away. They were going very fast. They
wanted to kill us, just intentionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why they would do such a thing, Tselim had a ready reply.
``Because they want to kill Chechens,'' he said. ``Because they
don't like us. They think we're bad.''

   The New York Times is planning three pages of stories and photos
on the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS (Washington) _ Gov. George W. Bush's twin losses in
Michigan and Arizona left many of his staunchest supporters and
financial backers shell-shocked on Wednesday, and some conceded
that they were no longer certain he would make it to the
nomination. The outcome set off a frenzy of recriminations from
inside and outside the campaign, including members of Congress and
the Republican National Committee who had eagerly rallied behind
Bush early on. By Richard L. Berke.

<P>
   REPUBS-CALIF (Los Angeles) _ All eyes are now on California.
McCain's hope is that if there are Republicans anywhere who
remember what it was like to put together the Reagan coalition,
it's California Republicans. McCain may now have enough money to be
relatively competitive here. There is a possibility that he could
win the California popular vote but not the vote for delegates,
restricted to registered Republicans. By Todd S. Purdum. (1200

<P>
   REPUBS-NY (New York) _ Sen. John McCain's victories in Michigan
and Arizona have set the stage for the first contested Republican
primary in New York state in 20 years. But McCain faced two
problems as he turned his attention East on Wednesday _ a contest
closed to non-Republican voters and, yet again, a state electoral
system designed to favor the candidates favored by the Republican
establishment, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-RIGHT (Austin, Texas) _ When his campaign plane touched
down in Kansas City, Mo., on Tuesday night, all that Gov. George W.
Bush really had to do was acknowledge the bad news from Michigan,
utter a few platitudes, paste a brave face over defeat and put a
smiling face on his expectations for the next Republican contests.
But Bush also did something else, something out of the ordinary,
something that spoke to a growing problem in his candidacy and to
much of what had gone wrong. ``Let me make it crystal clear,'' Bush
said loudly. ``I reject bigotry, I reject prejudice, I repudiate
anti-Catholicism and racism.'' Bush's statement suggested a
jarring, almost surreal change of political fortunes: somehow, a
candidate who began his bid for the presidency with crossover
dreams managed to pick up enough right-wing baggage that he found
himself in the strange position of having to offer voters this kind
of reassurance. By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   MICH-ASSESS (Detroit) _ Michigan, which in years past has given
surprising boosts to candidates as diverse as Pat Robertson, Jesse
Jackson and George C. Wallace, sprang another upset on Tuesday, and
in doing so gave the Republicans reason to worry about their
prospects in November. First, and most obvious, the primary results
here put new wind in the sails of Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas had hoped to finish him off here, but that
will not happen now until March 7 or later, if at all. Which means
more charge and countercharge, more ideological polarization and
much less time to concentrate on the Democrats. A news analysis by

ANALYSIS: MICHIGAN VOTE HINTS AT COMING PROBLEMS FOR REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also REPUBS) 
(js) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Michigan, which in years past has given surprising
boosts to candidates as diverse as Pat Robertson, Jesse Jackson and
George Wallace, sprang another upset on Tuesday, and in doing so
gave the Republicans reason to worry about their prospects in
November.
</P>
<P>
   First, and most obvious, the primary results here put new wind
in the sails of Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas had hoped to finish him off here, but that will not happen
now until March 7 or later, if at all. Which means more charge and
countercharge, more ideological polarization and much less time to
concentrate on the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore appears to be treading a
relatively smooth path to the Democratic presidential nomination,
and the Republican battle royal has distracted public attention
from Gore's often-truculent exchanges with his rival, former Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Second, neither Republican candidate seems capable of standing
astride the divisions plaguing the party and pulling it together.
The poll of voters conducted here by a consortium of television
networks and The Associated Press, like those taken earlier in New
Hampshire and South Carolina, showed a severely fractured
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, for example, those voters who termed themselves
conservatives backed Bush, 60 percent to 31 percent; those who
called themselves liberals backed McCain, 78 percent to 16 percent;
as did those who identified themselves as moderates, 64 percent to
33 percent. Those allied with the religious right backed Bush, 66
percent to 25 percent; those not so allied backed McCain, 60
percent to 36 percent. Those who think abortion should be illegal
always or in most cases backed Bush by wide margins, while those
who think it should be legal most or all of the time backed McCain
by more than 2 to 1. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, McCain demonstrated a considerable geographic
reach, winning 14 of 16 congressional districts, from rural
northern Michigan to Detroit's blue- and white-collar suburbs. Bush
took only two districts, both in the western part of state,
including former President Gerald Ford's home town, Grand Rapids;
that area has a large proportion of Dutch Reformed and other
conservative Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Third, each candidate has a critical problem to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is having trouble attracting Democrats and independents,
taking only 19 percent of independents in New Hampshire, 34 percent
in South Carolina and 26 percent in Michigan. In the general
election, about a third of the votes in pivotal states like
Michigan will be cast by independents, and on his showing so far,
Bush would seem likely to do no better than his father did in 1992
or former Sen. Bob Dole in 1996. Both were beaten by Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are not entirely clear, Bush seems to draw
Democrats and independents to the polls to vote against him _ so
many that Republicans were actually a minority in their own primary
here. Some came to back McCain, and some to send a local political
message, like opposition to Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a big
Bush backer. But Edward Chetofsky of Warren, a Democrat, and Carol
Damaskey of Royal Oak, an independent, told The Detroit News that
Bush's identification with the Republican establishment and with
big money influenced their votes for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's top strategist, said on Tuesday night that the
Bush campaign, already retooled once, again had ``a lot of work to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, on the other hand, is unpopular in his own party. His
share of the Republican primary vote has dwindled from 37 percent
in New Hampshire to 26 percent in South Carolina and 29 percent in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Unless he can turn things around, he will suffer in those
primaries, like New York's and Connecticut's on March 7, in which
only Republicans can participate. Had Michigan's primary been
restricted to Republicans, Bush would have won in a landslide, with
66 percent to McCain's 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, the party is highly unlikely, no matter what
the other circumstances, to nominate someone who can attract the
support of only about a third of the Republican primary voters _
someone who cannot, in other words, hold onto its base.
</P>
<P>
   McCain doubtless will emphasize his party credentials _ he began
on Tuesday night in his victory speech with an assertion that he
was a loyal, conservative, Ronald-Reagan-style Republican _ and his
voting record in the Senate. He has consistently won high scores
from the conservative groups that rate senators and
representatives, despite his apostasy on high-profile issues like
campaign-finance reform and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   One McCain adviser said a series of television commercials had
already been prepared emphasizing the candidate's conservative
positions on issues like gun control, abortion, taxes and
government spending.
</P>
<P>
   He has also begun arguing, as he had not done with any
frequency, that because he attracts many non-Republicans and Bush
does not, he would have a much better chance against the Democrats
in November.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, 50 percent of the voters said that Bush would be
more likely to win the general election, while 46 percent said
McCain would be the stronger nominee. The figures were comparable
in New Hampshire, but in South Carolina, fewer voters saw McCain as
a probable winner.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the peculiarities of this contest that both
candidates began it with conservative records and verbal signals
that they wanted to appeal to moderates as well.
</P>
<P>
   But a month of campaigning and voting has repositioned them.
Somehow, McCain's insurgency has come to be equated with
liberalism, not a popular philosophy in the Republican party,
though he is in fact less liberal than some of the governors and
other officials backing Bush. He blames attacks by Bush and groups
like anti-abortion organizations for that.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began as the ``compassionate conservative,'' committed to
reaching across party lines and to reforms in education and
elsewhere. But with his back to the wall in South Carolina, one of
the nation's most conservative states, he moved sharply to the
right, which hurt him here and could hurt him again in the primary
on March 7 in California, where two-thirds of Republican voters are
either moderates or moderate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man seems well placed at the moment to build bridges,
which their party badly needs.

US CHARGES COLLEGE STUDENT WITH BREACHING FEDERAL SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMAL E. WATSON AND FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In what prosecutors are calling a classic cybercrime _
hacking into government computers not so much for information as
for the sheer thrill of exposing chinks in so-called ``secure''
systems _ a Northeastern University student has been charged with
penetrating sites controlled by NASA and the US Department of
Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ikenna Iffih allegedly broke into NASA's system and used it as a
launching pad for attacks on other government web servers, leaving
a ``trail of cybercrime from coast to coast,'' US Attorney Donald
K. Stern said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside NASA's supposedly secure sites, the 28-year-old
Iffih planted a ``sniffer'' program that enabled him to intercept
the logons and passwords and gain access into other sensitive
computer systems. From those sites, he sabotaged communications,
intentionally causing delays and damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case, to some extent, represents the full range of
computer crimes we're seeing,'' said Stern. In an Internet crime
spree he said began in April 1999, Iffih ``hacked into an Internet
service provider and did substantial damage. He gained control of a
NASA computer and downloaded sensitive information from
Northeastern University.''
</P>
<P>
   Iffih faces three federal counts in connection with unauthorized
access to various computers. If convicted, Iffih faces a maximum of
10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   His only weapon besides a hacker's wiles, Stern said, was an
illegally obtained corporate Internet account, which unlocked the
doors to Defense Department computers. As he copied passwords and
defaced the sites with hacker graphics, prosecutors said, Iffih
covered his tracks with a ``telnet proxy,'' making it appear his
address was that of the very government computers he was attacking.
</P>
<P>
   Among other sites, Stern said, Iffih used the access to
penetrate the the US Department of the Interior's web server. When
he hacked into NASA's computers, Stern said, Iffih had the
capability not only to copy but to wipe out any file on the system,
though the NASA web server did not contain classified information
and was not involved with command or control of NASA satellites.
</P>
<P>
   When Iffih wasn't playing with files from sensitive government
computers, Stern said, he hacked into Northeastern's own systems,
obtaining a list of the names, addresses and social security
numbers of faculty, students and staff at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Hookailo, a spokeswoman for Northeastern, said the
university was contacted by Stern's office in the fall and agreed
to cooperate. She said that security systems have been upgraded,
and it was unclear if any disciplinary action would be taken
against Iffih.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said that he is not aware that Iffih used any of the
information that he received or passed it along to others, but said
that he caused substantial business loss, defaced a web page with
hacker graphics, and intentionally caused delays in communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we can tell this was the classic hacker mentality,''
Stern said. ``He was testing his skills against security systems.
He won in the short run, but lost in the long run.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ At least 8 million Ethiopians are likely to
suffer hunger or starvation this year, a crisis that could rival
the 1984-85 famine that killed at least 1 million people, U.N. and
independent relief officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aid experts hope that this time the world will not wait until
television images of bone-thin children dying in the dust of
another prolonged drought prompts an outpouring of help _ too late
for most of those suffering the greatest need. On Friday, the U.N.
World Food Program will announce an appeal worldwide to raise about
$50 million in emergency aid. Save the Children announced Wednesday
that it had opened an Ethiopian famine fund.
</P>
<P>
   A joint U.N.-private organization reconnaissance mission is
planned next week for the hardest hit regions of Ethiopia, a
country of about 60 million people. About 2 million people are
thought to be in most immediate need of emergency help, which can
take weeks to arrive because of poor transportation and a lack of
warehouses and centers for distribution. Airlifts may have to be
considered, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The world's response to the 1984 Ethiopian famine was enormous.
Live Aid rock concerts alone raised about $70 million. But by the
time much of the aid reached Ethiopia, beginning in mid-1985, many
thousands of people had perished.
</P>
<P>
   Aid experts fear that if the crisis they see developing this
year has to reach visible proportions again before there is
substantial action, all their advance planning will be meaningless.
``By then it's too late,'' said Jay Zimmerman, director of the
Ethiopia field office of Save the Children, who spoke at a news
conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some places, even if you could get food in tomorrow,
they're past the point of recuperation,'' he said. A region-wide
shortage of water and food has already struck the southernmost
parts of the country bordering Somalia and Kenya, he said. Drought
conditions are expected to move north in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer medical agency Doctors Without Borders has
reported that in one affected southern district, Gode, it is
already too late to set up feeding centers, as people have
scattered in search of water, food and medicine, and often die as
they move.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Lewis, the World Food Program's country director in
Ethiopia, speaking in a telephone interview from Addis Ababa, the
capital, said that the Ethiopian crisis has been building for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have enough food for everybody to get full rations
in 1999, so that's the legacy that we've inherited as we go into a
bad year,'' she said. ``This country is just so prone to being at
the mercy of the weather anyway, so even in good years there's a
need for food aid. This year we're just seeing a cumulative effect.
That's why there are so many people on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and other experts said that international organizations
felt more confident that they could cope with this crisis in part
because there has been more cooperation from the Ethiopian
government since the fall of Mengistu Haile Mariam's regime in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   But the government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi faces a
national election in May, at what could be the worst time of
scarcity for the southern regions of Ethiopia, which are
politically marginalized. With national food stocks reduced
everywhere to the lowest levels since 1984, there will be political
pressure on the government to supply proportionately more food to
more important parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Ethiopia is home to pastoral people, Zimmerman said.
Their livelihoods depend on animal flocks that provide cash crops
and food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty or 90 percent of their cattle and sheep are dead,'' he
said. ``When the cattle begin dying, that's like a stock market
crash for pastoralists. Now that their cattle are gone, they have
no assets, or milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman said that animal carcasses thrown into rivers and
wells are contributing to the spread of diarrheal diseases, already
a problem in drought areas as people forage for food. Towns are
being crowded with migrants from the countryside who strain their
already thin resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four percent of Ethiopians are malnourished to the point
of stunting, he said, adding that ``Ethiopia has never really
recovered from the 1984 drought.''

DEMOCRATS FIRE CHARGES VIA THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The intensifying hostility between Al Gore and Bill Bradley
crackled across the Internet this week, as each candidate launched
a new online assault on the other's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Political Web sites typically are upbeat affairs, gentle and
airbrushed in their celebration of the heroic candidate and
reluctant to mention opponents. But as the Democratic campaign has
gone negative, so have the Web sites. Now, Gore and Bradley are
acknowledging the villains in their online utopias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is the real Al Gore?'' asks a new Bradley Web site,
www.moreaboutgore.com, which features an image of the vice
president solemnly wagging his finger in the air. Nearby is an
image of a magnifying glass and the message, ``Take a closer look.
You'll be surprised at what you see.''
</P>
<P>
   The new site is designed to supplement Bradley's recent line of
attack that the vice president has hidden his conservative record
as a member of Congress in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can click on links to several issues Bradley is
highlighting for voting records and quotations to show that Gore
has modified his positions on abortion, gun control, and health
care.
</P>
<P>
   The well-designed Bradley site even includes photo images of
letters Gore sent to constituents in the 1980s, detailing his
reservations about abortion. Gore now says he adamantly favors
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign also began running a new radio ad in
Washington state featuring the site's address, concentrating his
efforts there leading up to the state's primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This week Gore's campaign Web site began featuring the Bradley
Information Bureau, designed to ``provide factual information on
Bradley's public statements.''
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the new feature _ found within Gore's
existing Web site at www.algore2000.com _ seeks to co-opt Bradley's
recent charges that Gore is dishonest and untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Gore site even featured one of Bradley's
harshest lines of the campaign _ but turned it back on the former
New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we believe that you will tell the truth as
president if you don't tell the truth as a candidate?'' asked the
Gore site, repeating Bradley's question to the vice president
during a Jan. 26 debate in Manchester, N.H. The site said it would
``help voters answer that question for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign says Bradley is the one who has been
dishonest, and the Web site listed quotes to suggest Bradley has
been misleading voters about everything from his net worth to how
much time he spent attending public school as a child.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore site also quoted a Bradley flier, passed out before
Monday night's Democratic debate in Harlem, in which Bradley
promises, ``I won't spend my time attacking my opponent on votes
from long ago.'' In recent days Bradley repeatedly has assailed
Gore on votes dating back more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Bradley Information Bureau featured a critique of
Bradley's latest advertisement, saying it ``distorts Gore's
record'' on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore site also displayed a 1999 Bradley quote that seemed to
capture the campaign: ``It takes discipline to be positive,''
Bradley said, ``because it's easy to slip the other way.''

GORE VOWS TO SUBSIDIZE EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS FOR THE
ELDERLY 

</HEADLINE>

By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. _ With a senior citizens complex as his
backdrop and a growing federal surplus as a financial cushion, Vice
President Al Gore promised to have the government subsidize
expensive prescription drug costs for the elderly Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The catastrophic drug plan, which Gore dubbed ``Medi-coverage,''
is the latest in a list of health care programs the vice president
has proposed as he campaigns for the Democratic presidential
nomination, including more money for children's health and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Under the latest drug proposal, the federal government would pay
the remaining drug costs for seniors once they have spent $4,000 in
any given year. The proposal, which is estimated to cost $35
billion over 10 years, would affect about 3 million seniors,
advisers estimated.
</P>
<P>
   They said the extra revenue would come from the federal budget
surplus and is already included in President Clinton's budget
proposal for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The catastrophic drug plan would be on top of another proposal
advanced by Gore that calls for the federal government to pay half
the costs of drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, up to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's opponent, Bill Bradley, campaigned Wednesday in New York,
telling a Columbia University gathering that 13.5 million U.S.
children were living in poverty and 44 million citizens were
without health insurance. ``We will not have true prosperity until
all our citizens share in our economic growth,'' Bradley said.

<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Bradley also released a new
radio ad for Washington state that, for the first time, is harshly
critical of Gore. It says Gore was a ``conservative congressman''
with an anti-abortion and pro-gun record, and it points listeners
to an anti-Gore Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Gore chose to make his prescription drug pitch before a friendly
audience of almost 2,000, many of whom would be beneficiaries of
the expanded health care program.
</P>
<P>
   The local congressman, Rep. Robert Wexler, R-Fla, noted ``there
is only one candidate for president who is going to be known as the
prescription drug president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was well-received in this heavily Democratic enclave
populated by liberals who had migrated to southeast Florida from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was invited to speak at the sprawling complex by Armadeus
Trinchitello, one of the last of a dying generation of political
organizers here referred to as ``Condo commandos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trenchy,'' as Trinchitello is affectionately called, noted
that he once campaigned with Gore's father when he was in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And he urged his fellow seniors to support the vice president.
Otherwise he warned, ``if you leave it to the Republican Party,
you're going to have a clone of Herbert Hoover and a pot in every
chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Florida holds its primary March 14, Gore never
mentioned his primary opponent, Bradley, who is badly trailing the
vice president in Florida and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the vice president appeared to be looking ahead to the
general election contest and the growing possibility that as a
result of Sen. John McCain's victories Tuesday in Arizona and
Michigan, he could face either the Arizona senator or Texas Gov.
George W. Bush in November.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore did not mention either Republican presidential
candidate by name, he was intent on deflating McCain's appeal to
Democrats and independents, and to tie him to conservatives in his
party. The vice president suggested that McCain and Bush held
identical positions, opposing prescription drug benefits and
managed care reform, and support private school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a choice but an echo,'' Gore said. ``They echo one
another in their efforts to attract the extreme right wing and to
dismantle some of the protections that we have in our countries for
seniors today.''
</P>
<P>
   While neither McCain nor Bush have proposed prescription drug
plans as expensive and extensive as the vice president's proposal,
they have talked about the need to provide the elderly with some
relief in drug purchases. McCain has proposed that a chunk of the
federal surplus be used to shore up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore was asked about McCain's boast that he was the vice
president's worst nightmare, the vice president responded that he
was ``concentrating on the Democratic semifinals. We'll let the
Republicans settle the dispute among themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was later endorsed by the International Brotherhood of
Painters and Allied Trades, one of the few members of the AFL-CIO
that had held out backing the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   He later flew to South Carolina where he held an education forum
and picked up the endorsement of Gov. Jim Hodges.

BRADLEY AD PINS `CONSERVATIVE' LABEL ON GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOLHER AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Struggling Democratic candidate Bill Bradley aired
his first attack ad against rival Al Gore Wednesday, accusing Gore
of being a closet conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, making a targeted appeal to senior citizens in Florida,
didn't mention Bradley as he detailed how he would cover
precription drugs for Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, bound for Washington state Wednesday to try to surprise
Gore in the nonbinding primary there next Tuesday, began airing a
30-second spot on Washington radio stations that highlights Gore's
conservative votes in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Gore's opposition in Congress to stricter gun laws,
tougher tobacco regulations, and federal funding for abortions,
Bradley is trying to portray the vice president as a rudderless
opportunist.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes right down to it, what does Al Gore really stand
for?'' an announcer asks in the radio ad.
</P>
<P>
   The commerical also directs listeners to an anti-Gore Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who spoke Wednesday at Columbia University in New York,
urgently needs to cut Gore's double-digit lead in Washington if he
is to gain any momentum before the decisive round of primaries on
March 7. Bradley plans to campaign in Washington until Tuesday's
voting and then will debate Gore in Los Angeles next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign suffered another serious blow Tuesday when
Arizona Senator John McCain won the Republican primaries in
Michigan and Arizona. Bradley had hoped Texas Governor George W.
Bush would knock McCain out of the race, leaving Bradley to bill
himself as the only authentic reformer in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, luxuriating in its healthy lead in the polls
in the South and in the critical primary states of New York and
California, brushed off the Bradley ad.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore camp was clearly pleased by Bradley's move. The
depiction of Gore as a conservative could help the vice president
pull in moderate voters in the general election. The Gore campaign
is also happy to see Bradley spend money, hoping that by the time
the March 7 round of 16 state primaries and caucuses are over,
Bradley will have substantially depleted his campaign chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as baffling as it is bewildering. Perplexing as it is
puzzling,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, confident in his lead, unveiled what he described as a
``third pillar'' in health care assistance for the elderly, a plan
to cover prescription drugs under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to provide help to seniors for the purchase of
prescription drugs,'' Gore said while announcing his
``Medicoverage'' plan that he said would complement Medicare and
Medicaid. The program would cost $35 billion over 10 years and
would help seniors with both basic and catastrophic prescription
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore got a predictably warm welcome from the 1,500 residents of
Century Village, a retirement community that voted, its leaders
say, almost universally for the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1992 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The senior vote is a crucial constituency in Florida, and visits
to ``condo heaven'' are almost compulsory for presidential
candidates. Some of the residents don't even vote in Florida, but
rather in their home states of New York and Massachusetts _ two
states holding primaries March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan, presented as a new initiative, is not substantially
different from what the Clinton administration announced in its
budget proposal this month. Clinton had set aside $35 billion for
catastrophic care under Medicare, but he had not specified how it
would be used.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the plan is similar to what Senator Edward M. Kennedy
has been proposing on Capitol Hill since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradley spokesman, Eric Hauser, accused Gore of ``scaring
seniors'' on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old record,'' Hauser said. ``It's got a rut in it,
he's played it so often. It's unfortunate that is what he has to
resort to. And I'm sure he's not talking about his vote in the
Senate when he chose tobacco over Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's health care plan includes drug coverage for seniors,
but the deductibles and caps would be different.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also proposed two new economic initiatives: a $200
million a year expansion of direct federal aid for workers who lose
their jobs because of new trade agreements, and a $100 million
pilot program to help low-income families buy computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after food stamps, Bradley's plan would provide $400
``info-stamps'' for computer resources to families living below the
federal poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   In Bradley's last East Coast event for at least a week, he
tweaked Gore over economic policy. Chiding Gore for saying he would
continue trying to reduce the national debt even in a recession,
Bradley said, ``This is the kind of economic management that got us
into the Great Depression.''

HOLIDAYS HIGHLIGHT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RUSSIANS, CHECHENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia _ Maria Iblayeva was 24 when Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin ordered her and the rest of the Chechen people rounded
up, packed into cattle cars and shipped en masse to the frozen
steppes of Central Asia and Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   During the harsh 13-day journey and the 12-year exile that
followed, at least 200,000 Chechens, one third of the population,
died of hunger, cold and disease. Iblayeva was the only one in her
family of seven who survived.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as Iblayeva and other Chechens marked the anniversary
of their deportation in 1944, they faced what they and human rights
activists describe as a new campaign of bloody reprisals as
Moscow's forces drove south through Chechnya in an effort to wipe
out separatist militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I survived back in 1944,'' Ilbayeva said at a humble market
stand in the village of Avtury, 16 miles south of Grozny. ``But now
I wish I hadn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood, however, was festive among the officers and troops in
a Russian artillery division dug in across a muddy field from
Avtury. For the troops, Wednesday was Army Day, a traditional
celebration of the military which has taken on an added meaning
this year.
</P>
<P>
   As acting President Vladimir V. Putin put it this week, the war
in Chechnya has raised soldiers' spirits and improved ordinary
Russians' attitude toward the military.
</P>
<P>
   The two holidays underscore the deep psychological differences
between Russians and Chechens that make the conflict in Chechnya so
intractable.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say they are fighting the good fight by
cracking down on ``bandits'' and ``terrorists'' whom they blame for
a spate of deadly bombings and attacks on neighboring regions last
year. They say their troops are restoring order in a region beset
by lawlessness since the Chechen rebels drove out the army after
Russia's failed 1994-96 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the way many Chechens and some outside observers see it,
Moscow has not only forgotten the crimes it once committed against
the entire Chechen nation, it is repeating them, forcing 300,000
Chechens from their homes, fueling the anti-Russian mood and
portending further turmoil in the republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deportation of the Chechens in 1944 for Chechen
consciousness means about the same thing that Hitler's genocide
means for Jews or the 1915 massacre means for Armenians,'' Russian
writer Dmitry Furman observed recently. ``It was a horrible trauma,
and the memory of it and the terror of the possibility of a repeat
is something that every Chechen feels.''
</P>
<P>
   When Russian troops entered Avtury in December, the villagers
chose to force rebels out of town rather than fight. This was a
tactic chosen by residents of many Chechen towns who had seen
enough death and destruction in the 1994-1996 war. But the tensions
in Avtury are still high. Men are silent when Russian soldiers are
nearby, but express animosity when they are alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be war here, I know it,'' said Adram Rakhmanov, 19.
``There is tension. The Russians take boys away, not all of them
come back. There are no fighters here, but they are turning us all
into rebels.''
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, citing witness testimony, said Wednesday
that Russian troops killed at least 62 civilians earlier this month
on the outskirts of the Chechen capital. The alleged massacre in
Aldi was the third mass killing of civilians that the group says it
has documented. The group reported a massacre of some 40 civilians
in Alkhan-Yurt in December and an ensuing rampage in Grozny's
Staropromyslovsky region in which 41 people died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is becoming increasingly clear that these are not isolated
incidents,'' Holly Carter, who directs the group's Europe and
Central Asia division, said in a statement. ``We are uncovering a
pattern of summary executions throughout Grozny.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian soldiers sealed roads Wednesday and banned civilian
movement between settlements. Police have stepped up security in
Chechnya and across Russia in recent days to prevent possible rebel
attacks to mark the anniversary of the 1944 deportation. But
Russian officials vehemently denied that federal troops took part
in any atrocities against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent months have proven that all that talk about our army
falling apart and losing preparedness are all blatant lies,'' Putin
told officials Tuesday in Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad. ``We need
not blush for our soldiers, officers, and generals acting now in
Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Stalin ordered the deportation of the entire Chechen nation
because he believed the Chechens, always hostile to Russian rule,
would aid the German force that had invaded the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture to Chechens and other nationalities deported under
Stalin, Putin issued a statement Wednesday offering his ``sincere
sympathy to those who suffered under the illegal repressions.'' He
added, ``We have always been together, sharing our joys and
sorrows.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Chechens did cooperate with the Germans during the Nazi
occupation of the Caucasus, but many others fought the Nazis on
Soviet frontlines, Caucasus specialist Azer Mursaliyev wrote in
Tuesday's edition of Kommersant Vlast magazine. The Soviets
court-martialled Chechens of all stripes, branded them enemies of
the people and sent them into exile.
</P>
<P>
   Mursaliyev said leaders of today's rebels learned the lessons of
the gulag _ ``believe nothing, fear nothing, ask nothing.''
Wednesday, the rebels shot down a Russian helicopter and damaged
three others, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Major General Sergei Makarov, whose troops in Avtury
have been shelling the separatists daily, said victory was near,
even though thousands of rebels were believed to be at large in
Chechnya. Makarov's troops said the rebels pose as civilians by day
while attacking Russian positions at night.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Makarov's men thought the war was close to ending as
they celebrated Army Day. As the general handed out awards _
plastic watches, framed pictures of tanks, and photo albums
inexplicably titled ``Love Scenes,'' the men and officers talked
about going home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will be able to look each other in the eye and say,
`job well done,' '' said Colonel Nikolai Musyenko, whose wife
traveled from Volgograd to visit him at the front. He raised a
vodka toast to a quick end to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, at the Russian military base on the
outskirts of Grozny, gunfire filled the night as troops opened fire
in the Chechen darkness.

GROUP SEEKS CONTROL OF PIONEER GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An investor group is launching a proxy fight against
Pioneer Group Inc., in a bid to replace four of eight directors and
to force a sale of the Boston mutual fund company.
</P>
<P>
   Lens Investment Management, of Portland, Maine, said in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday that Pioneer
could fetch at least $38 a share in a sale, more than double the
closing price of 17 1/4 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a great deal of shareholder value destroyed at
Pioneer,'' said Robert Monks, chairman of Lens. To recoup it, he
argued, ``You either change the management or you sell the company,
and better sooner than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Hostile maneuvers are rare in the mutual fund business. But a
growing chorus of voices is suggesting that Pioneer could better
exploit its brand name and venerable 72-year history under new
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer shares closed unchanged for the day. They have tumbled
48.3 percent since peaking at 33 3/8 in December 1997, as Pioneer
lost $116 million over two years on foreign ventures such as gold
mining, Russian banking, and timber selling.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to comment on Lens's move, saying it could
not discuss proxy filings. Pioneer two weeks ago said it had hired
investment bankers to review its options, including a possible
sale. But top executives have indicated they are making strides to
grow and improve performance without selling the company outright.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors think a sale is imminent. Mario Gabelli, whose
Gabelli Funds in Rye, N.Y., own 12.3 percent of Pioneer's shares,
said: ``You can't announce that you're hiring investment bankers
and then do nothing.'' He said he expects a deal to be done in 30
to 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   With that scenario already a possibility, Lens executives want
to make sure that a sale takes place. Pioneer hit Lens's radar
screen last year, as one of the worst-performing investment
management stocks in the market. Lens started buying Pioneer shares
in May and now holds 4.1 percent of the stock. Lens is not a
patient or passive investor.
</P>
<P>
   The firm oversees $400 million and is in the business of shaking
up lagging companies run by what it views as ``entrenched
management,'' and directors who aren't critical when managers make
mistakes. Lens has taken on the likes of Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. and
American Express Co., and more recently Waltham's Thermo Electron
Corp., with varying degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
   Lens's Monks, a three-time US Senate candidate and former
executive of the Boston Co., met with Pioneer chairman and
significant shareholder John F. Cogan Jr. in December to air his
views on the company. Since then, Pioneer has added three outsiders
to its board _ none of them from Lens _ and it hired Salomon Smith
Barney and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. to evaluate its businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lens is now proposing to put four of its own executives on
Pioneer's board, replacing four present directors, including Cogan,
74, and David Tripple, chief of Pioneer's $22 billion US fund
group. In its SEC filing, Lens said it wants to influence the
company to ``auction itself to the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer is widely seen as a company with a strong brand name
that missed an opportunity to grow during the bull market of the
1990s. Critics say Pioneer wasted too much capital on far-flung
ventures, while its fund rivals have been pouring money into
beefing up sales and marketing of funds.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to this concern, Pioneer recently hired William Poulin
from the New York investment banking firm Putnam, Lovell, De
Guardiola &AMP; Thornton, as head of marketing. It also promoted the
former marketing chief, Steven Graziano, to head of domestic
distribution and tapped a new head of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do have some nice products to restart the momentum with,
but they have to get things rolling quickly,'' said Neil Bathon,
head of Financial Research Corp. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a concentration in funds owning so-called value stocks,
which have been out of favor in the dot-com surge, Pioneer would be
an attractive purchase to many companies, industry sources say.
Among the possible bidders are Germany's Dresdner Bank, First Union
Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., Boston-based Liberty Financial Cos., and
the Brinson Funds, owned by Union Bank of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with mutual fund laws said any buyer would have
to get the Pioneer fund trustees on its side. The fund directors _
who are separate from the company directors _ have the power to
thwart a buyout. A purchase would also have to go before the fund
shareholders for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bennett, director of governance for Lens, said Pioneer
has squandered its chance to go it alone: ``This is a failure,
clearly, of the board and the management.''

STUDY DETAILS PROBLEMS WITH ASSISTED SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Physician-assisted suicide, which proponents say can be a humane
and painless way to aid terminally ill patients, is often fraught
with complications and long delays before death occurs.
</P>
<P>
   A sobering new Dutch study of 649 cases, published in the
current New England Journal of Medicine, shows ``complications''
occurred in 7 percent of cases of assisted suicide and ``problems
with completion'' (delays of hours to days before death) in 16
percent. With euthanasia, or ``mercy killing,'' which is not a
crime in the Netherlands, the rate of such problems were less _ 3
and 6 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The study has far-reaching implications for the end-of-life
debate in America, which until now, has focused on physicians
prescribing lethal doses of drugs to help terminally ill patients
end their own lives, not on outright euthanasia, which is illegal
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Published in conjunction with two other new studies on
physician-assisted suicide in Oregon, the only state in which the
practice is legal under certain conditions, the Dutch research will
``come as a shock'' to many in America, writes Dr. Sherwin B.
Nuland, the Yale University doctor who wrote the groundbreaking
1994 book, ``How We Die.''
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial, Nuland contends that the disturbing rate of
complications may dismay Americans ``who have never considered that
the procedures involved in physician-assisted suicide and
euthaniasia might sometimes add to the suffering they are meant to
alleviate and might also preclude the tranquil death being
sought.''
</P>
<P>
   If doctors are going to become involved in ending lives, he
argues, at least they should learn to do it right. ``Doctors are
unprepared to end life,'' he writes. ``If this is a burden to be
taken on and if the medical profession accepts it as falling within
the realm of individual conscience, then thorough training in
techniques must be made available.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Dutch study, done by Dr. Johanna H. Groenewoud and others
at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, doctors often had to step in to
complete the process when assisted suicide failed.
</P>
<P>
   The new research may force Americans to confront the issue of
euthanasia, notes Dr. William Breitbart, chief of the psychiatry
service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Breitbart fears the debate will now hinge on ``how best to kill
people, rather than stepping back and debating how best can we
prevent the suffering and despondency that leads patients to ask
physicians to kill them as the only way to stop the suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   George Annas, professor of health law at the Boston University
School of Medicine, agrees. ``If we're going to do it, let's not
botch it,'' he says, adding that, ``I am not one who thinks we
should start training doctors to kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   But if physicians are going to engage in assisted suicide, he
says, they should be present. ``And if they're going to be present,
they have to be ready to actually kill the patient if the patient
experiences significant pain or suffering in the process of
dying.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Dutch study, the most common ``technical problems'' were
trouble finding a vein in which to inject lethal drugs and
difficulty administering an oral medication. Vomiting and muscle
spasms were also frequent complications.
</P>
<P>
   The two Oregon studies focused on doctors' and patients'
experiences in that state since physician-assisted suicide was
legalized in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One study, led by Dr. Linda Ganzini, director of geriatric
psychiatry at the Portland VA Medical Center, was a survey of more
than 2,600 Oregon physicians, about five percent of whom had
received requests for lethal presecriptions since October, 1997.
They honored one in every six of those requests, and one in 10 of
those requests actually resulted in suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, 46 percent of patients who received palliative care,
such as medication to alleviate pain and nausea, changed their
minds about suicide. Yet, she also found that most patients who
completed suicide were receiving palliative care, and 81 percent
were in hospice care. ``It doesn't appear that patients die by
suicide because they lack palliative care,'' she said in a prepared
statement, ``but despite it.''
</P>
<P>
   This suggests, she added in a telephone interview, that some
terminally ill patients have reasons for suicide _ such as a desire
for autonomy and to control the manner of their deaths _ that may
not be solved by palliative care.
</P>
<P>
   The other Oregon study, led by Amy D. Sullivan of the Oregon
Health Division in Portland, focused on 27 patients who died after
ingesting lethal medications in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   These 27 patients represent a small number relative to all
patients who died in Oregon in 1999, the researchers noted,
although they do represent an increase over the 16 patients who
used Oregon's Death with Dignity Act the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Dorfman, president of the Greater Boston Hemlock Society,
which favors laws such as the one in Oregon that allow physicians
to assist in suicide, said the two Oregon studies suggest that
``the fears that had been expressed before this law was passed
don't seem to have materialized.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Dutch study, neither of the Oregon studies noted any
complications with assisted suicide, but, as Nuland says in his
editorial, this may be because researchers did not ask. In one
previous American study, researchers found that 15 percent of
attempts at physician-assisted suicide failed.

 &HT;    Bush camapign confident about GOP-only primaries
 &HT;    By Jena Heath and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Gov. George W. Bush's lead headed south and he
headed west, the informal Bush for President e-mail network
crackled with questions about life after Sen. John McCain's wins in
Michigan and Arizona Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the cyber-din of cerebral treatises and theories, the key
question was raised in a brief e-missive from Jim McCoy, no address
given.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many more open primaries are there?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   So far, open primaries _ contests open to all-comers _ have
provided the fuel for the McCain phenomenon and the hurdle for
Bush, the hobbling frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Bush, however, could be that open season is
about to draw to a close. His strategists believe, in the end,
being the favorite of Republican voters is the thing to be in the
battle for the Republican nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed last night to hear that my opponent is reaching
out to Republicans,'' Bush said here Wednesday. ``That's an amazing
admission to make.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who pleaded with Republicans to join his ``crusade'' in
his Tuesday night victory speech, said Wednesday his campaign still
has ``a long way to go.'' He plans to focus on his conservatism and
electability to attract more Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm proving to them is that I'm forming a governing
coalition,'' McCain said. ``This is a crusade, get with it and you
will enjoy the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   In his three big wins (New Hampshire, Michigan and Arizona),
McCain benefited from open primaries. Bush's only win in a state in
which McCain campaigned was in South Carolina last Saturday. In
that state, Republicans turned out in solid numbers (61 percent of
the total turnout) in response to McCain's attempt to bring in
Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   But in the other states, non-Republican voters dictated the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   As the game continues, open primaries will become the exception
rather than the rule. Overall, 1,443 delegates (409 more than
needed to win the nomination) are awarded in contests open only to
Republican voters. Only 623 are available in open battles.
</P>
<P>
   It's a calculation that has Bush strategists convinced their man
is where he needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot win the nomination of the Republican Party if you
only get one out of every four Republicans to vote for you,'' said
Karl Rove, Bush's top political strategist.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp's confidence, however, was undercut Wednesday by
an undercurrent of dissatisfaction from some his longtime
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a learning curve happening right now in terms
of running a national campaign,'' said Bush backer Chris DePino,
chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating questioned why Bush spent $1 million
on TV ads in Arizona, which gave McCain an easy win on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Weddington, Texas GOP chair, said the Bush campaign's
problems have been caused by an opponent who is seeking to prevent
Republican voters from picking their nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bush) has run a typical Republican primary race against an
opponent who is running a race as if he is a member of another
party,'' said Weddington. ``John McCain, it appears, is putting the
cart before the horse and his horse is looking like a donkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, McCain's top strategist, believes the Arizona
senator's open-primary wins have dulled interest in Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign argued a year ago when Governor Bush started
this campaign he could attract Republicans and independents and be
a big winner,'' Murphy told CNN. ``It turns out now they want to
padlock the primaries and only hold them in the Republican country
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Tuesday's battles are in Virginia and Washington primaries,
as well as caucuses in North Dakota. In Virginia, voters do not
register by party. All registered voters are eligible to
participate in the GOP contest, but they must sign a pledge
promising not ``to participate in the nomination process of any
other party.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has a system in which voters select one of
three ballots: Democratic, Republican or unaffiliated. The
unaffiliated ballots have no bearing on delegate allocation.
</P>
<P>
   But the contest becomes more of a Republicans-only event on
March 7 when there are 12 battles, including only four that allow
Democrats and independents to vote in the GOP primary. New York,
with 101 delegates, has a GOP-only primary. In California, with 162
delegates, everyone can vote, but only ballots cast by registered
Republicans will count toward delegate allocation.
</P>
<P>
   From March 10-14, there are eight contests. Five are GOP only,
including Florida, where 80 delegates are available.
</P>
<P>
   One of the open primaries is Texas on March 14, where Bush will
be a prohibitive favorite to collect all 124 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be the Republican nominee and the reason why is
I'm going to win next week and I'm going to win the week after
that,'' Bush said, adding there would no post-loss ``retooling''
like he underwent after his New Hampshire loss.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas government professor Bruce Buchanan said
Bush may want to take a long look at how he positioned himself to
win South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be worried about the fact that he tied the Christian
Coalition around his neck and lost his compassionate conservative
credentials and now looks like a hard-edged conservative,''
Buchanan said. ``They've got a confused image out there right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   And the McCain campaign is ready to pounce on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians are readying the welcome mat for Gov. George W.
Bush's arrival in the Golden State and wondering which candidate
will show up,'' McCain said in a Wednesday release. ``Will it be
the so-called compassionate conservative with moderate positions
initially designed to appeal to Democrats and independent voters,
or the right-wing Southern conservative alter-ego he created for
himself to right his floundering campaign in South Carolina after a
devastating defeat in New Hampshire?''

   WASHINGTON _ Floods. Hurricanes. Tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, scientists have made great strides in
developing better weather forecasting techniques to understand _
and then predict _ the behavior of severe storms, getting out early
warnings that can save lives.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists and engineers are still challenged by related
questions: how can a storm shelter be built to stand up to
hurricanes and tornadoes, and how can victims made temporarily
homeless by such violent storms be housed comfortably and
inexpensively?
</P>
<P>
   Now, academics and federal scientists are tackling the first
question, while an enterprising team of Georgia high schoolers has
come up with an inexpensive design that might answer the second.
</P>
<P>
   An arched temporary shelter built by Jacob Gibson, Tim Chen,
Jenny Schildecker, Sylvia Yang and Adi Sunderam from Chamblee High
School is well-insulated, impact-resistant and can withstand winds
of up to 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, 17, a senior from Stone Mountain, said the structure _
dubbed the Chamblee Thermalodge _ took five months to design and
build and cost $250. However, mass production would lower the cost,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The structure was one of several entries by 18 U.S. schools
competing in the annual National Engineering Design Challenge last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Student teams were asked to build a temporary shelter that is
portable, inexpensive and easy to put up and take down. The team
judged to have the best shelter _ Simbury High School in Simsbury,
Conn. _ won a $1,000 prize and a trip to Epcot Center at Disney
World in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program introduces high school students to engineering
and technology through a hands-on project,'' explained William C.
Salmon, President of JETS Inc., a non-profit educational
organization that promotes excellence in high school math, science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designs are aimed at human needs, so the program also
increased the social understanding of the young people,'' Salmon
added. ``In this way, they directly relate to the critical role
engineers play in society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``High school students are really interested in solving real
problems of the world, and this competition gives them the chance
to do that. That's what I like about it,'' said Ken Gibson, physics
teacher at Chamblee High and coach of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution that our kids came up with was innovative, unlike
the others, said Gibson, no relation to student Jacob Gibson. ``I
was very proud of our kids. I think they represented the Southeast
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Chamblee, which is a partner in education
with Cox Enterprises, all the student-designed shelters were
basically tents. Chamblee's was made of rigid foam insulation and
weighed 300 pounds, which did not meet the competition's
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were mainly concerned with people being comfortable, since
they normally live in a temporary shelter for (up to) 18 months,''
said Sunderam.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamblee Thermalodge has 160 square feet of floor space and
is 6 feet high. The team decided to go with the rigid foam because
it is stronger and quiet when the wind blows, unlike tents, said
Schildecker.
</P>
<P>
   Safety was also a factor. The students said people may freeze in
a tent during cold weather or accidentally set it on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The team calculated that a 300-watt heater would make their
shelter very comfortable during sub-zero weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shelter should be a second home because you don't want to
be uncomfortable,'' said Jacob Gibson. ``It raises the morale of
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The design contest was not just a glorified science project. The
effort to build better storm shelters has taken on greater urgency
in recent years as a record number of killer storms have rolled
through the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, according to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), President Clinton has declared 266
disaster areas in communities struck by tornadoes and hurricanes.
Those areas have cost FEMA $11.4 billion dollars, not including
private disaster relief funds.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, a tornado ripped through South Georgia,
devastating an area 10 miles long and up to a mile wide. An
estimated 1,000 people were left homeless in Mitchell County alone.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the problem of housing victims in the aftermath of such
storms, federal scientists are redoubling their efforts to figure
out how to help people survive disasters in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA, in cooperation with the Wind Engineering Research Center
at Texas Tech University, has designed ``safe rooms'' _ windowless,
structurally reinforced rooms are meant to be built in people's
homes _ said Buzz Weiss, a spokesman for the Georgia Emergency
Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Safe rooms can provide ``next-to-absolute level of protection,''
said Paul Tertell, a civil engineer with FEMA. In coming up with
the concept for the rooms, FEMA and Texas Tech relied on
information from past disasters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After inspecting more than 90 towns that had been struck by
tornadoes, they found that small rooms in the central part of
houses often remained standing even when the rest of the house had
sustained severe damage.
</P>
<P>
   The group decided that if such rooms were strengthened, they
could provide a high degree of protection.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said the safe rooms can withstand winds of up to 250 mph
and protect occupants from a 14-pound object measuring 2 feet by 4
feet and flying at 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Safe rooms, built of steel and reinforced concrete, were
developed primarily for use in new houses, but some can be
installed in existing houses, said Chad Morris, associate director
of Wind Engineering Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   He said although anyone with adequate building skills can
construct the rooms, he suggests hiring a professional contractor.
</P>
<P>
   In a tornado, the safe room ``might be slightly damaged, but you
will walk out alive,'' said Tertell, who was a judge at the
engineering design competition.
</P>
<P>
   Materials for the safe room can run from $2,000 to $4,000,
depending on the size, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Safe rooms have proven to be successful during recent natural
disasters in Oklahoma, Kansas and Florida. Many victims of towns
torn by tornados this month in southwest Georgia are planning to
build them in their new homes, Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Brochures and plans for the safe room can be requesting a free
brochure titled ``FEMA 320: Taking Shelter from the Storm'' from
the agency at 1-800-480-2520 or by visiting www.fema.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Although the safe room can provide a lot of protection, the
Georgia emergency agency is emphasizing that people stay aware of
the weather. This is especially true during the spring tornado
season, which typically lasts from March through May in Georgia,
Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that the state is ``tornado-prone,'' and because of
the terrain, it is hard to detect natural disasters on radar until
it is almost too late. He advised people to buy a National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration tone activator weather radio.
</P>
<P>
   When there is a weather advisory or a tornado warning, Weiss
said, the NOAA radio emits a loud sound similar to a smoke
detector. NOAA radios cost between $75 to $80.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to buying a NOAA radio, Weiss recommends that
families designate an area where they would meet during a natural
disaster. The safe room would be ideal, if they have one.
</P>
<P>
   Those without safe rooms, he said, should go to the basement of
the house or an interior windowless room of the lowest place in the
home. Those who live in mobile home or are in a car should get in a
ditch.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the most important thing is to have a NOAA radio'' to know
when to take action before it's too late, Weiss said.

 &HT;    `The American dream is to have a hot glazed doughnut'
 &HT;    By Dale Rice
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There's an old adage that defines the basic
philosophy of life in terms of a simple breakfast pastry.
</P>
<P>
   Look at a doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   See the hole? You're a pessimist.
</P>
<P>
   See the dough? You're an optimist.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple. To the point. No room for waffling.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of doughnuts: You either focus on the central
void or you are riveted on the glorious, glaze-encrusted circle of
soft dough that yields its sweet yeasty pleasures bite by bite.
</P>
<P>
   Doughnuts. Life. Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.
</P>
<P>
   My earliest memories of breakfast are not stacks of golden
pancakes, piles of crisp bacon or bowls of warm oatmeal; my first
recollections are doughnuts. Boxes of doughnuts. Brought home by
Dad.
</P>
<P>
   In the small rural town where I grew up, there were no bakeries,
no bags of doughnuts still warm from the fryer. Our doughnuts were
packaged by Stroehmann's, one of the area's main producers of white
bread. And as hard as it is to imagine now, in a home where Mom's
fresh baked goods were the daily norm, they were a treat.
</P>
<P>
   From Dad.
</P>
<P>
   So we loved them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they were covered in powdered sugar. Sometimes there
were four of each: sugared, plain and cinnamon. But they always
were the same style: cake doughnuts, the type leavened with baking
powder rather than yeast.
</P>
<P>
   Dad would sit at the kitchen table, with a cup of Sanka, and
open the box. Little hands grabbed first. Then Dad took one.
Sometimes he broke it in half and dunked it in coffee. Sometimes he
just took a bite. Either way, the look that followed was
unmistakable. Contentment.
</P>
<P>
   A man in the home he was born in. Surrounded by family. Eating a
doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 10 billion doughnuts. That's how many are consumed
in the United States annually. (Assuming, of course, that all of
the doughnuts sold actually are eaten.)
</P>
<P>
   That's enough doughnuts for every man, woman and child in the
United States to eat three dozen a year. (Do you digest your share
annually, or is someone making up for your inadequacy?)
</P>
<P>
   The number of doughnuts consumed yearly is just one of the
industry facts compiled for Dunkin' Donuts' corporate headquarters
in Randolph, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some more: 81 percent of doughnuts are purchased in the
morning, 56 percent are bought on weekdays, and 29 percent are
consumed in autos. (Clearly, eating a doughnut is safer than
talking on a cell phone. When is the last time you heard of a wreck
being caused by doughnut consumption?)
</P>
<P>
   So what else do we know, statistically speaking, about
doughnuts?
</P>
<P>
   They really stack up compared to muffins and bagels.
</P>
<P>
   In full-line retail bakeries (the places that make a wide range
of items), yeast-raised doughnuts are the second-biggest seller in
terms of revenue, behind custom-decorated cakes, according to
research published in Modern Baking magazine. In fact, doughnuts
outsell muffins 3-to-1 and outpace bagels 6-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for an old Dutch confection, which appears to be one of
the few facts we know about the early production of doughnuts. It
was the Dutch who developed them in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   They hung around for a couple of centuries before an American
baker supplied the real innovation: the hole.
</P>
<P>
   There we are. Right back at math again. Only this time it's not
percentages; it's geometry.
</P>
<P>
   A sphere within a sphere. Sometimes elliptical. Sometimes
circular. A doughnut. And a hole.
</P>
<P>
   BOUND BY DOUGHNUTS
</P>
<P>
   It was winter, the snow was falling, and once again Mom had been
volunteered by one of her children to make something for a bake
sale. But this time it wasn't going to be the usual rolled sugar
cookies or blonde brownies or Toll House cookies or snickerdoodles.
It was going to be doughnuts. And I was ready to help.
</P>
<P>
   A tall, lanky teen-ager, I stood at the white Roper stove,
monitoring the Dutch oven full of hot oil. Mom stood at the yellow
Formica counter, rolling the dough. Using a round cookie cutter
with a small one attached in the center, she cut the raw doughnuts
and brought them to me.
</P>
<P>
   Gently, I eased one in the hot oil. Then another. And a third, a
fourth and a fifth. Little bubbles sizzled at the edges. Ten
seconds. Fifteen seconds. I took the long meat fork and lifted one
ever so slightly, just enough to peer under the edge. Light brown.
A few more seconds. Peer again. Darker. Ready to flip. Flip.
</P>
<P>
   Five at a time. Making dozens. All for a good cause. Mother and
son. Bound by doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   HOMEMADE PASTRY NOTHING TO SCRATCH AT
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Cracking enough eggs to fill five 5-gallon
pails. Every day. Just to get started.
</P>
<P>
   When you make doughnuts from scratch, it's no simple process.
</P>
<P>
   A strong, husky guy, Jimmie Anderson hoists the 50-pound bag of
sugar and pours some on the scale. He reaches into the tub of
shortening, scoops it by the handful and adds it to the scale. He
quickly spoons salt by the tablespoon onto the pile. Then he dumps
the sugar-shortening-salt combo into a huge mixer bowl containing
beaten eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time for the water. Jimmie walks to the sink. Turns it
on. Tests for the proper temperature. On a cold day, he uses warm
water. On a warm one, he uses water on the cold side. He fills a
big metal measuring cup and pours the water into a plastic bucket.
He adds more water, then carries the bucket across the room, where
he dumps it in the bowl of the Hobart mixer that stands nearly 5
feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmie grabs a 25-pound bag of flour and pours it in. He puts a
little more flour on the scale and adds dry yeast. That in turn
goes into the mixer bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With a practiced twist of his forearms, Jimmie locks the massive
dough hook in place. He turns it on, cranking the bowl up as the
hook turns. The giant metal spiral works the contents, turning it
from yellow mess into yellow dough.
</P>
<P>
   The dough is turned out into a big stainless steel bowl, ready
for the first rise. When the raw dough puffs up soft and pliable,
it's cut into small pieces and left to rise a second time on trays.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fred Gonzales goes to work. He attacks it horizontally with
a rolling pin until the soft mound of dough is flat and 6 feet
long. He changes direction, rolling the other way until he has a
slab that is 3 feet wide. Then he immediately undoes his handiwork,
lifting the dough and shrinking it back to 4 feet by 2 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly Fred rolls the cutter in neat rows, leaving dozens of
cutouts behind. In fast action, he grabs each doughnut by the edge,
reshaping it into an oval that he places on a screen. When the
screen is full, it is carried into the frying room and placed in a
proofing box, a metal cabinet where the doughnuts rise for the
third and last time.
</P>
<P>
   There are no lamps inside the box to speed the process, and
there's a reason for that. If the dough proofs on its own time,
says Jimmie, the manager, it soaks up less grease.
</P>
<P>
   When the raw doughnuts are ready, Sergio Gonzales lowers them
slowly _ 3 1/2 dozen at a time _ into the vat of hot grease. They
puff up almost instantaneously, floating like a poolful of pale
yellow inner tubes.
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds later, using two wooden utensils that resemble
drumsticks, Sergio flips one to check it. They're ready. Flip.
Flip. Flip. Two to three a second. With wrist action that would put
some drummers to shame. A few more seconds and he lifts them out of
the grease.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio slides the doughnuts onto a metal rack, grabs a metal
pan, dips it in a vat of yellow glaze and pours it over the hot
doughnuts. Most of the glaze runs off, back into the holding vat
for the next bunch. He waits a minute or two for the glaze to set,
then stacks them, ready for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Over. And over. And over.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 hours most days. More on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women of Lone Star Bakery in Round Rock just keep
turning them out. As they have for years.
</P>
<P>
   And what can you say about their handiwork?
</P>
<P>
   Two things.
</P>
<P>
   One, it's good enough for national acclaim. Two, it's good
enough for the hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   First, the acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   After much tasting (Lone Star sent four same-day shipments by
plane to New York at the magazine's request), Saveur magazine in
1998 pronounced Lone Star as one of the five best doughnuts in the
country. It was the only yeast-raised doughnut to make the final
cut at Saveur, one of the leading gourmet publications in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Many longtime residents of the area have a passion for their
doughnuts, known simply as Round Rock doughnuts to the masses. And
the bakery has filled a lot of special requests, especially for
people who have moved on to other parts. But this one took the
cake.
</P>
<P>
   An undertaker pulled up to the drive-through window in a hearse.
To buy a dozen. To fulfill the deceased's last request: To be
buried with Round Rock doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   THE YEAST KIND
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe, but I went through the formative years without
sampling a yeast doughnut. In fact, my real introduction to
traditional glazed doughnuts came when I was a college student,
playing bass drum in the university marching band. (Yes, I
appreciate the symbolism, thank you very much.)
</P>
<P>
   The band needed money to help pay for a trip. So we decided to
sell doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple decision, I suppose. The dining halls provided
only 20 meals a week, and students were on their own on Sunday
nights. The demand had been created. All we need to do was feed the
supply. And doughnuts were a simple, no-fuss way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Each Sunday at 6 p.m., we drove to the bakery to pick them up.
Two-hundred dozen doughnuts, in big boxes that held four dozen
each. We delivered them to several of the men's dorms (we dropped
the women's dorms after the first week), where band members usually
sold out within a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally there were leftovers. Non-refundable,
non-returnable leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   So we ate them.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to a hungry college student who consumes six or
eight glazed doughnuts in one sitting?
</P>
<P>
   You never touch another.
</P>
<P>
   Or you're won over for life.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL TASTE
</P>
<P>
   Like hairstyle, fashion and art, doughnuts are a matter of
personal taste.
</P>
<P>
   The only common ground among the true believers is emotional,
not sensory. Aficionados feel passionately about doughnuts. For
some, they are a critical dietary staple. For others, they are junk
food extraordinaire.
</P>
<P>
   But these fans do not adhere to a single set of guidelines for
determining what makes a good doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   That became clear when I impaneled a jury of colleagues _ all
serious fans of the circles of dough _ to sample and judge a
variety of glazed doughnuts made locally.
</P>
<P>
   Some like them large. Some, small.
</P>
<P>
   Some like a heavy glaze. Some, light.
</P>
<P>
   Some like them resilient. Some, squishy.
</P>
<P>
   Some want them round. Some don't care.
</P>
<P>
   But each knows the perfect doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   For Mike, an artist's touch:
</P>
<P>
   ``A glazed doughnut,'' he wrote, ``must be full of fluffy, flaky
doughnut air, but have some presence _ a density devoid of
chewiness. The glaze must not soak into the doughnut, but form a
gossamer crust when cool, a crust that yields to the hand in a
delicate shower of snowflake glaze.''
</P>
<P>
   For Peggy, a lifetime of experience:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that's a glazed doughnut as she is s'poz'd to be!''
</P>
<P>
   For many readers, the ultimate is Krispy Kreme, the North
Carolina-based chain that last year said it would be re-entering
the Austin market in 2000. Unfortunately, we're not on the list of
openings for the next few months. Afterwards? Who knows. Krispy
Kreme is going public and, for the time being, can't comment about
any future plans.
</P>
<P>
   And what would I add to this discussion? You haven't lived until
you've eaten a Round Rock doughnut right out of the fryer.
</P>
<P>
   So hot it'll burn your lips if you're not careful, the doughnut
has a pronounced yeast flavor with a supple dough that stands up to
the sweet, unset glaze. It's a sublime balance of temperature,
taste and texture. A real treat.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that helps explain the view of Lone Star Bakery owner Dale
Cohrs (and the popularity of doughnuts nationwide):
</P>
<P>
   ``The American dream is to have a hot glazed doughnut.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PERFECT TREAT
</P>
<P>
   It was the mid-1970s, but it might as well have been the '30s.
The counter was the same. The booths were the same. The doughnuts
were the same. Even the waitresses hadn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch business was brisk, with good soups, sandwiches and blue
plate specials. The first time I ate there I assumed the doughnuts
on the trays in the window were remnants of breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw a small bowl zip by in the hands of my elderly
waitress. Then another. And another.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was that?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sundae,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a doughnut?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take one.''
</P>
<P>
   They put a cake doughnut on the bottom and topped it with a
scoop of vanilla ice cream and some hot fudge. If you were really
decadent, you asked for a chocolate-iced doughnut for the base. (A
practice I strictly limited to once or twice a month.)
</P>
<P>
   Doughnuts. Dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution at work.
</P>
<P>
   If you count fat grams, worry about sugar, read the content
labels on the backs of jars, skip this section and move to the end.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't want to spoil anyone's love affair with the round
sweets.
</P>
<P>
   But for the curious and the weight-watcher, I guess I'm
obligated to pass along the facts as I know them. The fact is a
typical doughnut contains 13 to 14 grams of fat per 2-ounce
serving. (I warned you; you can still quit reading this now.)
</P>
<P>
   To see how that sized up, I weighed one moderately sized,
relatively light doughnut from a local bakery, and it weighed in at
3 ounces. That's 19 to 21 grams of fat. In a single doughnut. And
who can eat just one?
</P>
<P>
   No, I did not put a Round Rock doughnut on the scales. I don't
want to know.
</P>
<P>
   In a case like this, ignorance is bliss.
</P>
<P>
   LIFE IS LIKE A BOX OF DOUGHNUTS
</P>
<P>
   This is a tale that has come full circle. Which certainly is
appropriate when you're talking doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Dad was excited. He was eager to take me, on a
visit back home, to a new restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Dreams, a little place in his little town, had a specialty
to distinguish it from all the other little places serving
breakfast. Doughnuts. Fresh cake doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   We went there one morning, and I watched. Dad went up to the
counter, looked over that day's selection and picked the doughnut
he wanted. He brought it back to the table, took a bite and sipped
his coffee.
</P>
<P>
   There it was again: that same look of contentment that enveloped
him 40 years ago. Proof that simple pleasures are often the real
treasures in life.
</P>
<P>
   Dad died last year, and each time I've revisited my hometown Mom
and I have stopped by Sweet Dreams for breakfast. Each time I have
a doughnut. And for a minute, I'm a child again, linked to parent
by more than genes.
</P>
<P>
   So I enjoy every bite, savoring the memories.
</P>
<P>
   Doughnuts. Life.
</P>
<P>
   Life. Doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there is no difference.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nasdaq stocks posted their largest-ever point gain
Wednesday after Federal Chairman Reserve Alan Greenspan, in a
nuanced bit of reasoning, said that while the hot stock market
presents a potential danger to the US economy, he would not raise
interest rates merely because share prices were high.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets often rise or fall according to Greenspan's
public statements, but the dance between investors and the Fed
chairman has become especially delicate in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan in fact is signaling that the central bank will raise
rate when Fed policy-makers meet next month. In Senate testimony
Wednesday and comments to a House committee last week, the Fed
chairman said that four previous rate hikes since June have failed
to slow the red-hot economy sufficiently.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, he clarified his reasoning for the potential rate
hike, and investors liked what they heard.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Greenspan laid out what appeared to be a new
benchmark for judging the need for a rate hike: stock and other
asset prices should not rise any faster than household incomes.
</P>
<P>
   When stocks appreciate faster than incomes, he said, the result
is a ``wealth effect'' -- people feel wealthy, and so they spend
more money, which leads to inflation. In essence, he said, a hot
stock market creates ``additional purchasing power for which no
additional goods or services have been produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments worried some analysts, as well as some senators.
They thought that Greenspan, who has complained of inflated stock
values for four years, wanted to raise interest rates in order to
cut stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan said that was not the case. Responding to
questions from senators, he said that comparing the pace of stock
appreciation to household income was ``merely a diagnostic tool,''
and that stock prices in themselves would not guide his decision on
interst rates.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan cited other reasons for a potential rate hike,
including an increasingly tight labor market and record-level
consumer spending, either of which could trigger inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Technology investors took his comments as a green light to buy
shares. The Nasdaq rose 168.20, or 3.8 percent, to a record
4550.32. It was its biggest point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index gained 8.52, or 0.6 percent. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply during Greenspan's
testimony but then moved into positive territory before ending the
day down 79.11 to close at 10,225.73.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan is saying that stock prices could be rational, but
that they are causing demand to grow so rapidly that it's incumbent
on the Fed to raise interst rates to offset that effect,'' said
economist Pierre Ellis of Primark Decision Economics in New York.
``But he's not trying to knock down the stock market in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally nuanced,'' said David Jones, chief economist at
Aubrey G. Lanston, a New York investment firm. ``He's saying, `I
have to watch stock prices because they have an impact on the
wealth effect,' but that's different than trying to control them.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding more complications to Greenspan's comments, Jones said he
was convinced that stock prices must in fact fall in order for
Greenspan to a ``soft landing,'' or gentle ending to a period of
strong growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can say he's not controlling stock prices, but to get a
soft landing, he has to get a significant but orderly correction''
in stock prices, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan himself said that cooling the economy ``will involve
equity discount factors high enough to bring the rise in asset
values into line with that of household incomes . . . This does not
necessarily imply a decline in asset values -- although that, of
course, can happen at any time for any number of reasons -- but
rather that these values will increase no faster than household
incomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who in 1996 complained of ``irrational exuberance''
in the market, said he was making no comment on the proper value of
stocks. ``It is very difficult to make a judgment whether we have a
bubble . . . So I'm not raising the issue in this context of there
being an irrational surge in stock prices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators said that stock prices were a new and frustrating
element in Greenspan's thinking on interest rates. Senator Paul
Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, said that rate hikes tend to hurt
the poorest Americans, those who are only able to find jobs when
the interest rates are low, which prompts companies to add workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal posts are being moved on us,'' Sarbanes said. ``We're
told to get productivity up (in order to avoid Fed rate hikes). We
get productivity up. The inflationary prediction is very good. . .
Now, we're told, well, we've got this problem. We've got the wealth
effect of the running up of equity values.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, said signs of
inflation were so scarce that there was no justification for a rate
hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't try to fix an economy that isn't broken,'' he
told Greenspan. ``If you become obsessed with looking for signs of
blazing inflation behind every door, and if you start slamming
these doors shut indiscriminately with higher interest rates, you
could easily slam doors shut on economic growth all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators asked Greenspan to comment on a range of topics, from
farm policy to immigration. In answering questions, the Fed
chairman strongly cautioned lawmakers against spending projected
federal budget surpluses that he said may not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that tax revenues are up sharply are not yet
understood, he said, and they may fall for equally mysterious
reasons. ``All I'm asking, in effect, is just to delay the rise (in
spending) until we have a better grip on what the true balance in
the federal government accounts is,'' he said.

 COMMENTARY: THE  ` McCAIN MAJORITY'  
(jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The primary message of Michigan _ one of the
must-win ``battleground states'' in November's election _ is that
John McCain would win the state for the GOP and George W. Bush
would probably lose it.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bother leaders of the religio-political right.
Echoing the cry of the commander of the British Middlesex Regiment
at an 1811 battle _ ``Die hard, men, die hard!'' _ they would
rather die hard than win. That's why we hear the lame excuse from
them that McCain's victory was somehow tainted by the outpouring of
independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush put his political future in the televangelist Pat
Robertson's hands in South Carolina, he purchased a single-state
``firewall'' at the price of the independent vote that determines
the election of presidents.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Robertson was allowed by Bush to blanket Michigan
with recorded phone calls trashing McCain as a threat to
Christians. This helped trigger the outpouring of independents that
won McCain the biggest delegation so far.
</P>
<P>
   With coming primaries in New York, California and Ohio limited
to registered Republicans, the question before Bush now is: Should
he stick with the slash-and-damn politics of Robertson and other
intolerant far-right leaders, who say they can deliver a third of
the party's voters?
</P>
<P>
   Or should Bush pull his McCain's-a-hypocrite ads and compete for
the Republican center, which might give the formerly moderately
conservative Texan a chance at winning the nomination in a way that
does not guarantee defeat in November?
</P>
<P>
   A couple of personal memories suggest the answer. In 1964, I was
dragging a ``Stay in the Mainstream'' banner for the
Rockefeller-Scranton campaign across the floor of the GOP
convention in San Francisco's Cow Palace as Barry Goldwater
delivered his inflammatory line defending extremism.
</P>
<P>
   As hot-eyed zealots rocked the hall, I looked over at Richard
Nixon's box. He was sitting on his hands. Nixon knew that at that
moment, Goldwater _ captive of the hard right _ had, in thumbing
his nose at moderates and independents, not only lost the election
for himself but for hundreds of other GOP candidates in one of the
worst debacles in the party's history.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to the convention of 1992. President Bush's
managers appeased the far right by giving Pat Buchanan prime time
on national TV. His declaration of ``religious war'' and ``cultural
war for the soul of America'' delighted the hard-core anti-abortion
lobby but soured the nation on the GOP _ defeating Bush and
bringing us Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Now the same set of religi-pols is demanding the same domination
of the party on cultural issues as their price for delivering their
legions to George W. Bush. He apparently promised Robertson not to
change a word of the harsh language of the anti-abortion platform
plank of which the majority of regular Republicans _ and the vast
majority of independents _ strongly disapprove.
</P>
<P>
   Down that road is defeat. Bush need not spurn the support of the
far right, which includes many principled people not driven by
hatred; indeed, the reverent Robertson has graciously permitted
Bush to say he would not impose a Roe vs. Wade litmus test on
judges. But he needs to call off his dogs of derogation.
</P>
<P>
   I live in the TV market that includes northern Virginia, and for
the past two weeks have been bombarded with Bush spots tearing down
John McCain, making him out to be a phony reformer. (Not a McCain
ad in reply.) Bush threw away $2 million in Arizona on these same
ads in vainly trying to pry Republicans there from their senator.
Unrestrained by Bush, Pat Robertson is preparing his poison phone
bank for Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush now trails in delegates, 92 to 85; if he wants to win the
nomination in a way that may yet allow him to win election, he
should compete for the support of the reasonable Republicans. We
reacted badly to his sellout at Bob Jones U., we don't go for his
continued TV smearing of McCain, and we will resist another party
takeover by the die-hard losers of the self-righteous right.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has plenty to debate McCain about, from tax cuts to
campaign finance reform to Wilsonian morality in foreign policy.
Unless Bush is up to that, he will find himself enlisting in the
McCain majority.

US AIRWAYS THREATENS SHUTDOWN IF NO CONTRACT REACHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that could create havoc throughout the Northeast, US
Airways' top management said it will shut down operations in 30
days if a new contract cannot be reached with the airline's 10,000
flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-page letter to the airline's 40,000 employees, US
Airways chairman Stephen M. Wolf and chief executive Rakesh Gangwal
said Wednesday the company ``will shut down the airline immediately
after the 30-day cooling off period'' if no agreement in a bitter
three-year negotiation with the flight attendants, members of the
Association of Flight Attendants.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a corporate strategy to compete, the airline _
saddled with higher labor costs than other major carriers _ has
signed contracts with every major union except the flight
attendants that pay them parity plus 1 percent with the four
largest airlines: United, American, Delta and Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The National Mediation Board declared an impasse to the
negotiations on Friday and the AFA rejected binding arbitration,
which triggered a 30-day cooling-off period that ends at 12:01 a.m.
March 25.
</P>
<P>
   The union has said that after the cooling-off period it would
engage in the highly effective and disruptive trademarked job
action known as CHAOS (create havoc around our system), in which a
small number of flights can be targeted without warning to
passengers or management.
</P>
<P>
   That threat prompted Wolf's letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If US Airways were to try to operate a schedule under such
conditions, in which we would not know from hour to hour which
flights the AFA would strike, our customers would lose all
confidence that they can rely on US Airways to provide them with
reliable service,'' the letter states.
</P>
<P>
   ``US Airways simply cannot risk losing our customers' confidence
again. If US Airways were to try and operate with an AFA CHAOS
program going on, it would risk losing large numbers of customers
permanently.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts and specialists reacted with amazement at the
move, while union leadership said it was an effort by management to
divide and conquer labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot use too much hyperbole for this,'' said Darryl
Jenkins, director of the Aviation Institute at George Washington
University and editor of the Handbook or Airline Economics.
``Outside of bankruptcy, I have never heard of this happening.''
</P>
<P>
   One Wall Street analyst speaking on condition of anonymity said:
``I am not very optimistic about what is happening. The company is
not budging and the flight attendants are doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Union spokesman Jeff Zack said Wolf ``was huffing and puffing''
and said the letter was ``an attempt to divide the employees, but
employees are used to management's divide and conquer tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, however, said it would be a grievous error to assume
that the letter is simply a bluff in high-stakes negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf and Gangwal came to US Airways in 1996 from United Airlines
and said labor costs needed to be brought under control (the
airline was selling newly acquired planes to meet payroll). The new
management team said costs were also high because the airline had
several different types of aircraft _ the result of USAir merging
with Piedmont and Pacific Southwest _ resulting in higher training,
maintenance and inventory costs.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiating a partity plus one contract with the airline's
5,600 pilots, US Airways entered into a $18 billion contract with
Airbus to change its entire fleet over the next several years to
the European-built airplanes. US Airways is expected to take one
plane a week from Airbus this year, but that fleet consolidation
and modernization will most likely be put on hold if the planes are
grounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will have to put off a lot of things,'' said Jenkins.
``This is not good for the airline. It is very unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know one thing about Wolf and that is he never makes idle
threats,'' said Jenkins. ``If he says that is what he is going to,
that is in fact what he will do.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline _ which lost $132 million from operations in the
second half of 1999, and expects to lose money in the first quarter
of 2000 _ is believed to have nearly $900 million cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said a shutdown of operations may result in the
furlough of employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that you have all done your part in meeting the
Company's goal of becoming cost competitive, and we want to
minimize the financial hardship that a shutdwon may cause for you
and your family. In the event that the Company does cease
operations, it will continue to pay all employees, other than the
AFA represented employees, for as long as is financially
feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, the US Airways Shuttle, and its low-cost Metro Jet
service have more than 2,200 flights daily, many of them in the
Northeast, and last year had nearly 56 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Many issues, ranging from compensation to work rules to pension
benefits, are outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA has said the airline made $2.1 billion in profit in the
last five years and the negotiation would require cuts in benefits
and quality of life issues. About 99 percent of the flight
attendants voted to support a strike if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The airline had no comment on what the announcement would do to
advance bookings at the airline, but they will almost certainly
fall off as customers search out other airlines.

COMMENTARY: THE BRADLEY TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a measure of Bill Bradley's distance from the real world
of power politics in this country that he seems somehow to have
convinced himself that he can revive his presidential campaign by
winning the nonbinding Democratic primary in the state of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   So he's gone off to the great Northwest, which is probably a
more congenial place for the cerebral former senator than some of
the bigger, noisier primary states like New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley goes his own way, meandering, leaving the rough and
tumble to others. It is fair to wonder if his heart is really in
this race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sounded some nice themes as he geared up his campaign
last year. He said the United States had a moral obligation to lift
as many of its children out of poverty as possible. He said it was
time to ``vanquish racial discord from our hearts and spirit.'' And
he came up with a plan that was supposed to make health insurance
available to nearly all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The health insurance plan was crucial to Bradley's candidacy,
and it became a liability. Al Gore jumped on it like a dog tearing
into red meat. Bradley was offended by the ferocity and _ in his
view _ unscrupulousness of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   All politics is personal. When Bradley saw a win in New
Hampshire slipping away from him, he retaliated against Gore _
bitterly, personally and relentlessly. He all but called the vice
president a liar and suggested he wasn't fit to be president. Those
attacks continue.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Gore was more right than wrong about the
Bradley plan. It is impractical and could cause more harm than
good. It would require a massive restructuring of the nation's
health care delivery and finance systems, and would probably erode
the availability and quality of health care that the poor currently
receive from Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is moot, because the plan is not about to see the
light of day. Democrats in Congress have not yet recovered from the
trauma of the Clinton health care debacle. A proposal as sweeping
as Bradley's would have no chance _ none, zero _ of passing
Congress in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional aide who is an expert on health care legislation
put it this way: ``The Clinton plan in large part fell of its own
weight, and I think an awful lot of members have taken away from
that experience the belief that the best and possibly the only way
to reform the health care system _ which all Democrats believe
needs reforming in a number of ways _ is to do it in very targeted,
incremental steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's major health care initiative is an effort to get
universal coverage for children by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Lewin, the chief executive officer of the California
Medical Association, said this week: ``Mr. Bradley has raised an
issue which I think will have great relevance in the future and
we're all indebted to him for being a visionary. Mr. Gore is
looking at the practical reality of the world and saying, `Let's
take a step that is viable.'''
</P>
<P>
   The practical reality of the world is just the thing that
Bradley seems so adept at skirting. How do you lift as many
children out of poverty as possible? How do you vanquish racial
discord? How do you overcome the recalcitrance in Congress and
really bring health coverage to all Americans?
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to talk movingly about these matters, which
Bradley does. It is another thing to rally the support that is
necessary to make some of these things happen.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when Bradley reminds me of the line that the
Sundance Kid tosses at Butch Cassidy. ``You just keep thinking,
Butch. That's what you're good at.''
</P>
<P>
   Butch's own assessment is, ``I have vision, and the rest of the
world wears bifocals.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical reality of running for the Democratic nomination
for president would seem to require that Bill Bradley do all he can
over the next 12 days to generate the kind of excitement in New
York and California that could lead to upset wins in those two vast
and crucial states. Without them, he's finished.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley is in the Pacific Northwest, where it's quiet and
cool and peaceful, and you can think those big and exciting
thoughts.

ENRIQUE IGLESIAS HEADS FOR STARDOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAVONNA MAY-MONS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Move over, Ricky Martin. Enrique Iglesias, a 24-year-old Latino
heartthrob with deep musical roots, is ready to take his spot on
the Latin throne. Last summer, his first English-language single,
``Bailamos,'' shot to the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Hot 100 chart.
``Enrique,'' his first English-language album, has spawned a second
hit, ``Rhythm Divine.''
</P>
<P>
   Enrique's fame didn't begin in the United States. Three previous
Spanish-language albums have sold more than 13 million copies since
1995 and produced 12 No. 1 Latin singles. He also had a Grammy and
an American Music Award under his belt before bringing his music to
the States.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique was born May 8, 1975, in Madrid, Spain, to the original
``el rey del latino mundo,'' Julio Iglesias, and model Isabel
Preysler. When Enrique was 3, his parents divorced. When he was 7,
he and his older brother, Julio Jose, moved to Miami to live with
their grandmother. They were cared for by a nanny, Elvira Olivares,
to whom Enrique dedicated his first album. When he decided to
pursue a singing career, it was she who loaned him $5,000 to record
a demo tape.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique didn't want to gain fame based on this father's name, so
he broke into the music scene without it. Without telling his
father, he dropped out of business school in 1994 and tried to
launch his career using the name Enrique Martinez. A year and a
half later, he signed with the Mexican label Fonovisa. That's where
it began. Since then, he has traveled the world, sold millions of
records and recorded songs in several languages, including Italian
and Portuguese. Last year, he landed a six-album, $40 million
record deal with Universal Music Group.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains: Can he outshine Ricky Martin?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why people think I'm following up on Ricky
Martin,'' Enrique recently told ``Entertainment Weekly.'' ``But a
record company won't give you a deal like the one I got if they
think you're nothing more than a one-time, follow-up act.''

MCCAIN GOES REPUBLICAN IN ATTACKING GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Starting with the lightning-fast Michigan primary
fight and continuing Wednesday as he pressed his resurgent campaign
in Washington, Arizona Senator John McCain dumped his broad appeals
to Democrats in favor of burnishing his Republican credentials and
bashing Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign pitch has not been retooled now that the
everyday do-or-die of the early primaries is over and the insurgent
candidate is facing an imperative to attract greater support among
Republicans. But the tone is different; some emphasis has shifted.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and public appearances McCain emphasized his
antiabortion, anti-big government, anti-tax positions, and
punctuated his remarks with the sometimes serious, sometimes
jocular moments of candor on which he built his early reputation in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   At Gonzaga University in Spokane, he was asked about the
controversy over the Confederate flag flying over the South
Carolina Capitol. He said his experience fighting for Martin Luther
King Day in Arizona taught him that outside interventions sometimes
hurt more than help. He could have let it go at that; instead he
made a point of saying his position was the same as his rival's,
Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has not gone soft on Bush, who recast himself as ``a
reformer with results'' after McCain badly upset him in the New
Hampshire primary. ``If he's a reformer, I'm an astronaut,'' he
repeatedly delights in wisecracking.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he less willing to tell audiences things they may not
want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are a lot of rich people in this area,'' he said
in a luncheon speech to the Rotary Club of Seattle. ``But I don't
think they need a tax break right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The 450 prosperous-looking Rotarians cheered heartily when he
said the tax break ought to go to working families, and most of the
rest of the federal surplus should be spent bricking up Social
Security and paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, McCain has been the least-scripted of the
major candidates for president. His town hall meeting format is
imitated by the other presidential contenders, but none could match
the free-wheeling style of the Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually McCain came to concentrate on whatever the crowd
wanted to talk about and assumed the voters knew his basic
positions.
</P>
<P>
   When the campaign started to go sour in South Carolina and Bush
was scoring with charges that McCain was not really a conservative,
the senator and his aides realized they had gone too far. McCain
had to remind audiences of his basic Republican stances.
</P>
<P>
   Now the reference to his antiabortion views get worked into
appearances whether he is asked about it or not. He compares
himself to Ronald Reagan whether that comes up or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get Republicans all over this country to know
him the way Republicans in Arizona know him,'' said Mark Salter,
McCain's chief of staff. In the Arizona GOP primary Tuesday, McCain
defeated Bush 2 to 1, even though Bush had the backing of the
state's Republican establishment and spent $2 million there while
McCain spent $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the prominence of basic conservative positions in
the candidate's presentations, Salter said the new message is
``don't listen to this crap about him not being a Republican. He's
a conservative Reagan Republican who knows how to attract others to
our party.''
</P>
<P>
   After a disastrous venture into negative campaigning in South
Carolina, McCain withdrew his negative ads and called on Bush to do
the same. The governor declined, and the Michigan advertising
contest pitted negative ads by the Bush camp against positive ads
by the McCain campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the negative ads worked in South Carolina, but now
people are alerted to it,'' McCain said on his campaign plane.
``That's why we won in Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, political director of the McCain campaign, said,
``We kind of got down in the weeds a little bit in South Carolina,
throwing elbows down where Governor Bush and his supporters wanted
us to be ... We thought we had to respond not just to his ad but to
the concerted attack being made by all his surrogates ... We wanted
to hit them hard. But McCain decided he didn't want to fight like
that, and we moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Bush attack turned to impeaching McCain's Republican
credentials, the Arizonan insisted that he would not rise to the
bait. He acknowledged that he must beef up his support among
Republicans if he is to have a chance for the party's nomination.
``I'm just going to talk more about reforming government,
education, the military, the tax code,'' he said. ``We have a
chance now to get Republicans to take another look ... I've got 13
days do do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a harder edge to the recalibrated McCain campaign too,
though. Salter and Mike Murphy, the senator's chief strategist,
said McCain's tough election night speech in South Carolina _
widely interpretted by political pundits as a graceless blunder _
was actually deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   It was intended, they said, to signal Bush, party leaders, and
journalists covering the campaign that they will insist Bush
explain his embrace of the Christian right in South Carolina to
Republicans in the rest of the country, where such groups are less
popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush went to Mars and won as a Martian,'' Murphy said, ``and
now he wants to rub the green pigment off his skin. Well, he can't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he will turn his attention to developing his vision
of the McCain majority he claims is emerging, based on the exit
polls showing that 28 percent of those who voted for him in
Michigan had never voted before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole campaign is about bringing you back into the
political process,'' he told an enthusiastic, anti-Gore crowd at
Gonzaga, a Jesuit university in Spokane. ``The McCain majority
means ... getting every young person in this room involved in the
political process and to inspire all young Americans to become
involved in causes greater than their own self-interest.''

4-LEGGED MUSES WAG   THEIR AUTHORS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No doubt years from now those afflicted with bibliomania will
look back and be puzzled as to why so many of our present-day
writers included their dogs and cats and other curious items and
achievements in their book flap ``About the Author'' sketches. The
information related is bare bones stuff, to be sure, but
nonetheless authors put a lot of time into crafting their own
versions, autobiographies actually, for their books' back cover
flaps.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them suffer from serious but gentle cases of
adorableness, i.e. ``She lives in New York City with her husband
and cats.'' Or he ``lives in Philadelphia with his wife and two
dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, writers seem to feel that these minuscule apercus are
so important that not only do they compose them themselves, but
often have them published twice, once on the flap and once again in
the back of the book itself. The rest of the book's cover copy is
dreamed up by other people and can get lost, so to speak, but not
the writer's mini-me.
</P>
<P>
   Pets, after spouses and children of course, stand alone,
although one wonders which are really more important. For instance,
Jon Katz, novelist and nonfiction writer, in his flap for ``Running
to the Mountain'' (Villard, 1999), wrote: ``He lives in northern
New Jersey with his wife and daughter, and spends a lot of time in
Washington County, New York, with his two dogs, Julius and
Stanley.'' Who was named and who wasn't? I rest my case.
</P>
<P>
   One supposes that we are not far from the day when graduate
dissertations will speculate on the role of dogs and cats in
literature of the late 20th century and early 21st, and reflect on
what it means to have a pet as a muse. Also popular on flaps are
Web sites, so writer and reader can communicate, and gritty skills.
One female novelist listed tap dancing. For some male writers, a
sort of adventurous muscularity seems necessary. A modern Jack
London.
</P>
<P>
   Katz said he reluctantly left Julius and Stanley out of his new
book, ``Geeks'' (Villard), ``because dogs are not a geek thing.''
Still, he said, in a place somewhere between not-serious and
deliberateness, that ``my two dogs are working dogs and co-authors,
and part of their work is that when I turn on my computer to write
one goes to one side of my computer and the other to the other side
and they don't move until I click off; I cannot imagine writing
without them there.'' Musemanship can take many forms apparently,
including just sitting.
</P>
<P>
   The author said: ``When I have a huge writing problem I take
them for walks _ we walk seven or eight times a day _ and I feel
like they are involved in the process. I know it sounds strange,
but writing is a solitary thing.'' He is also convinced that they
sell books. ``People have told me they bought a book because of the
picture of the dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   But he hastens to add, ``I'm not so far gone that I read things
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances Kiernan, the author of ``Seeing Mary Plain: A Life of
Mary McCarthy'' (W.W Norton), wrote for herself a two-sentence
sketch, and sentence No. 2 was: ``She lives in New York City with
her husband and cats.'' Pretty cool, considering that Kiernan has
10 cats, 6 in the city and 4 in the country. ``The cats weren't
mentioned originally; I put them in at the last minute because for
the last 10 years at home, I've seen more of those cats than anyone
else.'' The book has been a 10-year project; eight to write; two to
trim, edit and publish.
</P>
<P>
   McKay Jenkins, author of ``The White Death: Tragedy and Heroism
in an Avalanche Zone'' (Random House) believes his dog Satchmo, one
of two springer spaniels he owns, is with him ``when I do some of
my best writing. I wouldn't say he is my muse, but he comes
close.''
</P>
<P>
   His other dog is blind, so Satchmo and he share an hourlong run
every day or a two-hour walk. But Jenkins made sure that his wife
and not his dogs was included in his dedication, although his flap
bio is the one that says he ``lives in Philadelphia with his wife
and two dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers are generally amused and bemused by the process of
mini-autobiographies and by the fascination with pets in
particular. Gina Centrello, publisher of Ballantine, said that
writers ``labor over this more than anything else on the cover;
they tend to revise it and revise it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their attempt to tell readers a little something about
themselves. If it's not libelous, whatever they are comfortable
with is OK; if someone wants to mention their cats, OK''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Neuman, the copy director for Ballantine, whose job is to
produce the book jacket copy, said that even a dead pet can make a
book flap. ``Some writers name all their animals in the copy,''
Neuman said, ``but you know pets die, and occasionally an author
will say that curious readers want to know what happened to Muffy,
and she passed away. It's rare to include that, but for the most
part we let them if it doesn't go on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Now pets are not the only distinguishing fact that authors like
to cram onto their flaps. David Morrell, author of the action novel
``Burnt Sienna'' (Warner Books), described himself as a former
literature professor who had training in ``hostage negotiation,
executive protection, antiterrorist driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda Huffey, author of ``The Hallelujah Side'' (Delphinium
Books), said that the publisher told her ``to put in anything in my
life that I thought was interesting. So I put in that I tap dance.
My mother played the tambourine; I couldn't so I tapped. Einstein
was a tap dancer, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite as intellectual as Einstein tap dancing is the
material Rob Kaplan wrote about himself on the flap for ``A Passion
for Books'' (Times Books), a collection of essays and stories and
etc. about books that he edited with Harold Rabinowitz. Kaplan
located himself: ``He lives with his family and more than 4,000
books in Cortlandt Manor, New York.''
</P>
<P>
   On the bio printed in the book, Kaplan craftily included his
wife, his two children and, catching up with the trend, his two
cats, along with all those books.
</P>
<P>
   So now it's 2001, and the author of the best-selling epic
``Iliad'' is on tour autographing copies. The flap bio is easy to
suppose: ``Homer lives in Ionia with his family and a large wooden
horse.''

UTAH SENATE FUNDS DRIVE TO PROSECUTE POLYGAMISTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a century after Utah outlawed polygamy, state
lawmakers are still trying to fight polygamist clans.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate voted 28-1 Wednesday in favor of a bill that
would earmark $500,000 for prosecution of abuse and fraud in
polygamous societies and pay for a hot line and emergency shelter
for women and children who leave polygamous enclaves. The bill now
goes to the House, where a similar bill that some lawmakers called
a ``witch hunt,'' was defeated last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it clear that this is not about people with
different religious beliefs or consenting adults,'' said the bill's
sponsor, Sen. Ron Allen, a Democrat. ``This is about felonies in
these communities. It's a focus on a specific group, and they're
called felons.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he believed there were about 50,000 polygamists in
Utah and that about 300 women and children left polygamous families
in the last year. Polygamists trace their beliefs to Mormonism, but
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints long ago disavowed
the practice and Utah, as a condition of statehood, outlawed
polygamy in 1896. Polygamy, a third-degree felony, is rarely
prosecuted because many of the marriages, while performed in a
church, are not registered with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's come to my attention in the past couple of years that
there are a number of human rights violations in our state in these
closed societies,'' Allen said. ``Some are the same types of crimes
that occur in nonpolygamous society, such as child abuse and
incest, but also welfare and tax fraud. There is a preponderance of
empirical evidence that these crimes are quite common and may even
have the tacit approval of some community members.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said that the extra money and resources were needed
because there should be more aggressive investigations and
prosecutions, which have to penetrate the ``secret communities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are taught to not talk to the outside world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited cases of women and children who left their families
behind and had nowhere to go. ``We believe it's a first major step,
and we are giving women and children an opportunity to set their
own directions and have a sense of freedom in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Matt Throckmorton, a Republican, called the
legislation discriminatory prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a religious belief about plural marriages, they do
not have a religious belief that these crimes are acceptable,''
said Throckmorton, who voted against the bill in the House,
</P>
<P>
   ``We currently have laws to deal with these crimes. We don't
need a new prosecutor or new money.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office in Utah has about $75,000 in its
budget for investigations of crimes in isolated communities.
</P>
<P>
   The jailing of two prominent polygamists for child abuse last
year put a spotlight on the issue. A father pleaded no contest to
beating his 16-year-old daughter after she ran away from a marriage
to her uncle, who was convicted of incest.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the passage of the bill shows that the state is trying
to clean up its image for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt
Lake City, but Allen disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an interest in this issue before the Olympics came up,
and I was not compelled by the Olympics,'' said the senator who
introduced a similar bill last year. ``There is no doubt in the
community's mind that we have let this go on far too long, and it's
probably time to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Varela, a spokeswoman for Gov. Mike Leavitt, said he
supports the bill.

   JABALIYA REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip _ Seven months into her
seventh pregnancy, Hanan Suelem fidgeted, shifting her weight on a
hard bench in a bare-bones clinic. Beneath her floral headscarf,
primly fastened at the chin with a butterfly pin, her face was
mournful, the face of an old woman.
</P>
<P>
   She is 34, she said, but very tired. Her first two children were
planned, the next four ``accidents.'' This time, after one accident
too many, she begged Islamic clerics to grant her permission to
have an abortion. They told her, she said, that she would be
``killing a soul.'' She told them that her soul was dying, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this, no more, never,'' she said, speaking almost in a
whisper. ``I have learned now about the IUD. Right after I deliver,
I'll have them put one in. There are too many children all
around.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Outside the clinic, as if to make her point, the area's schools,
which operate on two and three shifts to accommodate the growing
Palestinian population, let out for the day. Thousands of girls
wearing pinstriped uniforms and boys in jeans took over the sandy
streets, kicking through rain puddles and climbing junk heaps on
their way to their tin-roofed, concrete shacks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The population explosion in the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip
appears to be unrivaled in the world. Its 1.1 million residents _
half of whom are under 15 _ are expected to double by 2014, which
would pose almost unimaginable strains on what is already a highly
congested area with few jobs, severely inadequate housing and
almost no natural resources. (The current population of just over 3
million in the West Bank and Gaza combined is expected to rise to
5.5 million by then.)
</P>
<P>
   Gaza's extremely high fertility rate of seven children per woman
is comparable with Somalia's or Uganda's. But unlike those very
poor Muslim countries, almost all of Gaza's babies survive and
adults live a relatively long life, fueling a boom that is now
forcing difficult choices on Palestinians and their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Family planning is a central issue in Gaza _ central, at least,
to many young Palestinians who say they do not want their children
to suffer as they did in oversized poor families. But, for the
young Palestinian government, with its conservative, male-dominated
Islamic society, family planning is culturally sensitive and
politically complex. Large families are not only traditional but a
point of nationalist pride.
</P>
<P>
   For the five-year-old Palestinian Authority, the population
issue has been a challenge, although one that has not been publicly
acknowledged. Officially, Palestinian leaders have long advocated
population growth as a way to outnumber the Israelis on the land
the two groups share.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, however, Palestinian health and education
officials, working with foreign donors and international
organizations, quietly support family planning through a steady
expansion of clinics and community outreach services. Women are
taught about the different methods of contraception that are
acceptable under Islam _ anything except permanent means, like
sterilization or tubal ligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically speaking, our leadership believes very strongly
that the demographic route is the way to settle the score with the
Israelis,'' said Dr. Hassan Abu Libdeh, director of the Palestinian
Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their speeches, they are in favor of more children,'' he
said. ``But practically speaking, they are trying to promote the
opposite. The Health Ministry and the Education Ministry are doing
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies show a growing acceptance and use of birth control over
the last few years, especially the IUD, or intrauterine device,
followed by birth control pills. Few women bother to bring home
condoms from the clinics, because men in Gaza refuse to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Hnd education officials are careful not to advocate
population control. They refer delicately to the ``spacing'' of
children, underscoring that they are not talking about placing
limits on family size, which would violate Islamic teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them it is normal and natural to take at least three
years between babies,'' said Dr. Amna Abed, who runs a clinic at
the Red Crescent Society in Gaza City. ``We tell them that it is
written in the Koran. Our God orders us to breast-feed for two
years. And then follows nine months of pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Abd Al Karim Kahlout, the mufti of Gaza, is just as
involved as the health officials, an advocate himself of
``spacing.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At his office in Gaza City, he offered a discourse on the side
effects of the IUD and the pills. He is an older man and blind, and
it was an unexpectedly frank speech, which his personal scribe
interrupted several times to make sure he understood. ``Excessive
bleeding?'' he asked, his pen poised. ``Lactating?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The mufti said that he receives at least 20 calls a day from
couples seeking birth control advice. He recommends the imperfect
method of suppressing fertility through continued breast-feeding,
which many Gazan women had abandoned when international
organizations started supplying them with formula that allowed them
to wean their babies early. But he counsels women to visit clinics
to get more modern methods if they need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Middle East, after the wars ended and advanced medicine
conquered the diseases that would kill babies, family planning
became an essential issue,'' he said. ``Islam believes that baby,
child and mother must live a good life, with dignity. That means
taking a long breather in between children. We don't want women to
be so burdened they throw their children into the street.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the mufti said, ``Mohammed did say, `Get
married, make many children and I will be proud of you in front of
all the nations.' ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The religion sends mixed signals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So does the government. During the uprising, or intifada,
against Israel that began in the 1980s, Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, personally urged women to give birth for the
cause, to produce male fighters to replace those who had been
``martyred.'' Young men used to vandalize family planning clinics,
which were seen as defeatist, Abed said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fertility rates did rise during the intifada, perhaps partly
because of official encouragement, but also because Gazans lived
through five years of nightly curfews, locked in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   When the Palestinian Authority took over with its meager budget,
it faced the fruits of the Palestine Liberation Organization
campaign, the intifada years and entrenched norms: a population
with one of the highest fertility rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Women in Gaza average seven children. In the West Bank, where
fertility rates are lower, they still average a very high 5.6
children per woman. That compares to about 2.7 children in Israel,
the same figure as the worldwide average.
</P>
<P>
   But Gaza is a statistical oddity. Whereas its fertility rates
are similar to those of such desperately poor Muslim countries as
Somalia, nutrition and health care are much better. This is largely
because most Gazans receive prenatal and primary care for their
children from the many nongovernmental organizations based there,
especially in the United Nations-run refugee camps like Jabalya.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a much higher proportion of Gazan babies survive
and live a long life. In Somalia, 122 of every 1,000 infants die
before they reach their first birthday. In Gaza, that number is
only 21. Somalians generally live only until their mid to late 40s.
Gazans' average life expectancy is 73.
</P>
<P>
   This creates the unusually high rate of population growth in
Gaza, which, judging from international statistics, is the highest
in the world: over 4 percent a year. Israel, in comparison, is
growing at the rate of about 2 percent a year, which includes high
levels of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's population of 6 million, of which about 5 million are
Jews, is expected to reach about 8.3 million by the year 2025. The
Palestinians predict that 25 years from now their population will
rise from just over 3 million, with 1.1 million in Gaza, to 7.4
million, with 3 million in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   For Gaza, already so densely populated, this seems unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind if Gazans continue producing babies, but they
will have to move somewhere else,'' said Dr. Abu Libneh, the chief
statistician for the Palestinian Authority. ``They simply will not
fit into their current geography _ forgetting about feeding and
employing them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He said only the most aggressive family planning program could
make a dent in the rate of growth. But the Palestinian government
is not involved in population planning at all, he said, not
recognizing the growth as a problem or priority.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian advocates for a sustainable development policy are
advocates for women. They are pushing fiercely, but without great
hope, for a law that would raise the legal age of marriage to help
delay the start of child-bearing. Half of Palestinian women marry
before they reach the age of 18, and it is legal to do so at 15 in
Gaza, and 17 in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a woman is married at the age of 15, she doesn't go to
school,'' said Dr. Rabah Muhana, a male physician who campaigns for
women's reproductive health and empowerment. ``If she stays at home
and doesn't have seven or eight children, what will she do?''
</P>
<P>
   Culturally, women are encouraged to keep having children until
they have at least a couple of boys. ``They don't count the females
when they calculate family size,'' said Dr. Mouna Farra, who runs
clinics in Gaza. ``They start paying condolences when the mother
has a female. `OK, so she will help you,' people say. `But try
again. Maybe you'll get lucky next time'.''
</P>
<P>
   By such standards, Hameed Daya, 48, a real estate developer, is
very lucky.
</P>
<P>
   He is the father of 10 boys. His wife never wanted to stop
trying for a girl. Eight years ago, she gave up, and Daya was
thrilled. But his wife falsely believed she was too old to get
pregnant. Now, at 43, she is expecting again _ an 11th boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can field a soccer team,'' Daya said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was from a poor family, and I never wanted my children to
suffer what I suffered,'' he said. ``Somehow God gave me more money
whenever I had more children. But there is a limit and I've reached
it. How can I give them all an education, a wedding, a house? I
tried to get my wife an abortion. I went to see the mufti, and I
lied to him. But he told me this was `harab' _ taboo. He scared
me.''

KUWAIT IS SAID TO BE OPPOSED TO CAMPAIGN TO LOWER OIL PRICES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ A consensus on the need for lower or stable oil
prices is slowly building among some leading producers, but
resistance to the Clinton administration's campaign for increased
oil supplies and lower prices is coming not only from Algeria and
Iran, but from a traditional Middle East ally, Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   According to American and Arab oil officials, Kuwait, which
controls 9 percent of the world's reserves and has considerable
ability to produce more oil, apparently remains opposed to the
administration's view that the recent run-up in prices to the
highest in nearly a decade will cause inflationary pressures that
threaten global economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of energy, Bill Richardson, in the sixth day of
his 10-day tour of some of the largest oil producers, picked up
strong support here from Egypt. After Richardson met Wednesday in
the Egyptian capital with President Hosni Mubarak and Sameh Fahmy,
Egypt's minister of petroleum, Fahmy said current prices were too
high and had to come down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't take the price down, everything will go up,'' said
Fahmy, speaking in English to Egyptian and American businessmen. An
inflationary spiral now, Fahmy said, would jeopardize Egypt's
development plans as well as its economic overhaul and
privatization. What the United States is promoting, Fahmy said,
would result in ``a balanced situation for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, oil ministers from the
four-member Gulf Cooperation Council pledged to work with other
producers to create a predictable oil market to avoid ``harming the
world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ministers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates and Qatar, which together produce about half the daily
output of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, did
not say they would do this by releasing more oil.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of such a statement, coupled with the refusal of the
Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, to answer reporters' questions
about whether production would be raised, led to speculation on the
oil markets that the group could not reach a consensus on strategy.
</P>
<P>
   This in turn, helped pushed up oil prices Wednesday. On the New
York Mercantile Exchange, prices rose 47 cents, to $29.39 a barrel.
Prices reached a nine-year high of $30.45 last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait's reported resistance to what is said to be an emerging
majority view among its fellow OPEC members also annoyed Clinton
administration officials in Washington, as well as Richardson's
energy team, which is expected to arrive in Kuwait on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Richardson said he was extremely
pleased with Egypt's support. Asked about the the Gulf Cooperation
Council's ambiguous statement, he called it ``responsible,'' adding
that it was ``heading in the right direction.'' He declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Other administration officials who had hoped that the
cooperation council would be more decisive about raising production
to lower prices were clearly irritated by what they described as
Kuwait's continuing hard-line stance, particularly in view of the
American-led military effort nine years ago to liberate Kuwait from
Iraq's occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's gratitude for you,'' said one American oil expert, who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-line stance on prices by Kuwait is also likely to
infuriate Capitol Hill. At a hearing last week, Rep. Benjamin A.
Gilman of New York, the Republican chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, urged the Clinton administration
to cut off military assistance to OPEC nations that refused to help
reduce oil prices. ``The people in the Northeast are facing a major
crisis in the cost of home heating oil,'' Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed Wednesday to say what oil price he was seeking from the
countries he called ``good friends of the United States'' _ Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia _ Richardson demurred. ``Thirty dollars a barrel
is too high,'' he said. ``And $10 is too low. We're not trying to
be greedy,'' he added, saying that it should be market forces that
determine price. ``We're trying to do what is in everyone's best
interest,'' he said.

EAVESDROPPING SYSTEM DOES NOT GATHER DATA FOR COMMERCIAL USE,
EXPERT SAYS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (With EUROPE-U.S.-SPY) 
(js) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Echelon system was developed in the 1970s, and
it links a series of computers in at least seven sites around the
world to receive, analyze and sort information captured from
satellite communications traffic, according to recently
declassified information.
</P>
<P>
   The computers watch and listen for key words in telephone, fax
and Internet communications and route intercepted messages on a
topic requested by a country. It is the modern descendant of a
decades-old electronic eavesdropping network set up by the United
States with Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Although an Echelon system exists, it is not controlled by the
National Security Agency to provide U.S. corporations with stolen
industrial intelligence, according to Jeffrey Richelson, a senior
fellow at the National Security Archive. Richelson retrieved
documents about Echelon through requests under the Freedom of
Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   The network began with an agreement between London and
Washington in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``Countries throughout the world _ not just these five _ engage
in widespread satellite intercepts,'' Richelson said. ``It is a
legitimate question whether people minding their own business are
having their conversations picked up by any of these systems.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of the most extravagant claims about Echelon make
little sense, Richelson said, because the National Security Agency
is overwhelmed by the proliferation of information over the
Internet. ``Its ability to collect and process information is not
nearly as immense as some of these accounts make it out to be,'' he
said. ``This agency is not doing all that well against the new
information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration denied accusations Wednesday by the
European Parliament that the security agency was involved in
illegally collecting intelligence for commercial use through
satellite interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. intelligence agencies are not tasked to engage in
industrial espionage or obtain trade secrets for the benefit of any
U.S. company or companies,'' said a spokesman for the State
Department, James P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   But those denials, along with the routine refusals of the
security agency to discuss the issue, will most likely not halt
congressional hearings planned for the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who called for the hearings into the
project, conceded that he was uncertain of what Echelon actually
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charges are serious that the government indiscriminately
scoops up millions upon millions of conversations daily over the
Internet and the telephone,'' Barr said in an interview. ``But the
first question I have is what is being collected on Echelon and how
is it being used. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, Barr, who once worked for the Central
Intelligence Agency, first heard of Echelon when he was researching
privacy issues last year for a speech he delivered before the
American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Over the internet, Echelon had reached urban myth status as the
spying arm of the U.S. government. A ``Jam Echelon Day'' was
declared last October, and activists around the world sent out a
huge number of communications over the internet and on the
telephone using words like ``terrorism'' that they presumed were
key words and would overload a system designed to listen for such
topics.

MARKET DIVERGES AS NASDAQ JUMPS 168.21, DOW TUMBLES 79.11 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The technology-laden Nasdaq stock index soared 168.21
points Wednesday _ its biggest point gain ever _ more than
offsetting the losses it incurred in the two preceding sessions and
surpassing the high it had set just last week.
</P>
<P>
   But in another sharp divergence between the performance of the
high-technology sector and most other stocks, 20 of the 30 stocks
in the Dow Jones industrial average fell _ 10 of them by more than
a dollar _ to push the blue-chip gauge down 79.11 points, to
10,304.84, its fourth loss in five sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The bullish technology tone was set early, analysts said, when
Merrill Lynch strongly recommended eBay, the Internet auction
house, and America Online, whose deal to acquire Time Warner has
met skepticism in various quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an appearance before a Senate committee, Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, seemed to dispel some
fears he aroused last week that he was focusing on stock prices in
an effort to cool an overheated economy that might cause inflation
to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a big relief rally'' for buyers of growth
stocks, said Matthew W. Johnson, head of Nasdaq trading at Lehman
Brothers. ``He didn't drop another shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also pointed to heavy buying of Cisco Systems and
Qualcomm stocks by index funds needing to add shares to conform
with rebalanced index weightings.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay surged 20 7/16 a share, to 154 15/16; America Online 9
1/16, to 58 11/16; Cisco 14 11/16, to 138 5/8; and Qualcomm 16
5/16, to 146 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one game for the portfolio manager,'' said
Richard E. Cripps, chief equity strategist at Legg Mason in
Baltimore. ``He can't afford to be in anything that's not showing
great relative strength.''
</P>
<P>
   And when technology stocks took off, many traders who had bet
that the declines of Friday and Tuesday would continue were driven
to cover their short positions, buying back shares they had
borrowed and sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index finished at 4,550.33, up 3.84
percent, with the 168.21-point gain slightly greater than the
previous one-day record of 167.05 points on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Technology also lifted the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index,
which climbed 8.52 points to 1,360.69 even though 350 of its
component issues fell while only 140 rose.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Dow, Procter &AMP; Gamble, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, IBM, Merck
and Honeywell all lost more than 2 points a share to lead its
retreat. The only issues to gain more than a point were Intel, up 2
5/16 a share, to 109 1/16; Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing, up 2
3/16, to 92 5/16; and Hewlett-Packard, up 2}, to 130}.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Blodget, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, initiated coverage
of eBay with a buy rating, saying that the stock could reach 175 a
share within 12 to 18 months; it wound up moving about halfway
there Wednesday. Blodget and another Merrill analyst said America
Online ``seems undervalued by almost any measure.''
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Greenspan
said that among other things, he agreed with analysts who see no
evidence of revived inflation. ``I cannot find it, no matter where
I look,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``the basic purpose of what we are trying to do is
to sustain this extraordinary recovery, this extraordinary
acceleration in growth and a vibrant labor market.''
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered
advancing ones 1,764 to 1,258, with 219 stocks setting new 52-week
lows and only 47 reaching new highs. Volume remained heavy, with
994 million shares traded compared with 980 million Tuesday.

ALCATEL ACQUIRES CANADIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (js) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Alcatel SA, the big French communications equipment
maker, has agreed to buy Newbridge Networks Corp. of Canada in a
$7.1 billion stock transaction. The deal will give the combined
company a stronger line of products to compete in North America
against domestic rivals that dominate one of the world's largest
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Wednesday appeared to be the culmination
of a period of uncertainty for Newbridge, which, though one of the
most prominent technology companies in Canada, has been losing
sales to big rivals like Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems of
the United States and Nortel Networks of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   For Alcatel, the acquisition of Newbridge will give it a maker
of equipment that delivers voice, data and video signals over a
single network, an important way to send vast quantities of
information over the Internet. Lucent and Cisco are already leaders
in this kind of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, which was announced Wednesday
after approval from the boards of both companies, one Newbridge
share will be exchanged for 0.81 Alcatel American depository
receipt. The Alcatel ADRs, each of which is equivalent to one-fifth
of a common share, fell $4 Wednesday, to $43.75, on the New York
Stock Exchange. Newbridge shares fell $1.50, to $32.875, also on
the Big Board. Trading in both was extremely heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Serge Tchuruk, Alcatel's chairman and chief executive, said in
Paris that his company ``is making a major move to become a world
leader in new-generation networks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is expected to boost both growth and income,''
Tchuruk added.
</P>
<P>
   Newbridge's headquarters in Kanata, Ontario, near Ottawa, will
become the head office for a new North American division of
Alcatel, with an estimated $2.5 billion in sales this year. Pearse
Flynn, president of Newbridge, has been named president of the new
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Cost savings for the combined company are expected to be $230
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Newbridge's strength in product development has been offset by a
weakness in marketing and profitability. In November, after the
failure of a sales push in the United States and its sixth warning
that quarterly profit would not meet expectations, Terence
Matthews, Newbridge's founder and owner of a 23 percent stake,
agreed to put the company up for sale. Matthews, who is expected to
move on to other high-technology ventures, said ``the union of
Alcatel and Newbridge is a true validation of our strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale to Alcatel had been anticipated for the last two weeks
after two other European suitors, Siemens of Germany and Ericsson
of Sweden, decided not to pursue Newbridge.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although it has been a relatively small competitor so far in the
United States, Alcatel is the second-largest communications
equipment supplier in Europe after Ericsson, and has a solid
international presence. It has 120,000 employees and operates in
more than 130 countries. In the last two years, it has spent $8.5
billion on global acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Newbridge, which has been in business for 14 years, has 6,000
employees and has until now operated largely through affiliations
with other companies _ one of the most important having been
Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel has been building slowly and modestly in North America,
but it will now be in a better position to compete. The United
States accounts for about 40 percent of the estimated $560 billion
global market for telecommunications equipment.

 &HT;    FOES BLAST GOVERNMENT PLAN TO MANAGE COLORADO FOREST
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's called ``Alternative D,'' and a lot of people
don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message from a Senate hearing Wednesday that examined
a U.S. Forest Service plan for management of the White River
National Forest in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative D, the plan option preferred by the Forest Service,
would close roads, limit ski-area expansion, curtail snowmobile use
and increase lands protected as wilderness in the 2.3 million-acre
forest.
</P>
<P>
   Its critics, including Colorado's two senators, say it would
unduly limit public use, hurt the region's economy and trample on
local and state rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``A top-down, one-size-fits-all approach to public land
management ignores all the hard work and expertise applied to the
issue by local citizens,'' said Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Several Colorado interests testified at the oversight hearing,
which was scheduled at the request of Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
R-Colo. Campbell amended a bill in October to extend the public
comment period on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said lawmakers should proceed with caution, because the
plan could set a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving up our responsibility over public lands to the
administrative branch of government, in my view, is not a good
precedent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said Alternative D would restrict the use of the White
River to ``only those young enough to carry 60-pound backpacks into
the forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending the plan, Lyle Laverty, regional forester for the
Rocky Mountain region, said it is still a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a draft,'' he said. Developing this an
``extremely open process,'' he said, and a final decision on the
matter won't come until early next year. Even then, the final plan
will be a ``dynamic, living document,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporterss of Alternative D say the plan is an unprecedented
attempt to limit the effects of ski-area expansion and off-road
vehicles on the quality of life and wildlife in the forest. There
are 12 ski areas operating in White River.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Compton, executive director of the Aspen Wilderness
Workshop, told the panel that the plan is a ``great place to
start,'' but should go even further to protect wildlife habitat and
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the limits on ski areas, Compton said that the
industry is being taken over by corporations whose motive for
expanding resorts is to develop adjacent private land.
</P>
<P>
   ``These impacts include monster vacation homes, sprawl, traffic
congestion, unaffordable housing and thousands of unskilled,
low-paying jobs that are straining our public services,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell asked sarcastically if Compton supported legislation to
stop people from building homes on private land.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I'm suggesting at all,'' Compton responded.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, state and local officials expressed various
concerns about the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alternative D would turn the White River National Forest into
a museum without visitors,'' said Randy Parsons, president of the
White River Forest Alliance, a group formed in 1997 to represent
park users.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons said his group worked with the Forest Service to develop
parts of the plan, but that all their suggestions were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that we have been misled from the beginning and that
the Forest Service has only given us lip service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Swartout, a policy analyst for Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado,
told the panel that the state is concerned that the plan gives a
higher priority to physical and biological resources than to human
uses of the forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This premise fails to balance those important priorities with
the simple fact that thousands of people rely on these resources
for their livelihood, their quality of life and the cultural and
economic health of their communities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others who testified at Wednesday's hearing included Andy Daly,
president of Vail Resorts; Jerry Abboud of the Colorado Off Highway
Vehicles Coalition, and Vera Smith of the Colorado Mountain Club.
</P>
<P>
   Public comments on the White River National Forest Management
Plan are due May 9.

<P>
   Oil prices have been flirting recently with $25 to $30 per
barrel, the highest in a decade _ levels almost reminiscent of the
oil shocks of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   And the yo-yo prices have been accompanied by hysteria about
dwindling supplies and potentially dangerous transfers of wealth,
from nation to nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the energy problem looming in the early 21st century is
neither skyrocketing prices nor shortages. Instead, the danger is
precisely the opposite. Long-term trends point to a prolonged oil
surplus and low oil prices over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, this scenario of plenty could destabilize
oil-producing states, especially those in the ellipse stretching
from the Persian Gulf to Russia. And although the U.S. economy
would by and large benefit, the backfire of low oil prices could
imperil U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   Both the popular and the elite media _ from Parade magazine
asking ``Could It Happen Again?'' to Scientific American, no less,
proclaiming ``The End of Cheap Oil'' _ are peppered with forecasts
of gloom and doom about energy security.
</P>
<P>
   But this ``sky-is-falling'' school of oil forecasting has been
systematically wrong for more than a generation. In its dramatic
1972 ``Limits to Growth'' report, the group of prominent experts
known as the Club of Rome wrote that only 550 billion barrels of
oil were left and these would run out by 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the world consumed 600 billion barrels of oil between
1970 and 1990, and there are today more than a trillion barrels of
proven reserves. This figure is likely to continue rising even as
global consumption exceeds the current 73 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity forecasters _ in some cases, the same people who
predicted in the 1970s that oil would cost $100 per barrel by 2000
_ are not only still wrong, they also have it exactly backward. The
world's problem is not scarcity but glut.
</P>
<P>
   This is true despite the recent Saudi-engineered production
cutbacks by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which boosted oil prices off their $8-per-barrel lows.
Seasoned oil-market watchers knew this fragile deal among oil
producers could dissipate quickly. Indeed by late February the
Saudis were signaling to the markets their support for a production
rise, which would trigger a price fall.
</P>
<P>
   As OPEC knows, other oil producers around the globe are enjoying
new finds and announcing new plans to expand capacity. The oil
supply potential in Iraq, Russia, Africa and elsewhere belies the
Cassandra-like predictions that the world will soon deplete its oil
assets.
</P>
<P>
   So too, the prophecies of dried-up wells obscure the far more
likely prospect: a sustained oil glut and long-term low oil prices,
which will have very different _ and largely unconsidered _
political and strategic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 dalliance with $8 barrels hinted at the possibilities,
with the economic meltdown in Russia and a forced succession in
wealthy Brunei.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab states of the oil-rich Persian Gulf, non-OPEC producers
and consumers are simply not prepared for a new geopolitics of
energy. Neither, frankly, is Washington. The political
reverberations of a sustained oil glut should not be
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   Several important regimes _ in the Persian Gulf states, Russia,
the former Soviet republics and such key Latin American countries
as Venezuela, Mexico and Colombia _ count on healthy oil revenues
for calming restless populations, assuaging social tensions and, in
some cases, significant nation building.
</P>
<P>
   Without the salve of rising oil revenues, many of these lands
can expect to see heightened political instability, social unrest
or even civil wars, which could be grimly reminiscent of the recent
Balkan slaughters.
</P>
<P>
   Without healthy oil revenues to buy off restive populations, the
leaders of various repressive gulf regimes will be left with only
repression to silence foes and quell public discontent, which could
fuel even more violent opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Radicalized local populations could also threaten the Middle
East peace process. Disgruntled gulf states might be tempted to
placate Islamist movements by funding the terrorists of Hamas, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 Persian Gulf war demonstrated the West's capacity to
defend important oil regions from traditional external threats like
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. But America's painful experiences
with revolutionary Iran in the late 1970s and the Balkans in the
1990s are grim reminders of how hard it can be to cope with
internal instability.
</P>
<P>
   The new dynamics of the global oil market have profound
implications for U.S. national security policy. Washington had
better gird itself.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong-headed predictions of scarcity are as old as the oil trade
itself. In 1885 the U.S. Geological Survey predicted ``little or no
chance of oil in California.'' In 1914 the U.S. Bureau of Mines
forecast only a 10-year supply of oil in the United States, and the
list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The latest scarcity theorists are exemplified by one of the
world's most prominent petroleum geologists, Colin Campbell. He has
argued in many industry, policy and scientific journals that
growing global consumption of oil, driven by the emergence of a
modern, industrialized Asia-Pacific, is dramatically raising
demand.
</P>
<P>
   This rise, he warns, will collide with a slowdown in new oil
discoveries, leading to another energy crisis. By 2003, global
production will peak and the oil age will start to end.
</P>
<P>
   Why then have average oil prices NOT risen much in nearly a
generation?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is profound changes in the oil and gas markets.
Another is a profound high-tech revolution. Many analysts expected
that non-OPEC oil production would be short-lived. But they missed
the technological advances _ including computer-assisted,
three-dimensional imaging that lets geologists ``see'' underground
oil pockets _ that slashed the costs of developing hard-to-tap
reserves and improved the chances for new discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, better platform designs and drilling methods have also
let companies recover more of the oil they find. These
technological gains have dramatically lowered the cost of finding
and producing oil and natural gas and given energy consumers ample,
inexpensive supplies just at the time that earlier forecasts had
predicted a shortage.
</P>
<P>
   They have extended the life of existing wells and allowed the
oil industry to double the amount of oil recovered _ in many cases
from about 20 percent to 30 percent to between 50 percent and 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The average U.S. costs for finding oil fell from about $15 per
barrel in the 1980s to just $5 per barrel in 1998. Drillers are
four times as successful at finding natural gas and six times as
successful at finding oil as they were before the 1973 oil crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Now that finding and producing oil is cheaper and easier, more
and more countries are getting into the act.
</P>
<P>
   Ample, accessible new reserves will soon come on-line in the
waters off the Gulf of Mexico, eastern Canada and western Africa,
as well as onshore in central Africa, South America and frontier
areas in the former Soviet Union and the far reaches of the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   Increased oil production in Venezuela, Colombia, Canada, Brazil
and the U.S. South has begun crowding more-distant Persian Gulf oil
out of the U.S. market. When growing oil imports from the Atlantic
basin (the North Sea and West Africa) are added in, the divide
widens.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming decade, the United States will increasingly rely
on oil from within the Western hemisphere and the Atlantic basin.
In the new, more efficient global oil market, most sellers strive
to sell their oil to the closest buyer to maximize revenues. It is
East Asia's dependence on Middle Eastern oil that is rising
substantially, not America's.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons to expect that the oil glut will NOT dry
up. All the major auto manufacturers have made large investments in
post-internal-combustion cars and have new prototypes of ``hybrid''
cars (that is, cars that run on both gas and electricity) and
fuel-cell cars to be mass-marketed by 2005-15, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota and Honda are already marketing hybrid models in the
United States that get 80 miles per gallon, and experts say that by
2015 these post-combustion cars will make up at least 20 percent of
new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Trends in the Middle East also bode well for lower oil prices,
particularly as U.S.-led sanctions against Iran, Iraq and Libya
begin to erode. Iraq, with 110 billion barrels in proven reserves,
has been held back from tapping them by U.N. sanctions since it
invaded Kuwait a decade ago. If sanctions are eased _ after, say,
Saddam Hussein is toppled, or the Desert Storm coalition collapses
completely _ one can expect to see Iraq's production rates double
within five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the oil-rich gulf, Iran and Kuwait are also working to reopen
their oil sectors to foreign investors, hoping to boost their
capacity to pump out oil, their political clout and their national
security.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia is following suit, both to protect its regional
prominence and to stimulate its economy. The Royal Dutch/Shell
Group recently announced an $800 million investment in offshore
Iranian oil fields, which could further add to the glut.
</P>
<P>
   If Kuwait, Iran and Iraq get their way, and if non-OPEC
production grows at only two-thirds the rate it did between 1985
and 1995, oil markets could be even more oversupplied than in 1998
_ the year prices collapsed to $8 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   To consume all the oil that will probably be pumped out over the
next 10 years, world oil demand would need to grow by more than 3
percent per year, instead of the 1.8 percent annual growth rate
between 1980 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   If the days when the gulf was America's lifeline are fading,
then similarly, no Caspian oil will feed U.S. markets; rather, it
will flow to Europe and possibly to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of defending America's global oil supply will
probably complicate as the world's oil habits change. As U.S.
imports from the Persian Gulf diminish, the expensive U.S. military
role of ``guardian of the gulf'' will become increasingly
vulnerable to citizens at home calling for more burden-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Will Congress and the U.S. public continue to agree to spend
blood and treasure to protect the Persian Gulf region while such
allies _ and recipients of the region's fossil fuels _ as the
European Union and Japan play virtually no military role there?
Such questions have colored the debate about expanding NATO's
post-Cold War role beyond Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Then too, China's rising hunger for oil imports means that it
will depend more on the same energy resources and sea
transportation lanes shared by the United States, Japan and other
industrialized countries. China, which conceives of itself as an
emerging great power, however, probably will not be comfortable
relying on the U.S. Navy to defend the sea lanes through which its
own Persian Gulf oil lifeline will have to be strung.
</P>
<P>
   If China thinks it is more vulnerable in energy, it could become
more assertive, particularly if U.S.-Chilations turn
adversarial. But if generous supplies of oil at moderate prices
persist, energy issues might actually provide a good opportunity
for cooperation between China, its neighbors and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons of the past century should have taught us that
politics, not geology, has ruled our oil-supply fate. Politics and
diplomacy brought the price of oil from $8 per barrel to $23 last
year. The internal politics of the Persian Gulf have repeatedly
disrupted U.S. oil supplies in the past and could do so again in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. dependence on Middle East oil wanes and Asian reliance
on it grows, a new set of issues will arise: rivalries between
Asian countries for oil supplies and complex problems about sharing
the burden for keeping the gulf's oil flowing freely.
</P>
<P>
   Properly assessing America's strategic situation in a world of
cheap oil _ in hopes of ensuring a more reliable oil supply _
should not be limited exclusively to military assistance but should
be linked to political and social institution-building and
diversified economic development.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, such reforms will better insulate the shakier countries
from the internal turbulence caused by volatile oil revenues.
Supply would be more secure, and the citizens of oil-producing
nations would gain more from the natural wealth their countries
control.
</P>
<P>
   Both producers and consumers thereby win _ regardless of how
high or low oil prices eventually wind up.

<P>
   Oil prices have been flirting recently with $25 to $30 per
barrel, the highest in a decade _ levels almost reminiscent of the
oil shocks of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   And the yo-yo prices have been accompanied by hysteria about
dwindling supplies and potentially dangerous transfers of wealth,
from nation to nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the energy problem looming in the early 21st century is
neither skyrocketing prices nor shortages. Instead, the danger is
precisely the opposite. Long-term trends point to a prolonged oil
surplus and low oil prices over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, this scenario of plenty could destabilize
oil-producing states, especially those in the ellipse stretching
from the Persian Gulf to Russia. And although the U.S. economy
would by and large benefit, the backfire of low oil prices could
imperil U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   Both the popular and the elite media _ from Parade magazine
asking ``Could It Happen Again?'' to Scientific American, no less,
proclaiming ``The End of Cheap Oil'' _ are peppered with forecasts
of gloom and doom about energy security.
</P>
<P>
   But this ``sky-is-falling'' school of oil forecasting has been
systematically wrong for more than a generation. In its dramatic
1972 ``Limits to Growth'' report, the group of prominent experts
known as the Club of Rome wrote that only 550 billion barrels of
oil were left and these would run out by 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the world consumed 600 billion barrels of oil between
1970 and 1990, and there are today more than a trillion barrels of
proven reserves. This figure is likely to continue rising even as
global consumption exceeds the current 73 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity forecasters _ in some cases, the same people who
predicted in the 1970s that oil would cost $100 per barrel by 2000
_ are not only still wrong, they also have it exactly backward. The
world's problem is not scarcity but glut.
</P>
<P>
   This is true despite the recent Saudi-engineered production
cutbacks by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which boosted oil prices off their $8-per-barrel lows.
Seasoned oil-market watchers knew this fragile deal among oil
producers could dissipate quickly. Indeed by late February the
Saudis were signaling to the markets their support for a production
rise, which would trigger a price fall.
</P>
<P>
   As OPEC knows, other oil producers around the globe are enjoying
new finds and announcing new plans to expand capacity. The oil
supply potential in Iraq, Russia, Africa and elsewhere belies the
Cassandra-like predictions that the world will soon deplete its oil
assets.
</P>
<P>
   So too, the prophecies of dried-up wells obscure the far more
likely prospect: a sustained oil glut and long-term low oil prices,
which will have very different _ and largely unconsidered _
political and strategic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 dalliance with $8 barrels hinted at the possibilities,
with the economic meltdown in Russia and a forced succession in
wealthy Brunei.
</P>

PROPOSED FLAT TAX FOR FOUNDATIONS COULD DISCOURAGE GRANT GIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine actually choosing to pay taxes at a higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   That is what some foundations do. Last year, for example, faced
with the decision whether to maintain its historical level of
giving or pay twice as much in taxes, the Carnegie Corp. of New
York, paid a total of $2.6 million to the federal government. The
foundation, one of the nation's largest, was under new leadership
and undergoing a review of its priorities, so it slowed its giving
and therefore no longer qualified for a lower tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we are driven by our programmatic ideas,'' said D.
Ellen Shuman, Carnegie's chief investment officer, who argued that
a foundation's emphasis should be on making grants, not on lowering
its tax bill. Otherwise, ``honestly, it would be the tail wagging
the dog,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Foundations have long complained about the two-tier federal
excise tax, which is set at 1 percent of a foundation's annual
investment income for a foundation that maintains or increases its
level of giving, or 2 percent for those that do not. They say the
tax is poorly designed and overly complicated, requiring too much
paperwork and discouraging large increases in giving by threatening
foundations with the higher tax if they subsequently reduce how
much they give to charity. By law, foundations must give away at
least 5 percent of their assets each year to retain their nonprofit
status.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the nation's largest private foundations say they
usually try to give away enough each year to meet the criteria for
the lower tax rate, many do not. Though only a tiny slice of their
billions in assets, the taxes represent millions of dollars flowing
to the federal government rather than to charity. When the Lilly
Endowment paid the higher tax rate in 1998, for example, the
additional amount was nearly $6 million. The foundation declined to
comment on its decision to pay the higher tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a little-noticed provision in President Clinton's 2001
budget proposal aims to simplify the tax, replacing the two tiers
with a flat 1.25 percent tax. The new proposal is intended to allow
foundations to focus on making grants without regard to the tax
impact of those decisions, according to a Treasury official.
</P>
<P>
   But some charity advocates say the provision will also eliminate
the only incentive that now exists to encourage more giving.
Largely as a result of the bull market in stocks, foundation assets
have soared in recent years. Assets reached $330 billion at the end
of 1997, the most recent data available, according to the
Foundation Center, a New York research group. Grants totaled
slightly under $16 billion, or 4.8 percent of assets, suggesting
that foundations, on average, are hewing to the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton proposal does ``nothing to ensure more money gets
into the hands of advocates and service providers,'' according to
the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a Washington
group that recommends linking any cut in the excise tax to an
increase in the amount foundations must give away.
</P>
<P>
   The group advocates raising the so-called payout, the minimum
percentage of assets foundations must give to charity, to 6 percent
and requiring foundations to include only actual grants in their
calculations. Many foundations currently include administrative
costs and their excise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Foundations pay an estimated $430 million in excise taxes a
year, according to the Council on Foundations, a Washington
association of foundations and corporate-giving programs, which
supports the Clinton proposal, saying that the current structure is
a disincentive to giving. The council is considering pushing for a
1 percent tax in order to prevent some of its members from paying
more in taxes. Though no one tracks the number of foundations that
pay the lower tax, the proposal is generally expected to result in
less tax revenue, suggesting that a greater number of foundations
pay the higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current rules, foundations face a series of hurdles
before qualifying for the lower tax rate. In addition to giving
away 5 percent or more of their assets, foundations must maintain
their average level of giving as a percentage of their assets,
based on the last five years. The rules also require that
foundations give away to charity an amount equal to the tax savings
reaped by paying at the 1 percent rather than the 2 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   While many small foundations simply pay the higher tax rather
than do the complex bookkeeping necessary, most large foundations
have learned to finesse the timing of their grant-making based in
part on the tax ramifications. But since these foundations also do
not want to give away so much that they shrink their assets over
the years, many are careful not to maintain what they view as too
high a level of giving and will decrease what they give away from
time to time to lower their average level.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There is inevitably a year when you decrease'' the amount you
give away, said George Vera, the chief financial officer for the
David and Lucile Packard Foundation, one of the very largest
foundations, with about $13 billion at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the large foundations also say that the surging stock
market and the resulting huge growth in the value of their assets
has made it hard to give away enough in well- thought-out grants.
Packard, for example, ``would prefer not to pay any taxes,''
according to Vera, but expects to pay the higher tax in 1999
because of the rise in the value of its endowment. ``How fast can
you ramp up programs?'' he asked, noting that the foundation has
focused on building the necessary infrastructure to handle the
higher volume of grants.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton proposal would make the task of managing the
grant-making less arduous, he said, adding, ``I think it is an
issue of simplicity and predictability.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the current tax structure say it may make some
foundations more reluctant to share the wealth for a year or so or
to undertake large programs that require significant spending in
any year for fear of raising their average giving levels. ``Why
should the government be interfering in the spending policies of
foundations?'' asked John Edie, the general counsel of the Council
on Foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The change has the support of some foundations that will
probably pay more under the current proposal because it raises the
tax they pay by a quarter of a percentage point. The W.K. Kellogg
Foundation, for example, usually meets the criteria for the lower
tax but is in favor of the 1.25 percent flat tax. `It would end
this cumbersome process,'' explained Mike Van Buren, a spokesman
for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the tax leaves some watchdog groups with the
impression that foundations are more concerned about protecting the
continuing growth of their portfolios than about their primary
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be more about the banking side of things than the
grant-making side of things,'' said Terry Odendahl, a co-director
of the National Network of Grantmakers, an organization of
foundations that is also trying to persuade foundations to increase
voluntarily the amount they give away, to at least 6 percent.
``Wouldn't they want to make bigger grants?''

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan defended the Federal Reserve's
recent interest rate increases Wednesday as necessary to keep the
current prosperity on track, and denied that he was putting the
entire economy at risk just to rein in the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Greenspan,
the central bank chairman, parried questions from members of both
parties about whether he was putting too much emphasis on the
strains that rising stock prices might be creating in the economy,
and too little on the benefits of low unemployment, steady growth
and low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on comments he made last week, Greenspan said that
while he was not aiming at stock prices, he had to be concerned
about how the run-up on Wall Street translated into increased
consumer spending and a broader increase in demand for goods and
services. That ``wealth effect,'' he said, was contributing to an
imbalance between demand and the economy's ability to produce the
supply needed to meet it, the classic precondition for an outbreak
of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he sees no evidence of inflation outside of
rising oil and commodity prices. But as he did during an appearance
before the House Banking Committee last week, he suggested that the
Fed will continue raising rates in small steps until the economy
slows from the blistering pace it set in the second half of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've tried to argue today is not that we are on the edge
of instability, but that we have an extraordinary economy which is
growing at a pace which is somewhat above the level which is
sustainable over a longer term,'' Greenspan said during a long
question-and-answer session with the Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates four times in eight months, in
quarter-point increments. Analysts are all but certain that the
central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will
push its benchmark federal funds rate _ the target rate for
overnight loans among banks _ up another quarter point, to 6
percent, at its next policy-setting meeting, on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   With inflation quiescent, the interplay between the stock market
and the economy has emerged as one of the trickiest and most
critical issues facing the Fed, and Greenspan spent much of
Wednesday's session trying to explain his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   By the Fed's estimate, ``perhaps three to four cents out of
every additional dollar of stock market wealth eventually is
reflected in increased consumer purchases,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Multiplied by the trillions of dollars of wealth created by the
long bull market, that is one powerful engine of consumer demand.
(Much the same phenomenon causes corporations to invest freely in
new technology and equipment.) By the Fed's estimates, the booming
market has, on average, added about one percentage point a year to
gross domestic purchases for five years.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Greenspan said, rising stock prices are an
expected and entirely justified response by investors to the most
fundamental change in the economy in decades, the surge in
productivity, or output per worker for each hour worked.
</P>
<P>
   The point, he said, is not whether stocks are overvalued.
Greenspan said his views on that are no more or less valid than
anyone else's. But that does not mean that rising stock prices _
or, more specifically, the huge and growing pool of new wealth
created by the market _ are not a factor in the economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the additional oomph that market-generated
wealth gives to demand is not replicated on the other side of the
economy's balance sheet _ supply, or the economy's ability to meet
that demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is firmly documented that when people have significant
capital gains, a small part of them do induce an increase in
consumption,'' Greenspan said. ``It is the nature of a capital gain
not to increase supply accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan tracks the scale of the wealth effect by watching a
ratio of household net worth to income. Since income growth is a
rough proxy for growth in the nation's productive capacity, a rise
in wealth relative to income implies an expansion of the gap
between demand and supply, the very imbalance of most concern to
Greenspan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said that the Fed has tracked the ratio back to 1922,
and that it did not change in a way that had a big effect on the
economy until the mid-1990s. According to the Fed's statistics,
household wealth remained between 4.8 and 5.1 times income from
1988 until 1996, when it began surging. By 1997, wealth was 5.7
times income; last year it was nearly 6.3.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of economy, which is creating a huge surge in
wealth, could create a huge surge in consumption and growth if
there were the people to produce the goods to meet the demand,''
Greenspan said. ``And the point at issue is we do not.''
</P>
<P>
   In prepared testimony delivered to both the House and Senate
committees, Greenspan said that squeezing inflationary pressures
out of the economy would have to involve bringing the growth in
asset values into line with the growth in income.
</P>
<P>
   After Greenspan set out that equation for the House committee
last week, some economists took it to mean that slowing the growth
in stock prices until they came in line with income growth had
become a goal of monetary policy. Responding to a question
Wednesday, Greenspan said that was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is merely a diagnostic tool to make a judgment as to
whether a wealth effect is indeed functioning in the economy,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the stock market is by no means the only source
of growing demand; rising real incomes, driven by productivity
growth, play a huge role as well. Some analysts suggested that in
an election year, Greenspan might find it less politically
sensitive to suggest that the problem facing the economy is the
stock market rather than low unemployment and rising wages.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, members of the committee pressed Greenspan Wednesday to
explain the distinction between using monetary policy to slow the
whole economy, with all that could mean for jobs and incomes, and
using it to curb the wealth effect by taking some air out of the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole new theory being laid out here,'' said Sen.
Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, the panel's ranking Democrat, ``that's
going to justify raising rates, curtailing the economy, when there
is no inflation. And it's all being done on the basis of this
wealth effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan never completely explained the distinction, if there
is one. Rather, he emphasized that what he was dealing with was
``not a theory, it's merely an analysis of what in fact is
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously for a Fed chairman who is often viewed as omnipotent,
Greenspan said the central bank was playing only a supporting role
in addressing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market forces, not the Federal Reserve, are driving up
interest rates to close the gap between supply and demand for
funds, which is a counterpart to goods and services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that Greenspan views the situation with
a growing sense of urgency. By his account, the economy has
absorbed the growth in demand relative to supply over the past few
years through two ``safety valves.'' They are an increase in
imports and a decline in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But with the unemployment rate at 4 percent, a 30-year low, the
economy is fast running out of workers, as the Fed sees things. And
with the nation's trade deficit at a record high, the United States
cannot afford to continue importing goods with abandon for much
longer.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Greenspan said, is that there is no longer much
of a buffer between increased demand and an inflationary spiral in
wages and prices _ especially as long as the stock market continues
to stoke demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wealth effect cannot persist indefinitely because it
relies on two safety valves, both of which are limited,'' Greenspan
said.

SUPREME COURT RULES GOVERNMENT CAN BE SUED FOR TARGETING
INDIVIDUAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (See also SCOTUS-HAWAII, SCOTUS-HEALTHCARE)

 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Wednesday that
an individual who claims to have been singled out and made the
target of adverse, irrational government action can bring a lawsuit
for the denial of equal protection under the 14th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The unsigned decision permitted a property owner's lawsuit to go
forward against an Illinois village that demanded a special
easement in return for connecting the property to the municipal
water supply. The decision upheld a 1998 ruling by the 7th Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the case, Village of Willowbrook vs. Olech, No.
98-1288, was a debate over the extent to which the 14th Amendment
protects people as individuals, as a ``class of one,'' rather than
as members of a historically vulnerable group to which the court
has given special protection. The plaintiff, Grace Olech, did not
allege that race or sex discrimination lay behind her problems with
the village government. Rather, she said village officials were
retaliating against her for an earlier, unrelated lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The court said Wednesday that its equal protection decisions
dating to the early 1900s had made clear that ``the purpose of the
equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment is to secure every
person within the state's jurisdiction against intentional and
arbitrary discrimination.'' A lawsuit can proceed, the decision
said, ``where the plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally
treated differently from others similarly situated and that there
is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate, concurring opinion, Justice Stephen G. Breyer
said the decision should not be understood to mean that ordinary
zoning decisions were now subject to equal protection challenges.
Olech's claim in this case that the officials were motivated by
vindictiveness and ill will was an important added factor, he said.

MCSORELY NO EXCEPTION AMONG NHL'S ENFORCERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marty McSorley went missing Wednesday, which runs contrary to
his life and times on the ice in his 17 seasons in the National
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' 36-year-old defenseman, suspended for the remainder
of the season for using his stick like a cudgel in Vancouver
Monday, once earned as much as $2 million a season for being a
presence, an enforcer, a player who never backed away from an
altercation. For years, he was superstar Wayne Gretzky's chosen
skate-along bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, with the looming possibility of being charged
with criminal action in Canada, McSorley chose not to represent
himself at a hearing at NHL headquarters in Manhattan. He opted not
to explain why he went haywire Monday and struck Donald Brashear in
the head with his stick, leaving the Canucks' forward and
unconscious with a concussion, convulsing on the ice at General
Motors Place.
</P>
<P>
   Had McSorley appeared at the hearing, he would have arrived
carrying the heavy baggage of the felled Brashear, as well as the
image _ both glorified and villified _ of being one of the game's
noted on-ice enforcers.
</P>
<P>
   Since debuting with Pittsburgh in 1983, McSorley amassed 3,381
penalty minutes, third-most in league history, and seven
suspensions. It's now possible he will never play in the NHL again,
pending the course the Canadian legal system takes. The NHL also
announced his reinstatement will not be considered until he meets
with commissioner Gary Bettman.
</P>
<P>
   The hot-tempered McSorley crafted his image as Gretzky's muscle,
keeping the Great One out of harm's way in Edmonton and Los
Angeles. Gretzky was the magician, McSorley the muscle in a game
that cherishes, even romanticizes, both the talents of the skilled
and the tactics of the enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   Dating back to its beginnings, the NHL has had rosters dotted
with brawlers, thugs, and goons, players who have little talent
beyond their ability to stand on skates and throw haymakers.
McSorley, though by no means offensively gifted, could do more than
punch.
</P>
<P>
   In hockey's sometimes quirky dictionary and culture, McSorley
was a valued enforcer, a policeman rather than a goon. He was
respected and feared by opponents, most of whom wisely avoided
engaging him in fisticuffs. In his heyday, he won two Stanley Cups
with Edmonton alongside Gretzky (1987, '88), his mere presence
buying room for skilled teammates like Jari Kurri, Mark Messier,
Glenn Anderson, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcers, by definition, are not angels (hello, Terry
O'Reilly). McSorley collected a career-high 15 goals and 41 points
with the Los Angeles Kings in 1992-93, the same season he led the
league with a gaudy 399 penalty minutes. He also helped the Kings
reach the Stanley Cup finals for the only time. And again, he was
partnered with Gretzky, having arrived in LA as part of the
blockbuster deal following the Oilers' fourth Stanley Cup win in
'88.
</P>
<P>
   It was during Game 2 of the '93 finals against Montreal that
McSorley and his stick were first partners in infamy. Caught
playing with a stick that had a bit too much curve in the blade,
McSorley was assessed a minor penalty. The penalty led to a
Montreal power-play goal to tie the game at 1 with 1:13 remaining
in regulation. Only 51 seconds into overtime, the Canadiens evened
the series on Eric Desjardins's winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a veteran,'' said a disconsolate McSorley after the loss.
``I should have made sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens went on to win the next three games and win the
Cup. Like the ball that dribbled through Bill Buckner's legs in the
'86 World Series, McSorley's Forum faux pas became the symbol of
futility for beleagured Kings fans.
</P>
<P>
   During his salad days with the Oilers, McSorley copped a bizarre
plea of temporary amnesia after spearing Calgary forward Mike
Bullard during a playoff game April 23, 1988. McSorley fled the
arena immediately after the game, offering no comment, only to
return the next day claiming he couldn't remember a single thing
that happened in the game after being hit from behind by Calgary's
Gary Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week later, the league slapped McSorley with a
three-game suspension. The videotape, as always, was blessed with
crystal-clear memory. Somewhere Wednesday, Bullard no doubt was
enjoying the news out of New York.
</P>
<P>
   His two Stanley Cups long in mothballs and his last contract
roughly one-third of its $2 million peak, McSorley will be
remembered most for his ugly dustup in Vancouver. Earlier in the
night, he was humbled in a fight with Brashear, a classic, almost
sad example of one of the game's new enforcers manhandling the old
guard. McSorley failed to goad Brashear into a rematch and, by his
own account, was trying to spark another feud when he misguidedly
chopped Brashear across the right temple with 2.7 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the way I want to be remembered as a hockey player,''
McSorley said before exiting the arena.
</P>
<P>
   It would take nothing less than a continent-wide onset of
amnesia to change that now.

COLOMBIAN ARMY STILL AIDING PARAMILITARY FORCES, REPORT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Units of the Colombian army continue to work
closely with right-wing paramilitary forces that are involved in
killings of civilians and threats against government human rights
investigators, according to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by the New York-based Human Rights Watch, says that
army brigades in Colombia's three largest cities, including the
capital, Bogota, have continued to sponsor and collaborate with the
outlaw paramilitaries during the past three years, even as military
leaders have made some progress in curbing abuses by their own
troops.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of army involvement in paramilitary violence remains
so intractable and widespread, Human Rights Watch officials said,
that only by putting new human rights conditions on its assistance
to Colombia is the U.S. government likely to bring significant
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``What must be done is to use the engagement of the United
States in Colombia now to force the army to break its links to
these paramilitary groups,'' said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the
executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The report was made public as the Clinton administration is
intensifying its push in Congress for $1.3 billion in new aid for
Colombia over the next year and a half. Most of the aid would go to
the Colombian security forces, in order to help them push into
remote areas of the country where drug production is thriving and
leftist guerrillas generally hold sway.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday night, Colombia's vice president,
Gustavo Bell Lemus, denied any institutional tie between government
forces and the paramilitaries, and asserted that Human Rights Watch
sought through the report to obstruct the approval of American aid.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bell noted that the report was based largely on information
gathered from Colombian government investigators. He cited this as
proof that government judicial agencies ``are carrying out their
work in an adequate and efficient way.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say they are fully aware of the
Colombian military's human rights problems, but they argue that
President Andres Pastrana is determined to curb official abuses,
and that American aid will help him to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Vivanco, other human rights advocates and some members of
Congress say that such assurances are not enough. Expecting the aid
package to be approved, they have begun lobbying for amendments to
it that would bar the Pentagon and the CIA from sharing
intelligence information with Colombian units that are known to
have supported paramilitary groups, and cut off American aid to
units that persist in helping the paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates in Colombia have asserted for several
years that while abuses by army forces were dropping precipitously,
military units were effectively handing over their dirty work to
the well-organized and well-funded rightist armies, which have
operated in the country for years.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Human Rights Watch cited ``compelling, detailed
information'' suggesting that a major army garrison, the Third
Brigade in Cali, secretly worked with the country's most notorious
paramilitary leader, Carlos Castano, to form a new paramilitary
group after leftist guerrillas abducted 140 worshipers from a Cali
church last May.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the new force, which was called the Calima
Front, was formed by active-duty and reserve officers of the Third
Brigade, who gave intelligence information and logistical support
to the troops, most of whom were paramilitary soldiers brought in
from northern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Calima Front was subsequently linked to at least
40 killings and the forced displacement of about 2,000 people from
their homes in the conflict zone, the report said, quoting local
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Watch report is based largely on statements
made and evidence gathered by Colombian government investigators
whose names were withheld for their protection.

JUSTICES TACKLE OVERTIME DISPUTE BETWEEN TEXAS COUNTY, SHERIFF'S
DEPUTIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A long-standing pay dispute between Harris County,
which covers most of Houston, and its sheriff's deputies landed at
the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael Leibig, representing 127 deputies, urged the
justices to strike down as illegal the Texas county's policy that
requires officers to take vacation rather than receive extra pay
for working overtime. He said the county rule violates the federal
Fair Labor Standards Act, which allows employees to decide for
themselves how their overtime will be compensated.
</P>
<P>
   But Harris County Attorney Michael Fleming, appearing before the
high court, defended the policy as a valid way to keep employment
costs down. He did not say, however, how much money the policy
saves the county.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, who are expected to render their decision by July,
appeared perplexed that a local pay dispute had made it all the way
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is this a big deal?'' said Justice Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Other justices suggested that the deputies might have waived
their right to challenge the policy by accepting county employment
despite knowing its stand on overtime compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy, Sheriff's Department commanders require
deputies to take time off when their overtime approaches 240 hours.
The forced vacation time, during which deputies are paid at their
usual salaries, relieves the county of the requirement under the
federal fair labor law that workers who are paid for working
overtime receive their usual wage rate plus 50 percent, also
referred to as ``time and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   The commanders must approve when time is taken off to ensure
that public safety is not compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies, upset at being told to take days off, sued in April
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The officers won the first round as the U.S. District Court for
Southern Texas said in 1996 that the county violated the fair labor
law by forcing employees to use compensation time.
</P>
<P>
   But the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed that ruling in 1998, holding that the federal law left it
to counties to decide how compensation could be taken.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies then appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Leibig of Fairfax, Va., conceded that the federal law allows
counties to let workers take vacation in compensation for overtime.
But the law also leaves it to the employees, not the county, to
decide whether they would rather be paid extra than take the time
off, Leibig told the justices.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Solicitor General Matthew Roberts, voicing the
Clinton administration's support for the deputies, said employers
cannot force employers to take vacation time against their wishes
under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
</P>
<P>
   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said deputies hired
before the policy was announced in 1994 cannot argue that they did
not agree to the compensation plan. The county, having told job
candidates of the overtime pay, can rightfully tell the deputies
that ``you have accepted my deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, countering Leibig, said the Fair Labor Standards Act
allows counties to take several cost-saving steps to avoid having
to pay their employees time and a half for overtime. Counties can
tell their employees to take time off and can set work schedules to
ensure than no one works overtime, Fleming added.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in apparent agreement with Fleming,
asked the attorney why the county went to the length of
establishing an overtime policy when it can simply tell an
employee, ``Jones, take next Wednesday off.''

 &HT;    Revamping Coke will take time, Stahl says
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola President Jack Stahl has told all employees
the current restructuring will take time as the company tries to
balance competing interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must balance the desire to get the changes behind us with
the need to do what is right for the business and fair to our
associates,'' Stahl said late Tuesday in an e-mail to workers
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes time as we restructure corporate (headquarters),
transfer responsibilities and understand how to localize our
operations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest soft drink company is in the process of
cutting 6,000 jobs this year as it decentralizes operations,
putting more decision-making in the hands of people in the field.
Coca-Cola sells beverages in some 200 nations.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl said the Atlanta-based company is trying ``to be as open
and forthright as we can'' in disseminating information to
employees ``during this difficult period.''
</P>
<P>
   Several employees who have kept their jobs so far say morale is
low at the headquarters because many are still at risk of losing
their jobs. What's more, some employees have criticized the layoff
process, which they say is dragging on for too long.
</P>
<P>
   In his six-paragraph memo, Stahl tried to alleviate some
concerns by giving an update on the job cuts:
</P>
<P>
   _ About 1,600 positions were eliminated in the United States and
Canada between Jan. 26 and Feb. 15. Over a third of the job cuts
have come from not filling open positions and by eliminating
contract employees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Up to half of the remaining 1,700 positions to be eliminated
in the United States and Canada could be achieved through an early
retirement program, attrition and eliminating vacant positions. The
other half is likely to come from outsourcing, transfers and
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Operations outside North America will lose 2,700 jobs, with
the bulk of the cuts coming in the second and third quarters.
Outside North America, Stahl said, ``our operating units must focus
on running their businesses as they restructure to become more
local.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl said managers will be meeting with employees to discuss
the status of their departments as the restructuring continues to
unfold. In the United States, he said, those meetings will occur
over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's stock traded as low as $50 Wednesday before closing at
$51.25, down 31 1/4 cents. The stock last traded that low in
October. Coke is down 12 percent since the beginning of the year.

MCSORLEY NO EXCEPTION AMONG NHL'S ENFORCERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Reslugging; fixing spelling in hed)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marty McSorley went missing Wednesday, which runs contrary to
his life and times on the ice in his 17 seasons in the National
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' 36-year-old defenseman, suspended for the remainder
of the season for using his stick like a cudgel in Vancouver
Monday, once earned as much as $2 million a season for being a
presence, an enforcer, a player who never backed away from an
altercation. For years, he was superstar Wayne Gretzky's chosen
skate-along bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, with the looming possibility of being charged
with criminal action in Canada, McSorley chose not to represent
himself at a hearing at NHL headquarters in Manhattan. He opted not
to explain why he went haywire Monday and struck Donald Brashear in
the head with his stick, leaving the Canucks' forward and
unconscious with a concussion, convulsing on the ice at General
Motors Place.
</P>
<P>
   Had McSorley appeared at the hearing, he would have arrived
carrying the heavy baggage of the felled Brashear, as well as the
image _ both glorified and villified _ of being one of the game's
noted on-ice enforcers.
</P>
<P>
   Since debuting with Pittsburgh in 1983, McSorley amassed 3,381
penalty minutes, third-most in league history, and seven
suspensions. It's now possible he will never play in the NHL again,
pending the course the Canadian legal system takes. The NHL also
announced his reinstatement will not be considered until he meets
with commissioner Gary Bettman.
</P>
<P>
   The hot-tempered McSorley crafted his image as Gretzky's muscle,
keeping the Great One out of harm's way in Edmonton and Los
Angeles. Gretzky was the magician, McSorley the muscle in a game
that cherishes, even romanticizes, both the talents of the skilled
and the tactics of the enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   Dating back to its beginnings, the NHL has had rosters dotted
with brawlers, thugs, and goons, players who have little talent
beyond their ability to stand on skates and throw haymakers.
McSorley, though by no means offensively gifted, could do more than
punch.
</P>
<P>
   In hockey's sometimes quirky dictionary and culture, McSorley
was a valued enforcer, a policeman rather than a goon. He was
respected and feared by opponents, most of whom wisely avoided
engaging him in fisticuffs. In his heyday, he won two Stanley Cups
with Edmonton alongside Gretzky (1987, '88), his mere presence
buying room for skilled teammates like Jari Kurri, Mark Messier,
Glenn Anderson, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcers, by definition, are not angels (hello, Terry
O'Reilly). McSorley collected a career-high 15 goals and 41 points
with the Los Angeles Kings in 1992-93, the same season he led the
league with a gaudy 399 penalty minutes. He also helped the Kings
reach the Stanley Cup finals for the only time. And again, he was
partnered with Gretzky, having arrived in LA as part of the
blockbuster deal following the Oilers' fourth Stanley Cup win in
'88.
</P>
<P>
   It was during Game 2 of the '93 finals against Montreal that
McSorley and his stick were first partners in infamy. Caught
playing with a stick that had a bit too much curve in the blade,
McSorley was assessed a minor penalty. The penalty led to a
Montreal power-play goal to tie the game at 1 with 1:13 remaining
in regulation. Only 51 seconds into overtime, the Canadiens evened
the series on Eric Desjardins's winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a veteran,'' said a disconsolate McSorley after the loss.
``I should have made sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens went on to win the next three games and win the
Cup. Like the ball that dribbled through Bill Buckner's legs in the
'86 World Series, McSorley's Forum faux pas became the symbol of
futility for beleagured Kings fans.
</P>
<P>
   During his salad days with the Oilers, McSorley copped a bizarre
plea of temporary amnesia after spearing Calgary forward Mike
Bullard during a playoff game April 23, 1988. McSorley fled the
arena immediately after the game, offering no comment, only to
return the next day claiming he couldn't remember a single thing
that happened in the game after being hit from behind by Calgary's
Gary Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week later, the league slapped McSorley with a
three-game suspension. The videotape, as always, was blessed with
crystal-clear memory. Somewhere Wednesday, Bullard no doubt was
enjoying the news out of New York.
</P>
<P>
   His two Stanley Cups long in mothballs and his last contract
roughly one-third of its $2 million peak, McSorley will be
remembered most for his ugly dustup in Vancouver. Earlier in the
night, he was humbled in a fight with Brashear, a classic, almost
sad example of one of the game's new enforcers manhandling the old
guard. McSorley failed to goad Brashear into a rematch and, by his
own account, was trying to spark another feud when he misguidedly
chopped Brashear across the right temple with 2.7 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the way I want to be remembered as a hockey player,''
McSorley said before exiting the arena.
</P>
<P>
   It would take nothing less than a continent-wide onset of
amnesia to change that now.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One day after Gov. George W. Bush's twin losses to
Sen. John McCain in the Michigan and Arizona, many of his
staunchest supporters said they were shell-shocked. And Bush
himself regrouped by agreeing to a debate in Los Angeles next week,
by ripping up his schedule to add a quick trip this weekend to
Washington state, where McCain is waging an energetic race and by
questioning the senator's Republican credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The voting on Tuesday not only revived the threat of defections
to the McCain camp, but also set off recriminations from inside and
outside the Bush organization, including members of Congress and
the Republican National Committee who had eagerly rallied behind
Bush early on.
</P>
<P>
   They groused about everything from Bush's lavish spending in
Arizona _ where McCain was the favorite son _ to his embrace from
Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition, to his
decision blame his defeat in Michigan on Democrats who ``hijack the
primary to help Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some RNC members are saying: `What is going on here? He's
getting his hat handed to him and he can't put down the
rebellion,''' said Steve Duprey, chairman of the Republican Party
in New Hampshire. ``And that makes them nervous. They're also
nervous about the incredible number of new people signing on to
vote for McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hand-wringing, Bush insisted that he was confident
he would prevail because to win the Republican presidential
nomination McCain, who has drawn much of his support from those who
identify themselves as independents or Democrats, still must do
something he has not demonstrated he can do: beat Bush among
Republicans. As the campaign advances to several states where only
registered Republicans can vote in primaries, Bush said his path
will become easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it amazing that somebody running for president as a
Republican has to reach out to Republicans for the vote,'' Bush
said at a news conference in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain quickly sought to expand his base and reintroduce
himself as as conservative, telling voters in Seattle, ``I'm a
proud conservative Republican. I'm a Reagan Republican. Have have
no doubt about that. I have to convince and tell our Republican
establishment: It's great over here, come on in, join us, join us
in this effort to build an inclusive party,''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's advisers argue _ and some of Bush's supporters
fear _ that if he continues to win contests and pick up steam he
could crack the governor's hold on bedrock Republicans. In fact, a
New York Times/CBS News Poll in New York, where only Republicans
can vote in the primary on March 7, found that Bush holds only a
slight lead over McCain. And that survey was taken before McCain's
victories on Tuesday.

   During his salad days with the Oilers, McSorley copped a bizarre
plea of temporary amnesia after spearing Calgary forward Mike
Bullard during a playoff game April 23, 1988. McSorley fled the
arena immediately after the game, offering no comment, only to
return the next day claiming he couldn't remember a single thing
that happened in the game after being hit from behind by Calgary's
Gary Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week later, the league slapped McSorley with a
three-game suspension. The videotape, as always, was blessed with
crystal-clear memory. Somewhere Wednesday, Bullard no doubt was
enjoying the news out of New York.
</P>
<P>
   His two Stanley Cups long in mothballs and his last contract
roughly one-third of its $2 million peak, McSorley will be
remembered most for his ugly dustup in Vancouver. Earlier in the
night, he was humbled in a fight with Brashear, a classic, almost
sad example of one of the game's new enforcers manhandling the old
guard. McSorley failed to goad Brashear into a rematch and, by his
own account, was trying to spark another feud when he misguidedly
chopped Brashear across the right temple with 2.7 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the way I want to be remembered as a hockey player,''
McSorley said before exiting the arena.
</P>
<P>
   It would take nothing less than a continent-wide onset of
amnesia to change that now.

 &HT;    A `MexicTejana' reveals the many roots of her art
 &HT;    By Jeanne Claire van Ryzin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Artist Santa Barraza probes the place of in
between: a place straddling two cultures, a site both old and new,
magical and real, remembered and imagined. She names this place
``Neplanta,'' a word from the indigenous Nahuatl language that
means an in between state of existence. The culture of Barraza's
Neplanta is distinctly mestizo _ a hybrid of European, South Texas,
Mexican and indigenous influences. It's also a confluence of
contemporary Chicana feminism and traditional female roles, a place
from which new interpretations of established cultural icons
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Barraza: A MexicTejana from Neplanta'' offers a rich
display of this artist's talent. The 51 works on exhibit _
drawings, prints, and paintings _ represent the past 20 years of
Barraza's career and offer an impressive look at her singular
style.
</P>
<P>
   Barraza's earlier pieces _ primarily prints and silverpoint
drawings _ are fluid and expressive. Mostly figurative portraits
and self-portraits, they are potent with sensitive personality.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Barraza's works of the past decade _ vivid and colorful
acrylic paintings rendered in a distinctive style of faux naive
magic realism _ which demand the most attention. Forms are
flattened and rendered in rich, saturated colors set against
backgrounds of minute and complex detail. Some are contemporary
takes on retablos _ small paintings created to honor a saint
credited for performing a miracle. Other pieces are interpretations
of codices _ illustrated books created by Mayan people to record
their heroic history, royal genealogy and prophecy. Barraza's
codices chart her search for her own feminine history with
portraits of Latina women both ancient and modern, personal and
iconic: revolutionary heroine Rigoberto Menchu, the mythic La
Llorona, the Virgen de Guadalupe and women from Barraza's family.
Like the traditional codices, these portraits are bordered by a
pattern of hieroglyphs.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Barraza's paintings range in scale from the
traditional small-sized retablos and codices to oversized
contemporary versions, one of which, ``Codex of El Poder de las
Mujeres,'' is a mural-sized 9 feet by 12 feet. This play of scale
is a powerful reworking of the Mexican mural tradition, one that
serves Barraza well in her artistic quest to chart new territories
and new histories for her MexicTejana identity.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Kingsville, Barraza attended Texas A&AMP;M in Kingsville
and later the University of Texas. She has taught at La Roche
College, Pennsylvania State University and the Art Institute of
Chicago. After 25 years away from her home state, Barraza returned
to South Texas, where she is now professor and chair of the art
department at Texas A&AMP;M at Kingsville.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this exhibit makes a fitting coda to Barraza's
homecoming. Returning to the land of Neplanta, this MexicTejana
artist unveils an affecting body of work.

COZY UP TO THE RANGERS IN LAID-BACK PORT CHARLOTTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The crowds are so thick at the St. Louis
Cardinals' training camp in Jupiter, Fla., that a dozen deputies
are needed for crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   Fans flock to Florida's east coast to see Mark McGwire flex his
muscles, take batting practice and _ when his workout is over _
sign autographs. Weekend or weekday, afternoon workout or night
game, the Cardinals' training camp is usually overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   It's the opposite scene on the other side of Florida, in a small
town 90 miles south of Tampa on the west coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers' spring training facility at Port Charlotte _
where players began practice this month and will play their first
Florida home game Saturday _ is one of the most relaxed and
sparsely attended in baseball. There are few restraining ropes _
and no sheriff's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty laid-back here,'' said John Blake, Rangers vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who come to Port Charlotte for spring training will have
more access to and a better view of their favorite players than
fans of perhaps any other baseball team. If you come to Port
Charlotte for the day and don't come away with at least a couple of
autographs, then you're too shy _ or you're not really trying.
</P>
<P>
   That's the charm of an otherwise sleepy series of hamlets that
encircle Charlotte Harbor and make up the metropolitan area that
serves as the Rangers' spring home. It's a great destination for
those who love baseball and the Rangers, and who want to experience
the intimacy of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   For spring training is the ultimate in intimacy between player
and fan. The regular season is weeks away, and the pressure of
performing has not kicked in. The average player's goal is to get
to work, get it done and get to the golf course or the fishing hole
before the sun goes down. And what's wrong with signing a few
autographs along the way?
</P>
<P>
   If you're truly lucky _ and it's not uncommon _ you can get a
player to pose for a picture with his arm around an adoring young
fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude on autographs in spring training is I try to
accommodate everybody,'' Rangers outfielder Rusty Greer said.
``When I get done lifting weights, I try to sign everything put in
front of me. I realize during the season we're not as accessible,
whereas down here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hard-core fans come early, around 8 a.m., setting up camp
outside the clubhouse entrance and waiting patiently for the
players to arrive for a 10 a.m. workout.
</P>
<P>
   The workouts are held on the back fields, a clover-leaf
arrangement of four diamonds that allows fans to wander around with
a front-row view. Admission to practices is free. (Game tickets, by
the way, cost $7 or $9 _ a bargain compared with regular-season
prices.) If you stand in the right place, you may see Ivan
Rodriguez jogging by, having just warmed up a couple of pitchers on
Field 4 and now ready for batting practice on Field 3.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way you can get that close to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   But that's Port Charlotte, more of a state of mind than an
actual tourist destination. The draw is a relaxed baseball
atmosphere under warm, sunny skies and with cool breezes coming off
the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The nightlife is just as casual. The hedonistic pleasures of
Tampa, Sarasota and Fort Lauderdale have yet to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Most baseball fans congregate at the End Zone, a sports bar
eight miles east of the ballpark in the beachside town of
Englewood. Locally famous for pizza, wings and Philly cheese-steak
sandwiches, the End Zone has 15 televisions and an owner/bartender,
John McCann, who takes on all comers in baseball trivia.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, some fabulous baseball memorabilia was destroyed
in a November fire, but McCann and fellow owner Greg Lyon rebuilt
and reopened the restaurant within months.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite Rangers hangout is Charlie's, a family seafood
restaurant also in Englewood. The grouper (a fish also known as sea
bass, and a local specialty) is particularly good.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the younger players who stay at the Days Inn in Port
Charlotte hang out at Johnny's Be Good, a bar next to the hotel.
But those who expect to impress manager Johnny Oates during the
next day's workout are back in their rooms long before last call.
</P>
<P>
   Big money has changed baseball, and one way is in the lifestyle
of players when they're away from home. There was a time when
spring training was one continuous party, and whatever conditioning
gained during the day was lost at some watering hole at night.
</P>
<P>
   But now, players can afford to bring their entire family to
spring training, rent a house with a swimming pool and set up
housekeeping so their home life doesn't miss a beat. Plus, with all
the money to be made in baseball, fewer and fewer players are
willing to risk a lucrative career with a night of nonstop
carousing.
</P>
<P>
   Other than baseball, there are few obvious tourist attractions
in the greater Port Charlotte area. There is Englewood Beach,
sandy, warm and with relatively clean Gulf water. On the other side
of the road are Crabby George's, the Lock and Key Restaurant and
the Gulf View Grill, which has a second-floor bar that offers a
terrific view of the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the French Riviera, Miami Beach or even South Padre
Island. Port Charlotte is just a small Southern town and retirement
community that offers baseball up close and personal.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, there are few places anywhere that can match it.
</P>

BUSH FALLS BACK ON HIS REPUBLICAN ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Not so long ago, when the presidential race first
started to make its way into the public consciousness, it was a
foregone conclusion that Texas Governor George W. Bush was the
centrist in the race. The phrase ``compassionate conservative'' all
but defined his fledgling candidacy. When he appealed to Latino
voters as a ``uniter,'' he often did so in their native Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, that foregone conclusion, like so many others
about the Bush candidacy, has started to look premature.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between New Hampshire and Michigan, in fact, a shift
occurred _ not necessarily in Bush's positions, which more or less
stayed the same, but in the public perception of where he lies on
the political spectrum. Moderate Democrats have failed to turn out
for Bush in droves. In New Hampshire and Michigan, Bush ceded large
numbers of independent voters to his opponent, Senator John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, defending his viability as a candidate the day
after his pummeling in the Michigan and Arizona primaries, Bush
fell back on the group he swore he would unite with everyone else:
the Republican base. At a news conference in Los Angeles, he
predicted he would win because ``Republicans are going to start
deciding who the Republican nominee is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush has fared far better among Republicans than his
rival, a factor many believe will be critical in making the Texas
governor the nominee, especially since so many upcoming contests do
not allow Democrats to participate the way Michigan did.
</P>
<P>
   But although it is quite routine for Republican primary
candidates to pay special attention to the party's conservative
base, many Bush supporters never expected him to rely on
Republicans this exclusively. They hoped Bush, with his $70 million
war chest, would focus mainly on courting voters away from the
Democratic nominee even before the general election began. And so
now, Bush finds himself under pressure to juggle two arguments:
That he is the choice of conservative Republicans in the primary,
and yet will be the moderate ``uniter'' who will lure away just
enough swing voters to win the general election next fall.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, was the dual message Bush sent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began the day by meeting with inner-city leaders to discuss
faith-based organizations as alternatives to government programs.
In a ``leadership forum'' at the Los Angeles Dream Center, Bush
told participants: ``It's important for the people in America to
see what can happen when you hear the universal call to love your
neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Bush was casting McCain as the more moderate of
the two, mocking him for having the opposite problem of Bush's:
Trying to court Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it amazing that somebody running for president feels
like, on the Republican side, now all of the sudden they've got to
start reaching out to Republicans,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Bush appeared on at a ``town hall'' on Spanish
television. He then flew home to Austin, where Thursday he will
review the scheduled execution of 62-year-old Betty Lou Beets, who
was convicted of killing two of her five husbands but who says she
was a victim of domestic violence. Bush Wednesday left open the
possibility of granting Beets an unusual 30-day reprieve, after
deciding whether the jury heard ``all the circumstances'' of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Bush showed his greatest sensitivity yet to
McCain's success, declining to telephone his opponent to
congratulate him on winning in Michigan and Arizona. When asked
about it at a news conference, Bush said: ``Let me do this publicly
now. I congratulate John on a race well run. He ran a good race.''
</P>
<P>
   But the main focus Wednesday was on the perception that he had
somehow lost his claim as the ``uniting'' centrist in the
Republican race. Bush faced further questions about his visit to
Bob Jones University, a Greenville, S.C., school that bans
interracial dating and has demonized the pope. He denied that his
main criticism of McCain _ his success with Democrats _ might be
the very thing that would guarantee McCain victory in a general
election. McCain, too, took advantage of the shifting winds by
issuing a news release with the headline: ``California Watching,
Waiting for Bush Waffles: Texas Governor Expected to Lurch Left
After Rightward Run in SC.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, repeated what he has said all along: That his
positions have not changed. It is McCain, he said, who has
manipulated ideological labels to his advantage. In particular,
Bush seemed outraged that McCain would identify with Ronald Reagan,
saying his appeal with Democrats was not the same as Reagan's in
1980 and that McCain's plans were not ``Reaganesque.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Reaganesque to discourage charitable giving,'' Bush
said. ``It is not Reaganesque to support a tax plan that is Clinton
in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also trotted out his California state chairman, Gerry
Parsky, to deny former first lady Nancy Reagan was planning to
endorse McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's remaining neutral in this primary,'' Parsky said
Wednesday morning. He had called her an hour earlier, just to make
sure.

GORE VOWS TO SUBSIDIZE EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS FOR THE
ELDERLY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
(Eds.: Sub 11th graf to correct to ``Amadeo Trenchitella'') 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. _ With a senior citizens complex as his
backdrop and a growing federal surplus as a financial cushion, Vice
President Al Gore promised to have the government subsidize
expensive prescription drug costs for the elderly Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The catastrophic drug plan, which Gore dubbed ``Medi-coverage,''
is the latest in a list of health care programs the vice president
has proposed as he campaigns for the Democratic presidential
nomination, including more money for children's health and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Under the latest drug proposal, the federal government would pay
the remaining drug costs for seniors once they have spent $4,000 in
any given year. The proposal, which is estimated to cost $35
billion over 10 years, would affect about 3 million seniors,
advisers estimated.
</P>
<P>
   They said the extra revenue would come from the federal budget
surplus and is already included in President Clinton's budget
proposal for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The catastrophic drug plan would be on top of another proposal
advanced by Gore that calls for the federal government to pay half
the costs of drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, up to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's opponent, Bill Bradley, campaigned Wednesday in New York,
telling a Columbia University gathering that 13.5 million U.S.
children were living in poverty and 44 million citizens were
without health insurance. ``We will not have true prosperity until
all our citizens share in our economic growth,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Bradley also released a new
radio ad for Washington state that, for the first time, is harshly
critical of Gore. It says Gore was a ``conservative congressman''
with an anti-abortion and pro-gun record, and it points listeners
to an anti-Gore Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Gore chose to make his prescription drug pitch before a friendly
audience of almost 2,000, many of whom would be beneficiaries of
the expanded health care program.
</P>
<P>
   The local congressman, Rep. Robert Wexler, R-Fla, noted ``there
is only one candidate for president who is going to be known as the
prescription drug president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was well-received in this heavily Democratic enclave
populated by liberals who had migrated to southeast Florida from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was invited to speak at the sprawling complex by Amadeo
Trenchitella, one of the last of a dying generation of political
organizers here referred to as ``Condo commandos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trenchy,'' as Trinchitello is affectionately called, noted
that he once campaigned with Gore's father when he was in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And he urged his fellow seniors to support the vice president.
Otherwise he warned, ``if you leave it to the Republican Party,
you're going to have a clone of Herbert Hoover and a pot in every
chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Florida holds its primary March 14, Gore never
mentioned his primary opponent, Bradley, who is badly trailing the
vice president in Florida and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the vice president appeared to be looking ahead to the
general election contest and the growing possibility that as a
result of Sen. John McCain's victories Tuesday in Arizona and
Michigan, he could face either the Arizona senator or Texas Gov.
George W. Bush in November.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore did not mention either Republican presidential
candidate by name, he was intent on deflating McCain's appeal to
Democrats and independents, and to tie him to conservatives in his
party. The vice president suggested that McCain and Bush held
identical positions, opposing prescription drug benefits and
managed care reform, and support private school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a choice but an echo,'' Gore said. ``They echo one
another in their efforts to attract the extreme right wing and to
dismantle some of the protections that we have in our countries for
seniors today.''
</P>
<P>
   While neither McCain nor Bush have proposed prescription drug
plans as expensive and extensive as the vice president's proposal,
they have talked about the need to provide the elderly with some
relief in drug purchases. McCain has proposed that a chunk of the
federal surplus be used to shore up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore was asked about McCain's boast that he was the vice
president's worst nightmare, the vice president responded that he
was ``concentrating on the Democratic semifinals. We'll let the
Republicans settle the dispute among themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was later endorsed by the International Brotherhood of
Painters and Allied Trades, one of the few members of the AFL-CIO
that had held out backing the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   He later flew to South Carolina where he held an education forum
and picked up the endorsement of Gov. Jim Hodges.

 DESPITE STRENGTH IN POLLS, McCAIN FACES UPHILL FIGHT IN NEW YORK  
(See also REPUBS, REPUBS-CALIF) 
(bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. John McCain's victories in Michigan and Arizona
have set the stage for the first contested statewide Republican
primary in New York in 20 years. But McCain faces two problems as
he turns his attention East _ a contest closed to non-Republican
voters and, yet again, an electoral system designed to assist the
candidate favored by the Republican establishment, in this case,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of his standing among rank-and-file Republican
voters, McCain appears to be in an unexpectedly strong position two
weeks before the March 7 vote. A New York Times/CBS News poll
completed Tuesday, of likely Republican primary voters in New York
state, before McCain's wins, found Bush with 43 percent and McCain
with 36 percent. It was a finding particularly notable given the
fact that McCain succeeded in fighting his way onto the ballot,
over the resistance of the state's Republican leadership, less than
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need some fresh blood in there,'' remarked Connie
Perez, 80, of Saratoga County, one of a number of Republican voters
interviewed Wednesday who said they were enchanted by the prospect
of both a genuine Republican primary and McCain's candidacy. ``He's
young and he was in the war, which counts, and he's going to try
new ideas, hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of Truman,'' said Angela DiMarino, a New
Rochelle homemaker waiting to get her hair styled at an Eastchester
salon. ``He just brings something to the race.''
</P>
<P>
   But things are never that simple when it comes to elections in
New York. McCain's supporters acknowledged that the state's
labyrinthine indirect primary system threatened the senator's hopes
of a strong showing in a state which, ideologically, would seem
somewhat partial to his moderate and maverick appeal. Primary
voters on March 7 will not be voting directly for the candidates,
but for six delegates and alternates whose names are emblazoned on
the ballot. Names of the candidates' themselves are reduced to a
small squibble below their delegates.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, in terms of the emerging shape of this
contest, Bush, with the support of Gov. George E. Pataki and almost
the entire state Republican organization, has assembled delegate
slates made up of state legislators, county executives and other
Republicans who tend to be well-known in their communities.
McCain's mostly volunteer organization in the state had to scramble
to even find delegates in most districts, and many are largely
unknown or are not elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The six Bush delegates are all friends of mine,'' said Richard
N. Bond, the former Republican national chairman and veteran of New
York politics. ``The six McCain people are people I have never
heard of. They are perfect strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just a matter of being better known than the
delegates supporting either McCain or a third candidate, Alan
Keyes. As elected officials, the Bush delegates have an established
network of supporters who will turn out the vote for them on March
7. And those delegates, no matter what they think of Bush, have a
powerful incentive to win, to make sure there are seats for them at
the Republican convention in Philadelphia this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And as Bush's senior New York advisers nervously surveyed the
upended landscape Wednesday, that network stood out as perhaps
Bush's single greatest defense against another defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important factor is every single one of these people
have got it on the line,'' said William D. Powers, the state
Republican chairman, of the delegates vying to go to the
convention. ``And you know something? When you've got it on the
line, you're going to work harder. They don't want to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The other force working against McCain, say Bush's supporters,
was that Republican primaries in New York are open only to
Republican voters; McCain's victory in Michigan came with the help
of independents and Democrats. ``If you look at Michigan, almost 70
percent of the Republicans voted for Bush,'' Pataki, who is serving
as Bush's state chairman, said in an interview. ``Here you're going
to have Republicans voting in the Republican primary _ which is the
way it should be.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News telephone poll, of 1,440 registered voters,
was conducted from Feb. 16 to Tuesday, before the results of the
Michigan and Arizona primaries. Although Bush was slightly ahead of
McCain, 16 percent said they were undecided. Keyes was selected by
4 percent. There is a margin of sampling error of 5 percentage
points for the 374 Republican primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   For Pataki and Powers, the primary emerged as a test of the
strength of a political organization that Republicans have come to
view as one of the strongest in the nation, and that took the lead
in an unsuccessful effort to keep McCain off the state ballot.
Pataki finds himself in a particularly high-pressure situation
given Bush's experience in Michigan, where he relied on another
Republican governor, John Engler, to run his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say that that it's going to be easy,'' Pataki said
``But I'm confident that we have the right candidate, we have the
right team, we have the strongest slate of the candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to begin running television advertisements in
New York later this week, an aide said Wednesday night, and is
planning to fly into Long Island, a Republican stronghold, next
week.
</P>
<P>
   For Republican voters, the prospect of the first genuine primary
since Alfonse M. D'Amato defeated Jacob K. Javits for the U.S.
Senate nomination in 1980 was a welcome if somewhat alien
development. In interviews, Republican voters said McCain's
performance had prompted them to take a look at a the race, though
the interviews suggested that many have a fuzzy perception of the
candidates and the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer McCain but I am not sure why,'' said Francois
Capronmanieux, a wine importer from Manhattan as he stepped off the
train at Bronxville. ``There is a sense he is more experienced and
serious. He has experience and a record in the Senate, with many
years of service.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saratoga, Ruth Backus, 78, assistant director of the
Shenendehowa Senior Center, said she planned to vote for Bush, and
described herself as upset that McCain had made such an effort to
draw non-Republicans into the party. ``I'm a firm believer in party
politics and I feel too many Democrats switched over. Being an old
Republican, I like Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican electorate _ 3.1 million voters, of whom 2.5
million live outside of New York City _ is different than any that
McCain and Bush have faced so far. ``It is far more moderate than
the typical Republican primary electorate,'' said Frank Luntz, the
Republican pollster who is advising New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in his race for the U.S. Senate. ``It is not as harshly
ideological and it is certainly not Religious Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz described McCain as ``perfect for those kind of voters:
economically conservative, perceived to be socially tolerant.''
However, he said that Bush benefited from having the support of
``the most powerful and well-organized'' Republican organization in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   One of McCain's few well-known New York supporters, Rep. Peter
King, a Republican of Long Island, acknowledged that disparity
Wednesday evening. But King, who had supported Bush before moving
over to McCain, predicted that that intrigue that had lifted McCain
to unexpected victories in Michigan and New Hampshire would upend
the Republican organization in New York as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would make the analogy to the Shah of Iran,'' King said. He
referred to the shah's powerful military resources, but added that
he ``was absolutely powerless when the revolution started. That's
they way they are: They have all the jobs, all the suits, all the
offices. But it's going to be hard to control the grass roots.''

 &HT;    Oasis or mirage? New album doesn't compare to past releases
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   GROUP: Oasis
</P>
<P>
   ALBUM TITLE: ``Standing on the Shoulder of Giants''
</P>
<P>
   ALBUM LABEL: Epic Records
</P>
<P>
   This is not the return-to-glory that fans of this band's first
two albums had hoped for. But on such stunning numbers as ``Little
James,'' leadoff single ``Go Let It Out!'' and ``Where Did It All
Go Wrong?'' the brothers Gallagher _ singer Liam and
guitarist/songwriter Noel _ are still unmatched in the grandiosity
they bring to pop songs. When Oasis is on, it's simply magnificent,
with a symphony in every solo and a voice that stretches the heart.
The band's problem has always been consistency, however, and about
half of this album sounds like ``Champagne Supernova'' gone flat.
It's as if Noel got caught up on the vision of a sea of swaying
teen-age arms when he wrote the sentimental anthems ``Roll It
Over'' and ``Who Feels Love?''
</P>
<P>
   Oasis just can't ``rock out'' like in their pre-stardom days,
either. Compare ``Bring It On Down'' from the first album to
``SOTSOG'''s token rocker ``I Can See a Liar'' and you'll hear lost
steps. Even lamer is the album's leadoff track which, besides
containing a word in the title that will keep this CD out of
Walmart, is a thundering mess that steals the melody of ``I'm a
Man'' by Spencer Davis Group. An even greater case of larceny is
the ``Roadhouse Blues'' lift on ``Put Your Money Where Yer Mouth
Is.'' There are also all those annoying sonic nods to the Beatles.
If the fast-forward button hadn't been invented, Oasis would've
inspired it.
</P>
<P>
   Just as with the previous three Oasis albums, there are only
four really good songs here. But nothing comes close to earlier
masterpieces like ``Morning Glory'' and ``Columbia.'' This is a
band that doesn't seem to know what's great about them, or maybe
they do but they'd rather indulge themselves. At any rate, this
party seems to be winding down.
</P>
<P>
   ARTIST: Papa Mali &AMP; the Instigators
</P>
<P>
   ALBUM TITLE: ``Thunder Chicken''
</P>
<P>
   ALBUM LABEL: Fog City Records
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Welbourne, the godfather of the Austin reggae scene,
assumes a new musical persona with the release of ``Thunder
Chicken,'' a satisfyingly swamp-saturated tribute to the bayou
beat. Welbourne is best known for his role as co-leader of the
Killer Bees but he's also performed in an intriguing assortment of
other musical contexts, including everything from acoustic swing to
third world blues. As Papa Mali he reverts to his Louisiana
upbringing, slipping comfortably into funk-flavored roots music
while proving that while you can take the boy out of Shreveport but
you can't take the swamp blues out of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The first three songs pretty much stake out the stylistic
parameters of Papa Mali's musical universe as a percolating,
percussion-driven rendition of Zydeco legend Clifton Chenier's
``Bon Ton Roulet'' leads into a jazzy, groove-oriented take on
bluesman Buddy Guy's ``Man of Many Words.'' An extended exploration
of Dr. John's masterpiece of cosmic swamp psychedelia, ``Walk on
Gilded Splinters,'' completes the trilogy and if your head isn't
full of visions of Creole queens and wonderfully wasted nights in
the Big Easy by that time then it's possible the hole in your soul
is affecting your ears.
</P>
<P>
   As in most things relating to the bayou beat the drums are
crucial and the indomitable Barry ``Frosty'' Smith, reinforced by
percussionists Bevis Griffin and Paul Mills, keeps the foundation
flexible with elastic energy that polyrhythmically pushes and pulls
the music ever onward. On tunes like the Wild Magnolias' ``Fire
Water'' the rhythm section, which also includes bassist Courtney
Audain, moves front and center, transforming the music into an
enlightened and irresistible rhythm rave-up that the Meters would
be proud to claim.
</P>
<P>
   In past live action the band came across as an Austin echo of
the Neville Brothers but ``Thunder Chicken,'' deeper, darker and
more diverse, uses Welbourne's charismatic Papa Mali creation to
personalize the sound with distinctive down-home blues stylings,
especially on the closing cuts. Welbourne's swamp trance vocals and
the uniformly excellent musicianship of all involved create a
strong and successful debut for an act with admirable experience
and unlimited potential.
</P>
<P>
   ARTIST: Fernando Ortega
</P>
<P>
   ALBUM TITLE: ``Home''
</P>
<P>
   ALBUM LABEL: Myrrh Records
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Fernando Ortega appeared on the national landscape of
contemporary Christian music and forever changed it. While others
were singing about tidily answered prayers and how well they
understood God, Ortega showed up bearing songs about being human,
and actually emphasized the mystery of the divine. Consequently,
his first two Myrrh Records releases struck a nerve that crossed
nearly every racial, geographical, denominational and stylistic
boundary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home'' continues in that lavish tradition. Once again Ortega
offers the listener not only songs, but experiences. ``On The
Line'' poignantly describes a man with Alzheimer's; ``Old Girl''
was written about an encounter with a homeless woman; ``Lonely
Road'' passionately reflects Ortega's yearning to be near his wife.
And as is his custom, this collection also includes new
interpretations of old hymns _ a stirring rendition of ``Pass Me
Not,'' and an absolutely stunning take on the traditional
African-American song ``Give Me Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   The music is at times more energetic and guitar driven than his
previous work, yet still retains the soft, melodic edge that has
become Ortega's trademark. Mournful Cello, subtle piano, and even
crickets from his own backyard are only a few of the expertly
placed musical commodities that support his rich, resonant voice.
The end result is a disc where not a word or note is wasted.

NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE APOLOGIZES FOR VIOLATING OWN
POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New England Journal of Medicine, one of the world's top
ranked scientific publications and a leading critic of doctors'
financial ties to industry, apologized Wednesday to its readers for
violating its own financial conflict-of-interest policy 19 times
over the last three years in choosing experts to review drug
therapies.
</P>
<P>
   The journal said it had failed to disqualify the authors of the
19 reviews even though the authors had told them about their
financial ties to drug companies that marketed therapies described
in the articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most serious mistake for which we have had to
apologize,'' Dr. Marcia Angell, the editor in chief of the journal
that began publishing in 1812, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The journal's policy would have required it to select authors
who had no ties to the companies making the drugs discussed in the
articles. The policy is intended to avoid bias in reporting
information about drugs that doctors prescribe for their patients.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews covered therapies for such ailments as hair loss,
breast cancer, AIDS, diabetes, postmenopausal osteoporosis,
alcoholism, asthma, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, meningitis,
attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and sickle cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
   Angell said the error did not necessarily invalidate any of the
information in the articles because all 19 reviews were also
subjected to the peer review process, in which experts reviewed the
manuscripts before publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I assume there is no reason to assume that the information
is not good information,'' Angell said.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``If you ask me, was there any bias in these
articles, I cannot answer that question. That's why we have a
conflict-of-interest policy because it is always possible for bias
to fly under the radar screen. There is no way I can say whether it
did or didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Angell said she and the other peer reviewers did not detect any
bias.
</P>
<P>
   The seriousness of the journal's policy lapse in part reflects
its leadership in setting policies that require authors to disclose
their financial ties to industry and in questioning the growing
trend for industry-sponsored research at universities and medical
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Angell said hers was the only scientific journal with a policy
that disqualifies scientists from writing reviews and editorials if
they have ``current, recent past, or planned future financial
associations'' with a company that stands to gain from a product
discussed in the editorial or review article. Reviews and
editorials differ from reports of original research in the journal.
While the original research reports findings, the reviews summarize
and assess trends on the research topic, such as drug therapy, from
journals published around the world.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The journal first learned of the policy lapse through articles
in the Los Angeles Times, Angell said. The newspaper reported one
such violation last September and then reported an additional seven
in October.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter of apology did not credit the newspaper's
articles because ``it did not seem particularly relevant'' to do
so, Angell said in the interview. She said, however, that she has
been ``forthright'' in citing the accuracy of the Los Angeles Times
articles in interviews with reporters from other news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   After the publication of the newspaper's articles, the journal
reviewed more than 40 articles published since January 1997 in a
series on the latest drug treatments for particular diseases and
ailments. Dr. Alistair J.J. Wood, a pharmacology professor at
Vanderbilt University, edits the ``Drug Therapy'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Although the journal abided by its policy in disqualifying
authors of reviews and editorials who received significant research
funds from companies making the drugs discussed in an article, it
did not disqualify authors whose institutions received such grants
or authors who served as consultants to the drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   The journal study found a total of 19 articles that violated the
policy, including the eight reported by the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   The apology, published in the form of a letter to readers in
Thursday's issue of the journal, included specific references to
the 19 articles, along with the names of drug manufacturers cited
in the articles. The drug companies included most of the major
companies and little-known biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   The lapse resulted from ``poor coordination among the editors
and carelessness within the office,'' Angell said in the interview.
``It was a mistake, to put it as bluntly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Angell, Wood and Dr. Robert D. Utiger, another editor, signed
the letter of apology. In it, the editors said that they had taken
steps to prevent a recurrence without spelling them out.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Angell said one step was to improve
communication among the editors. The journal, which is owned by the
Massachusetts Medical Society and earns about $20 million a year,
largely from drug company advertisements, employs six full-time
editors and other part-time editors.
</P>
<P>
   Another step will be to tighten the conflict-of-interest policy.
The journal will change the wording of the letter signed by authors
of editorials and reviews to require disclosure of who paid their

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ In the frigid early-morning hours of Oct. 7, 1998, a
bicyclist found the beaten and bloodied body of a 21-year-old
college student tied to a buck-rail fence in a remote field outside
Laramie, Wyo. Matthew Shepard was not dead yet, but within five
days he would be. Two local roofers about the same age as the
victim were arrested and charged with a murder they eventually
confessed to committing.
</P>
<P>
   Learning that Shepard was gay, they had lured him out of a
downtown bar, robbed him of $20, then beat him into unconsciousness
with the butt end of a handgun. They left him to die on the prairie
because they did not know what else to do with him. To avoid the
death penalty, each pleaded guilty in exchange for a sentence of
life in prison with no chance for parole.
</P>
<P>
   As one more in a growing list of shocking murders in recent
years, along with those of Nicole Brown Simpson, JonBenet Ramsey
and James Byrd Jr., the killing of Shepard brought with it the
usual accompaniment of intense media coverage and soul-searching
questions about how such a tragedy could have occurred. The murder
had the added dimension of martyrdom: his sexual orientation and
violent manner of death fused, symbolizing for gay men and lesbians
how close they still live to forces of hate, fear and
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   As a site for the murder, Laramie seemed no more unlikely than
anywhere else, a quiet, nondescript working-class town of 27,000
people, most of whom are white, heterosexual and unaccustomed to
national attention, particularly if it suggests that just for
sharing the same ZIP code as the killers, they might also be
perceived as homophobic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet through the arrests, confessions and sentencings, it was
plainly evident how such a horrifying event affected those closest
to it _ Shepard's family, the killers' families, the killers
themselves. It was never quite so clear how Laramie fared. Could
the town ever return to its docile anonymity, or would it forever
carry a murderous stigma as a place of intolerance, where a gay man
was killed for being gay? Who could really know? As Laramie tried
to move on, most of the cameras left.
</P>
<P>
   But a curious group of interrogators stayed behind, and out of
what they learned over a year of visits, during which they
tape-recorded interviews with 200 Laramie residents, Moises Kaufman
has crafted his latest play. The artistic director of the Tectonic
Theater Project in New York, Kaufman has created ``The Laramie
Project,'' an attempt to unpeel the layers of a town to understand
how ordinary people might be affected by extraordinary events.
</P>
<P>
   The play, a production of the Denver Center Theater Company in
association with Tectonic, was scheduled to open Saturday night at
the Ricketson Theater in the Denver Center for the Performing Arts.
Denver is the closest big city to Laramie. The play is expected to
run through April 1. Kaufman then hopes to move it to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Matthew was beaten, it was a watershed moment,'' Kaufman
said in a recent interview as he and his company transcribed and
evaluated hundreds of hours of audio tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At these certain watershed moments,'' he went on, ``ideas
float around in our culture, and an event like this becomes a
lightning rod as the ideas come together, parallel subjects like
gay issues, community issues, violence, class.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we do with most of our projects, we asked ourselves, can
the theater play a part in the national dialogue of current events?
Media does that differently with radio, television and newspapers.
We want to know if there is room for the theater to add to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman's last play, ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of
Oscar Wilde,'' attempted to answer similar questions about similar
issues in its own context, Victorian England, and did so with
rousing success. Though there was no actual murder, Wilde's
position and reputation (and ultimately his life) were casualties
once he was found guilty of being a homosexual and sentenced to
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn from actual court documents, testimony and handwritten
journals _ the only sources of the words uttered onstage _ the play
opened to glowing reviews in 1997 and ran for more than 600
performances in New York before moving on to Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Toronto and London. It continues in many other cities
here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Laramie Project,'' the presentation is more personal,
even though the play focuses less directly on the murder than on
its impact on the town. The story unfolds onstage through the words
of those interviewed by Kaufman's actors and writers, and also
through the actors' responses as they recreate their interview
sessions, sometimes playing both interviewer and interviewee,
marking the difference with costume and accent changes.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman acknowledged a certain amount of artistic license,
inasmuch as any creative endeavor involves some content selection
and editing. But the audience is never duped. The play opens with a
narrator conveying the important distinction that it is based on
what the actors heard from their sources, not on what the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the process resembles the work of Anna Deavere
Smith, the author and performer who created two acclaimed plays
after conducting hundreds of taped interviews _ to reflect ethnic
strife in New York City in ``Fires in the Mirror'' and civil
disturbances in California in ``Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992.'' Her
current work, ``House Arrest,'' examines the role of the presidency
through interviews and historical documents.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But there are important differences between her work and his,
Kaufman said. While Smith alone decided how many of those
interviewed would be given life onstage, the Tectonic project
involved 11 actors and writers as interviewers, a collaboration
that led to intense arguments and emotional pleas by company
members, campaigning to have their subjects included in the final
script. By the end, only about 60 made the cut, with Kaufman and
his head writer, Leigh Fondakowski, choosing.
</P>
<P>
   It was also unusual _ probably unique, Kaufman said _ that a
theater company would spend so much time in one place researching,
a commitment that made the actors themselves virtual residents of
Laramie and, as a result, part of the story. Unlike hit-and-run
television and many print reporters, they had the time to win trust
and, in the end, become part of the story they tell.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Laramie Project' actually explores the effect our
presence had on the town and that the town had on us,'' Kaufman
said. ``It underlines the importance of the observer and constantly
reminds the audience that what they are hearing and seeing is an
aesthetic experience created by a group of people who are trying to
tell a story and paint a portrait of what we saw and heard.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the play is not so much a documentary as
theatrical journalism, an attempt to tell a true story in a way
that would be more difficult in another medium.
</P>
<P>
   For Kaufman, the shocking events in Laramie had a natural
resonance, given his own crosscurrents as a playwright, director
and man. Kaufman, 36, whose father is a Holocaust survivor from
Romania, grew up Jewish and gay in a largely Roman Catholic
country, Venezuela, where he attended an Orthodox Jewish school in
which almost everyone else was studying business. Arriving in the
United States in 1987 to study theater, he instantly became a
``Latino.''
</P>
<P>
   Those personal anomalies, he said, fueled an initial fascination
with what happened in Laramie, and that fascination grew as he and
his actors gathered material from a wide assortment of townspeople.
Some of these were directly involved in the case, like prosecutors,
investigators, the bartender who served Shepard the night he was
assaulted and the bicyclist; others were not, including friends and
relatives of Shepard and friends and relatives of his killers, and
some had no connection.
</P>
<P>
   The actors also interviewed Shepard's parents, Judy and Dennis,
for whom the case became a crusade for laws making a victim's
sexual orientation a reason for designating a crime as a hate
crime. But the Shepards are not represented in the play. Nor are
the killers, Aaron J. McKinney and Russell A. Henderson, whom the
actors did not seek to interview.
</P>
<P>
   When they first arrived in Laramie, Kaufman and his inquisitive
band had no idea what their efforts might produce, he said. Some
were initially shy about seeking interviews. Some were
uncomfortable with the tape recorders. Most had never conducted an
interview of any kind. And some had rough early encounters: Kaufman
said one of the actors told him that he approached a man ``who I
thought was going to kick me in the stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   But as his questioners fanned out, working in teams of two,
themes began emerging over their six two-week visits to the town.
``We were hearing these incredible voices, incredible stories,''
said Fondakowski, a member of the Tectonic group since 1995. ``We
found that people had felt so betrayed in that their town had been
misrepresented as a Podunk, hillbilly, redneck kind of place. With
us, they saw they had another opportunity to tell a version of
their story.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kaufman and all his collaborators _ including Donovan
Marley, the artistic director of the Denver Center Theater Company
_ the final script uses Laramie's story to tell a much larger one:
that America, for all its fortunes and power, still cannot escape
the basic human conflicts, and tragedies, arising out of
differences learned through fear and ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about what happens to a town when it is forced to
really look at all the things people really believed in all their
lives,'' Kaufman said. ``A lot of the philosophy we heard from
people was that Laramie was a live-and-let-live place. But I don't
know. I really don't know what the truth is in that statement.''

 &HT;    Consumers challenge Texas law barring purchase of out-of-state
wine
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Amy Airhart walked into a local market on
Wednesday afternoon to find a good cabernet. But she would also
like to shop for wine over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, under state law, she can't. But that may change if
three Texas wine lovers who challenged it in court remain
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely would love the opportunity to be able to order
wines over the Internet, or from overseas,'' Airhart said, her eyes
scanning a rack of wines while her hands gently nudged a stroller
bearing her 5-month-old son, Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   Airhart and her husband tried, on a recent business trip to San
Jose, to order some wine from a California winery and have it
shipped to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The winery wouldn't do it, citing Texas law. Texans cannot bring
in from out of state more than 3 gallons of wine for personal
consumption _ and even then, the law says, they ``must personally
accompany the wine.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that law is being challenged. U.S. District Judge
Melinda Harmon of Houston ruled Feb. 10 that the limit is
unconstitutional because it violates the commerce clause of the
U.S. Constitution, which provides for free trade among states.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bobby Smith of Arlington, who has led the legislative
committee of the the Texas Wine &AMP; Grape Growers Association said he
regards the ruling as a golden opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what we do as an industry in Texas, or no matter
what the ABC decides as a regulatory agency, the Internet and the
Web are going to take off _ no matter what,'' said Smith, who also
owns a small vineyard and winery.
</P>
<P>
   The Licensed Beverage Distributors of Texas was still
considering what action to take, but it was clear there won't be an
endorsement of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be some type of control on those selling from
out of state, because what we'd like is a level playing field,''
said Robert H. ``Butch'' Sparks, the lobbyist for the Licensed
Beverage Distributors, which represents Texas-based wholesalers of
liquors and wines. ``We've got to file reports, pay taxes, observe
the wet-dry status. While we don't sell directly to the consumer,
the retailers have to check on minor age and all that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's Alcoholic Beverage Commission is scheduled to
consider in a closed session Monday whether to appeal Harmon's
ruling. Any decision it makes would have to be made in public.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling affects only wine, not beer or liquor, and it
includes out-of-state purchases over the telephone and through the
mail, as well the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But it also shows how easy access to the Internet, combined with
the development of national overnight shipping through such
companies as Federal Express, is putting cracks in how states tax
and regulate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some people already order wines over the Internet and get them
delivered despite the law, said Greg Steiner, one of the owners of
the Grape Vine. ``They ignore it; everybody knows the law,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state comptroller has not studied how much the state may be
losing in excise taxes, which are applied at the wholesale level,
because of untaxed out-of-state sales. But one rough estimate made
last year was $300,000, according to a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, buyers of wine from an out-of-state seller are
supposed to order it and have it shipped to a licensed Texas
distributor (wholesaler), who then forwards it to a licensed
retailer, who then sells it to the wine consumer.
</P>
<P>
   That process reflects Texas' three-tiered liquor industry
structure and regulatory system. All retailers must get their
alcoholic beverages from one of 132 state-licensed distributors for
beer or one of 290 state-permitted wholesalers for liquor, ale and
wine. The distributors and wholesalers, which must have majority
Texas ownership, must buy from the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a system that ``discriminates against out-of-state vintners
and wine shippers, especially small ones,'' the judge said, adding
that it gives Texas distributors and retailers a form of ``economic
protectionism.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials had argued that the limit on bringing in wine
from out of state was constitutional under the 21st Amendment,
which repealed Prohibition _ a period during the 1920s when the
government tried to stop all sales of alcoholic beverages _ but
gave states the right to regulate liquor, beer and wine sales.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the 21st Amendment applied only if the state
could show that its limit on out-of-state wine sales was needed to
constrain consumption of alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, she said, the state could show ``no temperance
goal served by the statute since Texas residents can become as
drunk on local wines.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Hull, an Austin spokeswoman for the Wine Institute, based
in San Francisco, said her group was ``thrilled to death'' by the
judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet and e-commerce are not going to go away,'' Hull
said. ``It would behoove the state to allow the ABC to promulgate
rules to allow this in a responsible fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to avoid delivering to minors, she said, such as
by requiring the buyer, with an ID, to go to the shipper's office
to pick up the wine, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ruling was limited to out-of-state purchases of
wine by consumers, it raised questions for others, too.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner, of Grape Vine Market, said he didn't mind consumers
having the right to order from out-of-state sellers over the
Internet. But, as part-owner of a huge, 10-month old retail store
stocking thousands of wines plus liquors and fine cigars who now
must go through a Texas-permitted wholesaler, he had a question:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why couldn't I do that, too?''

BUSH SEEKS TO REGAIN THE CENTER AFTER EMBRACING PARTY'S RIGHT WING
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When his campaign plane touched down in Kansas
City, Mo., on Tuesday night, all that Gov. George W. Bush really
had to do was acknowledge the bad news from Michigan, utter a few
platitudes, paste a brave face over defeat and put a smiling face
on his expectations for the next Republican contests.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also did something else, something out of the ordinary,
something that spoke to a growing problem in his candidacy and to
much of what had gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make it crystal clear,'' Bush said loudly. ``I reject
bigotry, I reject prejudice, I repudiate anti-Catholicism and
racism.''
</P>
<P>
   And just in case anyone missed a syllable, Bush's communications
director, Karen P. Hughes, hustled over to a group of reporters to
show them the text of the Texas governor's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   His proclamation had a specific prompting: thousands of
telephone calls that the campaign of his rival, Sen. John McCain,
had made to Roman Catholics in Michigan, reminding them that Bush
had visited Bob Jones University in South Carolina and recounting
some of the anti-Catholic sentiment associated with the
institution.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's statement also suggested a jarring, almost surreal
change of political fortunes: somehow, a candidate who began his
bid for the presidency with crossover dreams managed to pick up
enough right-wing baggage that he found himself in the strange
position of having to offer voters this kind of reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent Republican officials, looking at the advantage
McCain enjoyed among moderate Michigan voters, said Bush was
perhaps suffering from his actions in South Carolina, his alliances
with Christian conservatives and the appeals that the evangelist
Pat Robertson had made on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   These officials drew particular attention to a recorded
telephone message that Robertson had sent to many Michigan voters,
a divisive portrayal of McCain as an enemy of the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Robertson have said that the evangelist made the
calls on his own, but several political analysts said that voters
might not make such distinctions, and they suggested that a
cease-and-desist order from Bush would quickly make Robertson go
away.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear that any such discouragement is under way.
Robertson was on television, speaking as a Bush supporter, as the
returns from Michigan came in on Tuesday night. And the McCain
campaign said on Wednesday that voters in Virginia, whose primary
is on Feb. 29, were receiving the Robertson telephone call that had
been used in Michigan. A spokesman for the Christian Coalition said
the group, which acknowledged making the calls in Michigan, had not
made them in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be put back in the bottle,'' said Scott Reed, who
ran Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. ``Robertson is way over
the top, and somebody needs to pick up the phone and tell him to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Bond, former chairman of the Republican National Committee,
agreed that Robertson, the Christian Coalition and the appearance
of a rightward drift by Bush might well be costing him moderate
voters from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can get it back,'' said Bond, who took pains to
note that he does not sense an iota of intolerance in Bush. ``But
he makes it much harder with these Bob Jones and Pat Robertson
episodes, which make people from my background _ Northeast,
blue-collar, former Democrat, Catholic _ very uncomfortable. We
count, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Bush has often said that he has not tacked to
the right and that the positions he holds now are the positions he
held when he officially entered the race last June, not long after
winning re-election as governor with high support among Democrats,
blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   But the symbolism and the nuances of Bush's campaign were
distinctive over the two and a half weeks between his defeat by
McCain in New Hampshire and his victory over the Arizona senator in
South Carolina, a much more socially conservative state.
</P>
<P>
   In some campaign materials and advertisements that were
distributed by the Bush campaign and many more that were not, Bush
was cast as an anti-abortion crusader, despite the fact that he had
previously relegated the issue to the sidelines of his presidential
quest.
</P>
<P>
   During both a televised debate and a subsequent news conference,
Bush derisively suggested that McCain had won the support of the
Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group. It came across as an offhand
attempt to render the senator even less appetizing to the religious
right than he already was.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the stop at Bob Jones, an extremely conservative
Christian school with a well-known policy against interracial
dating. Bush did not acknowledge that controversy as he addressed
thousands of students there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what bothers me about that whole thing, and I know I'm
on the record, but I feel strongly about sending this message,''
Bond said. ``When George wants to be persuasive, from a
conservative point of view, he talks about changing people's
hearts, but when there came an opportunity to ask conservatives to
change their hearts, he didn't take it at Bob Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Bush send clear public signals that he wanted groups
like National Right to Life or the Christian Coalition to let up on
their assault against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Asked repeatedly at news conferences in South Carolina about
what these groups were doing, Bush talked about freedom of speech
and diverted attention to the advertising that the Sierra Club and
the National Abortion Rights Action League had done against him.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern persisted on Tuesday night in Kansas City, when
Bush held a brief news conference after the rally. Asked if he
repudiated the recorded message that Robertson had put out against
McCain, Bush said he did not know what the message contained, then
quickly switched the focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I repudiate the phone calls that came in accusing me of being
an anti-Catholic bigot,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   What about the Bob Jones visit? ``I don't make any apologies for
what I do on the campaign trail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's advisers are well aware that if Bush captures the
Republican nomination, he will need to to appeal to _ and reassure
_ swing voters in the center. And they understand that because Bush
wound up with a rival challenging him from the left, as opposed to
the right, he has perhaps acquired an image a bit different from
the one he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But they are betting that the repair work is minimal, and
several Republican officials and analysts agreed, saying that few
voters are paying close attention and that Bush's general aura,
record in Texas and true nature is not that of an extremist.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, this election will be decided by a few important
issues germane to American voters,'' said Ronald Kaufman, who was
the political director in the White House for Bush's father.
``Voters won't remember that Al Gore was chasing after Al Sharpton
or that George Bush got phone calls from Pat Robertson.''

JUSTICES REFUSE TO REVIVE FORMER MENTAL PATIENT'S LAWSUIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A unanimous Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to
revive the lawsuit of a former mental patient who claims Dallas
psychiatrists kept him hospitalized against his will for care he
did not need.
</P>
<P>
   In its 9-0 decision, the court said Mark Rotella waited too long
before suing doctors at the former Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion
in Dallas. Rotella alleged that the doctors conspired to admit him
on a trumped-up diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and
major depression.
</P>
<P>
   His lawsuit was one of nearly 1,000 civil cases brought by
former patients at Brookhaven and other psychiatric hospitals once
owned by National Medical Enterprises Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Rotella, who was 16 years old when admitted in February 1985,
said the doctors kept him in the hospital for 479 days not because
he needed treatment but because they were being paid to fill
hospital beds.
</P>
<P>
   Rotella, who was released from the hospital in 1986, sued the
doctors in 1997 under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organization Act, known as RICO.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, followed by the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, threw out the
lawsuit. The courts said Rotella's 11-year wait before suing the
doctors violated the law's four-year time limit for filing suit.
</P>
<P>
   On appeal, Rotella argued in vain before the Supreme Court that
he had filed his lawsuit in time.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was released in 1986, Rotella said he was unaware of
the doctor's alleged conspiracy until 1994. Therefore, his 1997
lawsuit, filed only three years later, fell within RICO's four-year
time limit, Rotella argued.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court, like the courts earlier, rejected his
argument.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said Rotella knew he had a potential lawsuit for
inappropriate hospitalization as early as his 1986 release, but did
nothing. The fact he was then not aware of the alleged conspiracy
by the doctors does not excuse his failure to file a lawsuit
against the hospital within four years of his release, Justice
David H. Souter wrote in the court's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The event that Rotella said alerted him to the alleged
conspiracy was the 1994 decision of National Medical Enterprises
Inc. to plead guilty to federal fraud and conspiracy charges and
pay a $350 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet Healthcare Corp. took over for NME in March 1995, closed
Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion and inherited the company's legal
problems. In the summer of 1998, Tenet paid $100 million to settle
700 wrongful hospitalization lawsuits filed in Texas, The New York
Times reported.

FEDS ANNOUNCE INVESTIGATION INTO POLICE BRUTALITY IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a broad and politically charged expansion of a
major police corruption scandal, the U.S. attorney, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the state attorney general announced
Wednesday that they were opening criminal investigations into
reports of widespread police brutality here.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements suddenly deepened the scandal after five
months in which the continuing disclosures of police abuses,
including the shooting and framing of innocent people, had
instigated little public or political outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said there were no major new developments behind the
intervention of the federal officials, but the unusual joint action
appeared to reflect both plummeting public confidence in the police
here and the growing, and increasingly open political feuding
between the police department and the district attorney's office
over the pace of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It also seemed to promise that the scandal will move beyond the
one inner-city station where it had been centered and could focus
on the possible failure on the part of senior officials to
supervise officers properly.
</P>
<P>
   With the expansion of the investigation, nearly every level of
law enforcement in the country is looking into a scandal in which
perhaps hundreds of people were wrongly imprisoned because of
police misconduct that went unchecked for years and that is
expected to cost the city $200 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the deeply troubled Los Angeles Police Department,
Bernard C. Parks, said he had called in the federal officials and
commented, ``We look forward to this partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   But that appeared to be in part a face-saving step, since every
one of the officials speaking at the unusual press conference here
Wednesday stressed that they were operating independently of the
Los Angeles Police Department and that they expected the
cooperation of the police in their separate investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney, Alejandro Mayorkas, said his office had been
looking at some cases related to the scandal for several months
``in a passive way'' until now. ``This will be the first step for
us to get involved actively,'' Mayorkas said in an interview later.
``It will be an active criminal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was widely perceived as, at least in part, the
product of an intensifying battle between Parks and the district
attorney, Gil Garcetti, over the breadth and pace of an
investigation that could have a far-reaching impact on the
political fortunes of many top city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The police chief has said his department had identified 99 cases
tainted by police corruption that should be overturned promptly,
and he has asked that three police officers be indicted. So far,
the district attorney's office has overturned 40 cases and has
indicted no officers, with Garcetti insisting that the cases are
complex and require great care if the prosecutors are going to
obtain convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The police chief and Mayor Richard J. Riordan have been highly
critical of Garcetti for what they perceive as foot-dragging, and
the police chief even publicly accused Garcetti's office of leaking
thousands of pages of documents on the case to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti has rejected the accusation and said the police have
been uncooperative at times. He also has hinted that Parks was
eager to push the cases quickly in an effort to contain the scandal
at lower levels of the department.
</P>
<P>
   While Parks refused to address questions about conflicts over
the investigation at the news conference Wednesday, Garcetti said:
``There is no turf war here. We are working collectively.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is now clear that, whether or not there is political
feuding, the scandal has now spun out of their control and it
appears certain to expand beyond the station, the Rampart Division,
which is in a gang-infested neighborhood, where it had been
centered.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a number of indications that public confidence
in the police and their department has been declining sharply. The
City Council voted Tuesday on a motion to initiate a new,
independent investigation. Although the measure lost by a slim
margin, several council members said it was a matter of time before
such an investigation is started because of concern that the police
were not capable of examining themselves fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The state's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, also announced
Wednesday that his office was beginning an investigation in an
effort ``to help them restore public confidence in the criminal
justice system here in Los Angeles.''

VW STOCK IS SHARPLY LOWER AS EARNINGS PLUMMET 80 PERCENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The shares of Volkswagen had their biggest
one-day drop in more than a year on Wednesday after the company
reported that earnings plunged 80 percent in the fourth quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen blamed one-time tax charges as a result of German tax
reform measures for much of the loss. Analysts said the problems
were much deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen, they said, had spent heavily to transform itself
from a producer of mass-market cars like the Golf and the new
Beetle to a producer of luxury cars like the Rolls-Royce Bentley,
which it acquired in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the carmaker lacked new models to replace the current line
of Volkswagens and Audis. In addition, Volkswagen has demonstrated
a lack of transparency, a persistent practice of being unclear
about its financial performance and then surprising investors with
unexpected results.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to bear in mind that it is very difficult to forecast
Volkswagen's results,'' said Marcus Plumer, an automobile analyst
at WestLB Research in Duesseldorf. ``They do publish quarterly
figures, but these are almost meaningless, and they often wait
until the fourth quarter to clean things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen shares dropped 6 percent on the Frankfurt exchange,
to 42.30 euros, or about $42.30, the biggest one-day drop since
Jan. 22, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen, reporting after the markets had closed on Tuesday
evening, said that its fourth-quarter net income declined from 736
million marks, or about $405 million, to 149 million marks, or
$76.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Volkswagen's sales actually increased 9.5 percent,
to 147 billion marks, or $76.1 billion, while its net income
declined 21.5 percent, to 4.9 billion marks, or about $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, Volkswagen said that one-time costs as a
result of German tax reform measures accounted for three-quarters
of the decline in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company also noted that research and development costs had
increased substantially and ``will remain high in the coming
year.''

 &HT;    Teen-age singer set to get `star image' as country music's next
breakthrough
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A New York record executive thinks the
next big thing in country music could be a 14-year-old who shares a
tiny bedroom with her little brother and sister in a West Palm
Beach condo, rides the bus to school and wears braces on her teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Her backup band is a karaoke machine. And her latest gig was in
a dingy tent at the South Florida Fair, on a makeshift stage
optimistically called the Rising Stars Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   But Jamie Floyd can sing _ a soulful, beautiful, intense kind of
song created by a voice that can cut through bad acoustics and bad
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a boss passes a tape, you listen,'' said Jayne Young of
W&AMP;R Group, a company in New York City that has produced such names
as Celine Dion and Mariah Carey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting the worst because it wasn't done in a
professional way. It was like karaoke. (But) it was exceptional,
even in that form.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Florida girl with the braces and big country hair _ the
third generation in a family of dreamers who hoped to be the next
big thing _ signed a production deal a few weeks ago. Young
predicts she could have a major-label record deal in a matter of
months. All this at 14 years old _ the age country staples LeAnn
Rimes, Tanya Tucker and Brenda Lee each became the next big thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thinking always was this was going to happen,'' Jamie says.
``But I think that I'm sort of amazed. I never knew it would happen
this soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they called us, it was so surreal. I think about all the
people who would die to be in this place. I feel so blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so she was probably born to do something like this. Her
parents met 25 years ago. Her piano-playing mother, JoAnn Bottari,
was in a Long Island band _ one led by her grandfather, Rick _ and
the band needed someone on guitar. Enter Tom Floyd, who joined the
band but within no time was gone, absconding with the piano player
to a new life in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   You can find the Tom &AMP; JoAnn Trio weekends at The Colony hotel
in Palm Beach. Or at a country club dance or a benefit event.
They've been singing and making music together all this time.
During the day, they take over the third bedroom of their
three-bedroom condo to give music lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when it just gets so bad financially, but you
go day by day, week by week,'' JoAnn says. ``When you're a
performer, you can't do this business because you want to get rich.
You have to do it because you love it and you want to sing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say JoAnn or Tom or Rick would have turned down an
opportunity like Jamie's. ``Very few of us get there,'' says JoAnn.
She sounds just a little wistful. But then she starts talking about
Jamie.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie never took a singing lesson. The Floyds played jazz music
to baby Jamie as she drifted off to sleep. Her first stage
appearance was at age 2 at Glen Eagles Country Club, where her
parents were performing. She did pretty impressive renditions of
``Somewhere Over the Rainbow'' and ``Twinkle, Twinkle Little
Star.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The music just came out and it kept coming out,'' her mom
says. ``We never really wanted her in this business ... but she
just wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie was turned on to country a few years ago _ she got LeAnn
Rimes' first CD and was hooked. There was just something about
country music. It's practically the only thing on the radio that
musicians can learn these days, her father says. The rest is so
electronically enhanced, it's nearly impossible to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Tom Floyd says, ``so much of the pop stuff is
sex-related. These are stories. It's not just the trailer broke
down and my dog died.''
</P>
<P>
   The other thing Jamie performs regularly is the national anthem.
She sings at Roger Dean Stadium for the Jupiter Hammerheads and for
spring training games. She's done the Florida Marlins and the
Florida Panthers (where she had to sing Canada's national anthem
for the visiting Vancouver Canucks hockey club).
</P>
<P>
   Rick Tickner, who picks the anthem singers at Roger Dean
Stadium, snatched Jamie up as a regular after listening to a few
bars as she auditioned over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of the best I've ever heard ... particularly for her
age,'' he said. ``You'd never guess she's 14 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie has her grandfather to thank for her new music contract.
The same man who unwittingly introduced her parents introduced
Jamie to her future.
</P>
<P>
   He was in a doctor's office last summer, paging through People
Magazine. He stopped on Page 41, a review of Nashville, Tenn.,
newcomer Julie Reeves, profiled as the chanteuse behind their album
of the week. In the story, he read that she was ``discovered'' by
Ric Wake, a pop producer who happens to run W&AMP;R Group.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa knew Ric Wake from the days when another of his musician
children worked with singer Taylor Dayne. He still had Wake's
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually got on the phone,'' JoAnn Floyd says, sounding as
excited as her little girl. ``I didn't think he'd pick up the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, one thing led to another, as they say, and Ric Wake and
Jayne Young were inviting Jamie to New York to record three of
their songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they got done hearing the songs there was dead silence,''
her mom recalled.
</P>
<P>
   And a few months later _ what seemed like eons to the Floyd
women _ they got a contract and an advance (they'd rather not say
for how much, but stress it's not much). Next, she needs to get
songs and a sound and an image.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew a 14-year-old needed an image?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no diva there,'' says Sherri Hubbard, journalism
teacher at the Dreyfoos School of the Arts, where Jamie is a
ninth-grader majoring in communications. (The music department, by
the way, rejected her. Maybe it was her country style. Not many
people go to Dreyfoos to learn how to be Reba McIntyre. Maybe, she
says, they got the feeling choir would take a back seat to her
other appearances.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Her hand isn't the first hand up but she always has the right
answer,'' Hubbard says. ``She's just one of those well-rounded,
dots-every-i-crosses-every-t kind of kid. She's well-liked and
accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   The music industry wants a little more diva, though. Jamie's
about to get a makeover, something she is both excited about and
wary of at the same time. What kid wouldn't like a shopping spree
in New York? But it would be nice if the executives who love the
way she sings would stop asking how she looks. Kind of like a guy
scoping out a blind date.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the way the business works, the record people say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would definitely not want her to meet (record) labels with
the braces on,'' says Young, the executive whose job is to develop
Jamie into a marketable talent.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie needs to be media-ready, get ``the star look,'' Young
says. ``So when you walk into a room, you see something special.''
</P>
<P>
   The details are up in the air, says Jamie. ``We're going to sort
of make an image, but they want me to be very comfortable with how
we present me to the public,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing is certain. ``Yes, we've got to get the braces
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie hasn't had much time to act like a kid lately, anyway.
Instead of group dates on a Saturday night, Jamie can typically be
found singing with her parents at The Colony. Instead of going to
school parties, Jamie may be practicing for SunFest. When she's not
working on her voice, she's working on karate, like she has for six
years. Or speech and debate _ she just competed in a countywide
tournament and came in first place, as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   But it's music that matters most to Jamie. And the grown-ups
closest to her say she is in good hands. ``She's not doing a
haphazard, child star kind of route,'' said Larry DeCarmine, a
School of the Arts teacher who has worked with Ricky Martin, Julio
Iglesias, Rosie O'Donnell and others. ``This is actually the best
way to groom an artist. This is the difference between the
Backstreet Boys of the moment and being a career artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie was named the Florida Country Music Association's 1999
Female Vocalist of the Year in the Junior Division. The nationals
come later this year in Las Vegas, but the Floyds don't think
they'll go. It's too expensive and you have to pay your own way.
</P>
<P>
   The kids in the local chapter get to perform together every
month or so at festivals, fairs and clubs. All dolled up and
feeling the music, the whole affair has a beauty pageant quality to
it. The youngest Floyd, Kelly, is 10 _ and the sparkly top and face
full of makeup and that voice says she could be following right
behind big sis. (So will Kelly follow in the family business? Mom
is quick to respond: ``Believe me, one at a time is enough.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Floyds insist they aren't forcing their kids into something
they may not be ready for. ``It was more me pushing my parents,''
Jamie says.
</P>
<P>
   Says JoAnn Floyd: ``We had to see it was part of Jamie and not
her parents pushing her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad wanted it all for me, just like I want it all for
Jamie, but it wasn't in the cards for me like it is for Jamie.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the uninitiated, the four syllables didn't sound
like a mantra. What did they signify, after all? One of the 50
states and, for a smaller group, the title of an old Broadway hit.
</P>
<P>
   But for the members of the cult, the word was uttered with the
religious hope reserved for references to messiahs and second
comings: ``Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a typical sentence using the word, to be spoken with awe
and trepidation: ``It could be the next `Oklahoma!''' Here is an
alternate version, to be said with a dying fall: ``Well, it
certainly isn't `Oklahoma!'''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: this might be/is not the answer to the prayers of
those waiting for the revitalization of the great American musical,
the show that will make the mold for the genre's next few decades.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, this kind of talk belongs to the dimly
perceived era known as the 20th century. By now even fanatical
devotees have concluded that there is not going to be a ``next
`Oklahoma!,''' any more than that ersatz Santa Claus, the Great
Pumpkin, will materialize for Linus in ``Peanuts.'' But don't strap
on your mourning bands just yet. The evidence of the last several
seasons suggests that musicals can thrive without a blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   The examples are eccentric and unlikely enough to tax any
conventional notions of what a musical is: an adaptation of a
modernist Irish short story in which performers seem to be singing
and dancing not for the audience but for one another (``James
Joyce's `The Dead'''); an evening in which there is no live singing
whatsoever, only recorded classical music and pop songs
(``Contact'').
</P>
<P>
   Or how about a show that takes the form of a glam-rock club act,
performed by a never-was of a star with an uncertain sexual
identity and strong confessional urges (``Hedwig and the Angry
Inch'')? Or a work, nominally about sex and politics on an aircraft
carrier, whose characters sing and dance, all right, but in the
manner of misprogrammed automatons (``North Atlantic'')?
</P>
<P>
   None of these shows lend themselves naturally to imitations.
They are not mapping out paths for other creators to follow, at
least not in any literal way. But each _ on its own carefully
constructed level _ is eliciting deeply emotional responses in
contemporary theatergoers, many of whom would not be caught dead at
a revival of ``The Sound of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   As a group, they suggest that the best way for the musical to
solve its identity crisis is to stop worrying about what it should
or must be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma!'' was the production that altered the very course of
a much-loved, still-young form of entertainment, or so squinting
hindsight informs us. Before Rodgers and Hammerstein's tale of
cowmen, farmers and dreaming girls opened on Broadway on March 31,
1943, the story goes, musicals were mostly frivolous things. Song,
dance and comic routines could more or less be switched from one
show to another, no matter what their individual plots or settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma!'' supposedly established a new paradigm: that of the
``organic musical,'' in which song and dance furthered the story,
arising naturally from the plot. This is still what most people
think of when they think of musicals, and there's a stigma of
quaintness attached.
</P>
<P>
   From the mid-1960s on, however, there was a nervous sense among
those who made musicals that a new template was required. By the
end of that decade, movie audiences would not swallow the idea of
people bursting into spontaneous song on screen, and the skepticism
carried over to the theater.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? You could not think of Stephen Sondheim, amazing
though his career has been, as the answer all by himself: one man
with a sui generis talent and sensibility, stretching the form
without breaking it.
</P>
<P>
   Was ``Hair,'' the tribal rock musical, the answer? What about
``A Chorus Line,'' the confessional, introspective musical? Or all
those rock operettas out of England, courtesy of Andrew Lloyd
Webber? Or those moody, intellectual chamber musicals so popular
among the composers coming of age in the 1990s?
</P>
<P>
   All of these variations have spawned their own progeny. The line
of Lloyd Webber, largely sired by Sir Andrew himself, had the most
lucrative and flamboyant run, but the sun has set on that empire,
at least in artistic terms. (Yes, I know, Frank Wildhorn's ``Jekyll
and Hyde'' is still alive and thriving.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the much-touted ``new school'' of young composers _
notably Jason Robert Brown (``Parade'') and Michael John LaChiusa
(``Marie Christine'') _ their complex, intricate scores failed to
flourish on Broadway stages. To many theatergoers, there remains
something hermetic about these shows that forbids emotional
connection.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of a new century, the only formulas regularly
exploited by Broadway producers, an unimaginative lot by and large,
involve rote recycling. The anthology format, in which old songs
and dance steps are combined into synthetic theme packages
(``Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' ``Fosse,'' ``Swing''), has become popular,
as have, pathetically, freeze-dried stage adaptations of movie
musicals (``Footloose,'' ``Saturday Night Fever''). And there are
always, as there should be, revivals of musical classics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But signs of fresher, more vital life are stirring in shows that
have, for the most part, originated Off Broadway. They are
different enough from one another to preclude any ideas of sweeping
trends with coattails to cling to. They each, however, meet the
criterion demanded of any successful musical: the ability to seduce
us into an alternative reality that is utterly consistent on its
own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Joyce's `The Dead,''' which has transferred to the
Belasco Theater after an initial limited run Off Broadway at
Playwrights Horizons, is in a sense the antithesis of the
traditionally extroverted Broadway musical. In adapting Joyce's
story of a Christmas party in Dublin to the stage, Richard Nelson
(the director and the author of the book) and Shaun Davey (the
composer) reflect their source's sense of human isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the evening's musical numbers, mostly rendered for
one another by the party's guests and hosts, the focus is as much
on those watching as on those performing. Indeed, audaciously, many
of these songs are executed by people with their backs to the
audience, or in quarter-profile to it.
</P>
<P>
   You are always aware of how varied the responses of the other
characters on stage are. Music may draw them together, but it also
individualizes them. The work's extraordinary emotional pull has
much to do with this feeling of separateness.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Contact,'' soon to open at the Vivian Beaumont Theater
after starting at its smaller sister at Lincoln Center, the Mitzi
E. Newhouse, the director and choreographer Susan Stroman turns
dance itself into the principal narrative force of the show's three
vignettes. Working with recordings of classical, jazz and pop
pieces, the show delightfully blurs the lines between ``natural''
movement and the stylizations of dance, between awkwardness and
grace and, by extension, between fantasy and reality. In this
sense, it's as organic as ``Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hedwig and the Angry Inch,'' John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen
Trask's show about sex and the single rock icon at the Jane Street
Theater, and ``North Atlantic,'' by the venerable avant-garde
troupe the Wooster Group, are downtown shows in all senses of the
word, aimed at younger, hipper crowds. Both are works of wide
cultural eclecticism.
</P>
<P>
   Trask's score for ``Hedwig'' ranges from country-and-western to
punk rock, while ``North Atlantic,'' directed by Elizabeth LeCompte
from a text by James Strahs, seems to have scrambled together the
sensibilities of every American war movie ever made and then
filtered them through a medley of pastiche cowboy ballads.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, both shows, in different ways, are about dislocation
at a time when personal styles are changed like underwear and
technology fractures the way people see things. Yet they both bring
an exhilarating precision to their presentations of melting
identities (personal in the case of ``Hedwig,'' cultural in ``North
Atlantic''), a feeling for the patterns in pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   All four of these new musicals are as appropriate to their era
as ``Oklahoma!'' was to its. This is an age, after all, in which
trends, whether in fashion or painting, tend to mutate before they
can be labeled. Art doesn't march forward in a straight line
anymore, if indeed it ever did. Musicals are just starting to wake
up to that reality.

 &HT;    Beckham still helps provide some spice
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How eerie must David Beckham have felt as he walked on
the pitch for Wednesday's friendly with Argentina? Considering
recent events, the Manchester United star and ``Spice Boy''
celebrity might wonder why dramatic turns in his career and life
seemingly revolve around encounters with the South American power.
</P>
<P>
   Beckham was red-carded in England's 1998 World Cup loss to
Argentina, earning him such severe media abuse that he fled for the
anonymity of New York with then-girlfriend and current wife
Victoria Adams, a k a pop star ``Posh Spice.''
</P>
<P>
   And last weekend, as the 24-year-old world player of the year
runner-up prepared for United's key Premier League match with
Leeds, Beckham was chased off the training ground by manager Alex
Ferguson, who didn't buy his excuse of taking a day off to care for
his ill infant son.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Beckham was seen in the stands _ wearing a Braves cap
_ as United beat Leeds 1-0 to maintain a six-point lead. His
suspension is fueling speculation that he might leave the defending
English and European Champions after the season. Ferguson isn't
enamored with Beckham's lifestyle and Posh's insistence that they
live near London, a three-hour drive from Manchester, or her
suggestion of moving to a warmer climate such as Italy or Spain.
</P>
<P>
   England manager Kevin Keegan, trying to reverse a recent string
of lackluster results, didn't hesitate to put Beckham in the lineup
Wednesday. It didn't matter, however, as England ended up in a 0-0
draw. Beckham was given a yellow card for a hard tackle on
Argentina's Diego Simeone, the same player who provoked the English
star to kick him, and get kicked out of action, the last time they
met.
</P>
<P>
   In other Wednesday friendlies, Holland beat Germany 2-1 in a
record-setting performance by Major League Soccer-bound Lothar
Matthaus. The German captain earned his 144th international cap,
surpassing former Swedish goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli atop the career
appearances list.
</P>
<P>
   Two Juventus stars lifted their teams to late victories.
Alessandro Del Piero converted a 79th-minute penalty kick as Italy
topped Sweden 1-0, and 1998 World Cup hero Zinedine Zidane scored
with two minutes left as France edged Poland 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland got an 87th-minute goal from Robbie Keane in a 3-2
surprise over the Czech Republic. Spain and Croatia played to a 0-0
draw, and Norway beat Turkey 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLISH LEGEND DIES
</P>
<P>
   Sir Stanley Matthews, the acclaimed ``Wizard of the Dribble''
and the first British soccer player to be knighted, died Wednesday
at the age of 85. Matthews had more than 1,000 appearances for
Stoke City and Blackpool, winning the F.A. Cup with the latter club
in 1953. He also played 54 times for England, from 1935 to 1957,
and was listed in the Top 10 of many of the All-20th-Century teams.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: SANTOS A SURPRISE
</P>
<P>
   The first month of the Torneo Verano season has generated more
than a few surprises, especially at the top of the table. Santos
Laguna, which missed the Invierno playoffs last fall, has a
league-high 14 points after a 2-0 win over UAG on Sunday. It was
one of six games that featured a red card in a contentious weekend
in which a total 10 players were sent off. UAG was playing a man
down when Edson Alvarado drew first blood in the 80th minute, and
Hector Hernandez struck five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONS LEAGUE RESUMES
</P>
<P>
   The second round of group play in the European Champions League
resumes next week after a three-month hiatus, with some of the
favorites needing good results. Barcelona is two points behind
Porto but plays host to the Portugese power on Tuesday in Group A.
Lazio, tied with Chelsea for the lead in Group D, is at home to
Feyenoord, while defending champion Manchester United, trailing by
a point in Group B, gets a visit from Bordeaux. The biggest clash
is on Tuesday, when Group C leaders Real Madrid and Bayern Munich
meet in Spain. On Wednesday, Group B leaders Fiorentina will host
Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLAND: BOLTON REACHES SEMIS
</P>
<P>
   The First Division Bolton Wanderers got a 1-0 victory over
league-leading Charlton Athletic on Saturday to reach the
semifinals of the F.A. Cup. Bolton, which won the first F.A. Cup
final in 1923, got a 47th-minute goal from Eidur Gudjohnsen. The
other semifinalists are in the Premier League. Aston Villa, which
beat Everton 2-1, meets Bolton when the semis begin April 2.
Newcastle, which has reached the semis for the third year in a row,
plays Chelsea in the draw's other half.... Leicester City will play
First Division spoiler Tranmere Rovers on Sunday in the final of
the Worthington (English League) Cup.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: RIVALDO WAKES UP BARCA
</P>
<P>
   Barcelona snapped out of a recent lull just in time for
Saturday's big match against Real Madrid by trouncing Valladolid
4-0. Rivaldo scored twice, including one on a superb bicycle kick,
and Barca closed to within five points of Deportivo La Coruna,
which beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0.

   PARIS _ Fears that the United States, Britain and other
English-speaking countries are using a Cold War eavesdropping
network to gain a commercial edge roused passions across Europe
Wednesday, even after the notion had been flatly denied in
Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
   The subject kept the European Parliament in Brussels entranced
for hours and drew banner headlines across the Continent. One
political cartoon showed Britain in bed with the United States,
despite Britain's membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The hubbub grew from a report prepared for the European
Parliament that found that communications intercepted by a network
called Echelon had twice helped U.S. companies gain an advantage
over Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of the latest allegations, suggestions of
commercial spying have surfaced regularly in recent years. They
have infuriated many Europeans who seem to have little trouble
believing that military espionage systems developed during the Cold
War would now be used to help businesses in English-speaking
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Echelon is a network of surveillance stations stitched together
in the 1970s by the U.S. National Security Agency, with Australia,
Britain Canada and New Zealand, to intercept select satellite
communications, according to recently declassified information in
Washington. But both Washington and Downing Street quickly rejected
the idea that they might be using any secret information to bolster
their own economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No is the short answer,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair of England
said in London. ``These things are governed by extremely strict
rules, and those rules will always be applied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. intelligence agencies are not tasked to engage in
industrial espionage or obtain trade secrets for the benefit of any
U.S. company or companies,'' said the State Department spokesman,
James Rubin, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we cannot comment on the substance of the report, we
can say that the NSA is not authorized to provide intelligence
information to private firms,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The denials did little to quell European fury, especially in
France. French Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou said that French
companies were being encouraged to encrypt sensitive information to
avoid detection by U.S. espionage operations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She said Echelon had been set up as a military system dating
originally to 1948 to eavesdrop on the Soviet Union and its allies
during the Cold War but had since been converted to be used ``for
economic espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it appears the network has been diverted to the purposes
of economic espionage and for keeping a watch on competitors,''
Guigou said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The flare-up was prompted by the publication of a report
commissioned by the European Parliament 18 months ago, after
initial allegations of commercial espionage. The 18-page report,
which was written by a free-lance journalist, Duncan Campbell, and
based in large part on newspaper accounts, claimed that Echelon had
been used by the United States to gain the advantage in a least two
deals involving major European companies.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell described Echelon as a vast, coordinated system that
includes a system of satellites and at least 10 listening posts
worldwide that can intercept telephone calls, e-mails and faxes.
</P>
<P>
   The report drew skepticism from conservative members of
parliament, some of whom said the document had failed to provide
sufficient proof.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``well-informed'' press reports from 1995, Duncan claimed
that information learned through Echelon had been given to Boeing
Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. when they were trying to win a $6
billion contract from Saudi Arabia. His report said that the spy
network intercepted calls between the European consortium Airbus
and the Saudi airline and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also charged that spy information had helped U.S.
Raytheon Corp. win a bid for a $1.3 billion surveillance system for
the Amazon forest against Thomson-CSF, a French company.
</P>
<P>
   But few details were offered about how the information was of
any use to the U.S. firms. Each example was described only in a
short paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's executive commission has refused demands to
crack down on industrial espionage of the type described Wednesday,
saying that charges have not been proven.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's only a rumor and I don't deal in rumors,'' the
commissioner responsible for the European Union's single market,
Frits Bolkestein, said at at parliamentary hearing on data
protection earlier this week, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Echelon, which is run jointly with the NSA's
counterparts in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, has
also been widely criticized in the United States as an excessive
intrusion into the private communications of Americans and their
allies. Some say the system developed by the National Security
Agency emerged from the Cold War as a kind of Big Brother without a
cause.

 &HT;    More heat, insulation might prevent drain freeze
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's been a while since we've run a question-and-
</P>
<P>
   answer column, so I've got a backlog.
</P>
<P>
   I'll deal with three today and probably a couple more next week.
</P>
<P>
   LAUNDRY DRAIN FREEZES, BACKS UP
</P>
<P>
   E.K. sent an e-mail saying her house, built in 1992, has a
laundry room with a washing machine hook-up unit along an outside
wall. The hook-up unit has a hot tap, a cold tap and a drain hole
for the drain pipe from the washer. Her problem is the drain pipe
sometimes freezes in cold weather and drain water from the washer
backs up onto the laundry room floor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Solution: Bob Rhoads of R.A. Rhoads Inc., the company that
built E.K.'s house, said he tries to avoid placing plumbing pipes
along outside walls, but sometimes it can't be avoided. Houses are
built with an exterior surface, such as brick or vinyl siding, then
a layer of sheathing (flat panels with weatherproofing) and then
studs. Insulation goes against the sheathing to keep the cold air
out, but on extremely cold days the insulation sometimes is not
enough to keep plumbing fixtures that run between studs from
freezing. The drain in a washer hook-up is a simple vertical pipe
called a standpipe with a bend called a trap positioned a couple
feet below the opening. Water sits in the trap to keep sewer gases
from entering the laundry room, and it's the water in the trap that
can freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoads says the most important way to prevent problems is to
keep the laundry room warm in extremely cold weather and to make
sure the warmth reaches the wall that contains the pipe. People
don't necessarily heat the laundry room on days they are not doing
laundry; they close the register and close the room off much of the
week. A certain amount of heat always leaves the room through the
outside wall, and, unless there is heat in the room, the water in
the drain trap eventually freezes when a deep cold spell hits.
Because the drain has a history of problems, E.K. has to leave the
register open in the laundry room when temperatures get into the
single digits and below.
</P>
<P>
   E.K. said she's done those things and still has problems. Daniel
Leitshuh of Rambo-Westendorf Plumbing said it may be possible to
add more insulation. That would require removing the drywall over
the drain pipe and stuffing insulation in on the outdoor side of
the pipe. Another option is to replace the in-wall drain system
with a free-standing washtub in the laundry room. With a washtub,
the trap will be inside the room under the tub rather than inside
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   VINYL WINDOWS CAN BE PAINTED
</P>
<P>
   J.H. sent an e-mail saying her family had white-vinyl storm
windows installed on its older home, and now the family wants a
different color and wonders if vinyl can be painted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Solution: You can paint vinyl window frames. The majority of
replacement-window owners don't do it, though, and it's not
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kostak, the owner of All Seal Home Improvement, a local
company in the vinyl-window business, and James Lindsey, operations
manager for the Sherwin-Williams commercial painting facility, both
said vinyl windows can be painted with water-based latex acrylic
paint. As with any painting job, don't go with the cheapest paint
on the shelf. Most of the exterior latex paints in the middle of
the available price range, about $18 to $25 a gallon, should work
well. Vinyl must be cleaned thoroughly before it's painted. Kostak
said he also would rub them down with a little fine-grit sandpaper
to take off any surface gloss and give the paint a surface it can
bite into. Lindsey said the same effect can be achieved with a coat
of latex primer.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that if you paint your vinyl windows, you're committing
yourself to painting them again and again every few years as the
old paint wears out. One of the reasons many people get vinyl
windows is to avoid repainting, so you'll be losing that advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ROOF GRUNGE CAN INTERFERE WITH DRAINAGE
</P>
<P>
   G.B. of Dayton said an area of his house has a roof with a
shallow pitch that gets very little sunlight. The roof gets a green
growth on it, and he wonders if the growth is harmful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Solution: Bill Dahm, one of the owners of Dahm Brothers
Roofing in Dayton, said the green growth is probably moss, and it's
not a good idea to let it build up. The moss is common in the area,
and it typically grows on the north and east sides of a house
because those areas get the least direct sunlight. Dahm said it's
the same reason moss grows on the north and east sides of trees in
the wild; harsh sunlight kills the moss, but it thrives in deep
shade.
</P>
<P>
   Dahm said the moss can build up on a shallow roof and clog the
grooves that channel rainwater straight down the roof toward the
gutters. The obstructions can contribute to water pooling on the
roof or moving sideways, neither or which is desirable. He suggests
getting a deck broom, one of those brooms with coarse bristles
coming out of a rectangular block. Standing on a ladder, use the
bristles of the broom to brush the moss, breaking it up and
sweeping it away. While you're up on the ladder, check your gutters
and scoop out any debris.
</P>
<P>
   If your roof is steep, you shouldn't risk standing on the roof
to break up moss. Dahm said moss can make roofs, especially slate
roofs, slippery and extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   A more common problem with roofs in the Miami Valley climate is
dark drip lines. These lines also tend to form on the north and
east sides of houses that don't get a lot of sun, but they're
caused by mold and mildew rather than moss. Dahm said mold and
mildews feed on the fiberglass in shingles, but they won't destroy
the shingle. The streaks are mostly a cosmetic problem.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent streaks, you can install strips of copper or zinc
along the peak of the roof and around protrusions through the roof
such as chimneys. The runoff from the copper and zinc prevent mold
growth. Dahm said shingles that contain copper are becoming more
popular and probably will become standard. The copper in the
shingles prevents mildew growth and therefore prevents streaks.

CLINTON HAS LEARNED TO LOVE STATE DINNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There was a time when President Clinton did not
seem to care for getting all gussied up in a tuxedo to entertain
the leaders of the world. He preferred rolling up his sleeves in
the Cabinet Room to raising his glass in the State Dining Room.
Twenty-one-gun salutes, red carpets and fine china _ that was all
considered oh so President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But after a slow start, Clinton has become quite comfortable in
his tux, which he slipped on one more time for a state dinner with
King Juan Carlos I of Spain and his wife, Queen Sofia. And he will
use his fancy threads several more times, aides say, before his
second term ends.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his presidency with a string of 16 working lunches
with various heads of states, gatherings that were no more
glamorous than the run-of-the-mill sessions held with, say,
congressional committee chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   He waited almost a year before holding his first formal meal for
a foreign leader, and that November 1993 dinner for Kim Young Sam,
South Korea's president at the time, left out the red carpet, the
arrival ceremony on the south lawn and other traditional trappings.
</P>
<P>
   In diplomatic parlance, there are supposed to be just two types
of high-level dinners, which are really just two cannon blasts
apart, and both feature elaborate meals.
</P>
<P>
   A visiting head of state can be honored with a state visit,
complete with a 21-gun salute. A head of government, such as a
prime minister, can get an official 19-gun welcome _ should the
State Department find such an honor in line with United States
foreign policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton White House, in its early years, sometimes bent
the traditional rules.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's first state dinner came a year and a half into his
presidency, a glitzy white-tie gala in June of 1994 in honor of
Emperor Akihito of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, whatever hesitancy Clinton displayed early on with
the pageantry of the presidency has clearly faded, and the White
House kitchen has served up a steady stream of exotic entrees _
roasted salmon on caramelized fennel and endive, roast duck and
papaya, grilled lamb with Vidalia onions.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's dinner, with grilled rack of lamb as the main
course, is the 27th such affair, slightly more than President Bush
during his single term.
</P>
<P>
   The number of state dinners planned before Clinton leaves office
is treated at the White House almost as a state secret. But aides
acknowledge that the buglers and flag bearers and others who make
such events special will gather several more times in the months to
come.
</P>
<P>
   The White House social office, which is under the oversight of
the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, runs the show. That
includes the invitation list, the menu, the seating chart, and even
the floral arrangements. (Wednesday night it was white Virginia
roses, white Phalaenopsis orchids and white gardenias accented with
a touch of white ginestra.)
</P>
<P>
   The tribute to Spanish royalty was Mrs. Clinton's first state
dinner as a Senate candidate. But there were no blatant signs that
she sought to turn the affair into a campaign event.
</P>
<P>
   The wines were from California wineries owned by Spaniards, not
from the Finger Lakes. The menu was catered to the tastes of the
royal visitors, right down to the queen's penchant for chocolate.
There were no Buffalo wings.
</P>
<P>
   A scan of the invitation list _ a cozy 170 people _ disclosed no
large contingent from Wellsville or Oswego or anywhere else in the
Empire State. But the director of scheduling for Mrs. Clinton's
campaign effort, Evan Ryan, did attend.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, every state dinner is a mixture of pomp and
politics. Some of those invited get in the door as a result of
their titles or largesse to the party, while others add star power,
ethnic diversity or just plain cultural flair.
</P>
<P>
   The list for Thursday night's dinner included guests as varied
as the actress Meg Ryan, James Billington, the librarian of
Congress, and Abe Pollin, the owner of the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Also noticeable were some who stuck by President Clinton in the
impeachment imbroglio _ like his friend Vernon Jordan; the actress
Whoopi Goldberg, his loyal backer; and Gene Lyons, a journalist who
wrote a recent book harshly critical of Kenneth Starr, the former
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Putting together the list is a complicated undertaking that
involves officials in the State Department, the National Security
Council and a variety of offices in the West Wing. Those who have
never made the cut lobby relentlessly for a seat at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Declining his invitation this time was Vice President Al Gore,
who was busy discussing education issues at a campaign stop in
South Carolina in hopes of holding some state dinners of his own
one day
</P>
<P>
   Not only potential guests jockey for invitations. Embassies of
countries across the globe work from Inauguration Day until lights
out for an opportunity to break bread with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very sought after _ by both those people who want a
seat at the table and those countries that want to be afforded the
honor,'' said a White House aide who was peripherally involved in
the planning of Wednesday night's dinner. ``This is the ultimate.
Some countries have a tough time getting a working visit. State
dinners are reserved for our most important allies.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of honored countries spans the globe, and is closely
followed among diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Chinese officials pressed for a state dinner. But U.S.
officials, concerned about human rights and other matters, instead
offered President Jiang Zemin a meeting with Clinton in New York.
Two years later, when the winds of foreign policy shifted, Zemin
got what one White House aide referred to as ``all the bells and
whistles.''
</P>
<P>
   State dinners, by design, are heavier on pageantry than policy.
Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, was asked at a press
briefing this week about the main issues that will come up between
the president and the Spanish king.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an opportunity for the president to highlight
the deep and rich nature of our relations with Spain, and to
continue ongoing efforts to expand and deepen the friendship
between the two countries,'' Lockhart offered.

   ``It's ceremonial, then, mainly?'' the reporter responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty much what I'd read from that answer,'' Lockhart
replied.

 &HT;    Lewis murder trial set to begin May 15
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ray Lewis wanted a speedy trial and a judge gave him
one, setting his murder trial for May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Superior Court Judge Alice Bonner set the trial
date during an hourlong status conference Wednesday afternoon with
attorneys in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy with the trial date and happy the process is
under way,'' Lewis lawyer Ed Garland said as he walked out of the
judge's chambers. ``We want to have this matter concluded and
decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Lewis defense team filed a speedy trial motion,
which requires the trial to be set by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Garland predicted the calling of trial witnesses would last
three weeks, with jury selection taking another three to four days.
</P>
<P>
   Garland said he has yet to decide whether to file a motion to
have Lewis tried separately from co-defendants Joseph Sweeting of
Miami and Reginald Oakley of Baltimore. As of now, all three
defendants will go to trial May 15.
</P>
<P>
   The three men are charged with murder and aggravated assault in
the Jan. 31 stabbing deaths of Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar,
both of Decatur, Ga., after a night of post-Super Bowl partying in
Buckhead, Atlanta's entertainment district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be ready to go,'' Assistant District Attorney Clint
Rucker said of the trial date.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he wanted to try all three defendants together,
Rucker declined comment, citing a recent gag order. ``I don't want
to comment on any of the state's trial strategy,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rucker said his office has not filed a motion to revoke Lewis'
$1 million bond. Rucker's boss, District Attorney Paul Howard, said
last week he may ask that the bond be revoked. The prosecutor
suggested that the All-Pro NFL linebacker may have violated the gag
order when he held a news conference in Baltimore to proclaim his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Garland took exception with that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every American citizen accused of a crime has the
absolute right to pronounce and proclaim that position: that he is
innocent,'' he said. ``I do not think such a motion would have any
basis at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner closed the hearing to the public and denied a motion
filed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution for it to be open. The
hearing was attended by Rucker and lawyers for all three defendants
in Bonner's chambers.

THEY'RE GOT MEMORIES RIGHT HERE IN MASON CITY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASON CITY, Iowa _ In an age of Broadway musicals so impersonal
that one of their most frequent sources of new material is old
movies, ``The Music Man'' is a reminder of another time in
musical-theater history, when melodious ideas for the stage were as
organically grown as cornfields, when showy spectacles could be
teased out of the experiences of a single life.
</P>
<P>
   Driving along the snow-encrusted streets of Mason City recently,
Carl R. Miller could not have been prouder of the inspirational
role this old northern Iowa industrial town played in the history
of the American musical. As the model for the place immortalized in
Meredith Willson's ``Music Man,'' it is, in a sense, a landmark of
the imagination, a locality redrawn in the mind of one of its most
illustrious natives and reinvented on a stage as an emblem of
prairie innocence and brass-band sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where Meredith went to church, and his mother taught
in the Sunday school,'' Miller, executive director of the
preservation-minded Mason City Foundation, said, gesturing out the
window of his car. ``This is the footbridge that they named for
him. Look at the old hotel, and the old bank building. In his mind,
this was River City.''
</P>
<P>
   River City. Oh, ya got trouble, Willson's singular creation,
Professor Harold Hill, convinces the gullible townsfolk. Hill
explains why in that talk-song from the 1957 musical that put
Willson and the turn-of-the-century Mason City of his boyhood on
the Broadway map.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which tells the story of a con man who sells the
citizenry on the dream of a boys' band he has no intention of
leading, was the smash hit of the 1957-58 season, going on to play
for 1,375 performances and beating ``West Side Story'' for the Tony
for best musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Music Man'' _ the highly successful 1962 movie version
starred Robert Preston, reprising his celebrated Broadway
performance _ has been a staple on the high school, dinner theater,
summer stock circuit for years, but only rarely has it played in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   A 1980 version at City Center, with Dick Van Dyke as Hill, was
received tepidly, in part because Van Dyke was considered too sunny
a scam artist to con the Iowans, let alone the New York critics.
</P>
<P>
   But now, ``The Music Man'' is back, in a major new production
directed and choreographed by one of the theater's reigning
talents, Susan Stroman, the driving creative force behind Lincoln
Center Theater's acclaimed dance play, ``Contact.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest incarnation, featuring Rebecca Luker in the Barbara
Cook role of Marian the Librarian _ and, in a risky departure, a
virtual unknown, Craig Bierko, as Professor Hill _ opens at the
Neil Simon Theater on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``As American as apple pie and a Fourth of July oration'' is how
Brooks Atkinson described the show in his opening-night review in
The New York Times on Dec. 20, 1957. The comparisons may not have
been the most original, but they are entirely apt, for Willson's
musical sensibilities are patriotic, wholesome, even corny.
</P>
<P>
   The show, in fact, originated entirely in the heart and memory
of this multitalented Iowan _ he wrote the book, lyrics and music _
who, like Norman Rockwell and Thornton Wilder, sought to
memorialize small-town American life through the everyday people
who animated it.
</P>
<P>
   Willson was scrupulous in his insistence that ``The Music Man''
be viewed as a homage to the Midwestern experience, circa 1912,
that he had witnessed. The musical, he wrote in the script's
introductory notes, ``was intended to be a valentine, not a
caricature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The humor of this piece,'' the author added, ``depends on its
technical faithfulness to the real small-town Iowans of 1912, who
certainly did not think they were funny at all.''
</P>
<P>
   To Stroman, the musical, now in rehearsal, is rooted in an
identifiable patch of the heartland. `` `The Music Man' is about
the rhythm of the pitch of the traveling salesman,'' she said,
``and then about the rhythm of the language of the people of
Iowa.'' Indeed, the show is a compendium of musical touchstones of
Willson's world, from ``Seventy-Six Trombones'' the John Philip
Sousa-inspired production number, to the close-harmony songs sung
by a barbershop quartet.
</P>
<P>
   If a cringe factor has to be included in the dramatic equation _
the big second-act dance number, after all, is called ``Shipoopi''
_ Stroman said that taking Willson at his word is one way to ward
it off. ``I've done a lot of research on Mason City and on Iowa,''
she said, emphasizing that for the sake of authenticity, each
ensemble member has been provided with a history and a connection
to another ensemble member. ``The town,'' she added, ``is treated
like a real town.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads back, of course, to Mason City, where Willson, a
composer and conductor, was born in 1902. (He died in California in
1984 and was buried in his hometown.) More than almost any major
American musical _ more than, say, the cynical big city depicted in
John Kander and Fred Ebb's ``Chicago,'' more even than the
exhilarating frontier can-doism of Rodgers and Hammerstein's
``Oklahoma!'' _ ``The Music Man'' is idealized Americana, a show
with powerful connections to the geography, language and behavior
of a peculiarly American place.
</P>
<P>
   The authenticity even extends to the names that Willson used.
``There are still Shinns in the phone book,'' Miller said of the
surname Willson gave to the clownish mayor of River City. ``And the
women's dance group he put in the show _ you know, `one Grecian
urn'? _ still performs here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 66, happens to be a former mayor of Mason City, but he
is also Willson's foremost local champion. It just so happens that
even as the musical is being readied for Broadway, Miller is
leading a revival of interest in Willson. The foundation he heads
not only has restored the composer's 105-year-old childhood home on
South Pennsylvania Avenue here, but it is also building, on land
next door, a $10 million museum and indoor streetscape that will
recreate the River City of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To be called, of all things, Music Man Square, it will be
devoted to Willson and the musical for which he is best remembered.
The complex is scheduled to be completed in 2002, the centenary of
Willson's birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first building will be the pool hall,'' Miller said,
standing in the partly finished shell of a 30,000-square-foot
structure that is to house Music Man Square's main street,
archives, theater, classrooms and restaurant. There will be a sweet
shop, like the one in which Marian sipped a strawberry phosphate,
and, yes, a Wells Fargo wagon. ``Paroo's porch will be the gift
shop,'' he added, referring to the home of Marian, her mother and
her little brother with the bad lisp, Winthrop.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea has a bit of Harold Hill-like grandeur about it for
a modest city of 30,000 just off the interstate and midway between
Des Moines and Minneapolis, Miller, a retired college athletic
director, looks askance at skepticism. The plan, he said, calls for
an evocation of the Mason City ethos, a tourist attraction
celebrating ``the goodness of people, the neighborliness of people,
a quality of life that we are losing and people want to get back
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller could be describing the rationale for the Broadway
revival of the ``The Music Man'' itself. Indeed, to spend time in
Willson's Mason City is to begin to feel the convergence of the man
and his musical. The show, his first to make it to Broadway _ the
others were ``The Unsinkable Molly Brown'' (1961) and ``Here's
Love'' (1963) _ is filled with meaningful bits and pieces of his
own life: his participation in a local boys' band, his playing of
the piccolo, his affinity for the music of Sousa, in whose concert
band he performed as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot of him is in `The Music Man,' not the con-man
part but the sincerity,'' Willson's widow, Rosemary, said in a
telephone interview from her home in Southern California. ``This
was his baby. You know, I've had musicians come up to me, even in
the last couple of years, and say, `I worked with Meredith years
ago, and he never changed from the first day I met him.' He was
always the same hometown boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Willson, who had been Willson's secretary and married him in
1968 after the death of his wife, Rini, has maintained contact with
Mason City: she is one of the benefactors of Music Man Square. She
also returns for the annual band festival here, a ritual of spring
that drew Willson himself, even in his final years.
</P>
<P>
   It was music, too, that compelled him to leave Mason City; as a
young man, he moved to New York and enrolled at the Damrosch
Institute, later to be renamed the Juilliard School. At the age of
24, he was made first flutist in the New York Philharmonic and
performed under Arturo Toscanini.
</P>
<P>
   Willson's career eventually led him into television and film. He
was a music director for both ABC and NBC, and he wrote the score
for Charlie Chaplin's satire of fascism, ``The Great Dictator.'' It
was when he was performing on radio as a comedian on ``The Big
Show'' with Tallulah Bankhead that he began to contemplate
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never tried to write a musical comedy, and it didn't
come easy,'' he told an interviewer in 1980, just before the
opening of the City Center revival of ``The Music Man.'' ``I guess
I must have done 30 or 40 full rewrites before I got it right.''
</P>
<P>
   After he became famous, Willson retained his connections to
Mason City; the movie version of the musical even had its premiere
here. But in the years after his death at 82, as ``The Music Man''
faded a bit from memory, the town's musical theater heritage was
pretty much limited to the footbridge named for the composer.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the 1990s, and the intervention of Miller and
his wife, Caralee, that Willson's contributions to the city became
a civic issue. His boyhood home was purchased by the Mason City
Foundation from private owners and the house restored to its 1912
look.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and a group of volunteers lead tours of the Willson
homestead, ``a nice upper-middle-class home'' of the period, as
Miller described it. Musical instruments played by Willson and his
brother Cedric fill the house: like Marian, Willson's mother was a
piano teacher. The foundation even acquired Meredith's baby
blanket; it rests, neatly folded, in his tiny upstairs bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   As dreamily as old-time Broadway producers, the Millers see
far-reaching potential in ``The Music Man'' and Music Man Square,
and they seem to know Willson's characters as intimately as
schoolteachers become acquainted with their students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Harold Hill is a composite of various people he knew
growing up,'' Miller said, so authoritatively you could almost hear
the trombones.

CSUN WIN VS. BRUINS A NET BOOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You just never know when the next
David-defeats-Goliath story will come along, but you know it always
will be compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge's four-game volleyball victory last week
against UCLA deserves closer examination _ not because it was the
Matadors' first victory over the Bruins in eight years but because
so many little things had to happen to make it so. Yet everything
converged just right in the Wooden Center and the Bruins were
felled.
</P>
<P>
   Take a closer look at the fourth game. Northridge trailed 13-5
and 14-9 but rallied for a 16-14 win. Most didn't think it possible
because at that moment, the Matadors were being outplayed in
various facets. Their passing had disappeared, the setting wasn't
clicking with the hitting, and the blocking was suspect.
</P>
<P>
   But then the chain of events began. CSUN middle blocker Adam
Black's quadriceps cramped and he had to come out.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how an injury can make a team play out of its mind.
Suddenly, outside hitter J.P. Jandreau turned into Keyshawn Johnson
(``Give me the damn ball!'') and Ross Horn _ who hardly plays and
converted to middle blocker just a couple of weeks ago _ played
like a veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know we can step it up without one of the
starters,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Jandreau always has been one of CSUN's top attackers, teaming
with Eckhard Walter and Junior Mosones to give the Matadors three
outside-hitting options. Against UCLA, Jandreau had 30 kills, five
more than Walter and Mosones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jandreau never had felt so confident as in that fourth game.
He knew the odds were against his team _ the players were tired,
Black was hurt and this was UCLA _ but he found the energy.
</P>
<P>
   He also knew he was in sync with setter John Baxter, so it made
sense to call for the sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had nothing to lose in the fourth game,'' Jandreau said.
``I knew I was going to kill the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, me and J.P. didn't connect well,'' Baxter said,
``but that last game, he was in the zone. It looked like it and he
was talking like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Horn, meanwhile, was the unlikely hero _ a freshman from Sanger
High who had not set foot in a match since Jan. 19 against La Verne
and was in awe of UCLA (``This is UCLA! These guys are huge!'').
</P>
<P>
   When Black went down, Horn silently urged Black to get up.
Instead, as trainers massaged Black's legs, Horn prepared.
</P>
<P>
   He entered nervously but didn't play like it. The plan never was
to set him, yet Horn succeeded in keeping UCLA's middle on him
instead of Jandreau by shouting loudly and jumping with every set.
</P>
<P>
   When he got the first of three block assists, he was so excited,
he let out a primal scream.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors battled back and won the fourth game 16-14. The
celebration scene resembled a team winning the national
championship _ players shouting and jumping onto each other.
</P>
<P>
   Black's legs prevented him from participating, but he clearly
saw UCLA players with their heads down, angry looks on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   True, there were UCLA factors contributing to CSUN's victory.
UCLA players arrived at the Wooden Center just 50 minutes before
the match's scheduled 7 p.m. start. Plus, the Bruins played without
senior setter Brandon Taliaferro, who had back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   But Northridge made everyone sit up and take notice. USA Today
and Volleyball Magazine put the Matadors _ in spite of their 4-5
record _ 10th in their national polls, up from 15th.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors remain heavy underdogs, but they're no longer dark
horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's automatic respect,'' Jandreau said. ``Overnight, (teams)
come in playing a legitimate team. It's not longer the 15th-ranked
team in the nation, it's the team that beat UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Showdown: Pepperdine's women's basketball team plays its most
important game of the season Friday at 7:30 p.m. against St. Mary's
at Firestone Fieldhouse. The teams are tied atop the West Coast
Conference with 10-2 records. A Waves win, coupled with a victory
Saturday against San Diego, would give Pepperdine the inside track
to the top seed in next month's conference tournament. &QL;

WORLD TRADE PANEL'S RULING ON TAXES IS MAJOR DEFEAT FOR U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States has suffered its largest defeat
ever in a trade battle, losing a dispute with Europe about tax
policies that deals a blow to trans-Atlantic relations and could
force U.S. companies to pay billions of dollars more in taxes each
year.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals panel of the World Trade Organization, the
Geneva-based body that regulates trade, has ruled that the United
States must scrap a law that allows companies to avoid paying taxes
on some overseas sales by channeling them through offshore
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which Clinton administration officials expect to
be announced Thursday by the WTO, orders the United States to
rewrite its tax code by Oct. 1 to eliminate what the decision calls
an illegal export subsidy or face sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has lost trade cases before, but no previous
loss has come close to this one in dollar terms. Last year alone,
hundreds of U.S. companies including Boeing, Microsoft and General
Motors avoided paying about $4 billion in federal taxes under the
provision. Boeing alone used the tax law to save $130 million in
1998, a crucial edge in its competition with Europe's Airbus
Industrie for global aircraft sales.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the unfavorable ruling
would set off a scramble to find ways of preserving the tax breaks.
One option is to alter the tax code to come into compliance with
WTO rules, though it is not clear how that would be done. The
United States will also seek to reach a political settlement with
the European Union, which brought the case in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If settlement talks fail, Washington also has contemplated
filing a counter-suit against what it argues are equivalent
European export subsidies. Retaliation of that kind would further
strain economic ties between the two economic powers at a time when
they are already fighting skirmishes over beef, bananas,
genetically modified goods and aircraft noise. Sharp disagreements
between the United States and Europe were one of the factors that
led to the collapse of global trade talks in Seattle late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules are widely viewed as creating a level playing field
with the European tax system and are important to the business
community,'' said Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers in a
statement Wednesday night. ``We will work closely with our European
counterparts, Congress and the business community to achieve a
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, said she
would work to ensure that the dispute does not derail cooperation
with the European Union on other fronts. ``It's in neither of our
interests to allow this case to damage bilateral relations,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The defeat comes as United States trade policies are being
challenged on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is lobbying Congress to approve trade
agreements with China, Africa and Caribbean nations. Congress will
also vote this spring on whether to renew U.S. membership in the
WTO; some critics of the trade group have accused it of extending
its reach into areas where it does not belong, threatening the
sovereignty of member nations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This could not have come at a worse time for the U.S.,'' said
Peter S. Watson, a trade lawyer and former head of the
International Trade Commission. ``It makes the U.S. a loser in a
major case involving significant financial exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   How much financial exposure is still an open question. While the
administration estimates that the tax breaks could save U.S.
companies as much as $5 billion annually, a WTO panel has yet to
rule on what the total damages might be. In one recent subsidies
case involving Australia, damages were applied retroactively. If
that position is adopted in this case, the European Union could
claim billions of dollars for past damages inflicted by the tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a little publicized tax provision that allows
exporters to channel overseas sales through subsidiaries, called
foreign sales corporations, set up in places like the Virgin
Islands, Barbados and Guam. The United States does not tax sales
made by those subsidiaries, nor does it impose duties when they
transfer profits to their parent companies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that the offshore tax havens clearly violate WTO
rules that prohibit nations from subsidizing exports to make them
more competitive. But the United States has argued that the tax
breaks mirror subsidies the European Union provides to companies
there. Europe forgives value-added taxes on exported goods, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have a pact dating from the early 1980s in which
they agreed not to challenge each other's tax policies, Clinton
administration officials said. The administration contended during
the case that the WTO should not intrude into tax matters covered
by such agreements between nations, but the trade body rejected
that argument.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why the European Union chose to bring the case remains
unclear. European officials have said they believe the
long-standing U.S. tax breaks give U.S. companies an unfair
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials accuse Europe of exploiting U.S.
vulnerability on the tax issue out of spite. Europe was bitter when
Washington used the WTO to pry open European markets for imported
bananas and hormone-treated beef _ decisions that Europe is still
fighting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Members of Congress and industry executives are urging the
administration to find a way to resolve the matter quickly.
Business lobbyists said that if the corporations lost the tax
breaks entirely, they would find themselves at a serious
disadvantage against European competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we absolutely must not do is to unilaterally
disarm,'' said Homer E. Moyer Jr., a Washington lawyer who
represents some companies that employs the tax breaks. ``This cries
out for some kind of political solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggested that one answer would be for the United
States and Europe to swap victories _ European beef and banana
restrictions for United States tax breaks. But the money involved
is of a different magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO has ruled that the beef and banana restrictions cost
U.S. companies several hundred million dollars in lost exports each
year, while the tax ruling involves billions of dollars of export
earnings for United States companies.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials are worried that the dispute could
undermine the already tepid support for the WTO in Congress.
Lawmakers will vote whether to renew the nation's membership this
year. Though the measure has been expected to pass _ the United
States was a founding member of the WTO in 1995 _ opponents now
have fresh ammunition to argue that the organization does more harm
than good.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have argued that WTO judges often overreach in
their rulings, sometimes encroaching on the sovereignty of member
nations. Environmentalists are among the fiercest critics, citing
cases in which the WTO has struck down some environmental
protections. Other opponents have attacked the WTO as the captive
of anti-American groups abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are predisposed against the WTO will use this as a
poster child'' for their claim that it interferes in domestic
politics, Watson said, adding that he disagrees with that
sentiment.

<P>
   Oasis/``Standing on the Shoulder of Giants'' (Epic)
</P>
<P>
   Raise a Guinness in praise of Oasis, who has beaten the odds to
deliver the most satisfying straight-ahead rock album in recent
memory. Many have written this definitive Britpop band off,
especially after 1997's disappointing ``Be Here Now'' and its
collection of mostly forgettable tunes. But with the quintet's
fourth disc, in stores Tuesday, all is forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Oasis has been energized by the addition of two top
players _ rhythm guitarist Gem Archer and ex-Ride bassist Andy Bell
_ along with co-producer and collaborator Mark ``Spike'' Stent,
whose dance-inspired studio technique has been heard on work from
Massive Attack, Bjork, U2 and Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing'' smacks of '60s psychedelia, but not the half-baked
variety cooked up on so many current albums. Standout Noel
Gallagher-penned tracks like the bleary-eyed ``Who Feels Love?''
``Where Did It All Go Wrong?'' and the joyfully caffeinated ``Put
Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is'' (spiced up by soulful backup singers
P.P. Arnold and Linda Lewis) have melodies you can sing in the
shower after just a couple of listenings. Oasis, appearing April 9
at the Universal Amphitheatre, is back. 4 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR;

</P>
<P>
   Kurt Elling/``Live in Chicago'' (Blue Note)
</P>
<P>
   Despite his superb track record of studio work, diehard fans of
jazz singer Kurt Elling have long maintained that you really
haven't experienced the man unless you've seen him in concert.
``Live in Chicago,'' recorded over a three-night span last year at
the Green Mill (Elling's regular Chi-town hangout), is proof that
these people know what they're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   This is a playful album full of great accomplishments, chief
among them Elling's delivery. Whether he's warmly wrapping his
velvety voice around standards like ``For Sentimental Reasons'' and
``Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,'' or scatting with vocalese pioneer Jon
Hendricks on ``Don't Get Scared'' and the appropriate ``Goin' to
Chicago,'' Elling is in full control, a virtuoso who puts jazz
singing squarely in the 21st century. If you can't catch Elling at
the Green Mill on Wednesday nights, this is the next best thing. 3
1/2 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   William Orbit/``Pieces in a Modern Style'' (Maverick)
</P>
<P>
   Techno-ambient master Orbit, the iconoclastic aural architect
behind Madonna's groundbreaking ``Ray of Light'' and her current
``American Pie'' remake, here uses his remarkable digital
virtuosity to break down classical masterworks by Samuel Barber,
Handel, Beethoven, John Cage and others into their molecular
grooves and pulses.
</P>
<P>
   Eschewing an orchestra, the multi-instrumental Brit filters
these pieces through an elegantly chilly sensibility, creating
musical abstracts that assimilate the influences of funk, world
beat, pop and techno, but are perhaps most reminiscent of
Kraftwerk's baroque pop-electronica by way of Pierre Boulez and
Steve Reich.
</P>
<P>
   This technique best lends itself to early-modern pieces like
Cage's ``In a Landscape'' and Erik Satie's ``Ogives Number 1,''
transformed here into a hypnotic soundscape of abruptly shifting
dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Orbit's version of Mascagni's Intermezzo From
``Cavalleria Rusticana'' comes off as overly mannered and fussy. He
also scores with his funky interpretation of Beethoven's ``Triple
Concerto,'' and a surprisingly traditional take on Barber's
``Adagio for Strings,'' which was a recent pop hit on Britain's
Radio One. 3 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Reed Johnson &QR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Susana Baca/``Eco de Sombras'' (Luaka Bop)
</P>
<P>
   Baca first surfaced in the States with a couple of sweet/sad
tracks on the exquisite compilation ``The Soul of Black Peru,''
which limned the little-known Afro-Peruvian sound sprung from the
poor side of Lima. She followed with an eponymous debut and now
this, whose title fittingly translates to ``Echo of Shadows.''
Fittingly, because that term, in its melancholy and quiet romance,
neatly encapsulates the sensibility of this lovely effort.
</P>
<P>
   Put Baca in the class of World Music divas headed by Amalia
Rodrigues and Cesaria Evora, influenced by Iberian and African
sounds, filtered through native and street sensibilities and
blessed with clear, mournful voices that evoke dark passageways,
stolen kisses and star-crossed hearts. Wonderful for that soulful
midnight pondering of fate and dreams. 3 1/2 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ David Bloom &QR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jimmie Dale Gilmore/``One Endless Night'' (Rounder)
</P>
<P>
   Four years after his cosmic cowboy experiment ``Braver Newer
World,'' quirky Texas singer-songwriter Gilmore refines his
disparate influences into a safer but more pleasing package of
mostly covers. Produced and stringed to the gills by the ubiquitous
Buddy Miller, ``Endless'' rocks up country songs (Townes Van
Zandt's ``No Lonesome Tune''), countrifies rock ballads (The
Grateful Dead's ``Ripple'') and gets spacey on Brecht and Weill's
venerable ``Mack the Knife.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cuts, including Gilmore's title composition and
Butch Hancock's lovely ``Banks of the Guadalupe,'' wistfully evoke
the longing for lasting love _ a topic the artist's masticating,
caramel-and-chewing-tobacco vocals are sublimely suited to. 3
stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Bob Strauss &QR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Barron/``Spirit Song'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   Piano master Barron has come up with another wonderful album
that's filled with lyrical beauty, imaginative playing and
interesting explorations. The 56-year-old pianist began the album
with the idea of deviating from standard bebop chord progressions,
and the new direction has clearly invigorated his compositions.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the album is a stunning three-song sequence that
includes the gentle bossa nova ``Um Bejo'' (enriched by violinist
Regina Carter), a glorious rendition of Billy Strayhorn's ``Passion
Flower'' and a joyous version of McCoy Tyner's ``Passion Dance.''
The latter tune features standout playing from saxophonist David
Sanchez, a former student of Barron's who demonstrates that he
learned his lessons well.
</P>
<P>
   Also featured are longtime Barron collaborator Eddie Henderson
on trumpet and guitarist Russell Malone, who guests on three
numbers. Highly recommended. 3 1/2 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ G.W. &QR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Various/``Organ-ized'' (High Street)
</P>
<P>
   This 13-track compilation proves that the Hammond B3 organ is
alive and well. Indeed, organ-led jazz has been enjoying a bit of a
renaissance these days, and ``Organ-ized'' features some of the
instrument's young lions (Larry Goldings, Joey DeFrancesco) along
with the grand master himself, Jimmy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   There is a bit of sameness to some of the modern-style
selections, but the album includes enough variety (fusion, blues,
r&AMP;b) to keep any party movin' and groovin'. 3 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ G.W. &QR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Chandra/``Quiet'' (Narada World)
</P>
<P>
   Chandra _ a fiercely independent singer of Indian descent, who
melds her otherworldly vocal talents, East-meets-West sensibilities
and minimalist accompaniment in often startling intersections of
atmospheric sound _ here reissues one of her oldest solo
recordings, from 1984. This is, indeed, ``quiet'' stuff, wordless
waves of vocalizing laid over spare Western and Indian
instrumentation, hypnotic in an understated way, but without the
driving bliss-trance sounds of more traditional South Asian
artists. She covers some of the same interesting if geographically
indefinable territory as Dead Can Dance's Lisa Gerrard, with
roughly the same admirably high success rate.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Chandra's work has been combined with more
explicitly dance-oriented sounds by others, a fusion that promises
fruitful new avenues for the work of this distinctive artist. 3

NATO COMMANDER MAKES A PLEA FOR MORE PEACEKEEPERS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-POLICE) 
(js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to bolster its military strength
before the combative ethnic factions of northern Kosovo, NATO's
senior commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, appealed Wednesday for up to
1,800 additional troops from NATO countries and said they need to
be dispatched quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that some extra U.S. troops,
beyond the 5,300 already in Kosovo, could be included in the new
contingent that Clark requested.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said Washington was not prepared to extend its
presence beyond the 15 percent to 17 percent of the overall total
of NATO troops in Kosovo that the administration pledged last year.
</P>
<P>
   The French defense minister, Alain Richard, said here Wednesday
that France, whose troops have overall control of the divided city
of Kosovska Mitrovica, would send another battalion, or about 600
troops, to the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark said more troops are needed in Mitrovica beyond the
extra French battalion. He asked for two to three more battalions,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   If U.S. troops were needed they would come from a Marine
Expeditionary Unit, currently in the Mediterranean Sea, Pentagon
officials said. But no decision had been made on the inclusion of
U.S. troops, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The marine unit is part of a multi-national strategic reserve of
troops that some NATO nations agreed last year to set up for Kosovo
in case of the need for reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who made his appeal to the North Atlantic Council, NATO's
decision-making body in Brussels, said he was concerned that some
nations had refused to send their troops, already based in Kosovo,
to Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough troops, and nations have turned down
command requests,'' Clark said in an interview. He did not name the
countries that had turned down requests for their soldiers to go to
the city, which has become a dangerous flashpoint between ethnic
Serbs and Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal to comply with the requests, which came from the
commander of the peacekeepers in Kosovo, Gen. Klaus Reinhardt of
Germany, reflected the lack of enthusiasm among NATO countries for
putting troops into such an unpredictable situation.
</P>
<P>
   Another indication of weariness with the operation in Kosovo was
the drawdown of troops by some countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the council I was concerned about the continuing
drawdown of NATO forces and that we needed more troops,'' Clark
said. He said nations had withdrawn troops from Kosovo because it
was ``expensive and difficult'' to keep them there.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, extra troops, including 350 U.S. soldiers, were
sent to Mitrovica to reinforce the French contingent. Some of the
soldiers were punched by angry Serbs who hurled stones at the
troops as they searched for weapons and were forced to retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo has become a quagmire,'' said one French military
officer. ``Nobody has a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The deteriorating situation in Mitrovica was discussed at a
White House meeting Tuesday that included Secretary of Defense
William Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the
director of central intelligence, George Tenet, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Participants agreed to back Clark's request for more NATO troops
and discussed ways of trying to improve the sullen atmosphere in
Mitrovica, including the training of local police.
</P>
<P>
   But the main conclusion of the meeting was that NATO troops
should ``make a show of force to show you are in control,'' a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica is fast becoming permanently split along ethnic lines,
with Serbs carving out the northern section as a haven. Thousands
of Albanians who fled that area during the war last year, and a
smaller group who fled last week, have been unable to return.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Clinton administration officials have accused the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, of deliberately fomenting
violence in the city in an effort to keep Kosovo unsettled and to
keep northern Mitrovica for Serbs only.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clark said one of the purposes of the extra troops was to make
sure that Mitrovica did not ``harden into permanent cantonment.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall troop strength in Kosovo is well below the
commitments made by countries last summer at the end of the
conflict. Then, a total pledge of 49,000 troops was made from both
NATO and non-NATO nations, according to NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are 30,000 NATO troops in Kosovo, with another 7000
in the bordering countries of Albania and Macedonia. Another 7000
soldiers from non-NATO nations, including Russia, are stationed
inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a continuous thinning out of troops, and it has to
stop,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in troop levels and the continuing failure of the U.N.
to attract funds and personnel for its civilian activities _ such
as rebuilding and staffing schools and hospitals _ have largely
contributed to the continuing problems of Kosovo's struggling
international rule.

TOP TO BOTTOM AND BACK FOR BECK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, there was a brilliant young golfer who shot 59
to equal the lowest round ever in a PGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   It earned him fame, wealth and a still-standing spot in the tour
record book. But what Chip Beck also gained with that 13-under-par
round in the 1991 Las Vegas Invitational was the ability to say
today, with absolute certainty, that he has experienced the best
and the worst of major-league golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real miracle I'm here,'' said Beck, the 1988 Nissan
Open champion who was invited to play that tournament again last
week on a sponsor exemption after missing 47 consecutive cuts from
1997-98, then losing his tour card last year, then flunking
tour-qualifying school.
</P>
<P>
   Now THAT'S a fall. The man who shares the best score in tour
history relying on the kindness of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Happily for Beck, it now appears he has more than sponsor
exemptions _ three already this season _ working for him. A year's
practice with instructor Dr. Jim Suttie has rebuilt Beck's swing,
restored his confidence and rejuvenated his spirit. That and new
clubs _ ``the best equipment I've had since 1991'' _ have him
playing his finest golf in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   He's driving the ball 25 yards longer, putting well enough to
rank No.5 on tour and he tied for 21st in the Buick Invitational
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But that's now. Last year, when he either missed the cut or
withdrew in 17 of his first 20 tournaments while searching for his
swing, Beck was as down as he can remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if I would be back this year,'' he said. ``I
didn't know if I'd get in any tournaments. You're just at the mercy
of people's goodness, really, and you hope you haven't rubbed
people the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be highly unlikely in the case of Beck, who might be
the tour's most cheerful individual _ one who even found a bright
side to his confidence-sapping, near-two-year streak of missed
cuts:
</P>
<P>
   ``I could get home every Friday night and enjoy my family,'' he
said. ``It wasn't all loss.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was also enough downside to last a lifetime. The man
who ranked No.2 in tour earnings in 1988 went from an inability to
hit fairways to a constant struggle to believe in himself to an
endless search to find something or someone to fix his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel every emotion,'' Beck said. ``You feel sorry, you
feel like quitting, you feel you don't have the ability _ you go
through the gamut of experiences where you're trying to figure out
how to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't missing cuts because he wasn't trying,'' said
two-time Nissan Open champion Fred Couples. ``A lot of hard work
has paid off. You can see he's hitting the ball extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how he could hit it any better,'' said Kevin
Sutherland, who played in the same group when Beck got to 8-under
and within five shots of the Buick Invitational lead at one point.
``Every shot he hit was going right down the stick.''
</P>
<P>
   That, after Beck said he went five years in which, ``I hit a
ball out of bounds every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The comeback _ what Beck's caddie, Steve Hulka, calls the
``comebeck'' _ started when Beck hooked up with Suttie 13 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be here without Doc,'' Beck said. ``You learn from
everybody, but I think that he definitively knew what I needed to
do and not many people could tell me definitively what I had to do
and how to go about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It took six months before Beck could see results, but when they
came, he began to improve dramatically off the tee. He made the cut
in eight of his last 10 starts of '99 and thinks he failed Q School
only because he was too tired from all the work he had devoted to
regaining his form.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatically improved swing solved only part of the problems
the still-fit but worn-down and 43-year-old Beck faced in the
no-cut, six-round final stage of that national qualifying
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you're using all the new young tools you had at
one time,'' he said. ``You've got broken-down tools and you're
trying to compete with determination and concentration and the
ability to work smarter.... The kids are getting better and getting
stronger and hitting the ball longer. It's pretty challenging for a
guy my age.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beck, who missed the cut by two strokes at Riviera, believes
his rediscovered ability to hit fairways will bring him back. And
he's grateful for the sponsor exemptions that have helped him to
make his case on the course instead of having to leave the game on
a low note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel blessed,'' he said. ``I know that good things are going
to happen.''

<P>
   ``Reindeer Games'' is one of those big-scheme crime thrillers
that throws a surprising new revelation at the audience every 10
minutes or so. This kind of strategy is always risky since, in most
cases, anyone who's seen a few of these things can predict the
twists with unengaged ease.
</P>
<P>
   That's not this movie's problem. The trouble here is, every plot
complication is so implausible that, after a while, you stop paying
attention and start wondering just how big an idiot the filmmakers
mistook you for.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Affleck is an imprisoned car thief named Rudy who, with two
days left on a five-year sentence, is looking forward to Christmas
parole and dinner with the family. His cellmate Nick (James Frain),
an equally short-timer, has another holiday treat in mind: The
luscious convict groupie he's been pen-palling with for months has
rented a cozy little cabin near the icy Michigan penitentiary,
where the two of them fully intend to jingle all the way into the
new year.
</P>
<P>
   But, as sympathetic buddies in these kinds of things are
intended to do, Nick gets himself killed in a cafeteria brawl the
day prior to his release. When Rudy steps outside the walls and
sees that the anxiously waiting Ashley (Charlize Theron) is even
more beautiful than her pictures, he can't help but say ``Hi, I'm
Nick.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's been five years ...
</P>
<P>
   Still, scumbag.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, after some athletic present-opening, Rudy/Nick
discovers, in a most deservedly unpleasant way, that enjoyably
vulnerable little Ashley has a real nasty brother, Gabriel (Gary
Sinise in a long, black wig composed of petroleum byproducts).
Seems Nick was being set up all the time by Gabriel's mob of
gun-running teamsters, who want to rob a nearby American Indian
casino where Nick used to work. Since he's not Nick, Rudy possesses
little of the inside knowledge the gang wants him to provide, Or
Else. Of course, convincing them that he's not Nick means a
definite Or Else, so Rudy plays along.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ashley really likes Nick, or Rudy, for who he is, or
isn't, and she's only helping Gabriel because he's forcing her to,
or isn't ...
</P>
<P>
   Things get convoluted from there, and we've been asked by the
distributor, a division of Miramax Films, not to give away the
unexpected plot developments. This from the same company that, in a
previous century, brought us ``The Crying Game,'' and has
apparently forgotten when such a request would actually matter.
</P>
<P>
   But we'll play by the rules of this red-nosed ruse, except to
mention the one motif that pretty well sums up the level of
ridiculousness the story inflates to. That would be dead Santas.
Lots of `em.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck gives a pretty good performance as a guy who can't
believe what a ludicrous turn his life has taken _ but then, if
he'd at all read Ehren Kruger's (``Scream 3'') script, he wouldn't
necessarily be acting. Theron's lady of many moods is convincing
when she has to be in a scene-by-scene kind of way, but is defeated
by a characterization that couldn't possibly hold up under extended
scrutiny. Dennis Farina has some funny moments as the dreary
casino's manager, who only wants to get out of this snowy hell and
back to the real world: Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran smart action guy John Frankenheimer directs smoothly,
but with no capacity to bring true tension or narrative sense to
the proceedings. ``Reindeer Games'' lands in one of the red (``Dead
Bang''/``Island of Dr. Moreau'') rather than black (``Manchurian
Candidate''/``Seven Days in May'') slots on Frankenheimer's career
roulette wheel. &QL;

ENRIQUE IGLESIAS HEADS FOR STARDOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAVONNA MAY-MONS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Move over, Ricky Martin. Enrique Iglesias, a 24-year-old Latino
heartthrob with deep musical roots, is ready to take his spot on
the Latin throne. Last summer, his first English-language single,
``Bailamos,'' shot to the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Hot 100 chart.
``Enrique,'' his first English-language album, has spawned a second
hit, ``Rhythm Divine.''
</P>
<P>
   Enrique's fame didn't begin in the United States. Three previous
Spanish-language albums have sold more than 13 million copies since
1995 and produced 12 No. 1 Latin singles. He also had a Grammy and
an American Music Award under his belt before bringing his music to
the States.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique was born May 8, 1975, in Madrid, Spain, to the original
``el rey del latino mundo,'' Julio Iglesias, and model Isabel
Preysler. When Enrique was 3, his parents divorced. When he was 7,
he and his older brother, Julio Jose, moved to Miami to live with
their grandmother. They were cared for by a nanny, Elvira Olivares,
to whom Enrique dedicated his first album. When he decided to
pursue a singing career, it was she who loaned him $5,000 to record
a demo tape.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique didn't want to gain fame based on this father's name, so
he broke into the music scene without it. Without telling his
father, he dropped out of business school in 1994 and tried to
launch his career using the name Enrique Martinez. A year and a
half later, he signed with the Mexican label Fonovisa. That's where
it began. Since then, he has traveled the world, sold millions of
records and recorded songs in several languages, including Italian
and Portuguese. Last year, he landed a six-album, $40 million
record deal with Universal Music Group.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains: Can he outshine Ricky Martin?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why people think I'm following up on Ricky
Martin,'' Enrique recently told ``Entertainment Weekly.'' ``But a
record company won't give you a deal like the one I got if they
think you're nothing more than a one-time, follow-up act.''

 &HT;    Preston King returns to native home
 &HT;    By Colin Campbell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Professor Preston King _ who fled the United States as
a young black graduate student in 1961 rather than go to prison in
a case that even the judge now says was racially loaded _ came home
to America on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His late-afternoon flight from London landed through a layer of
gray clouds that partly obscured the trees below, and soon King was
driven south through the Georgia night toward Albany, where he was
born.
</P>
<P>
   A courteous man, as well as a determined one, his first words
upon stepping from the plane and onto American territory were
pleasantries with the officials who'd come to whisk him off to a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   King, 63, was dressed in the white shirt and silver tie that his
daughter, Oona King, a 32-year-old member of Britain's parliament,
had bought him earlier in the day and insisted he wear for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't like the new clothes, but indulged her _ and perhaps
deferred to her instincts. They proved the right touch for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite the homecoming that I had banked on after 39
years because ...'' King said, his voice choking, ``I am here to
inter my eldest brother Clennon ... So, this is an emotional
occasion and a somewhat sad one.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, President Clinton granted King a full pardon for both
his 40-year-old conviction for refusing to obey his draft board and
the crime of fleeing to avoid jail.
</P>
<P>
   When King ran afoul of the law, he was enrolled at the
prestigious London School of Economics. He said he was willing to
be drafted, but would report for his physical only if members of
his all-white draft board started calling him Mr. King again,
instead of Preston as they started doing when they realized he was
black. The draft board declined to grant him that, and after his
arrest and conviction he decided to leave the country rather than
serve his 18-month sentence or impoverish his father through legal
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The pardon _ which King's family had been seeking diligently
since his daughter began publicizing her father's case in 1998 _
allowed him to return immediately to attend his eldest brother's
funeral, which will be in Albany this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   King will fly back on Saturday to rainy northeast England, where
he teaches political theory at the University of Lancaster. He
expects to return to America periodically and, on May 8, he has
been invited to deliver the commencement address at Fisk
University, his alma mater in Tennessee, which granted him an
honorary degree in absentia last year.
</P>
<P>
   King was accompanied on the nine-hour flight to Atlanta not only
by his daughter, but also by his 30-year-old son Slater, his
lawyer-nephew Chevene King Jr. of Albany, and NBC's Keith Miller
and Carol Grisanti, who've been reporting on King's case since
early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody approves of King's pardon and return. One
passenger on the plane asked a TV cameraman whether King had
apologized for dodging the draft during Vietnam. (In truth, King
was denied his student deferment and ordered to appear for his
physical before the Vietnam War began, during peacetime.)
</P>
<P>
   Several letter-writers to this newspaper have made similar
critical comments about King's actions of 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the original judge in the case, 97-year-old William A.
Bootle, was among those who urged Clinton to pardon King.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bootle's support) indicates a kind of moral courage, which is
unusual...'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   King was tired but cheerful on the long plane ride to Georgia,
and he said he looked forward to smelling the air of his native
country.
</P>
<P>
   His trip this week is focused mainly on the funeral of his
79-year-old brother, Clennon W. King Jr. Preston King is 63, and
was overseas when his mother, father and three other brothers died
and were buried.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to visit the house in Albany where he grew up, to thank
some people personally, and to explain, if necessary, that he
wouldn't have broken the law except that it had seemed required to
make an important point about equality in a racially divided land.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's allowed to travel in the United States whenever he
likes, King wants to attend an occasional academic conference here
and, in general, ``do something useful in the American context.''
He expects to maintain his home in England and to write more when
he retires.
</P>
<P>
   King spoke eloquently and seemed as composed as ever on the
plane and at his news conference, where he thanked Clinton, Bootle,
his daughter and others who'd helped him. He was also witty enough
that he made some listeners forget how long he has been away.
</P>
<P>
   He has taught in Ghana, Kenya and Australia _ like a man without
a country _ as well as in England. He has been abroad through vast
social and political changes in America. And he was young enough
when he left _ and had lived his life far enough from
Statue-of-Liberty images of America's identity, that he never quite
considered himself ``an American'' in the conventional sense. ``I
though of myself as a Southerner,'' King said, before leaving
England.
</P>
<P>
   At his airport news conference, King expanded the thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albany is where I grew up,'' King said. It's what I love: its
pine trees, its forests, its water moccasins, its rattlesnakes, its
reasonably high skies, its very hot summers.''

JUSTICES RULE ELECTION LAW IN HAWAII IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a decision strongly asserting the right to be
free from discrimination at the ballot box, the Supreme Court on
Wednesday struck down as unconstitutional a Hawaii law that allowed
only native Hawaiians to vote for the trustees of a state agency.
</P>
<P>
   In its 7-2 decision, the court said the Constitution expressly
prohibits federal and state governments from refusing to let people
vote because of their race. The court added that the constitutional
provision, found in the 15th Amendment, must be read broadly to bar
voting discrimination based on ancestral background as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii violated the 15th Amendment when it allowed only
Hawaiians who can trace their ancestry on the island to 1778 to
vote for state Office of Hawaiian Affairs trustees, the court
ruled. Other Hawaiians were excluded from the vote solely because
they did not belong to a specific ethnic group, the justices added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ancestral inquiry mandated by the state implicates the
same grave concerns as a classification specifying a particular
race by name,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote in the court's
majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the principal reasons race is treated as a forbidden
classification is that it demeans the dignity and worth of a person
to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own merit and
essential qualities,'' he added. ``An inquiry into ancestral lines
is not consistent with respect based on the unique personality each
of us possesses, a respect the Constitution itself secures in its
concern for persons and citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Rice, a Hawaiian who cannot trace his island ancestry to
1778, challenged the constitutionality of the state law after his
application to vote in the agency's election was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii tried to defend its voting restriction, found in the
state constitution, by arguing that the agency administers benefits
only to those Hawaiians who can trace their ancestry to 1778, when
English explorer Captain Cook landed on the island inhabited by
about 250,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The state also argued that its favoritism of native Hawaiians in
the agency election was analogous to the special treatment the
federal government bestows on Indian tribes as an indigenous
people.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing with the state, the U.S. District Court for Hawaii
threw out Rice's lawsuit. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
agreed, prompting Rice to appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Overturning the lower courts, the justices held that states
cannot discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity on election
day, even if the elected officials would administer an agency that
serves only a segment of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no room under the (15th) Amendment for the concept
that the right to vote in a particular election can be allocated
based on race,'' Kennedy wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Kennedy's opinion were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen G. Breyer, joined by Justice David H. Souter,
wrote a concurring opinion agreeing that Hawaii had failed to
justify its election day exclusion of non-native Hawaiians.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens dissented,
saying that the Hawaii law was justified because native Hawaiians
are, like Indian tribes, an indigenous people entitled to special
governmental treatment.

DID THIS TEACHER GO TOO FAR?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
RIO VISTA, Texas: of the children. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I would think if they were eighth-graders or higher, there
would have been absolutely nothing wrong with this,'' said Peoples,
who is the chairwoman of the black caucus of the Texas State
Teachers Association. ``As a teacher and a black woman, I think
this might have been a little ill-advised. I realized he used the
word to make a point; he probably should have used another word or
another phrase, such as `You inferior people.' You have to consider
the developmental level of the children and be very careful of what
you say.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Peoples said, ``I think a suspension was a little
harsh. I feel if the school board investigates and looks at what he
was intending, they won't give him any severe disciplinary measures
for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Role-playing techniques are common from middle school through
college, said Don Jackson, a cooperating attorney with the American
Civil Liberties Union. Students can be divided by hair or eye color
to show the evils of racism or hunger. For example, he said, to
explain World Hunger Week, students are sometimes divided into
three groups, with some getting a tiny portion of food, some a
medium-size meal and some a large meal.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said, however, that he's never heard of children being
called a racial slur in a role-playing exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Matson did not say he would be using the ``N'' word in his
lesson plan. And that, Jackson said, makes ``a great deal of
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's being disciplined for teaching something outside the
curriculum, that's one thing,'' he said. ``If he teaches something
already approved and he's disciplined, that's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Matson went too far in using the ``N'' word, said Mike Sacken, a
professor of education at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This general approach to role-playing goes back a long way in
teaching the notion of stigma and group disenfranchisement,''
Sacken said. ``But this guy's situated it into the most critical
and fragile social conflict in our nation's history. To me, this
was really bad judgment. When he speaks, he represents the entire
education system. Developmentally, there's some real questions
whether or not the kids could understand what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU will be taking a ``close look'' at the case, said Frank
Colosi, a Fort Worth lawyer and member of the ACLU state legal
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broad picture is that the school district seems to be
imposing a speech code in the middle of a history lesson, and
that's bizarre,'' Colosi said. ``It seems to me that using the `N'
word was done to make a point, and that's the kind of thing that
should certainly be tolerated. If someone gets offended over
history, that's a problem; a classroom is certainly an appropriate
place for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Rio Vista is a bastion of political correctness.
I think there's a distinct possibilility that the motivation is
that the teacher is being frowned upon because of his racial
liberalism. If that's the case, it's political discrimination that
governments are not allowed to practice any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Matson retired from the Navy in February 1997 and teught in
Itasca that fall. He taught there through spring 1999, said Itasca
Superintendent Ray Freeman, who declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Matson wanted to teach in Rio Vista because it was closer to
home; he lives on a family farm five miles from the school.
</P>
<P>
   He is, according to some parents, an excellent teacher. Pam, who
has a child in Matson's class and declined to give her last name,
said Matson is ``not a baby sitter _ and that's harder and harder
to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, she said, was not offended by the lesson or by
``Roots.'' On Saturday, Pam circulated a petition and so far, she
said, 35 parents (not all of the children in Matson's class) have
signed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a great teacher,'' said Charlene Coffman, whose
son Bo, 12, is in one of Matson's classes. ``I'm disappointed. He
provided our kids with some upper-level thought processes. He makes
them think.''
</P>
<P>
   Bo said the lesson the Friday before MLK Day ``showed us what it
was like to be a black person in school. It taught me it was cruel,
and to be nice to everybody and don't let them ever be treated like
that again. `Roots' taught us about how slaves were captured and
became slaves, and what it was like where they lived and how they
were treated on the ships. The nudity wasn't that bad; it was just
in a few parts. I think he should come back and teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Matson said he spoke with an ``older, more experienced'' teacher
before he did the role-playing classes and that she ``thought it
was a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he is especially surprised at the suspension
because after the showing of ``Roots'' he spoke with Miles, and she
did not indicate he was in any sort of trouble, or that a
suspension was in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very nice; she told me she had been getting calls from
the school board,'' he says. ``I explained the lesson and she said,
`I think that's a great lesson. I admire your creativity. It was
poor judgment to use the ``N'' word.' I said, `I won't do it
again.' I told her I wouldn't show `Roots' again.''
</P>
<P>
   The next week, he was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Matson is reading and helping around the house and waiting for
March 9. Pam says that at least two parents, and perhaps as many as
five, will speak in his behalf at the school board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And although Matson says he would not use the ``N'' word again,
he stands by the intent of the lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talked about Dr. King, some kids thought he'd been
president,'' he said. ``Or he freed the slaves. They really don't
know. These kids haven't heard much about civil rights; they didn't
understand what segregation was about.

<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore paused in
their mutual attacks Wednesday to announce proposals for social
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposed a federally financed system of earnings
insurance to compensate workers who take salary cuts as a result of
global trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not have true prosperity until all of our citizens
share in the benefits of our growth,'' he said in an address at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that offered many economic policy positions but few
details, Bradley also accused Gore, his rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination, of advocating the kinds of policies ``that
got us into the Great Depression.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning in Deerfield Beach, Fla., offered a proposal
to cover catastrophic drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's address highlighted a political problem facing the two
Democrats: both are strong advocates of free trade, and both are
trying to win votes from union members and environmentalists who
support sharp restrictions on trade.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bradley did not back away from his support for
expanding global trade, but he argued that the best way to protect
the nation's gains from free trade would be to buffer American
workers from the worst side affects of global competition,
including layoffs and declining wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economic prosperity has been spectacular,'' Bradley said
to more than 400 students, faculty members and supporters, a huge
American flag draped behind him. ``But despite all our success, far
too many Americans are still on the outside looking in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made his remarks as he was preparing to open a weeklong
stand in Washington, which holds a nonbinding primary on Feb. 29.
Seattle was the site of fierce protests against the World Trade
Organization when it met there last year, and opposition to
expanding global trade seems to run strong among many Democratic
voters in that state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's proposal for earnings insurance would partly reimburse
workers who lose employment because of trade agreements and then
are hired into lower paying jobs. The program would compensate such
workers for half their lost wages, up to a maximum of $10,000 a
year, for up to three years. The intention would be to sustain them
while they learned new skills.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a worker who lost a $45,000 a year job and was
rehired by another company for $25,000 would receive $10,000 a year
for three years under the program. The program, which would not
replace unemployment insurance, would cover only workers affected
by new trade agreements, not existing ones. Bradley's aides said
the program would cost $200 million a year and could be paid for
out of the federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign immediately distributed a news release saying
that Bradley had already spent all of the surplus on his other
proposed social programs, particularly his plan for near-universal
health insurance. Bradley's aides contend the total price tag for
his proposals is less than the non-Social Security surplus,
projected to be nearly $2 trillion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said its drug plan would cost $35 billion to
$40 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   For a $44 monthly premium, the plan would have Medicare pay half
of an individual's drug costs up to a $5,000 a year. Poorer
Medicare recipients would pay no premium.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has proposed an optional prescription drug benefit for
Medicare recipients that would have a $500 deductible, $25 monthly
premium and 25 percent co-payment fee.
</P>
<P>
   In New York Wednesday, Bradley said of the Gore proposal: ``It
sounds vaguely familiar. It's my proposal.''

DID THIS TEACHER GO TOO FAR?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO VISTA, Texas _ There is no question that on Friday, Jan. 14,
sixth-grade teacher Mike Matson used the word ``n-----'' in his
four social studies classes at Rio Vista Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are: 1) Was this an appropriate way to teach his
80 or so children _ none of whom is black _ about the evils of
racism and segregation?; and 2) Will it cost the 48-year-old
teacher his job?
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 14 was the last school day before Martin Luther King Jr.
Day. Matson, a retired Navy officer in his first year of teaching
in the tiny North Texas town, wanted to show his 80 or so students
just how ugly racism could be, and the sort of atmosphere King
lived in before the civil rights advances of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   As the children entered his classroom, they saw the legend
``1950s America'' on the room's dry-erase board. Also on the board
were the word ``White'' and an arrow pointing to the front of the
room, the word black ``Black'' and an arrow to the back. The girls
went to the front, the boys to the back, and Matson did some
role-playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, `You n-----, be quiet,' or if a girl was concerned
about the boys I'd say, `You're nothing but a n-----lover.' I
played this out for 10 or 15 minutes. It was just to add realism. I
wanted them to see what it felt like to be called something that
cut directly to the bone and was the most hateful thing you could
be called.''
</P>
<P>
   Matson says that he used the word no more than three times per
class, and that the role-playing also included a girl portraying
Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat on a city bus and a boy
portraying a black man trying to register to vote.
</P>
<P>
   He taught them about the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott, about
how hard it was to get a good job if you were black in the '50s,
and he told them about the ``moral courage'' of King.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a boy tried to get a drink at the water fountain outside
the room, I'd say, `You can't get a drink there,' '' he says. ``In
the first period, some girls cried and I said, `You're right _ I
shouldn't be doing this.' I was gratified _ I was trying to get an
emotional reaction. It was a simulation, and they learned about a
great American.''
</P>
<P>
   The next week, on Tuesday and Wednesday, he showed the first 90
minutes or so of the TV series ``Roots'' to show African culture
and to emphasize the brutality of the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   The portion the students saw, he says, did contain some brief
shots of topless women. But he felt that the pluses, and what the
children learned about the evils of slavery, were far more
important, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rio Vista school Superintendent Sharron Miles
suspended Matson with pay. He is out of class pending a March 9
school board meeting that will determine whether he can teach the
rest of the year and whether his contract will be renewed for the
2000-2001 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Miles declines to comment, saying she ``can't discuss personnel
issues with the media.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The information about this came to me from a school board
member who had been contacted by parents,'' Miles said. ``I was
asked to investigate. I talked to parents who had concerns and
several parents who haven't had concerns. I will make my
recommendation, but ultimately it's the board's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Rio Vista school board President Mike Elmore also declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at liberty to talk about it; I don't know any of the
details,'' he says, adding that ``numerous'' displeased parents
brought the lesson and the showing of ``Roots'' to his attention.
``We're looking forward to having all this present in open session;
there's a lot of rumors and innuendoes in the community. It will be
nice to know what the facts are.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident has become a cause celebre in this little community
where the last U.S. census (in 1990) recorded no African-Americans
among the 541 residents, according to the North Central Texas
Council of Governments.
</P>
<P>
   It has led to at least one pro-Matson petition and some very
hard feelings among parents; an argument between parents at Little
League basketball games at the school Saturday, one says, almost
came to blows.
</P>
<P>
   If Matson and some of the parents who want him back are to be
believed, there's a feeling among teachers that if they make ``one
little mistake,'' as one parent put it, they may face unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Shaw, executive director of the United Educators
Association, says he has never heard of a similar case.
</P>
<P>
   Matson, he says, has very little recourse; Texas teachers are on
probation for their first two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think kids are ever too young to learn about
discrimination,'' Shaw says, ``but I would not have advised him to
do this, because I know the retaliation that comes when teachers
take chances like this. I would have told him, `This will not be
understood, and you will put your job in jeopardy, right or wrong.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth middle school teacher Rubidel Peoples said that what
Matson did was not appropriate considering the age of the children.

 By DAVID BARSTOW with FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With two more primary victories under his belt, Sen.
John McCain campaigned across the Pacific Northwest on Wednesday
with restored confidence, proclaiming himself a ``proud pro-life
conservative Republican'' yet continuing his appeals to Democrats,
Independents, young people and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party of Abraham Lincoln,'' he told a group of college
students today, ``is a party of addition, and not division.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off victories in Michigan and Arizona, McCain repeatedly
aimed his campaign appeals at two distinct fronts during a series
of events across Washington state, one of three states that will
hold Republican primaries next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about his weak support among conservative voters, he
underscored his commitment to cherished Republican positions _
reducing government spending, opposing abortion, strengthening the
military.
</P>
<P>
   But delighted with his backing from Democrats and independents,
he reminded large, enthusiastic audiences of his terrifying
experiences as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, of his determination
to end ``corporate welfare,'' of his ``crusade'' to show young
people that public service is an honorable undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about this victory yesterday,'' he told
several hundred people at Gonzaga University in Spokane, ``was we
have proved _ I hope to my Republican friends, and I believe to
most Americans _ that we can reassemble a coalition, a coalition
that reaches out across party lines, preserving our core with
conservative Republican principles and yet attracting to our banner
people who are Independents, people who are Democrats,
Libertarians, vegetarians.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gov. George W. Bush reached out to a wider
audience than he normally does, visiting a privately funded social
service center that helps provide food, clothing and education
assistance to people in inner-city Los Angeles. The Dream Center,
as it is called, is a model for Bush's efforts to encourage
private, faith-based involvement in social services.
</P>
<P>
   He later held a news conference in which he belittled McCain's
appeal during his victory speech for Republicans to support his
insurgent campaign. ``I was amazed last night to hear my opponent
is reaching out to Republicans,'' he said. `It's an amazing
admission to make.''
</P>
<P>
   He also blamed the ``liberal Democratic vote'' for his 6-point
loss in Michigan and suggested that the Democrats who voted for
McCain had tried to ``hijack the primary to help Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't anticipate that nearly 20 percent of the Republican
primary would be made up of, in many cases, liberal Democrats,'' he
said. ``I don't think anybody did. The only thing we need to do is
rally our base and rally our support.''
</P>
<P>
   During his speeches on Wednesday, McCain largely avoided mention
of Bush, instead aiming his fire at President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, just as Bush did after winning the South
Carolina primary on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews with reporters, McCain and his aides attempted
to pin Bush to the terrain of the far right. Rarely did they utter
Bush's name without mentioning his support from social
conservatives like Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, or Bush's
controversial campaign appearance at Bob Jones University in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain left open the possibility that his campaign would
continue to place phone calls telling Catholic voters that Bob
Jones has made a series of anti-Catholic remarks. On Tuesday, as
voters cast ballots in Michigan, Bush complained bitterly that
people were receiving such calls, but the McCain campaign denied
any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Only late in the day, did the McCain campaign acknowledge making
them, a point Bush made on Wednesday. ``They admitted they were
making those calls,'' he said. ``I don't accept that kind of
campaign. And I don't appreciate it one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain has repeatedly promised not to run negative
advertisements, he defended the phone calls on Wednesday speaking
to reporters on his campaign plane. ``That was an accurate phone
call,'' he said, jabbing the air for emphasis. ``I didn't call
anybody a bigot.'' That comment referred to phone calls that the
Rev. Pat Robertson, a Bush supporter, made to voters in Michigan,
in which he characterized Warren Rudman, a McCain supporter, as a
``vicious bigot.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet just below the swagger, there was a palpable sense of relief
in the McCain campaign. The magnitude of the loss in South Carolina
last week had been stomach-churning, aides said, and Michigan had
been viewed as a must-win state, which perhaps explains McCain'sreaction upon hearing himself declared the victor of Michigan
on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain flew first to Spokane and then to Seattle riding a crest
of new enthusiasm and campaign contributions over the Internet. In
Spokane, several hundred people stood outside of the Gonzaga
student union because it was packed to capacity. When McCain waded
though the crowd, people surged toward him, seeking his handshake
or his autograph on campaign signs, books, newspapers, T-shirts
and, inexplicably, a volume of Washington state statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, McCain continued to stake out the center right. He
reiterated his support of the death penalty, but also said Gov.
George Ryan of Illinois was justified in declaring a moratorium on
executions after 13 Death Row inmates there were cleared of murder.
He spoke out in favor of charter schools and school vouchers, yet
promised he would finance such measures by cutting ``corporate
pork'' rather than reducing money for public schools.
</P>
<P>
   McCain strategists said on Wednesday that one key to shoring up
support from Republicans will be to forcefully remind voters
McCain's conservative voting record on a wide range of economic and
social issues. ``We have to do a better job of connecting the dots,
and we will,'' said John Weaver, a senior strategist for McCain.
``We have to remind Republicans of John McCain's life history, his
record, his ties to Reagan.''

NEW COLLEGE STICKER SHOCK: JUNIOR'S CREDIT CARD BILL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents who thought they had planned enough, saved enough and
struggled enough to see their children through college are
confronting a challenge they never anticipated: What to do when
junior comes home one weekend and announces that he is deep in debt
on credit cards they didn't even know he had?
</P>
<P>
   As credit cards have become increasingly available on campus,
some students are piling up the sorts of debts that only their
parents can pay. Financial experts recommend that, before their
children even leave for college, parents train them in the
responsible use of credit. Some universities are offering such
advice, and some have banned credit card issuers from their
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Student debts are growing. A survey by the New England Education
Loan Marketing Association, or Nellie Mae, a nonprofit provider of
student loans, found that 35 percent of recent graduates who were
repaying Nellie Mae loans had other debt payments, unrelated to
their education, of more than $1,000 a month, up from 10 percent in
1991. Educators fear that such multilayered debt is endangering
students' credit ratings and thus their ability to rent apartments
or finance cars once they enter the work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way plastic has been used has changed over the last 20
years,'' said Colin D. Riley, a spokesman for Boston University.
``It used to be for emergencies. Now, they're using them for
virtually everything, from clothes to CD's.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin N. Murray, 24, of Wynantskill, N.Y., had five credit
cards by the time she graduated last year from the State University
of New York at Oswego. She left school with $3,000 in credit card
debt and $22,000 in student loans. Most of her card debt, she said,
came from cash advances for expenses including entertainment,
clothes and CD's. ``If I didn't have the cash I'd just go to the
A.T.M.,'' she said. ``I was clueless about credit cards. I thought
I would pay them off little by little, but I was spending more than
I was making.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Murray, 51, Kristin's mother, said she had warned her
daughter about the cards. ``I said: `Kristin, this isn't a very
good thing to get into. You have to pay for this stuff.' She said,
`I know, I know, I have money.''' Her mother helped Kristin make a
few payments but knew it was best for her daughter to work out the
problem herself. Kristin has since been in touch with the card
companies to arrange a payment schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Some students, and some personal finance experts, say card
issuers are marketing too aggressively on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Patrick, 32, a graduate student at Columbia University,
said she received her first credit card at the University of Rhode
Island. ``I was like `woo-hoo,''' she said. ``I used it to visit a
friend in California during spring break.'' By the time she
graduated, she was about $1,400 in debt. ``It was just ignorance,''
she said. ``Even though I had a job I couldn't meet my expenses and
pay off the cards. If you fall one month behind, it takes three
months to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Patrick said card issuers solicited constantly on campus.
``To make matters worse, there would also be vendors coming into
the student union selling clothing and jewelry,'' she said. ``So on
one side was Visa and on the other were vendors with these cool
things. My weakness was jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   Nellie Mae found that 60 percent of college students surveyed in
1998 and 1999 had credit cards, and that 21 percent had more than
four. Their average credit card debt was $1,843, and 5 percent had
debt of more than $7,000. Card issuers say that they are providing
a service that students want, and that they try to educate them
about using cards wisely. ``They are an active force of the
marketplace and they deserve to have the same services and offers
as everybody else,'' said Catherine Pulley, a spokeswoman for the
American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents, like Heather R. Zimmerman's, have found that the
best answer is to lend the money to pay off the debt, then be
repaid later. Ms. Zimmerman, 29, of Dallas had two cards at the
University of Arkansas. One day at a jewelry store, she used a card
to buy a $4,500 Rolex watch. ``I really wanted the watch,'' she
said. ``I had never had debt until I was Miss Smartypants and
decided to get that watch.''
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't make the payments and eventually turned to her
parents. ``She wanted all the accouterments of keeping up with her
peers,'' said her mother, Glenda D. Kemple. ``The problem was she
didn't have enough income to make the minimum payments.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents made her sell the watch and lent her money to clear
the credit card, having her make monthly payments until the debt
was paid off. She finished paying by the time she graduated. ``She
had an adult problem, so we treated her as an adult,'' Ms. Kemple
said. ``It was probably the smartest parenting that we've ever
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Some schools say there is little they can do to defend students
against credit card issuers wanting to seize an attractive market.
``College students have been in a sense kind of screened,'' said
Joseph Russo, the director of financial aid at the University of
Notre Dame. ``They have more education, and to follow, more
success, higher salaries, more money. It's a free market. and there
is nothing we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some schools, like Boston College and Northeastern University,
do not allow card companies on campus. ``We do it because
18-year-olds are a very vulnerable market,'' said Terry Yanulavich,
director of public relations at Northeastern. ``Our purpose is not
to provide a market for organizations selling services that
students don't need.'' Students, however, can still obtain cards
through mail and phone offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools will counsel students who have gotten into trouble
with their credit cards, and some try to teach students how to
handle debt even before classes start. Boston University makes
incoming freshmen attend a seminar on the use of credit cards.
``The message isn't that credit cards are bad,'' said Mr. Riley,
the university spokesman. ``It's that they need to understand how
to use them and their responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial experts say parents should be the most important
source of financial guidance. Amy Cole, regional coordinator of
education at the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Southern New
England in Boston, said parents should share their own financial
experiences, even the bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those examples will have some meaning for their children and
they will respect their parents' honesty,'' she said. ``You need to
show them there are choices. If you want those $100 sneakers, what
will you have to give up to get them? The experience shows them how
money works. It just doesn't pop out of an A.T.M. machine.''
</P>
<P>
   If students get into credit card trouble, she said, parents
should sit down with them to see where the money is going, set
budgets and, if the students can pay off the debts themselves, let
them. Because many students want to make only the minimum payments,
parents should show them how long it would take to pay off the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Saunders, vice president of public affairs at the Nellie
Mae Foundation in Braintree, Mass., says this process takes time.
``All of that financial stuff is incremental,'' she said. ``If we
are letting kids learn about credit cards after they have one, then
they are learning the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Patrick now understands the risks. She got rid of all her
credit cards. As she was doing an interview for this article, a
call came into her other line. It was a credit card telemarketer.
What did she tell him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him, `Please put me on your don't-call list,''' she
said. &QL;

 &HT;    Atlanta lawyers sue U.N. over 2 Rwanda deaths
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An Atlanta law firm is pursuing an unprecedented legal
action against the United Nations for withdrawing its protection of
two Rwandan government officials and allowing them to be killed in
the 1994 genocide that ultimately claimed 800,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Middleton, Mathis, Adams &AMP; Tate is representing survivors of
Landoald Ndasingwa, the Rwandan minister of Labor and Social
Affairs, and Joseph Kavaruganda, the chief justice of the Rwandan
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is working with the help of Michael Hourigan, an
Australian lawyer who worked as a U.N. investigator looking into
the Rwandan genocide, and then quit, partly because he was dismayed
by what his investigation revealed about U.N. actions. Hourigan has
moved to Atlanta to work with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents discovered by Hourigan's investigators was a
memorandum showing that UNAMIR _ the United Nations Assistance
Mission for Rwanda _ was informed nearly two months before the
start of the genocide that Ndasingwa and Kavaruganda faced a
``serious threat'' of being killed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hourigan, U.N. officials never notified the men of
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Had Ndasingwa been told that he had been targeted to be killed _
and had he known that his U.N. protection was just an illusion _ he
would have acted accordingly, said his sister, Louise Mushikiwabo,
who lives in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know for a fact that his family would have left the
country,'' Mushikiwabo said. ``At least his children would be alive
today.''
</P>
<P>
   A three-man ``independent inquiry'' into the U.N.'s actions
during the genocide issued a report in December that found ``a
failure by UNAMIR troops to guarantee the protection of these
political personalities that had been assured and expected.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was head of U.N.
peacekeeping operations at the time, ``has endorsed the report
wholeheartedly,'' said Farhan Haq, a U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kofi Annan said that he felt deep remorse about what happened
in Rwanda, and he said the U.N. would take responsibility,'' Haq
said. But Haq said also that, ``as a general rule, the United
Nations cannot be sued for its official actions.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 18, lawyers Hourigan and Richard Middleton Jr.,
president of the American Trial Lawyers Association, sent Annan a
letter outlining the claims made by the families of Ndasingwa and
Kavaruganda that they deserve reparations. No amount was specified.
</P>
<P>
   Haq said the U.N. mailed a response several days ago. ``While it
expressed sympathy for the case of the two women, it denied that
they had a legal claim,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hourigan said Wednesday he had not yet received the letter, but
it is by no means the end of the matter. ``This is, I guess, the
first salvo,'' he said. ``We'll press on.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. peacekeeping efforts in Rwanda _ a Maryland-sized
country of 8 million in Central Africa _ began in August 1993, when
the government of Rwanda reached a peace agreement with a rebel
group called the Rwandese Patriotic Front.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic tensions between the majority Hutus, who have
historically been cultivators and poorer members of Rwandan
society, and the minority Tutsis, who have historically been
wealthier herders, had been building for decades. The government
was dominated by Hutus, the Rwandese Patriotic Front by Tutsis in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, signed Aug. 4, 1993, in Arusha, Tanzania, called
on the United Nations to help implement the accords during a
22-month transition to an elected government and the integration of
the two opposing armies.
</P>
<P>
   The accords were vehemently opposed by hard-line Hutus, some of
whom operated within the government. Both Ndasingwa, a moderate
Tutsi, and Kavaruganda, a moderate Hutu, were members of the new
transitional government that was supposed to be set up under the
accords.
</P>
<P>
   But things started going badly soon after the agreements were
signed. By Jan. 11, 1994, the commander of the U.N. peacekeeping
forces in Rwanda, Brig. Gen. Romeo Dallaire of Canada, sent a cable
to U.N. headquarters in New York. The cable, which was shown to
Annan, warned of two plans: one to kill Belgian peacekeepers to
prompt the international force to withdraw from Rwanda; the other
to exterminate the Tutsi population.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials denied Dallaire permission to intervene and seize
caches of arms.
</P>
<P>
   But in late 1993 and early 1994, as the situation deteriorated,
both Ndasingwa and Kavaruganda were given round-the-clock
protection at their homes by U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the evening of April 6, 1994, a plane carrying the
president of Rwanda, Juvenal Habyarimana, and the president of
Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira, was shot down as it approached the
airport in Kigali, Rwanda's capital. There has been published
speculation that the coup was launched by hard-liners within
Habyarimana's Hutu-dominated government who feared that the
president was not tough enough on Tutsis and who wanted an excuse
to begin the campaign of extermination.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the genocide, obviously well-planned, was under
way.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, according to testimony given by
Ndasingwa's night watchman to the independent inquiry, a policeman
told Ndasingwa that members of the Presidential Guard _ a cadre of
elite Rwandan soldiers _ were on their way to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Then about 20 members of the President Guard arrived. The U.N.
soldiers guarding Ndasingwa abandoned the area, leaving through a
gap in the fence.
</P>
<P>
   A guardsman knocked at the door. Ndasingwa gave the man money
and pleaded for his life. The guardsmen entered and found
Ndasingwa's daughter, Malaika, 17, hiding in a closet. They
gathered the family in the living room and killed Ndasingwa; his
Canadian wife, Helen; his son, Patrick, 15; and Malaika.
</P>
<P>
   That same morning, similar events were unfolding at
Kavaruganda's house. At 5 a.m., the family awoke to machine gun
fire, according to Kavaruganda's wife, Anonciata.
</P>
<P>
   Kavaruganda told his two teen-age daughters to hide in their
bathroom. He and his wife hid in the master bath.
</P>
<P>
   Kavaruganda looked out a window, saw one of the U.N. soldiers
who was guarding the family and asked what was going on. The
soldier told Kavaruganda that members of the Rwandan army were
looking for him, according to Anonciata Kavaruganda's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they are looking for me,'' Kavaruganda replied. ``They
want to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kavaruganda tried to lock the soldiers out. But the Rwandan
troops broke into the house and found his daughter Judith hiding in
the her bathroom. They put a gun to her head and ordered her to
show them where her parents were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, father, open the door because they are going to kill
me,'' she called.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. soldiers neither fled nor offered resistance; instead
they told Kavaruganda that he would have to leave with the Rwandan
soldiers. The judge asked permission to get dressed, but was told
he wouldn't be needing his clothes. He has not been seen since and
is presumed to have been slain.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. soldiers remained in Kavaruganda's house, watching,
socializing and drinking as Rwandan soldiers beat and threatened
his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, April 7, 10 Belgian peacekeepers were killed. On
April 13, Belgium announced it was withdrawing from the
peacekeeping force. The United States followed by telling the
Security Council that UNAMIR had no further role in Rwanda because
there was no cease-fire to monitor. On April 21, the United
Nations, still scarred by the failure of its peacekeeping effort in
Somalia, reduced its force from 2,500 troops to a token 270.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 100 days, an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate
Hutus were murdered, many of them butchered with machetes. The
killing ended when the Tutsi rebel forces took power.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly seven years since, the effects of the genocide _
termed by the independent inquiry ``one of the most abhorrent
events'' of the 20th century _ have reverberated through Central
Africa. The most notable repercussions have been in Congo, which
Tutsi-led governments in Rwanda and Burundi have invaded to drive
out Hutu rebels, touching off a multinational conflict that has
been called ``Africa's First World War.''
</P>
<P>
   And a year ago, Rwandan Hutu rebels _ among those driven out of
the country in 1994 _ killed eight tourists, including two
Americans, at a gorilla sanctuary in Uganda, severely depressing
that country's tourist revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The legal case against the United Nations for its failures in
Rwanda began as a byproduct of a meeting called by U.S. Rep.
Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.). McKinney visited Rwanda in 1997. She was
deeply moved, she said, by a genocide memorial at a school in
Gikongoro, where Rwandan authorities have laid out the bodies of
tens of thousands of victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw skulls,'' McKinney said. ``I saw bodies frozen in
defensive positions. ... This became sort of like the missing part
of me. ... Nobody forgets. When you see those bodies, and they're
like this, covering infant bodies _ the depravity of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   After she returned to Washington, McKinney and another member of
Congress held hearings on the genocide. Meanwhile, Hourigan, who
had returned to Australia, wound up helping the British
Broadcasting Corp. produce stories on the matter. Through that, he
heard of McKinney's work on the issue and her need for information.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, McKinney called a meeting at which Hourigan and some
Rwandan activists, including Louise Mushikiwabo, were present.
Hourigan showed Mushikiwabo the internal memo showing the United
Nations had known her brother was targeted to be killed. She was
shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' Mushikiwabo said. ``It's a moment I'll never
forget. Not that I had any special trust in the U.N. To me, what
was shocking was not so much not protecting my brother, but the
fact that they were in possession of that information a month and a
half before, and they did not share that information.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not entirely clear under what authority the United Nations
might be sued. Hourigan mentioned the possibility of suing under
U.S. law or alleging a breach of a law passed by the United Nations
itself. The law firm, he said, plans to pursue every political and
legal means available.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are international principles on genocide and crimes
against humanity,'' he said. ``But at the moment, the only two
statutes we have is the Yugoslavia war crimes statute and the
Rwanda statute. So this allegation is a breach of the Rwanda
statute.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the question goes far beyond reparations for the
families.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the United Nations has been accused of
complicity in genocide, he said. The families want to make certain
that the pledge the world made in 1945 _ ``Never again'' _ really
means never again.

 McSORLEY BANNED FROM HOCKEY FOR REST OF SEASON  
(ART ADV: A graphic is being sent. Non-subscribers can purchase by
calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.)  By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marty McSorley of the Boston Bruins on Wednesday received the
longest suspension in National Hockey League history for an on-ice
incident. As punishment for his stick attack against Donald
Brashear of the Vancouver Canucks, McSorley was suspended for the
final 23 games of the regular season and also for the post-season
playoffs if his team qualifies for them. He will forfeit $72,000 in
salary.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McSorley will not be re-instated for next season
until he meets with and gets approval from Commissioner Gary
Bettman. Part of the decision then, league officials said, will be
based on Brashear's recovery. Brashear suffered a Grade 3
concussion, the most serious kind, when McSorely struck him on the
right side of the head near the end of Monday night's Canucks'
victory in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The team originally said Brashear would need 14 to 21 days of
rest before he can be evaluated, but Brian Burke, the general
manager, said Wednesday that Brashear might be idle even longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Donald does well, it's looking like four to six weeks
before he can return,'' Burke said. ``And four weeks would be
miraculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The longest suspension in league history for an on-ice
infraction was for 21 games against Dale Hunter of the Washington
Capitals, who injured Pierre Turgeon of the Islanders in 1993 with
a check after a goal that caused a serious shoulder injury. No
stick was involved in that hit. The longest previous suspension for
a stick foul was 15 games, given to three players in three
different incidents. Players have been suspended for longer periods
for drug violations away from the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Brashear was unconscious and bleeding after McSorley hit him
with the stick, on the right temple. Brashear lost his helmet and
the back of his head banged against the ice. Brashear, his neck in
a brace, was carried away on a stretcher but was revived in a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Quoted by the newspaper The Vancouver Province Wednesday,
Brashear said: ``It looked worse than it was. It looked like I was
dying. I wasn't dying. But it's a concussion.'' A team spokesman
said Brashear is suffering from headaches and has a swollen face.
He is resting at home.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual development, McSorley refused to participate in
the hearing at league headquarters in New York. NHL officials said
he abstained on the advice of his lawyer because Vancouver police
are investigating the incident with the possibility of recommending
assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley, through his lawyer, his agents and the National Hockey
League Players Association, requested that the disciplinary hearing
be delayed for 48 hours. The league refused the request, so
McSorley was represented at the hearing by one of his agents. His
lawyer and one from the union also participated via telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was announced by Colin Campbell, executive
vice-president and director of hockey operations for the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a player in a game strike another player like
that from behind,'' Campbell said, in a news conference via
telephone. ``You can't do this. You can't strike a another player
with a stick, particularly to the head. When you do, the
repercussions will be severe.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vancouver, a police spokesman said the investigation is
continuing but that no recommendation on charges is expected before
next week. ``The investigators are looking at video and they have
been talking with the Vancouver Canucks as well as the NHL,'' said
Janice Williams, media liason assistant for the city police
department. ``Both have been extremely co-operative. Once the
investigators complete their report, it will be submitted to Crown
prosecutors with recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, the general manager of the Canucks, said: ``Everyone in
the league would like to operate where the police are not involved.
But it's not our place to tell the Vancouver police what they can
or cannot investigate. So we're going to co-operate fully with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to McSorley's agents, Michael Barnett and J.P. Barry, were
not returned. The NHLPA released a short statement that said: ``In
light of the wide range of issues surrounding this matter, we don't
feel it is appropriate to discuss it at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The only formal appeal process for McSorley, according to the
league, is a hearing before Bettman. A union spokesman, Tim
Wharnsby, declined to discuss speculation that McSorley and the
NHLPA would consider filing a grievance before an outside
arbitrator with the contention that McSorley was not given enough
time to prepare for his hearing at league headquarters. McSorley
traveled from Vancouver to Boston on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell and William Daly, the league's chief lawyer, discussed
the incident in a wide-ranging conversation with reporters.
Referring to the damage to the sport's image _ with the incident
replayed constantly this week on television _ Campbell said: ``It's
an isolated incident. It certainly isn't a reflection of our game.
This is not how we want hockey portrayed. We can't undo this.
Hopefully people understand it. Marty McSorley did something that
was very unacceptable and he is paying the price.''
</P>
<P>
   McSorely and Brashear had fought earlier in the game, with
Brashear prevailing. Both are among the largest athletes in the
league and are frequent fighters. Later in the game, Brashear
turned down an invitation from McSorley to fight again, even after
McSorley slashed and roughed him.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, Boston goalie Byron Dafoe left the game
with a leg injury after Brashear fell into him. With Vancouver
leading by three goals in the final minute of the game, some
wondered why the coaches, Pat Burns of Boston and Mark Crawford of
Vancouver, would have those two players on the ice. Campbell
exonerated the coaches and said fighting is part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're ready to tar and feather the coaches,''
said Campbell, who coached the Rangers from 1994 through 1998.
``There have been fights in hockey forever. And we haven't got to
the point where we say they should be illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that this incident was not common, even for hockey
combat. ``To be hit by a stick from behind, it's just not
acceptable,'' Campbell said. ``The suspension reflects that.''

MEMO TO UCLA: PICK UP THE PACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA Bruins aren't playing an NCAA Tournament
elimination game tonight against Oregon, but they'd be wise to take
that approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins must win five of their last six to reach the
18-victory plateau that probably would secure an at-large berth. If
they lose tonight, they'll have to win at Stanford next week to
maintain an 18-win pace _ and Maples Pavilion is the last place
they want to visit in a must-win game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be tough, but you never look at a game in the future
and plan on losing,'' UCLA forward Jason Kapono said. ``We've got
four of six at home and that should help us.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins (13-11, 4-8) defeat the Oregon and Washington
schools at home and beat Cal on the road, they'll have 18 wins
regardless of what happens in Maples.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to beat Oregon and then worry about Stanford later,''
guard Billy Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Duck, Duck, break: It doesn't have the best athletes in the
conference, but Oregon probably has the best fast break. For the
Bruins to survive tonight, they must slow Ducks point guard Darius
Wright and his wing men, Freddie Jones and Alex Scales.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can get the ball out of the net and down the floor,''
UCLA coach Steve Lavin said. ``Their initial offensive thrust is
the toughest to defend in the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Point killers: UCLA has enough problems, but none are more
debilitating than turnovers and missed free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins lead the Pac-10 in field-goal percentage (47.8), but
it's wasted because they're last in free-throw percentage (55.5)
and last in turnovers per game (17.8).
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember a team since I've been here that had so many
deflating plays,'' Lavin said. ``It's the equivalent of a football
defense constantly being on the field because the offense keeps
turning the ball over. . . . We never get any momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   __ By the numbers: The Bruins are 38th in the latest RPI power
rankings and 42nd in the latest Sagarin ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Ray Young is shooting 27.7 percent and averaging 3.3
points in his last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jerome Moiso has scored 20 points in the last three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, which beat the Bruins 73-58 in Eugene four weeks ago,
hasn't swept UCLA since 1984.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maurine Brown Neuberger, an Oregon teacher who became the third
woman elected to the U.S. Senate and was an early consumer
advocate, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Portland, her
hometown. She was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Neuberger, a Democrat, served in the Senate from 1961 until
January 1967. She was expected to run for re-election in 1966 but
decided against it, mainly, she said, because of the amount of
money she would have to raise to campaign; she estimated it would
cost ``well over $250,000.''
</P>
<P>
   When Neuberger entered the Senate, her only female colleague was
Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, a Republican who was elected to the
Senate in 1948 and served until 1973. (The first woman to serve in
the Senate was Hattie Wyatt Caraway, an Arkansas Democrat who was
appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband,
Thaddeus, in 1931; she subsequently won a special election in 1932
and was re-elected twice, serving until 1945.)
</P>
<P>
   Neuberger was the widow of Sen. Richard L. Neuberger, who died
in 1960, but she was not appointed to fill his unexpired term.
Instead, she ran in the general election and won, saying she would
follow her husband's path as a liberal Democrat but with a mind of
her own.
</P>
<P>
   She devoted much of her efforts to consumer issues. She
sponsored one of the first bills to mandate health-warning labels
on cigarette packages and wrote a book highly critical of the
tobacco industry, ``Smoke Screen: Tobacco and the Public Welfare''
(1963).
</P>
<P>
   She urged pollution controls for automobiles years before
meaningful action was taken. Cosmetic manufacturers drew her scorn
for charging buyers more for fancy packaging and advertising than
for the product itself; she herself did with just a touch of
lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``No industry I know of has ever been able to regulate itself to
the interest of the consumer public,'' Neuberger declared.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Senate, Neuberger taught American government
at Boston University and Radcliffe College for two years before
returning to Oregon. There she tutored Portland elementary school
pupils in reading and arithmetic until she was well into her 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Maurine Brown was born on Jan. 9, 1907, in Cloverdale, Ore.,
into a family of pioneers. She studied at the Oregon College of
Education and graduated from the University of Oregon in 1929.
After taking graduate courses at the University of California at
Los Angeles, she taught high school English and physical education
in Oregon public schools.
</P>
<P>
   She was married in 1945 after Richard Lewis Neuberger, then a
young writer interested in politics and government, finished his
wartime service as an Army captain. Already active in precinct
politics and civic programs, she campaigned for her husband when he
won election to the Oregon Senate in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   She herself entered the State House of Representatives two years
later. That earned the Neubergers a footnote in political handbooks
as the nation's first husband and wife to serve simultaneously in
two chambers of a state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The couple also worked together as freelance writers,
collaborating on articles about the Pacific Northwest. They also
wrote a book, ``Adventures in Politics: We Go to the Legislature''
(Oxford, 1954).
</P>
<P>
   Neuberger astonished Oregonians when she took on the powerful

U.S. PUSHES FOR MORE POLICE IN KOSOVO, CITING TROOPS' BURDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-U.S.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is pushing the NATO
allies to send more police officers into Kosovo, arguing that NATO
troops are stretched when they are forced to maintain municipal
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt Mitrovica shows that the longer NATO troops
are required to do police duties, the more often they will appear
to take sides in a dispute and the more often they will find
themselves in trouble,'' a Pentagon official said. Kosovska
Mitrovica is the divided city where violence has repeatedly taken
place between ethnic Serbs and Albanians. Serbs have thrown rocks
at U.S. troops trying to stop the ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after the peacekeeping mission began in Kosovo,
Pentagon and White House officials have become irritated that the
United Nations and the NATO allies have yet to make good on their
commitments to strengthen the civil administration in Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   They say they fear the standoff could turn into a test of the
entire NATO-led peacekeeping mission and of the administration's
Balkans policy, a policy the White House does not want to fail in
this election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, you've got to have police, rule of law, those
things that our soldiers, our KFOR troops, do not do,'' said Gen.
Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, using the
shorthand name for the peacekeeping force. ``We've got to get the
police force in.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the latest crest of violence in the last few days,
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen visited U.N. secretary general
Kofi Annan in New York to ask the United Nations to send more
police officers and civilian administrators into the field. The
United Nations is in charge of trying to restore civilian
government in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep the emphasis on getting the policemen there
and getting a judicial system,'' Cohen said last week. He added,
``It's important for this to be calmed immediately.'' Washington
has been anxious about the paucity of police officers for months.
U.S. volunteers are part of the police force.
</P>
<P>
   At the instigation of the administration, senior policy makers
from the United States, France, Italy, Germany and Britain met in
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, last week to press the United Nations,
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the
European Union to live up to their commitments to provide at least
2,000 additional civil police officers, administrators and experts
on the judiciary for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure that everyone understands what is at
stake here: the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo,'' said a senior
White House official. ``The Europeans are sensitive that they have
only pledged 800 police when 4,700 police are needed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A senior U.S. military official said: ``The longer our soldiers
carry out police duties, the greater the risk of casualties or
soldiers getting into trouble. We don't like occupying countries
and then find ourselves holding the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Europeans say they are doing their share, including
contributing police officers. They say the U.S. complaints stem
from the elections in the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
   Within the administration, some officials question the
Pentagon's singular focus on adding more police and the public
finger pointing that is causing unease among the allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a gray line in areas like Mitrovica between policing
and securing a safe environment,'' said a senior diplomat. ``You
have an infiltration problem of weapons and nationals from Serbia
and Albania coming in through a porous border. That is a military
problem.''

FIGHT OVER `HARVARD' ROILS EFFORT TO SAVE HMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' struggle to save its largest HMO has
sparked an unusual confrontation with the world's richest
university over who owns the right to the name ``Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University has put state regulators on notice that it
wants to ``assert rights'' over the Harvard name as the state
negotiates to rescue the financially ailing health plan, Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care, which has had free use of the name since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly Wednesday countered with a
lawsuit, asserting that Harvard Pilgrim owns its name and the
university cannot do anything about it. But Reilly conceded the
Harvard name has some intrinsic value and said it is a crucial
element in the state's effort to attract investors to save Harvard
Pilgrim, which insures 1.1 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The episode marks a strange twist in the Harvard Pilgrim story
because until now, Harvard University had been viewed as a likely
partner in the state's efforts to salvage the HMO and was
negotiating with state regulators to invest an undetermined amount
in its namesake. But on Friday, the relationship apparently took a
tense turn.
</P>
<P>
   University officials presented Reilly and state Insurance
Commissioner Linda Ruthardt with the letter signed by Provost
Harvey Fineberg.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Reilly was clearly displeased with the
university for raising the name issue at a delicate time in his
negotiations to rescue the HMO, which was forced into receivership
on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``That letter threatened our process and created a cloud,'' he
said. ``The university understood when they sent that letter that
there would be consequences and there is. This is all about
protecting the plan and its members and that's what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Fineberg's letter did not explicitly demand back the name,
First Assistant Attorney General Dean Richlin said the implication
is that Harvard wants to reserve the right to take it back if
regulators decide on a plan the university doesn't like, such as
selling Harvard Pilgrim to a for-profit insurer.
</P>
<P>
   That is one option regulators are considering for the HMO; the
other is to raise enough cash from investors to keep Harvard
Pilgrim afloat until it can turn around its finances.
</P>
<P>
   While Harvard University has become increasingly aggressive
about protecting its name in recent years, university Spokesman
Paul Grogan said Wednesday that Fineberg simply wants to
``institute a discussion'' and ``not to necessarily take back the
name or impede any transaction the attorney general is
considering.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the letter and the lawsuit could be strategic moves in
negotiations that are proving to be strenuous and time-consuming.
Both Reilly and university officials said they are not backing out
of negotiations to bring Harvard onto a rescue plan for the health
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter does not say we have the right to approve any
deal,'' Grogan said. ``But it has to be in the mix. We don't want
to remain silent and then be faced with some outcome that causes
concern about the use of the university's name, when it might be
too late or too messy. But we're mindful of how delicate this is
and we want to be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Harvard nor the attorney general put a dollar value on
the name. And Reilly said that no potential buyers or investors
have said that the Harvard name must specifically be part of any
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Reilly said the name Harvard Pilgrim is an ``asset'' and a
``brand name with unquestionable value'' that has become nationally
recognized as a provider of high-quality health care.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said that Harvard Pilgrim has used the name without
``challenge, permission or written agreement'' from the university
since 1969, when Harvard Medical School Dean Robert H. Ebert and
Harvard University Law School Professor Arthur E. Sutherland helped
found the health plan as an experiment in providing quality health
care at a preset price.
</P>
<P>
   David Bernstein, head of the intellectual property section at
the Boston law firm Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo,
said it's unclear whether Harvard or the attorney general will
prevail, but he said it's a question the courts are being faced
with more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most universities have only become savvy in protecting their
intellectual property rights in the past decade or so,'' he said.
``Harvard University owns several dozen trademarks and is very
assertive in activating its trademark rights. They don't want
people diluting the Harvard aura.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Harvard sued a Boston man who is accused of trying
to make money selling back to Harvard the Internet rights to its
own name. Michael Rhys allegedly registered 65 Internet domain
names incorporating the words Harvard and Radcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has a contract that allows Harvard Vanguard Medical
Associates to use the university's name. The contract expires at
the end of the year and Harvard has indicated it will not renew it.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, Harvard hasn't minded. The John Harvard's Brew
House uses the name of the university's founder without legal
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In the Harvard Pilgrim case, ``whether they have a right to the
name is hard to say,'' Bernstein said. ``You build up rights to
your name through the use of it.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was a contract between Harvard University and Harvard
Pilgrim, he said, it may contain a clause allowing Harvard to
rescind permission in the case of financial collapse. Or, the
university could try to make a case that the public cannot
distinguish between the university and the health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Grogan said that there never was a written contract, but that
there may be other types of agreements that are equally as binding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name was delegated under a certain set of conditions and
they have remained relatively the same _ it's a nonprofit HMO in
the health care business. The entity has stayed the same and now
there is a potential for great change.''
</P>
<P>
   While Grogan said he's not familiar with the circumstances under
which the John Harvard's Brew House created its name, he said that
it's less likely that anyone would confuse the brew house with the
university _ something that could happen with the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it has to do with the nature of the enterprise,'' he
said. ``Obviously Harvard, with its medical school and hospitals,
is in the health business in a major way.''

 &HT;    Gore, Bradley fence with ideas, Web sites
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats Bill Bradley and Al Gore delivered major
policy speeches Wednesday, while for the first time exploiting new
vehicles on the Internet to level personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out to senior voters in Florida, Gore outlined a $35
billion to $45 billion prescription drug benefit for seniors facing
catastrophic illnesses. In New York, Bradley proposed a wage
insurance program for workers who lose their jobs as a result of
international trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Over the Internet, meanwhile, the candidates escalated the war
of words that began during Monday's acrimonious debate at the
Apollo Theater in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley launched a new Web site, www.moreaboutgore.com, that
highlighted Gore's more conservative voting records on abortion,
gun control and health care while he was a member of Congress from
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also launched a new radio ad in Washington state, where
Bradley plans to campaign over the next five days. It begins,
``What do we really know about Al Gore?'' The ad highlights some of
the same charges made on the new Web site, and urges listeners to
log on to the site ``to see for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The new site was launched just a day after Gore added a feature
to his own Web site called the ``Bradley Information Bureau.''
Gore's site contains a long list of what the Gore campaign calls
misleading and untrue information put out by Bradley about Gore's
record.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's edition of Gore's site included a partial rebuttal
to Bradley's new radio ad, asserting that Gore was strongly in
favor of abortion rights and touting his recent endorsement by the
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley has just been going ballistic since losing
Iowa and New Hampshire,'' Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said. ``So
this is just the latest in a series of attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Gore's campaign opted to respond with its own
radio ad, sharply criticizing Bradley for ``running attack ads''
that make him ``sound more like a Republican every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristan Ludecke, Bradley's spokeswoman, said Bradley was simply
trying to set the record straight. ``We got an awful lot of
questions about where Gore used to stand on some of these issues,''
she said. ``The real issue is that Al Gore acted one way when he
was in Congress and a completely different way when he was with
Bill Clinton.'' With less than two weeks to go before a critical
round of primaries and caucuses March 7, both Bradley and Gore are
targeting key states and constituencies in a final push for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's trip to Deerfield Beach, Fla., where he addressed seniors
at a retirement living center, was targeted at a key voting group
in Florida's March 14 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his new prescription drug benefit would help nearly 3
million seniors who face costly drug payments as a result of
chronic or catastrophic illnesses. For a $44 monthly premium,
Gore's plan would pay half of all drug costs up to $5,000. Once a
beneficiary's out-of-pocket expenses exceeded $4,000, the plan
would pay all prescription drug costs. For seniors with incomes
below $11,000 a year, the plan would pay full drug costs with no
cap and no premium charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this time of great prosperity, it is unacceptable that so
many seniors have to choose between medicine and food and rent,''
Gore said. ``We must use our prosperity so that seniors never lack
the medicines they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore had previously unveiled a drug benefit program for seniors
last September. The latest enhancement, which Hattaway said was
made possible by larger projected budget surpluses, makes Gore's
plan competitive with one offered by Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's prescription drug plan does not cap benefits, but
includes a $500 deductible, a $25 monthly premium and a 25 percent
co-payment on drug purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at Columbia University on Wednesday, Bradley
argued that the nation's prosperity should be an incentive to make
investments in health care, education and worker retraining for
those Americans left out of the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our success, far too many Americans are still on the
outside looking in,'' Bradley said. ``We can now afford to be bold
in setting the national agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposed a $200 million program to supplement the wages
of workers who lose jobs because of new trade agreements. The
benefit would only be available for workers who took new jobs at
lower salary, subsidizing up to half a worker's lost wages up to
$10,000. A worker earning $45,000 a year who was forced to take a
$25,000-a-year job, for example, would be eligible for a $10,000
annual subsidy from the government for a maximum of three years.

 &HT;    Selig orders Strawberry to leave first workout
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ A blunt telephone call from commissioner Bud Selig
had Darryl Strawberry whisked from the field Wednesday during the
New York Yankees' first full workout of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's next call could preclude the troubled player
from ever returning.
</P>
<P>
   Selig is expected to announce a suspension for Strawberry within
the next 24 hours, in response to the player testing positive for
cocaine use. Having already served suspensions of 60 and 120 days
over the past six years for drug use, the designated hitter now
faces a possible season-long ban. At his age, it could end his
career. Strawberry will turn 38 on March 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot going on in his life, and it's sad and
unfortunate, and you wish you could help him,'' manager Joe Torre
said. ``And the only thing you can do is support him and wish him
well. I don't know what the answer is.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry surprised the club with his decision to attend the
first full-squad workout, and Selig was astonished. Although the
player thought that he had been cleared to participate after he met
with Selig in Milwaukee on Tuesday, the commissioner called the
club's complex to order Strawberry off the field when he heard he
was working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just like to say I'm not running or hiding,'' Strawberry
said earlier. ``You guys know I try to move forward. I came here
today because this is where I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But some two hours later, during the first session of batting
practice, Selig called and Torre sent word to Strawberry in the
outfield to return to the clubhouse. He dressed hastily and left
the facility without comment.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was being tested as often as twice a week, as
provided by the terms of his probation for a cocaine possession
conviction. He tested positive Jan. 19 in testing conducted by the
Florida Department of Corrections. Baseball is believed to have
been notified earlier of the results, but the Yankees were not
called until the eve of the first full-squad workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real disease, a sickness,'' said Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner, who has been supportive of Strawberry. ``It's
really sad.''

MICHIGAN TOWN DEFEATS BID TO LIMIT LIBRARY'S INTERNET ACCESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLAND, Mich. _ Voting on the nation's first ballot measure to
shackle the Internet on library computers and keep children from
being exposed to pornography, the people of this deeply
conservative town have chosen not to force a public library to
filter computer access to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives had labeled the showdown as the ``Lexington and
Concord'' of the struggle over American libraries' Internet
policies, and Christian conservative groups outspent free-speech
advocates by 14 to 1. But residents voted 55 percent to 45 percent
against the proposal, which would have cut off municipal financing
for the library here unless it blocked access from its computers to
sites containing ``obscene, sexually explicit or other material
harmful to minors.''
</P>
<P>
   The referendum was on the same ballot as the statewide
Republican primary, and helped increase turnout to 41 percent of
registered voters here, more than double the usual level in a
primary.
</P>
<P>
   The vote here in southwestern Michigan, in what is sometimes
known as Michigan's Bible Belt, comes at a time of mounting
pressure on public libraries across the country to prevent patrons,
particularly minors, from visiting Web sites featuring pornography
and other material that many conservatives find objectionable. The
American Library Association estimates that 15 percent of the
nation's public libraries have installed filtering software to
prevent patrons from visiting various kinds of sites, especially
pornographic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of filtering say that children could suffer permanent
emotional scars if they stumble across an indecent site, even while
supervised. ``The librarians can't move fast enough to prevent that
image from entering the child's mind and staying there forever,''
said Gary Glenn, the president of the American Family Association
of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Krug, the director of the office for intellectual freedom
at the American Library Association, said that psychological
studies had shown that children were not so easily affected by
sexual imagery. The association contends that Internet filters are
a good tool for parents to use on home computers but violate the
First Amendment when they are used in libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that filtering software can also block access
even to some educational sites, and may create a false sense of
security among parents and library administrators, because the
software can sometimes be circumvented by enterprising computer
users.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters here had an additional concern: children of families
not affluent enough to afford home computers might suffer
academically. ``I really don't think it's a good idea because it's
a disadvantage to the poor,'' said Mary Hunt, a 57-year-old
homemaker who said as she left the polls at Holland's Civic Center
on Tuesday evening that she had voted against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying herself as African-American and Native American,
Hunt said that if the measure had passed, it would have been
particularly harmful to this city's growing minority community.
</P>
<P>
   But sentiment was very different outside a polling place at one
of this city's four Christian schools. Chris Ransom, a 28-year-old
manager at a metal scrap recycling company, said that he had not
connected his family's home computer to the Internet because of
worries that his 11-year-old son, Justin, and 9-year-old daughter,
Jessica, might see something inappropriate. He said he had
cautioned both children about using the Internet at their friends'
homes or at the library.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Cyndi, who sat next to him in the family minivan after
they had both voted for the ballot proposal, added that, ``We warn
them that you can get out there and you never know when you're
going to get into'' inappropriate sites.
</P>
<P>
   Holland, a city of 32,000, is not alone in wrestling with
Internet issues here. Nearby Georgetown Township, which has 50,000
people, has already installed filtering software on all computers
in its public library, in defiance of a state law requiring that
public libraries with Internet access have at least one computer
without filtering software. Another city nearby, Hudsonville,
turned off all Internet access from computers at its libraries here
on Dec. 9, for fear of lawsuits by conservatives if filters are not
installed and by First Amendment advocates if filters are
installed.
</P>
<P>
   The public library in Holland is a very large and beautiful
building of limestone and glass that even features a cafe in the
basement that serves cappuccino and omelettes. While the library's
board has rejected Internet filters, the staff closely supervises
use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Computers in the children's area are not connected to the Web at
all. Seven computers in the adult section with Web connections are
on desks arranged in the shape of a horseshoe, and Karen Goorhous,
the library's computer trainer, sits at the base of the horseshoe,
where she can see what people are viewing. Computers with Internet
access do not have drives for diskettes, to prevent users from
downloading information, and files can be printed from the Internet
only using a printer behind the reference librarians' desk.
</P>
<P>
   Goorhous said that only once had she found someone, an adult
man, viewing clearly pornographic material, and she had told him to
stop. But she said that some residents had also complained when
other patrons used the Internet to visit sites that were not
necessarily pornographic, such as one that featured a photograph of
Britney Spears, the teen-age singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her navel was showing,'' Goorhous said.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Meengs, the president of the library's board, said that
there had been no complaints that the library's existing oversight
of Internet use might already be too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot initiative here was led by Irvin Bos, a 59-year-old
builder and manager of apartment buildings who said he had
dedicated himself to fighting pornography because of an incident
that occurred when he was 12 years old. He found a sexually
explicit book by the roadside then and read sections of it over and
over again in the family's barn in the following months, Bos said
in an interview Wednesday. When lightning struck the barn six
months later, burning it down and killing the family's prize bull
and best cow, Bos said that he felt responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew I had caused that barn to burn down,'' Bos said.
</P>
<P>
   His ballot drive was helped by the American Family Association.
Glenn said that he hoped to discuss the issue with the library
board in the coming months. If filtering software is not installed
_ and there is little sign that the board is changing its position
_ the association will work with local conservatives to make sure
that another filtering measure appears on the November ballot, he
added.

   LOS ANGELES _ Carlos Santana dominated the 42d Grammy Awards
Wednesday at this city's new Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   His triumphs with his album ``Supernatural'' were to no one's
surprise and no one's chagrin. A critical, popular, and sentimental
favorite, Santana won six Grammys during the afternoon,
pre-telecast ceremonies. He was expected to win four more during
the CBS telecast of the awards, which are presented by the National
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe this?'' said Santana, 52, after the fourth
win. ``Someone once said, `to live is to dream, to die is to
awaken.' Please don't wake me up. . .''
</P>
<P>
   He won for pop performance by a duo or group with vocal for
``Maria Maria''; pop collaboration with vocals for ``Smooth'' with
matchbox 20 singer Rob Thomas; rock performance by a duo or group
with vocals for ``Put Your Lights On'' with Everlast; rock
instrumental performance, and rock album.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Globe jazz critic Bob Blumenthal won in the album notes
category for work on ``John Coltrane: The Classic Quartet _
Complete Impulse! Studio Recordings.'' Berklee College of Music
executive vice president Gary Burton and longtime Cambridge
resident Pat Metheny won for Jazz Instrumental Performance,
Individual or Group for ``Like Minds,'' a collaboration with Chick
Corea, Roy Haynes, and Dave Holland.
</P>
<P>
   The first evening award went to TLC's ``Fan Mail'' for R&AMP;B
Album.
</P>
<P>
   However, the old guard asserted itself across the board in pop,
rock, and R&AMP;B categories. Cher edged out Jennifer Lopez for Dance
Recording and Sarah McLachlan _ hardly an old-timer except in
relation to her competition in this category _ beat out hot
newcomers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera for Female Pop
Vocal Performance. Sheryl Crow, who won for Female Rock Vocal
Performance, gave ``thanks to Carlos Santana for not being in this
category, and thanks to Axl Rose fo writing a great song.'' Barry
White kept young lions Maxwell, R. Kelly, and Tyrese at bay,
winning Male R&AMP;B Vocal Performance and Traditional R&AMP;B Vocal
Performance. After 31 years in the head-banging business, Black
Sabbath won its first Grammy, beating out youngsters Ministry,
Motorhead, Nine Inch Nails, and Rob Zombie for Metal Performance.
Summed up Black Sabbath member Bill Ward, ``Hello, I'm the drummer.
Carlos, God bless you.''
</P>
<P>
   An album of Stravinsky compositions recorded by the San
Francisco Symphony swept the Classical category with three Grammys.
Another Stravinsky work, ``The Rake's Progress,'' won in the Opera
Recording category.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Collins won soundtrack honors with ``Tarzan.'' Another pop
songwriter-turned-film composer, Randy Newman, won Instrumental
Composition for a Motion Picture for ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Madonna and William Orbit nabbed the win in the cumbersome
category of Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television Or Other
Visual Media for ``Beautiful Stranger'' from ``Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Country music winners spanned the generations, with Grammys
going to George Jones (for Best Male Country Vocal Performance),
Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt, and Dolly Parton (for Best Country
Collaboration with Vocals) and a tearful Dixie Chicks, who won two:
Country Album and Country Performance By A Duo or Group with Vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Tito Puente won his fifth Grammy, beating out the favorite
``Buena Vista Social Club Presents Ibrahim Ferrer'' in Best
Traditional Tropical Latin Performance. Ruben Blades, who declined
an invitation to dine with King Carlos of Spain to attend the
Grammys, won for Best Latin Pop Album.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Winter, who won for New Age album, confessed that he was
grateful that his music has a section in the record store, even
though ''New Age was the 12th label applied to me through the
years, and it's completely confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Staples venue was an object of jokes by Grammys emcee Rosie
O'Donnell. ``It was there or Kinko's,'' she cracked, and delivered
good-natured barbs to everyone from gal-pal Madonna to presenter
Jennifer Lopez, who wore a cleverly-tied swatch of sheer green
fabric as her Grammy gown.

BLACKS IN SECRET SERVICE ACCUSE IT OF BIAS IN PROMOTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last year, after 16 years as an agent in the
insular fraternity of the Secret Service, Reginald G. Moore had
made it to one of the most prestigious posts in the agency as a
lead agent on President Clinton's protective detail, entrusted with
Clinton's life. Moore seemed to be poised to advance to the
agency's managerial ranks.
</P>
<P>
   But even though his written evaluation for 1999 shows that he
was among the most outstanding agents of his rank, Moore, who is
black, said he was denied a promotion and given the task of
training the white agent promoted ahead of him. When Moore was
reassigned to a counterfeiting squad in Dallas, he decided to defy
the Secret Service's traditional code of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it the way I was supposed to do it,'' Moore said
recently. ``I got a very, very wrong deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Moore officially became a lead plaintiff in a
class-action complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, a legal action that accuses the Secret Service of a
pattern and practice of racial discrimination dating to 1987 in
promotions through biased selections, highly subjective personnel
evaluations, arbitrary transfers and an unfair system of bonuses
and awards.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Treasury Department, Jim Mackin, said
Wednesday, that agency officials could not comment on the specific
accusations of the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Service cannot comment on matters that are
currently under litigation or matters which may be addressed
through an administrative complaint process,'' Mackin said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``However, the Secret Service takes very seriously any
complaint of racial discrimination. This organization has actively
engaged in ensuring a diverse work environment and affording equal
opportunity to each of our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mackin said the agency's commitment to diversity was illustrated
in the most senior ranks of seven assistant directors, two of whom
are black and one of whom is a woman. A White House spokesman would
not comment on the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   With another Secret Service agent, John E. Turner, a member of
Vice President Al Gore's protective detail, Moore, known as Ray,
has filed a complaint that is a first step in what promises to be a
long process, that unless informally resolved, will wind up in U.S.
District Court in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   In their efforts, the Secret Service agents are following other
black agents at the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms who have gone to court to obtain substantial changes in
promotions, assignments and training.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm seeing at the Secret Service is indicative of the
pattern I've seen throughout federal law enforcement, you get
promoted on who you know, not what you know,'' said David J.
Shaffer, a lawyer for the Secret Service agents who also
represented agents at the FBI and ATF. ``I've seen it at the FBI
and at the ATF What makes it so compelling at the Secret Service is
that they are willing to take a bullet for the president but they
can't get promoted because of their race.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer said the percentage of black agents who are promoted
from top agent ranks to managerial positions underscores the
charges against the agency. Of the 2,453 agents in the Secret
Service as of July 31, 1999, the last date the data were compiled,
black agents at the rank just below the supervisory level made up
10.7 percent of the workforce. But as of that date black agents at
the first managerial tier numbered only 4.2 percent, a disparity
that the agents attribute to racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   John P. Relman, another lawyer for the agents, said, ``It takes
someone like Ray to demonstrate how the glass ceiling works. Even
if you beat the white competition, that's not enough. You have to
be superb by any objective measure if you're black, and here people
will see that Ray is as good as you can get, but he still couldn't
get promoted.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The complaint against the Secret Service charged that the agency
promoted agents through an informal system based on friends and
influential contacts in its senior echelons. The complaint said,
``Even though the Secret Service promotion system has a numerical
ranking, it is excessively subjective, is not job related and has
been implemented through a `good old boy network' to the exclusion
of African-American special agents. White special agents who have
relatives or friends in the Secret Service are able to access this
network and advance quickly through the ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The agents' complaint opens a window on the internal culture of
the Secret Service, one of the government's best known but most
insular federal law-enforcement agencies, an institution that has
connected to popular imagination for its agents' willingness to
place their bodies between a president and an assassin's bullet. In
an interview, Moore said that agents are trained to suppress their
instinct to turn away from the sound of gunshot, and instead, turn
toward it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After working his way from the Miami and Baton Rouge offices,
Moore was assigned in 1994 to the Presidential Protective Division
at the White House, the most prestigious Secret Service
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   There have been high profile blacks on the presidential detail
like Larry L. Cockell, the former head of the Presidential
Protective Division, who testified to the grand jury in the special
prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr's investigation in 1998 into whether
Clinton lied about his relationship with Monica S.Lewinsky. But
Cockell has since left the White House for a promotion to an
executive job in the Secret Service in charge of training.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he advanced from a line agent, maintaining what he
said was the moving ``secure bubble'' around the president, to a
senior job as ``No. 1 Whip,'' the primary backup to the senior
supervisor on his shift. Of landing a slot as an agent on the
president's detail, he said, ``It's huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said that he learned how to handle the Uzi and other
automatic weapons used by the Secret Service _ trained to keep his
finger outside the trigger guard because agents always operated in
crowds. He studied with behavorial scientists to spot possible
threatening people in crowds and stayed in top physical shape ready
to take on any potential presidential attacker.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had learned to drive the presidential limousine,
the massive armor-plated, electronics-laden vehicle that he
described as tanklike in its handling characteristics. A mild bend
in the road, he said, ``feels like hairpin turn.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he learned how to respond to a variety of situations,
including Clinton's penchant for spontaneously wading into crowds,
an anxious moment when agents must swiftly improvise a human
shield. He trained for more serious situations, including
shoulder-fired missile strikes and ``J-Turns,'' in which he
alternately accelerated, braked and sharply turned the steering
wheel of the presidential vehicle so that he could spin it in a
180-degree turn, roaring off in the opposite direction from any
pursuer.
</P>
<P>
   Moore traveled abroad with the president and served as the lead
agent preparing for diplomatically sensitive assignments like he
did in February 1999 when he supervised security arrangements for
Clinton's trip to King Hussein's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Moore was promoted to be a temporary supervisor at the
Joint Operations Center at the White House, the Secret Service
command post in the Old Executive Office Building, adjacent to the
White House. The Service uses the center to coordinate the
movements of the president and vice president and other dignitaries
and to manage security in the White House complex.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, Moore said, agents assigned to temporary
supervisors' jobs are almost always named to permanently fill the
managerial jobs. Moore said that he and most of his colleagues
assumed he would be too. But when he arrived at work on the morning
after senior managers secretly select agents for advancement he was
not on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Disheartened, Moore went to a supervisor, who expressed his
disbelief. ``I don't know what happened, Ray,'' he recalled being
told by his glum superior. ``I don't accept it. It was a Secret
Service decision. You should have been promoted.''

 &HT;    Sanders fills Braves' bill as top-of-the-order hitter with good
glove
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Braves fans might remember Reggie Sanders from
the 1995 National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Braves pitchers rendered his bat useless, and Sanders went
2-for-16 with a demoralizing 10 strikeouts. That performance put a
damper on what otherwise was the best season of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough experience to go through,'' said Sanders, who
played eight years with the Cincinnati Reds. ``But we're put in
situations for a reason. I had to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three seasons after that, Sanders wasn't the same.
Injuries didn't help. But last year, Sanders was healthy, and he
worked under hitting coach Merv Rettenmund in San Diego. The
combination had Sanders back on the top of his game and the Braves
eager to trade for him as a top-of-the-order jolt.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, the Braves' new left fielder and probable No. 2 hitter,
came to Atlanta with Quilvio Veras and Wally Joyner for Ryan
Klesko, Bret Boone and minor-league pitcher Jason Shiell. Sanders
joined the rest of the Braves position players Wednesday in the
first full-squad workout of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised the Padres traded him,'' said Rettenmund, who
was hired from the Padres to replace Don Baylor. ``He's capable of
hitting first, second. We used him mostly at third, fourth. He can
hit any place in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders hit .285 last year, his best since .306 in 1995. His
on-base percentage climbed to .376, the highest since .397 in 1995.
He hit 26 home runs, second-highest in his career since the 28 he
hit in 1995, and his 36 steals matched his career high.
</P>
<P>
   Rettenmund said he encouraged Sanders to get his hands in a more
comfortable position at the start of his swing so that he was more
fluid and quicker in his approach to the ball. The result was a
better ratio of strikeouts to at-bats; he had 108 strikeouts in 478
at-bats last year, compared with 122 strikeouts in 484 at-bats in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it had to do with Merv and then just a group of guys
we were around,'' Sanders said. ``Even though we weren't going
anywhere, we still had heart. We still had guys who worked hard
every day. It just carries over. I think it's the same way with
this organization. Everything is first class, all the guys seem to
be very nice, seem to be very professional, and all that stuff
carries over onto the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Rettenmund said he thinks that Sanders is still a little hurt by
the Padres trade, but not enough to prevent him from being happy
about where he wound up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine,'' said Sanders, a Florence, S.C., native who has
been traded twice in the last two years. ``At least it was teams
like San Diego _ that's where my wife is from, so that was a great
thing. Now, I'm here, I'm closer to home, so with those situations
it doesn't bother me that much. This day and age, nobody's
guaranteed anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has played right and center field for most of his
career. The Padres moved him to left field last season, where he
will play this year, with Andruw Jones in center and Brian Jordan
in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it was tough, probably the first month or so. It
probably looked like I'd never been out there before,'' Sanders
said. The biggest adjustment was getting used to the new angles
that the ball would come off the bat, with it tailing away from him
instead of moving toward him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, after that, it kind of kicked into gear,'' Sanders said.
``At this point, it's no problem.... You're definitely going to
have the best outfield in major-league baseball.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One day after Gov. George W. Bush's twin losses to
Sen. John McCain in the Michigan and Arizona primaries, many of his
staunchest supporters said they were shell-shocked. And Bush
himself regrouped by agreeing to a debate in Los Angeles next week,
by ripping up his schedule to add a quick trip this weekend to
Washington state, where McCain is waging an energetic race, and by
questioning the senator's Republican credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The voting on Tuesday not only revived the threat of defections
to the McCain camp, but also set off recriminations from inside and
outside the Bush organization, including members of Congress and
the Republican National Committee who had eagerly rallied behind
Bush early on.
</P>
<P>
   They groused about everything from Bush's lavish spending in
Arizona _ where McCain was the favorite son _ to his embrace from
Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition, to his
decision to blame his defeat in Michigan on Democrats who ``hijack
the primary to help Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some RNC members are saying: `What is going on here? He's
getting his hat handed to him and he can't put down the
rebellion,''' said Steve Duprey, chairman of the Republican Party
in New Hampshire who has remained neutral. ``And that makes them
nervous. They're also nervous about the incredible number of new
people signing on to vote for McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, an early Bush supporter, said he
was especially disturbed by Bush's outreach to religious
conservatives. ``This Robertson stuff and the hard turn to the
right really hurt him.'' he said. ``I think Bush is still the
favorite if you're at the betting table. But he's got to change his
message and be inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hand-wringing, Bush insisted that he was confident
he would prevail because to win the Republican presidential
nomination McCain, who has drawn much of his support from those who
identify themselves as independents or Democrats, still must do
something he has not demonstrated he can do: beat Bush among
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign advances to several states where only registered
Republicans can vote in primaries, in particular New York, Bush
said his path will become easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it amazing that somebody running for president as a
Republican has to reach out to Republicans for the vote,'' Bush
said at a news conference in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain quickly sought to expand his base and reintroduce
himself as as conservative, telling voters in Seattle, ``I'm a
proud conservative Republican. I'm a Reagan Republican. Have have
no doubt about that. I have to convince and tell our Republican
establishment: It's great over here, come on in, join us, join us
in this effort to build an inclusive party,''
</P>
<P>
   McCain asserted that he would do well in several states with
closed primaries, particularly Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode
Island. ``Those states I guarantee you I can win,'' he said in an
interview. The question, he continued, was whether he could make
headway among Republicans in the South and the Midwest and
California, a state that allows Democrats and independents to vote,
but only counts Republican votes in determining who wins delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's supporters fear that if McCain continues to win
contests and pick up steam he could crack the governor's hold on
bedrock Republicans. In fact, a New York Times/CBS News Poll in New
York, where only Republicans can vote in the primary on March 7,
found that Bush holds only a slight lead over McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The results on Tuesday seemed to upend the dynamic in the
Republican camps instantly. After his victory in South Carolina on
Saturday, Bush began looking past McCain and citing Vice President
Al Gore in his speeches. On Wednesday, Bush was back to deriding
McCain. And his operatives found themselves putting down rampant
rumors in Republican circles _ rumors that had no apparent basis _
that the governor intended to shake up his staff.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the outcome places fresh pressure on Bush in
the contests on Tuesday in Virginia, Washington state and North
Dakota, states that had not been considered high priorities. While
Bush's advisers have thought he had an edge in Virginia because of
its conservative tilt, they said they were now worried that
Washington, with its more moderate electorate, would be more suited
to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign on Wednesday repeatedly revised its schedule
to adjust to a McCain threat in Washington. Aides at first settled
on a plan for the governor to stump in Virginia on Monday and
Tuesday, but he now intends to leave Austin on Sunday to campaign
in Washington state for at least a day and a half or perhaps
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big fear of what could happen next is not to have a win on
Tuesday in the North Dakota, Washington and Virginia primaries,''
said a lobbyist here who is an adviser to the Bush campaign. ``That
would be trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Everybody's in general agreement that the next 48
hours are critical in terms of, `Does the press go in full swoon
for McCain again?' All bets are off if in the next 48 hours McCain
appears to be getting a big bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers said they were also rethinking their strategy
and expected to put more effort into Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the immediate focus on next week, advisers to Bush and
McCain said they were most concerned about the flurry of big-state
contests on March 7 and March 14.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, aides on both sides said the most important battle will
be fought over California, the biggest prize of all, which holds
its primary on March 7. That explains why after days in which
Bush's advisers had suggested that the governor might not take part
in a debate in Los Angeles on March 2, he agreed on Wednesday to
appear.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of a protracted race also threatened to drain Bush's
treasury, even though he has swamped Mr. McCain financially. One
Bush aide said the campaign will now have to draw from an account
it had intended to use against Gore in the spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dipping into our Gore pool,'' the aide said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many Bush supporters and advisers interviewed on Wednesday said
they were reeling from the outcome and they did not hesitate to
bluntly criticize the governor's campaign. Several said while they
still expected Bush to capture the nomination, they were not nearly
as certain of that as they were even a day before..
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was confident that Bush would be the nominee, Rep.
Vernon J. Ehlers, a Michigan Republican who supports the governor,
said: ``I would be much much more confident if he had clobbered
McCain. I think it would have been over then.''
</P>
<P>
   Upton said he was approached on Wednesday morning by a
distraught Bush backer at a Rotary Club meeting who fretted that
the governor had moved too far to the right. ``A man gave me a
compass to put in my pocket. He said, `Give this to George Bush. He
lost his way after South Carolina,' '' Upton said.
</P>
<P>
   And after the votes were counted on Tuesday, he said, a woman in
tears approached him at an event in Kalamazoo to complain about the
governor's ties to the religious right _ and people who backed Pat
Robertson's bid for president against his father. Upton recalled:
``She said, `I just can't believe that George W. sidled up to the
same folks who set out to destroy his dad here in Michigan in
1988.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides were jubilant, but they acknowledged that they
were almost as shocked by the Michigan outcome as the Bush
operatives. Dan Schnur, McCain's communications director, said he
was bracing for a possible loss in Michigan so on Tuesday morning
he gave his staff a pep talk, reminding them that no matter what
happens ``you ought to be proud _ you guys are part of history.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Schnur and Thomas Rath, a Bush adviser, used
identical language to describe the road ahead: ``uncharted
waters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the Twilight Zone of presidential nominee
selection,'' Rath said. ``I don't think anybody ought to be real
confident of anything this morning.'' As for the Bush operation, he
added, ``We're ready for some days of no surprises.''

 &HT;    Hawks back away, don't plan any deals
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Officially, the trading deadline is 6 p.m.
today. In reality, it's already over for the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Pete Babcock said late Wednesday afternoon that
the team has nothing in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I'm talking about today involves things we can do
at the end of the season,'' Babcock said. ``We don't have anything
at this moment, and I do not foresee that changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said all offers the Hawks have entertained would include
players with contracts that go beyond this season, some extending
beyond 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just won't do it,'' Babcock said. ``If we were to take on
long contracts, then we would violate the very reasons we had for
trading Steve Smith. And that was to allow us to create cap room so
that we can build a championship contender. We simply will not
deviate from that path.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawks president Stan Kasten, who vowed in January to make
changes and said last week that the team had not improved
sufficiently to suit him, echoed Babcock's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't compromise our future,'' Kasten said. ``We won't take
on bad contracts. We won't trade our young players, which is
something most teams want us to do. And we will not waste the rest
of their season or compromise next season. We just won't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten said that within the near future, the Hawks will become
more reliant on their young players and give them chances to prove
themselves. ``You can expect to see them play the rest of the
way,'' he said. ``That plan will probably go into effect when the
team comes off its current six-game road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he would not address Isaiah Rider's short-term future,
Kasten said, ``There are one or two things that we still have to do
that I'm not going to talk about right now.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Hawks are intent on going to their young players for the
rest of the season, having Rider on the roster could become a
liability. As a rising free agent, he could be expected to chafe in
the role of bench player, much as he did earlier this season when
he refused to take on the role of sixth man for even a limited
time, as suggested by coach Lenny Wilkens.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the Hawks might find it a necessity to waive
Rider, but it almost certainly cannot happen before the Hawks
return home on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Rider is not waived or is claimed after March 1, he becomes
less attractive to contending teams because playoff rosters are
frozen on that date.

MCSORLEY OUT FOR AT LEAST 23 GAMES, NHL RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta - Marty McSorley's season came to a harsh and
abrupt end Wednesday when the National Hockey League suspended the
Bruins' defenseman for the remaining 23 regular-season games and
the playoffs as a result of his striking Vancouver Canucks' forward
Donald Brashear in the right temple with his stick Monday night
with less than three seconds left in the game at GM Place. It is
the longest suspension ever handed down by the league for an on-ice
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension isn't necessarily over at the end of the season.
According to the edict handed down, if McSorley wants to play
again, and his representives indicated to league officials that he
does, he will have to meet with commissioner Gary Bettman to
reevaluate his situation. Another factor that will weigh on
McSorley's future is the health of the 28-year-old Brashear and how
quickly he recovers from the concussion he suffered as a result of
slamming his head onto the ice.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley, on advice of legal counsel, elected not to attend the
hearing at the league's headquarters in New York because of the
ongoing criminal investigation into the incident by the Vancouver
police department. He was represented by IMG agent Mike Barnett via
conference call, who also had an IMG associate at the hearing, and
by the NHL Players' Association via conference call. McSorley's
agent and the NHLPA had requested a two-day postponement of the
hearing but it was denied because the league said it felt it was
important to act swiftly and decisively.
</P>
<P>
   NHL Vice President and Director of Hockey Operations Colin
Campbell said he interviewed both Bruins' general manager Harry
Sinden and Vancouver GM Brian Burke and examined all the evidence,
which spoke for itself. In addition, Campbell said he looked at the
fight the two players had early in the first period as well as the
knee injury to Bruins' goalie Byron Dafoe, who was tripped by
teammate Kyle McLaren as a result of his getting tangled up with
Brashear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at everything here,'' said Campbell. ``Mr.
McSorley's act is entirely unacceptable. It would be grossly unfair
to suggest that his conduct is at all representative of the game,
of the other 700 players who play in the NHL or of the countless
others who play hockey at all levels. We regret that this act
occurred and that it has brought this kind of attention to our
game. You can't strike another player with your stick, particularly
to the head. When you do, the repercussions will be severe.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the seventh suspension of McSorley's 17-year career and
the first since 1994. Much has changed in the league and McSorley
is being affected by the league's cracking down on any kind of
blows to the head as well as hits from behind. This was both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hits from behind can be devastating,'' said Campbell. ``We
feel awful when things like this happen. It was a dangerous blow
and the suspension reflects that and we didn't like it. I've been
involved in a lot of hockey games over the last 30 years and I have
never seen a player in a game strike another player like that from
behind. We obviously have a more awareness, a consciousness toward
protecting the head. In this situation, it was cut and dried, it
wasn't your normal supplementary discipline. Donald Brashear had no
idea what happened to him and probably still has no idea unless
someone told him or he saw the replay.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the issue of concussions and the length of time it takes
to recover from them also factored into the punishment. Brashear is
expected to be out 14-21 days but it remains to be seen if that
will be long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concussions are a difficult injury to get a handle on and
assess,'' said Campbell, who said he was personally sickened when
he saw what happened. ``It takes a good seven days to assess a blow
to the head. I don't think we can 72 hours later make an assessment
saying he'll be back in 7, 10 or 20 days. The severity of the
suspension, the blow to the temple with a hockey stick, we didn't
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the reputation of both players involved, Campbell said
there was an inquiry as to why both McSorley and Brashear were on
the ice with three seconds left in a game that was long decided
before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked that question,'' said Campbell. ``I've dealt with
other coaches who feel the league has no jurisdiction with who they
put out on the ice. In this case, at the end of the day the player
has to be responsible for his actions. You might wonder in a 5-2
game why those players were out there. We looked at the last seven
or eight minutes of the game and we didn't feel that anything was
escalating. Donald Brashear is a player who has taken a regular
shift and actually has been a real dominating player the last
couple of games for Vancouver and Marty McSorley was taking a
regular shift on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Vancouver police investigation, the league said it as
well as both teams are cooperating but the NHL is hoping the police
will defer to the league's punishment and let the matter end there.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this incident, McSorley was most famous for having an
illegal stick in the 1993 Stanley Cup finals which badly hurt the
Kings' hopes of a Cup. Now, McSorley's career has been irreparably
damaged as well as the game he loves. The $72,000 salary he will
forfeit is a drop in the bucket compared to the price he is paying
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty was an example of a player who came into this league and
made it strictly on toughness,'' said Campbell. ``He became a
pretty good hockey player skills wise. By the time he took his
career from Pittsburgh to Edmonton to Los Angeles, he was on the
power play, he could play forward, he could play defense, he had
the ability to not only be tough but to score goals and make plays.
Marty was most known for the illegal stick and he was an important
player on that hockey team in all regards. Marty's last suspension
came in 1994 and he's been pretty clean since then. It's
unfortunate that probably his legacy will be this incident.''

THREAT SEEN TO U.S. TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TRADE-U.S.; moved in ``f'' category) 
(js) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two supporters of China's entry into the World
Trade Organization warned the White House Wednesday that the
administration is in imminent danger of seeing its huge trade
initiative die, partly because of Beijing's threats to Taiwan and
because Vice President Al Gore appears to have cold feet about the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   In a heated exchange before the Senate Finance Committee, the
chairman of the panel, Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., said
Wednesday that recent comments by Gore ``raise serious questions
about the administration's commitment to getting this deal done and
the legislation passed.'' Speaking at a meeting of the AFL-CIO last
week, Gore promised to negotiate stronger protections for workers'
rights and the environment if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking minority member of the committee, Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York, was even harsher in his assessment of
how the administration has handled an agreement on which much of
the United States-China relationship now hinges.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, he said, has not yet sent a bill to Congress
to grant China permanent ``normal'' trade status _ the one U.S.
concession in an accord that opens China's markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has to know that they have to get this
thing done in two to four weeks,'' Moynihan said in an interview
Wednesday afternoon, describing a timetable for a vote far speedier
than what the White House is considering. ``After that this whole
thing is in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say they disagree and want a vote before
the summer. But the timetable is partly up to the Republicans, and
administration officials met Wednesday with Sen. Trent Lott, the
majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has begun a lobbying campaign on the China
deal, meeting members of Congress in small groups in the yellow
Oval Room in the White House residence, and will speak on the issue
on Thursday morning in front of the Business Council, a group of 75
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The White House insists that it can win passage of the deal by
relying on the support of Republicans, and by winning over 70 to 90
Democrats. But it is far from clear they will get that support.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Democrats, pressured by labor's opposition to the trade deal,
are far more leery. Gore promised last week to get labor and
environmental protections into a subsequent agreement with China,
but Moynihan said Wednesday that ``the Chinese won't sign that
deal, so we won't have any future trade agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments put the White House in what one administration
official said this week was ``an intellectually indefensible
position.'' By suggesting that he would press for a better deal
later, Gore gave political cover to those Democrats who want to
skip the vote this year. And plenty want to do exactly that, after
the unions have made clear that they will work to defeat, district
by district, members of Congress who vote for the China agreement.
</P>
<P>
   This week China also made passage more complex. Its 11,000 word
report on Taiwan, released on Monday, suggested that Beijing would
feel free to use military force to reunify the mainland with the
Republic of China if negotiations with Taiwan drag on for too long.
That drew a sharp response from the Pentagon and from conservative
Republicans who see China as an emerging security threat to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a bizarre political alliance between conservatives
in Congress and labor and environmental groups opposed to the China
deal.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Finance Committee Wednesday, Charlene
Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, made no direct
references to either Gore or the threats against Taiwan. She told
Roth and Moynihan that she was testifying ``with the full support
of the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also argued that while Congress could debate the issue
endlessly, it really had no choice other than to sign on to the
deal _ or risk putting U.S. firms at a huge competitive
disadvantage in the world's largest and fastest-growing market.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the administration is going to have to give
ground to its critics. Some supporters of the trade organization
deal say that may mean approving more arms for Taiwan _ which
enrages Beijing _ or may mean finding a way to enforce Chinese
compliance with the deal that would appease the critics.

 &HT;    'GOLDEN DOLLAR' IS MOST POPULAR COIN EVER, MINT DIRECTOR SAYS
 &HT;    340&AMP;add.
 &HT;    With photos.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ``golden dollar'' is the most popular new coin
in American history, the director of the U.S. Mint said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 million gold-colored dollar coins have been put
into circulation since Jan. 26, and more than 1 billion may be
produced by the end of the year, Mint Director Philip N. Diehl told
the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   The last dollar coin produced by the Mint was the ill-fated
Susan B. Anthony dollar, which was roundly rejected for looking too
much like a quarter. It took that coin 14 years to reach the 500
million circulation level.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the golden coin is so great that the Mint doubled its
production two weeks ago to 5 million a day, ``which means we are
meeting the Susan B. Anthony annual demand every 11 days,'' Diehl
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have banks and retailers all over the country who are
clamoring for ... delivery of the coin as fast as we can possibly
make it and as fast as the armored car industry in the United
States can deliver them.''
</P>
<P>
   The uniqueness and beauty of the new coin, combined with its
initial scarcity, is spurring demand from the general public, Diehl
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are attracted to it because it's such a beautiful
product. It really is a stunningly beautiful product, and it
connects with people, and they want to have and hold it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Public hoarding of the coin is likely to continue until the Mint
can produce enough coins that ``everybody has as many as they want,
and then they really start using it on a day-to-day basis,'' Diehl
said.
</P>
<P>
   The golden dollar bears the likeness of Sacagawea, the young
Shoshone woman who guided explorers Lewis and Clark on their
westward journey two centuries ago. The reverse side depicts a
soaring eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Although made of a different alloy than the Susan B. Anthony
dollar, the golden dollar is the same size and _ in a feat of
engineering _ can be used in vending machines that accept the
earlier coin.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the coins were distributed to Federal Reserve banks _
which then sold them to local banks _ and through Wal-Mart stores.
Wal Mart purchased 94 million coins and began giving them as change
on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint decided to distribute the coins through Wal-Mart to
demonstrate their popularity and to reinforce the concept that
these were ``working'' coins, not merely collectibles, Diehl said.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, local 7-Eleven stores also were scheduled to receive
some of the first shipments of the golden dollars, but the company
backed out just before their release, citing concern for their
salespeople's security.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint plans wider distribution of the coin in the coming
weeks, Diehl said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning March 6, the Mint will unveil a $40 million
advertising campaign designed to urge the public to use, not hoard,
the new coin.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising campaign will be financed by the Mint's profit
on sales of the coin. It costs 12 cents to manufacture the $1 coin.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the new coin confounded banks and retailers
``who told us the American public doesn't want this coin,'' Diehl
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their experience with the Susan B. Anthony
dollar, banks and retailers argued that the public would not use a
dollar coin as long as the dollar bill remained in circulation. But
Diehl said he expects both to be accepted and there is little
political support for eliminating the dollar bill.
</P>
<P>
   The public's acceptance may be traced to the results of an
Internet survey the Mint conducted to get people's reactions to a
series of questions about a new coin.
</P>
<P>
   More than 11.7 million people checked the Mint's Internet site
the first day of the survey and more than 120,000 e-mail messages
were received during the survey.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the gold-colored coin, the Mint also is producing
the second year of the 10-year state quarter series, featuring a
design chosen by each state on the reverse side. Five state
quarters are being minted each year in the order they ratified the
Constitution or were admitted as states.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar and the quarter will impose a huge demand on the
Mint's production capabilities, Diehl said. Last year, the Mint
produced a record 20 billion coins. This year, the Mint will likely
produce 29 billion coins.

KEEP THE FAITH, BUSH'S ALLIES IN CONGRESS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Maine, Pa.)  (rk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there was one Republican mantra flowing in and
out of the Senate cloakroom and Capitol Hill hideaways Wednesday,
following George W. Bush's defeat in Michigan, it was this: don't
panic, don't abandon common sense.
</P>
<P>
   No one can win the Republican nomination without Republican
votes, and Bush is way ahead of McCain in that respect, Bush's
congressional allies said Wednesday. And the future is filled with
far fewer open primaries _ those elections where Democrats can vote
for Republicans, something that carried McCain to victory in New
Hampshire and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be the Republican nominee if you can't get a
majority of Republicans to vote for you,'' Sen. Gordon Smith,
R-Ore., and Bush supporter, said bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine and a Bush
ally, called the Michigan victory an ``out and out surprise,''
especially considering Bush's win in South Carolina and the strong
backing he received from Michigan's Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Smith, she said Bush allies were crunching the numbers
and, for now, staying the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that Republican supporters of Bush have
taken comfort in is that if it had just been Republicans voting in
Michigan, it would have been a smashing victory and even with
independents factored in it would have been a win, although
narrowly,'' Collins said. ``But we recognize that he has tough
fight ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate cloakroom, McCain's victory has prompted yet
another round of puzzlement over how a man disliked by many
Republicans in the Senate has been able to turn the tables on them.
Only four Senate Republicans openly support his bid.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush needs to do, Republicans agreed Wednesday, is
reconnect with the idea of ``compassionate conservatism,'' which
made him so appealing to a broad cross section of Republicans in
the first place. And, they added, he needs to tone down the
negative campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has connected with some because he looks like he is
giving them straight talk and it appears the governor has
drifted,'' said Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-N.Y., , a Bush ally.
``He is best when he throws away the script and talks from the
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, nobody is underestimating McCain anymore, and a few
Republicans are paying closer attention to what is driving his
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that our party has a lot to learn from what John
McCain is doing in our own efforts to hold the House and hold the
Senate,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who has endorsed neither
McCain nor Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to take a page from his book, and learn from his
moving to the center,'' Specter said. ``Americans want to be
governed by the center. McCain is not exactly writing a new script.
It's an old familiar tune.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter also emphasized McCain's potential strength in a general
election. The power to attract crossover votes from Democrats and
independents, he said, is important and should not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the art of politics,'' Specter added.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, where presidential politics could help decide
whether Republicans keep control or lose it, Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.,
the leader of the effort to elect Republicans in this year's House
races, said he has no reason to fear McCain, although he would
prefer it if Bush were ``up 30 points.'' Some have wondered whether
McCain's anti-Washington message, if he keeps it up, would wind up
hurting incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Davis does not think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings out people who have not been engaged in the process
_ young people, first time voters, independents, the people you
need,'' Davis said of McCain. ``And once they are in the Republican
column for president, they are more likely to stay there than if
they had never come over in the first place. I mean, think about
it. It doesn't scare me.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more skeptical about McCain's ability to draw
Democratic voters to the Republican side in November. Boehlert
called the Democratic turnout for McCain in Michigan on Tuesday, a
``Machiavellian plan, covert or overt'' to help the Democratic
nominee in the long run.

Washington, Georgia and Massachusetts and the `big three'
(California, New York and Ohio), this is a coast-to-cost primary.''
North Dakota, Virginia and Washington hold Republican primaries on
Tuesday. But March 7 is the main event, with 613 Republican
delegates at stake. A candidate needs 1,034 delegates to be the GOP
nominee.

   NEW YORK _ In 1980, before ``True West,'' his play about the
contorted reunion of two estranged brothers, opened at the Magic
Theater in San Francisco, Sam Shepard was asked by a reporter why
he wrote it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to write a play about double nature, one that
wouldn't be symbolic or metaphorical or any of that stuff,''
Shepard replied in an interview in The New York Times Magazine. ``I
just wanted to give a taste of what it feels like to be two-sided.
It's a real thing, double nature. I think we're split in a much
more devastating way than psychology can ever reveal. It's not so
cute. Not some little thing we can get over. It's something we've
got to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, there is something prescient-sounding in
that; the third of three family-nightmare plays Shepard wrote in
the 1970s (``Curse of the Starving Class'' and ``Buried Child'' are
the others), ``True West'' has lingered, a favorite of student
productions and small theater companies, as a work of impact and
influence.
</P>
<P>
   As a new revival gets set to open on March 9 at Circle in the
Square with two rising film actors, John C. Reilly and Philip
Seymour Hoffman, alternating in the brothers' roles, it comes to
Broadway for the first time as perhaps Shepard's most resonant, and
famous, play.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because the fraternal duel to near death that
takes place in an unassuming suburban home is the hyperbolic
reflection of the kind of family conflict that almost anyone can
find, well, familiar. And it is partly because, Shepard's demurral
notwithstanding, there is something metaphorical in the struggle
between Austin, the college-educated, conventionally ambitious
screenwriter, and Lee, the slightly unhinged renegade who supports
himself as a burglar.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers' battle, an increasingly antic squabble over whose
idea for a screenplay describes a more authentic Western story,
sends up Hollywood's appropriation of Americana. Though it devolves
into a mutual primal scream, the conflicts that live within each of
them _ intellect versus loins, dream versus actual experience,
obedience to the code of civilization versus impulse to rebel _
live within the culture as well as in the individual.
</P>
<P>
   Set on the periphery of the Los Angeles suburban sprawl, the
play quite consciously evokes the image of a spoiled and even
perverted American frontier that seems, if anything, more spoiled
and perverted today. Even to the playwright.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle with the land is finished,'' Shepard, now 56,
said in a recent telephone interview from his home in rural
Minnesota. He acknowledged he might well have said the same thing
20 years ago, when the movie-fed celebrity culture was burgeoning _
``True West,'' predated Broadway's most well-known Hollywood
sendups, David Rabe's ``Hurlyburly'' and David Mamet's
``Speed-the-Plow'' _ but he said ``True West'' was never meant as
an assault on Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely futile to criticize Hollywood, not that it
doesn't deserve it,'' Shepard said. ``It simply doesn't care what
your attitude toward it is. The machinery is too powerful, too
awesome. But the seduction of the place is unbelievable, an
extraordinary American thing. Like Las Vegas, it's all about
winning and losing. The play deals with that _ the success and
failure and power. Nobody's ever going to turn that system around;
this is not a Buddhist culture.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he went on, ``now the frontier is the computer, so
it has become an internal thing. Computers cause protracted
dreaming about what might be, and the frontier everyone is seeking
is now in the imagination. That means everything _ relationships,
families _ has taken on a new dimension. We don't even need a
family anymore; you can have an imaginary family. To even talk
about the structure of the family anymore is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Theme is really a bad word, but there's a
current in the play about what's true and what isn't, what is
reality and what's fantasy. The scripts being concocted are the
fantasy, but in the course of it all, the two guys come up with
stories about their father, simple, defined stories about him
losing his teeth, going to Mexico, that are the real stories.
That's the dichotomy I wanted to set up. Where is the actual
experience? Is it in something you hope will come true? Or is it
what is happening to you, moment by moment? I was writing about how
that has lost its meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The current production, directed by an Englishman, Matthew
Warchus (who directed ``Art'' on Broadway), came about when the
director met Ron Kastner, a producer of ``Side Man'' and other
shows. The two agreed to collaborate on ``True West,'' which
Warchus had staged in Leeds and London with the actors Mark Rylance
and Mark Rudko alternating roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a heavy workload for the actors,'' Shepard said
of the role-switching, ``but the play is ideally suited to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Warchus, who also directed the new film version of Shepard's
play ``Simpatico,'' concurred. The switching is not a gimmick, he
said, but a legitimate way to explore a vein tapped by the play
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, the play finds the idea that these two
characters start to assume each other's persona in the story,''
Warchus said. ``And though there is a tendency to see them as
opposites, they are brothers. They have more in common than they
have differences. Shepard has written in the play that random,
arbitrary events have caused this schism in their lifestyles. The
role switch is an echo of that arbitrariness, the idea that it
could have gone another way.''
</P>
<P>
   Warchus said he was directing the play as if it were two
separate productions, to ``celebrate'' the idea that no given
presentation of a work is definitive. ``Audiences believe a
production is more fixed than it actually is,'' he said.
``Certainly, if someone sees it twice, there will be no sense of
repetition.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors will switch roles every three performances. They
intend to flip a coin the day the play opens to determine that
night's casting; the regular rotation, with Hoffman as Austin,
begins the next night, March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Some major critics are being invited to see the play twice, but
whether anyone else will is unknown. The actors (including Robert
LuPone and Celia Weston in secondary roles) are under contract for
16 weeks, until just after the Tony Awards in early June. The idea
is to establish the production, then either extend it with Hoffman
and Reilly or recast it for a longer run.
</P>
<P>
   The star power, said Roy Gabay, the play's executive producer,
is likely to create some repeat business _ ``the groupies, if you
will'' _ and the producers are considering a couple of sales
gambits: reopening the box office at the end of each night's
performance, and offering a discount ticket to both shows on those
two-performance days when the schedule calls for a switch in
between.

 NEW YORK: in between.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Budgeted at $1.2 million, in a 600-seat house (only the Helen
Hayes, at 499 seats, is smaller on Broadway), the production will
need regular sellouts _ or close to it _ to recoup its costs.
</P>
<P>
   The play itself, with its juicy twin parts for youngish actors,
has long had a reputation for star-polishing. Peter Boyle and Tommy
Lee Jones were the original brothers in New York, in an ill-fated
Public Theater production. During rehearsals, disagreements with
Joseph Papp, the Public's autocratic producer, led to the
resignation of the director, Robert Woodruff, causing Shepard to
disavow a production that critics generally clobbered, and
engendering a chill between the playwright and the impresario that
endured until Papp's death in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But the play's first commercial production, which opened in 1982
at the Cherry Lane Theater in the West Village, took on the stature
of legend. ``I can't imagine that everyone who says they saw that
production saw it,'' Gabay said. ``I saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it levitated the careers of two members of
the Chicago-based Steppenwolf company: John Malkovich, whose gift
for sinister bullying received its first wide attention for his
portrayal of Lee, and Gary Sinise, who played Austin and directed
the show as well. Their performances were later filmed for public
television; onstage, the Quaid brothers, Randy and Dennis, followed
them.
</P>
<P>
   That the roles are most naturally inhabited by actors who are
friends or family is, by now, almost a given. With each actor
playing both parts, Warchus said, it's a necessity. ``It requires
actors who are confident but without a lot of ego about trespassing
on each other's territory,'' he said. ``A lot of actors prepare
half in secret, to surprise the other actors. But I needed them to
be confiding in each other. As a director, I have to be more laid
back, because I'm here trying to generate two productions. I can't
select out something good too soon, because that might intimidate
the other production. On the other hand, you can't be afraid to do
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Reilly, 34, and Hoffman, 32, whose profiles have been
increasingly burnished by the three films they have performed in
together _ ``Hard Eight,'' ``Boogie Nights'' and the current
``Magnolia,'' all directed by Paul Thomas Anderson _ the lure of
``True West'' was both the stature of the play and the opportunity
to make use of their friendship onstage. Reilly was cast first; he
suggested Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly recalled: ``Before I met Phil, Paul Anderson said to me,
`I met this amazing actor; he's the next John C. Reilly.' And I
was, like, `Why would you say something like that to me?' So it's
come full circle. Now, when I'm asked for someone to play my
brother, it totally makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know how rehearsals proceeded because the actors
declined several requests to allow an observer in the room. Asked
how their performances differed, neither would respond with
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hesitant to sort of categorize anything, because it's
still evolving,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman added: ``You can do a scene as Austin and have a grip on
it, and then do it as Lee and you're struggling, but you still feel
connected to the same scene. It's hard to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that the burden of preparing two separate roles
has been more daunting than anticipated; opening night was
originally scheduled for this Thursday but was postponed a week.
</P>
<P>
   Both actors spoke with some awe of the playwright himself, who
was present during the first week of rehearsals. And both revealed
their eagerness to give Austin his due; Malkovich's performance as
Lee, they said, has lingered so long in everyone's mind that Austin
has gotten a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great joys I'm getting out of this is, as a public
service, in showing people how great the part of Austin is,''
Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman concluded: ``One thing I have found out is that not one
of these parts is better than the other. It's pretty astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard said that all he did during the rehearsals was stay out
of the way and talk a bit about his personal connection to the
play. Shepard grew up mostly in Duarte, Calif., on an avocado ranch
at the edge of the Mojave desert. He had two sisters, but no
brother; like Lee and Austin, however, he had a wayward father. He
said he told the actors, neither of whom is from the West ( Reilly
grew up in Chicago, Hoffman outside Rochester), about the desert's
strange and eerie allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty strong influence,'' Shepard said, ``this vast
empty thing out there, the heat and all the rest of it, on
temperament and things like longing _ as in longing to get the hell
out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   He understood, he said, why Hoffman and Reilly were so drawn to
the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of play actors love to handle,'' Shepard said.
``There's a lot of stuff in there that men, in particular, love to
grapple with. At its heart is this conflict between the intellect
and the emotions, the physical wild man part and the reasonable
intellectual side. You know, what it really means to be a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds a little trite, but there's not a whole lot of men
who know what a man is, and I always thought it was weird that
American men haven't resolved this; the American male is in
conflict, uniquely in conflict in the cultures of the West. You're
either a rassler or you're a book guy, and I think they're getting
farther and farther apart; there's a bigger gap between the macho
man and the other one.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard said he had just finished a new play, ``The Late Henry
Moss,'' which he described as ``a father-and-son kind of deal.''
Asked what it was about, he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same stuff,'' he said. ``Same old stuff.''

HONEYWELL IS EXPANDING ITS PRESENCE ON THE WEB
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chalk up another distinction between Honeywell, the $8 billion
instruments and controls company, and Honeywell, the $24 billion
diversified manufacturer that was formed when it merged with
AlliedSignal.
</P>
<P>
   The old Honeywell had a Web site, operating since July, called
MyPlant.com. It was a forum for plant managers, engineers and other
operations people to exchange ideas, use Honeywell software to
simulate their processes, buy Honeywell products and even view
banner ads from other manufacturers. All of it was free, even the
ads. And Honeywell ran the site alone.
</P>
<P>
   The new Honeywell, though, has promised Wall Street heady growth
and has often said it will look to strategic partnerships to get
it.
</P>
<P>
   And here is the latest sign: Thursday, Honeywell, based in
Morristown, N.J., plans to announce that it will work with
Microsoft to increase MyPlant.com's reach and offerings
significantly. The site, which will use Microsoft's new Windows DNA
2000 operating system, will offer the same types of services and
software programs, only far more of them. And it will charge for
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Bonsignore, the chief executive of Honeywell,
predicts that traffic at the site, which he said already has 30,000
users a month, will increase tenfold, and will generate $500
million in revenues by 2003. ``MyPlant now has the credibility of
Microsoft's technology and access to Microsoft customers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the site's main purpose, Bonsignore said, is to generate
more customers for Honeywell products. And to do that, he said, it
must become ``an e-hub, the portal of choice for industrial
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he said he was talking to Rockwell International, Emerson
Electric and other Honeywell competitors about joining forces on
the site. ``I suspect Honeywell will eventually be a minority
shareholder in the site, but that will be fine if it gives us
access to more customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which has bought a small equity stake in MyPlant.com,
views its participation as a way to introduce its technology to
more industrial customers, as well as a way to help some of its own
customers interact with industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``MyPlant.com is a great showcase for our platform technology
and may someday be a delivery vehicle for tutorials or
manufacturing-oriented software,'' said Laura Jennings, vice
president for worldwide strategic planning at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   MyPlant is not Honeywell's only Web foray. In a few months it
will introduce MyAircraft.com, which it has set up with United
Technologies and i2 Technologies, which sells industrial software.
The site will enable customers to buy technical information, use
inventory control software and buy parts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Honeywell and United Technologies compete for aircraft
engine sales, their replacement parts are not interchangeable, so
they can easily sell the parts jointly on the Web. ``No one's going
to buy a $10 million engine online, but it's a great way to reach
aircraft maintenance companies,'' said Peter Dalpe, a United
Technologies spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore predicted that MyAircraft.com would bring in more
than $80 million its first year; he is talking with other aircraft
companies about joining the site.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell plans another Web site, MyFacility.com, for the
construction industry. It is talking with United Technologies,
which also makes elevators and climate-control systems, about
working together on that site, too.
</P>
<P>
   `'Amazon.com, eToys, all those Web companies are building the
back end of their business,'' Bonsignore said. ``We've got the
customer relationships, the warehouses, the factories, all the
back-end things down pat. We're reinventing the front end, the part
that makes it easy to do business with us.''

 &HT;    Ohio Valley smog stats set off alarm
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The worst examples of lung-choking smog have
always been associated with large cities on the East Coast, but the
Midwest may be just as bad or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Cities like New York, Boston and Philadelphia have higher peaksof ground-based ozone pollution, but people in the Ohio River
Valley are exposed to dirty air for longer periods of time. A new
study by the Ohio Environmental Council concludes the longer
exposure has a more serious impact on health.
</P>
<P>
   The year-long study, Ohio Valley, Ozone Alley, found that people
in the Midwest are exposed to dangerous levels of ozone pollution
up to 75 percent more often than those in Boston and New York.
Hospital admission rates for smog-related problems, such as asthma
attacks and emphysema, also were higher for the Midwest than the
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past several years, the discussion has been about our
effect on East Coast pollution,'' said John Paul, director of the
Regional Air Pollution Control Agency, or RAPCA. ``This report
shows that we have our own problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A monitoring station in Springfield usually shows the highest
readings in the Miami Valley from April to October _ smog season _
when nitrogen oxide (NOx), chemicals in the air and sunlight
combine to form smog. Springfield is downwind of pollution from
both Dayton and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``This past season, we had two high readings in Montgomery
County, as well,'' Paul said. Those pollution levels exceeded the
permissible federal standard.
</P>
<P>
   Older Midwest coal and oil power plants, which do not have to
meet the same standard as newer plants, generated 50 percent of the
nitrogen oxide produced in the Ohio Valley, the study said. The
power plants alone, were capable of causing smog readings above
federal standards, when added to normal background ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Health effects from smog include shortness of breath, asthma
attacks, decreased lung capacity and impaired immune system
defenses against respiratory illness.
</P>
<P>
   As many as one in five Americans are especially susceptible to
lung problems, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   That group includes children, whose lungs are not fully formed;
the elderly; people with respiratory diseases; mail carriers and
those who work outdoors; and cyclists, joggers and others who
engage in intensive outdoor exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The study reports that in 1997 alone, unhealthy smog levels
contributed to: 83,000 asthma attacks in the Ohio Valley; 1,909
visits to the emergency room; and 636 hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   While respiratory diseases have a complex array of causes,
recent studies strongly point to smog as a major factor, said
George Liekauf, a molecular toxicologist at the University of
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a study of healthy college kids, exposing them to
ozone for 6.6 hours and they started to see a detrimental effect
after four hours,'' Liekauf said. ``A study of students at Berkeley
compared lung function to the student's ZIP code. Those from high
pollution areas had the worst lung function.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency attempted to tighten
the regulations on smog, under the Clean Air Act in 1997, but the
effort was blocked by a federal court that said the agency had
unconstitutionally taken on legislative powers. The court, however,
did agree that the studies were scientific, and there were health
effects from smog.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio EPA has opposed adopting the U.S. EPA's more stringent
standards for both ozone and particulate matter.
</P>
<P>
   David Flannery of the Midwest Ozone Group, which represents
power companies, said that the report used the stringent proposed
standards, which are not in effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mixture of bad science and bad law,'' he said.
``Nearly all of this area is in compliance with the present
standard.''

ON THE ROAD TOWARD HOPE: KURT WEILL'S CELEBRATION OF THE JEWS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 27) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 63 years of dormancy if not oblivion, ``The
Eternal Road,'' Kurt Weill's vast, emotionally gripping musical
pageant of Jewish history, is returning to the city of its
premiere, but in a form that may perplex and even infuriate its
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday evening, the Brooklyn Academy of Music will
present the complete four-act version of the work, known in German
as ``Der Weg der Verheissung'' (``The Road of Promise''), in a
production that originated last year at the Theater Chemnitz in
Germany. Under the musical direction of John Mauceri, it will be
sung and acted in German, with supertitles.
</P>
<P>
   The original text, written in 1934 by the Austrian novelist
Franz Werfel, has been rewritten in a way that will either assuage
or outrage post-Holocaust sensibilities by reflecting horrors that
neither Werfel, nor Weill, nor Max Reinhardt, the original
director, could have foreseen. The Brooklyn audience may feel that
a work meant to celebrate Jewish history in its darkest hour has
been ambushed to become a well-intentioned but irrelevant
reinterpretation of the German past.
</P>
<P>
   Composed in Paris in 1934, performed in English in New York
three years later, then largely lost and slowly reconstructed,
``The Eternal Road'' reflects the very last moment of what the
Chemnitz program notes call Judeo-German culture. Werfel's play
portrays a besieged Jewish community of no specific time or place.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for the king to decide their fate, a collection of
Jewish types assemble overnight in the synagogue. One man is pious
but intolerant. Another supports the synagogue with his money but
has no interest in religion. A non-Jewish woman arouses the anger
of others by seeking asylum with her Jewish husband. (Reinhardt,
Weill and Werfel all married non-Jews.) And a cynic, called the
Adversary, sneers at every aspect of the faith.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor, who has hidden his Jewish identity to advance his
career, arrives with his 13-year-old son (originally played by the
young Sidney Lumet), who in the course of the drama will accept the
burden of his heritage. (``It's really a big bar mitzvah,'' says
Mauceri.) The Rabbi tries to comfort the congregation by retelling
biblical stories, from the calling of Abraham, which introduces the
musical motifs of the Promise and the Road, to the destruction of
the First Temple.
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue scenes are spoken by actors throughout the show.
As the Rabbi begins to chant the biblical tale, soloists and
choruses enact the stories, and the work assumes its musical form.
The play moves back and forth between the two levels of action, and
as the relevance of the biblical stories to the synagogue's fate
becomes increasingly clear, the music unites the two spheres.
</P>
<P>
   The Adversary appears in the biblical frame, leading the dance
around the golden calf. When the story of the destruction of the
temple is completed, the king's messenger appears, decreeing that
all Jews must leave or face death. The congregants accept their
fate and, led by the 13-year-old boy, march out of the city to an
unknown destination, the next stop on the Eternal Road.
</P>
<P>
   After much discussion and compromise among the Kurt Weill
Foundation; Mauceri; Gerhard Muller, the Chemnitz dramaturge; and
Michael Heinicke, the director, the work was supplied with a new
ending. A Gestapolike force invades the synagogue and demands that
the Rabbi set fire to the Torah scrolls. The Adversary says that he
is the Rabbi and is shot. The congregants are marched off to their
doom. Only the boy remains. While true to later events, the new
ending falsifies Werfel's political and theological ideas, which
were controversial even in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   The saga of ``The Eternal Road'' exemplifies the adage about too
many cooks or, in this case, too many geniuses. Werfel, Weill and
Reinhardt, brought together by the Polish-born American Zionist
Meyer Weisgal to create a ``musical response to Hitler,'' had
radically different ideas about the work and about their own
relation to Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Weill descended on both sides of his family from distinguished
lines of German rabbis and cantors, and although he broke with
Judaism in his student days, married a non-Jew, Lotte Lenya, and
was even buried in a nonreligious ceremony, he never disowned his
Jewish identity.
</P>
<P>
   Werfel, by contrast, had a passionately religious spirit that
was drawn to the rituals and mysteries of Roman Catholicism, though
he never took the final step of conversion. Reinhardt described
himself as a ``pious Jew'' but viewed his religion as a private
matter. His most famous German productions, ``Everyman'' and ``The
Miracle,'' dealt with Christian themes.
</P>
<P>
   Until the rise of Hitler, the three collaborators all thought of
themselves as German artists of Jewish origin, not Jewish artists,
and all had rejected Zionism as well as other forms of Jewish
``particularism.'' Their position was typical of many German and
Austrian Jews who lived an assimilated existence and identified
strongly with the culture of Goethe, Schiller and Kant, Mozart,
Beethoven and Mendelssohn. By 1934, the Nazis were implementing
laws and policies that would destroy forever any such notion of a
German-Jewish synthesis.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting in Reinhardt's palatial villa in Salzburg,
Austria, the three collaborators went their own creative ways.
Werfel thought of the work as a play with incidental music and
wrote the script without consulting Weill, who independently began
to envision a Jewish equivalent of Bach's Passions or Handel's
``Messiah.'' Reinhardt, the Julie Taymor and Steven Spielberg of
his time, imagined an eye-dazzling spectacle, and in the end he
prevailed, as the awe-struck reviews of the premiere show.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing Reinhardt's vision, the American designer Norman Bel
Geddes built a five-tiered stage, leading up from the synagogue to
the heavens. The set filled the orchestra pit, so the score had to
be pre-recorded stereophonically on film stock, by Leopold
Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra.

 NEW YORK: Philadelphia Orchestra.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some accounts of the opening night claim that the curtain came
down at 2 a.m. and that the fourth act was a technical fiasco,
others that the curtain was down before midnight but that the score
had been heavily cut. Critics appear to have left after two acts to
meet their deadlines, but they liked what they saw and heard.
</P>
<P>
   In The New York Post, John Mason Brown described the show as ``a
racial pageant that rises to moments of such visual beauty and
magnificence as the modern theater has never seen equaled or
approached.'' Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times praised Weill's
music as the ``lifeblood'' of the production.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rave notices and an 18-week run, the exact nature of the
initial production remains a mystery. The recording of the
orchestral music has vanished, as have all the instrumental parts.
</P>
<P>
   Lenya kept the original copy of the score in a closet, ``next to
the vacuum cleaner,'' Mauceri said. That score, too, is missing,
although several photocopies were made before it disappeared. Even
Weill's score was incomplete, said Edward Harsh, a composer and
musicologist who is the director of publications at the Kurt Weill
Foundation and was mainly responsible for reassembling the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weill composed very quickly,'' Harsh explained. ``The score
often lacks a vocal line, and I had to choose between melodies in
the orchestra.'' The most helpful document that remained was
Reinhardt's promptbook, which detailed all the cuts in the music
and text, but many of these were made at the last minute, for
technical rather than artistic reasons. No urtext remains of the
1937 production; any performance today is a result of
reconstruction, conjecture and directorial approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1937 production was a Max Reinhardt spectacle,'' Harsh
said. ``Chemnitz did not have the capability to mount that kind of
staging, so the work now feels more like an opera.'' The Chemnitz
version also cuts many of Werfel's spoken lines, especially in the
rancorous prologue in the synagogue. Harsh says that most of the
cuts were made in the interest of brevity, but the new ending
clearly reflects political concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has been trying to resurrect ``The Eternal Road''
since the 1980s. The English musicologist David Drew assembled
material from the third and fourth acts into an excerpt called
``Propheten'' (``Prophets''), which was performed in 1989 in
London. Leon Botstein and the American Symphony Orchestra presented
Acts III and IV in English in 1998 in New York, not using the Drew
edition.
</P>
<P>
   The four-act version _ one hesitates to call it the original _
was finally staged in Chemnitz last June, after the German company
agreed to produce the work with the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the
New Israeli Opera in Tel Aviv and Opera Cracow in Poland, and to
bring in Mauceri, a longtime champion of Weill's music.
</P>
<P>
   Chemnitz, known in the old East Germany as Karl-Marx-Stadt, has
no particular associations with Weill, who was born in Dessau and
lived in Berlin, but it has one of the largest and most
technologically advanced stages in Germany. The ``Weg der
Verheissung'' production was part of a post-unification program of
restitution, which included the rebuilding of the city's synagogue.
But Chemnitz had gone from 12 years of Nazi rule to 50 years of
communism. There was no remaining Jewish community. The former
German Democratic Republic considered itself free of all
responsibility for the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did the cast know very little about Jews,'' Harsh
said, ``but they didn't even know the biblical stories.'' Eastern
Europe has shown a capacity for anti-Semitism in the absence of
Jews, but there have also been many recent incidents of
philo-Semitism, like festivals of klezmer music in Berlin and
Warsaw, which attract mainly non-Jewish audiences. Yet the reaction
of German music critics to the Chemnitz production focused on the
work's place in German history.
</P>
<P>
   West German critics, still clinging to the dichotomy of the good
Brecht-Weill of the 1920s and the bad American Weill, held their
noses at the ``Broadway'' harmonies and scoring. Faulting the music
for its failure to speak in the language of atonal Expressionism,
they perpetuated the idea that in leaving Germany for America,
Weill had gone from a civilized nation to a barbaric one.
</P>
<P>
   East German critics, by contrast, praised Weill as an
antifascist, whose popular style was comparable to the idiom of
Hanns Eisler and Paul Dessau, both of whom returned to East Germany
from the United States after the war. In the absence of a Jewish
audience, the work became a pawn in the battle over the German
past.
</P>
<P>
   But in Brooklyn, the audience, like those who saw it in 1937,
will judge ``Der Weg der Verheissung'' as a statement of Jewish
history, a task complicated by a German-language performance, which
will distance the work and give the music and the drama their own
``particularism.'' And once beyond that barrier, the audience will
still face the challenge of the play's politics and its musical
idiom, for it is not only West Germans who prefer Weill as Weimar
radical to the later composer of ``Lady in the Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   The revised ending, in fact, either disguises or deliberately
undermines the troubling political position that remains in
Werfel's script. In the fourth act, two prophets contend before
King Zedekiah as he faces destruction by Babylonian armies. A false
prophet, Chananiah, argues for armed resistance, while Jeremiah
calls for peace and penitence.
</P>
<P>
   In the politics of 1934, this juxtaposition would translate into
a plea for appeasement. Werfel, like many others, believed that
boycotts from outside would only make things worse for German Jews.
Viewed unsympathetically, as it is easy to do today, Werfel's
assumption that some gesture of Jewish penitence would save the
people can seem like the terminal delusion of German Jewish
assimilationism and self-hatred. But editing Werfel's politics robs
the work of what Botstein calls its ``heartbreaking naivete'' and
sabotages the theme of Promise, which unifies the play.

 NEW YORK: the play.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weill dedicated the score of ``The Eternal Road'' to his father,
Albert Weill, a cantor, and his music reaffirmed ties to the
synagogue in which he had grown up. Before beginning work on the
score, he wrote down 200 synagogue melodies from memory, then went
to the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris to check their authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   From beginning to end, the score is full of melodies that would
have been familiar to Western European Jews but that, with the
exception of the Kol Nidre melody sung in the show by King David,
American Jews may not recognize and may even find disturbingly
Germanic. While American synagogue music today sounds Eastern
European, or Israeli, or American, the music of the German
synagogue echoed the melodic shapes of Schubert and the harmonies
of Mendelssohn yet had its own historical integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Weill's use of important German-Jewish melodies is pervasive and
always dramatically apt, with themes from the Shavuoth and Yom
Kippur services matched to crucial events in the play. Audiences
today will notice a melodic warmth uncharacteristic of earlier
Weill _ Mauceri refers to the music's ``new generosity'' _ without
recognizing that this new feeling derives from carefully borrowed
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Although it never sounds Jewish in the manner of Ernest Bloch or
Leonard Bernstein or Jerry Bock, ``The Eternal Road'' is in fact a
musical reliquary for a vanished liturgical tradition that no one
in Chemnitz remembered and few in New York will remember, either.
</P>
<P>
   But audiences will notice, and may resist, many familiar Weill
melodic and rhythmic gestures deployed in surprising ways. There
are tangos out of ``Mahagonny'' and march tunes reminiscent of
``The Seven Deadly Sins,'' divorced from their Brechtian irony, and
precursors of ``September Song,'' which seem at odds with the
biblical setting. After the golden calf is destroyed, Moses sings a
psalm of praise to a fox trot, which cries out for a Hawaiian
guitar accompaniment, and the march tune associated with the idea
of the Way seems to trigger all the wrong associations; one West
German critic said it sounded like a Gestapo march.
</P>
<P>
   Many Weill scholars, though befuddled by these stylistic
swerves, have pointed out that the work is somehow powerfully
moving in spite of its mixed idiom. But Botstein sees the work's
power as stemming precisely from its style.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music demythologizes the characters in the story and puts
them on a human scale,'' Botstein said. ``Weill does not give us a
Michelangelo Moses, but a person like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Werfel and Weill emphasize human emotion rather than the
abstractions that preoccupied Schoenberg in ``Moses und Aron.'' The
pop melody Moses sings may seem shockingly banal at first, but it
gradually, cunningly convinces listeners of its sincerity, as if
Moses were so surprised by God's power that he could only sing
straight from his heart. The tune sets up the dramatic angle that
interests Werfel and Weill but not Schoenberg: the death of Moses
before he can reach the Promised Land, beautifully rendered in a
dialogue with the Angel of Death, in which Moses pleads for life.
</P>
<P>
   For advocates of the two-Weill theory, ``The Eternal Road'' is
the shaky bridge between two inimical worlds. But as Weill's
complete work becomes more familiar, his Jewish pageant may appear
the keystone of a single-minded creative project. His warmer
melodic language had already appeared in the opera ``Die
Burgschaft'' and the Second Symphony; his commitment to the
political function of music would continue in ``Johnny Johnson''
and ``Lost in the Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s Weill rejected the complexities of art music in the
service of radical politics. After 1933, he saw ``that the
oppressors were now the oppressed,'' as Botstein said, and embraced
bourgeois culture and liberal democracy. Going on to collaborate
with Paul Green and Langston Hughes, he became, politically, a man
of the left in the American rather than the European sense, but
this change only confirmed his populist musical instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the entire well of the European tradition, including
modernist experiment, as poisoned, Weill took on the appearance of
a Broadway tunesmith but brought to American musical theater a
technical sophistication and intellectual self-consciousness it had
lacked.
</P>
<P>
   As melodists, Cole Porter and Richard Rodgers could run circles
around Weill, but neither of them, nor even Gershwin, could have
composed the contrapuntal choruses, large-scale musical forms and
lucid orchestrations that may one day win ``The Eternal Road'' a
secure place in the repertory.

   ETERNAL-ROAD-MUSICAL (New York) _ After 63 years of dormancy if
not oblivion, ``The Eternal Road,'' Kurt Weill's vast, emotionally
gripping musical pageant of Jewish history, is returning to the
city of its premiere, but in a form that may perplex and even
infuriate its audience. Beginning Monday evening, the Brooklyn
Academy of Music will present the complete four-act version of the
work, known in German as ``Der Weg der Verheissung'' (``The Road of
Promise''), in a production that originated last year in Chemnitz,
Germany. Under the musical direction of John Mauceri, it will be
sung and acted in German (with supertitles). The original text,
written in 1934 by the Austrian novelist Franz Werfel, has been
rewritten in a way that will either assuage or outrage
post-Holocaust sensibilities by reflecting horrors that neither
Werfel, nor Weill, nor Max Reinhardt, the original director, could
have foreseen. By David Schiff. (Moved). &QL;

   JEWS-IN-PALESTINE-FILM (Undated) _ ``The Life of the Jews in
Palestine'' _ which was produced in 1913 by the Odessa-based
Mizrakh Company and presumed to be lost for some 80 years _ has
resurfaced in New York. Showing on March 6 and 7, in an excellent
new print with English intertitles at the Museum of Modern Art,
Noah Sokolovsky's 78-minute silent film is quite likely the rarest

   MORRISSEY-FILMS (New York) _ Paul Morrissey disdains rock music,
abhors recreational drugs and thinks even less of liberal politics.
Such sentiments may seem surprising coming from a director whose
films luxuriate in the libertine lives of heroin users,
masturbating transvestites and polymorphous-perverse male
prostitutes. Yet Morrissey _ who from 1966 to 1972 directed more
than half a dozen movies produced by Andy Warhol, discovered the
avant-garde rock band the Velvet Underground and once saw a court
label his work ``obscene, vulgar and profane'' _ believes he's
misunderstood, to say nothing of misrepresented. ``Every movie I've
ever made says the same thing,'' said Morrissey, 61, recently at
Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel. Presumably, that includes ``Trash,''
which will be shown at the New York Underground Film Festival at
Anthology Film Archives on Friday and open in New York and Los
Angeles on March 17 to mark its 30th anniversary. By David Bahr.

   BROADWAY-MUSICALS-FORM (Undated) _ At the beginning of a new
century, the only formulas regularly exploited by Broadway
producers, an unimaginative lot by and large, involve rote
recycling. The anthology format, in which old songs and dance steps
are combined into synthetic theme packages (``Smokey Joe's Cafe,''
``Fosse,'' ``Swing''), has become popular, as have, pathetically,
freeze-dried stage adaptations of movie musicals (``Footloose,''
``Saturday Night Fever''). And there are always, as there should
be, revivals of musical classics. But signs of fresher, more vital
life are stirring in shows that have, for the most part, originated
Off Broadway. They are different enough from one another to
preclude any ideas of sweeping trends with coattails to cling to.
They each, however, meet the criterion demanded of any successful
musical, and most successful works of art in general: the ability
to seduce us into an alternative reality that is utterly consistent
on its own terms. By Ben Brantley. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   HOUSE-ARREST-THEATER (Undated) _ Anna Deavers Smith tried not to
get up there onstage and do it herself. For the first time since
she became famous for recreating _ to the last gesture and vocal
tic _ dozens of real-life individuals, based on her actual
conversations with them, she decided not to perform her own work.
Instead, she cast actors in ``House Arrest,'' her latest foray into
the nation's psyche, this time focusing on the role of the American
presidency, from Thomas Jefferson to Bill Clinton. By Robin

   LARAMIE-PROJECT-THEATER (Denver) _ Could the town of Laramie,
Wyo., ever return to its docile anonymity, or would it forever
carry a murderous stigma as a place of intolerance, where a gay
man, Matthew Shepard, was killed for being gay? Who could really
know? Most of the cameras left. But a curious group of
interrogators stayed behind, and out of what they learned over a
year of visits, during which they tape-recorded interviews with 200
Laramie residents, Moises Kaufman has crafted his latest play. The
artistic director of the Tectonic Theater Project in New York,
Kaufman has created ``The Laramie Project,'' an attempt to unpeel
the layers of a town to understand how ordinary people might be
affected by extraordinary events. The play was scheduled to open
Saturday night at the Ricketson Theater in Denver and run through
April 1. By Michael Janofsky. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   TRUE-WEST-THEATER (New York) _ In 1980, before ``True West,''
his play about the contorted reunion of two estranged brothers,
opened at the Magic Theater in San Francisco, Sam Shepard was asked
by a reporter why he wrote it. ``I wanted to write a play about
double nature, one that wouldn't be symbolic or metaphorical or any
of that stuff,'' Shepard replied in an interview in The New York
Times Magazine. Twenty years later, there is something
prescient-sounding in that; the third of three family-nightmare
plays Shepard wrote in the 1970s (``Curse of the Starving Class''
and ``Buried Child'' are the others), ``True West'' has lingered, a
favorite of student productions and small theater companies, as a
work of impact and influence. As a new revival gets set to open on

   MUSIC-MAN (Mason City, Iowa) _ Driving along the snow-encrusted
streets of Mason City recently, Carl R. Miller, executive director
of the preservation-minded Mason City Foundation, could not have
been prouder of the inspirational role this old northern Iowa
industrial town played in the history of the American musical
``Music Man.'' As the model for the place immortalized in Meredith
Willson's musical, it is, in a sense, a landmark of the
imagination, a locality redrawn in the mind of one of its most
illustrious natives and reinvented on a stage as an emblem of
prairie innocence and brass-band sentimentality. The show, which
tells the story of a con man who sells the citizenry on the dream
of a boys' band he has no intention of leading, was the smash hit
of the 1957-58 season. ``The Music Man'' is back, in a major new
production directed and choreographed by one of the theater's
reigning talents, Susan Stroman. The musical opens at the Neil
Simon Theater on April 27. By Peter Marks. (Moved).

   REAL-EVENTS-THEATER (Undated) _ Theater, a medium reliant on
flights of imagination, is not exactly a place where precise
depictions of real events are common. But this season, a handful of
plays on New York stages and beyond are demonstrating a strong
adherence to the facts, with documentary-style texts that have been
drawn verbatim from interviews and transcripts. By Jesse Mckinley.

   KURT-WEILL-MUSIC (Undated) _ Kurt Weill rarely wrote for the
notorious Weimar-era cabarets of Berlin. Still, the popular
misimpression that identifies him with the Berlin haunts of
Isherwood and Sally Bowles is understandable. Weill's music from
this period simply sounds so deliciously dangerous. Its harsh
beauty and dissonant lyricism embody everything we believe Berlin
cabaret to have been: sardonic, sophisticated, gorgeously profane.
It is therefore tempting in this, Weill's centennial year (his
100th Birthday is Thursday), to look to his musical world for
instruction: How can our own less-than-scintillating cabaret scene
rediscover the passion, the artfulness and the engagement of
Weill's time? By Barry Singer. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-WORDS (Undated) _ Words have been much on music's mind
lately, and the two have been as much opponents as colleagues.
Watching important literary properties (``The Great Gatsby,'' ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'') being wrestled to the ground musically
has become a sporting event. For better or worse, words seem to be
coming out on top. New operas have to have selling points, and
music is not first among them. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   AUDRA-MCDONALD-MUSIC (Undated) _ For better or for worse, Audra
McDonald, the extraordinary mezzo-soprano whose performances in
``Master Class,'' ``Carousel,'' ``Ragtime'' and ``Marie Christine''
have drawn the kind of acclaim on which legends are built, is
nothing if not a singer of impeccable taste. Listening to her
exquisitely phrased, finely shaded performances of a program of
mostly show tunes on her second solo album, ``How Glory Goes,'' you
come away captivated by as lofty a vision of nonclassical American
theater music as any singer has dared put forth. By Stephen Holden.

   RUBELLS-ART (Miami) _ At the opening of a new exhibition at the
Rubell Family Collection's gallery. A mile and a half northwest of
downtown, the 40,000-square-foot warehouse once served as a storage
facility for contraband seized by the Drug Enforcement
Administration. But on this night, when many new acquisitions by
the New York collectors Donald and Mera Rubell were on display for
the first time, most of the comments centered on how the Miami art
scene was coming of age. Running through June, the exhibition,

   JAPANESE-EDO-PAINTINGS (Indianapolis, Ind.) _ Over 20 years,
Alan Strassman, a Boston investment manager, collected 95 Japanese
paintings from the Edo period (1615-1848). His collection became
one of the largest and finest of its kind in private hands. From
the start, when he bought his first scroll painting _ which showed
a tiger gazing at the moon (prompting him later to call his Edo
works the Tiger Collection) _ Strassman was dazzled by, as he put
it, the ``unique flat perspective'' in Japanese art. Their
fragility and his space limitations made it impossible to view all
of his collection at one time. But Strassman will finally be able
to see most of these Edo paintings when they go on view in ``300
Years of Japanese Painting: New Treasures for Indianapolis,'' an
exhibition that opens at the Indianapolis Museum of Art on May 20
and remains until Aug. 6. By Rita Reif. (Moved).  &QL;

   WILD-MAN-ART (Chestnut Hill, Mass.) _ The piece is called ``The
Wild Man,'' and it comes from a late-14th-century choir stall in
Cologne, Germany. Human in form but animal in its sculptured curly
hide, the 11}-inch oak figure is a denizen of the medieval
imagination. For Germans in the Middle Ages, this figure, seen in
its ecclesiastical setting, evoked the fond myth of the German
people descending from a land of rural tribesmen in prelapsarian
synthesis with nature. Nancy Netzer, director of the McMullen
Musuem of Art at Boston College. Netzer is one of five Boston
College professors who organized the show ``Fragmented Devotion:

   EISEMAN-ARCH (New York) _ Peter Eisenman's design for the Staten
Island Institute of Arts and Sciences brings into focus a theme
that has preoccupied him in recent years: the relationship between
the history of places and the history of ideas. The $65 million
project partly straddles the St. George terminal of the Staten

GORE AND BRADLEY DO WELL IN N.Y. POLL; GORE DOES BETTER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. KAGAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley are
viewed favorably by registered Democrats who are likely to vote in
New York's presidential primary election next month, but Gore to a
greater degree than Bradley, according to the latest New York
Times/CBS News Poll.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to choose between them, twice as many people said
they were likely to vote for Gore instead of Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is viewed favorably by 48 percent of likely Democratic
primary voters, while 13 percent hold an unfavorable view of him.
Bradley is viewed favorably by 28 percent, while 14 percent hold an
unfavorable opinion. The remainder in both cases said they were
undecided or had not yet heard enough about the candidate to
express an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll interviewed 1,897 adults throughout New York state,
of whom 542 said they were registered as Democrats and would
definitely or probably vote in the primary on March 7. The margin
of sampling error for the latter group is plus or minus 5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whom they would vote for if the New York Democratic
presidential primary were held today, 59 percent said they would
vote for Gore, while 28 percent said they would vote for Bradley.
But half of Bradley supporters and four in 10 Gore supporters said
their minds were not entirely made up.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll was taken from Feb. 16 to Feb. 22, the third
week after the New Hampshire primary, which Gore won.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-primary polls are notoriously variable because many voters
begin thinking about the contest only a week or so beforehand, and
because turnout is often low and individual turnout difficult to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's supporters cited his experience and the accomplishments
of the Clinton administration as their chief reasons for backing
him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's supporters cited his honesty and integrity, his
general policies, and their dislike of other candidates as their
chief reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Seven out of 10 Democratic primary voters said Gore could be
trusted to keep his word as president. Six out of 10 said the same
about Bradley. Only 16 percent said Gore had ever made or changed a
policy decision as a direct result of money he received from a
major campaign contributor. Only 11 percent said Bradley had done
that.

<P>
   With 88 categories and 90 minutes to present the awards, you
can't exactly blame producer David Foster for providing the
following acceptance guidelines during the hectic Grammys
pre-telecast awards show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying `thank you' is appropriate,'' Foster said. ``Saying
`thank you so much' would be pushing it. A mere `thanks' will earn
you a standing ovation.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences is trying to
increase the profile of its pre-telecast awards, giving VH1 and
various Internet sites the privilege of broadcasting raw
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   But then, you have to wonder just how many people are interested
in who won for best album notes or best polka album.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the early ceremony did have its notes of interest. In
what may be a precursor to next month's Oscars, Phil Collins won a
Grammy (his seventh) for his work on the ``Tarzan'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short, short,'' Collins said, referring to the brevity of the
ceremonies, then adding mischievously, ``I know I'm short.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, Collins expressed his appreciation and a bit of
relief at winning the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another cycle of my career,'' Collins said. ``I've had
my ups and downs. Hopefully this will be the beginning of another
`up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Collins added that he just started working on songs for another
Disney animated film, one that ``will be out in four years.'' He
plans to score that film, as well as write several songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the other early major music category, Madonna and
producer-songwriter William Orbit won best song for ``Beautiful
Stranger'' from ``Austin Powers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Foster, making light of Madonna's absence (she thinks they're
too commercial) said, ``C'mon down, Madonna! Madonna? C'mon!''
</P>
<P>
   There was no Madonna. But naturally, Carlos Santana did show up,
collecting six Grammys during the pre-telecast portion of his
evening avalanche of awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If to live is to dream and to die is awaken, please don't wake
me up,'' Santana said, after winning one of his honors. (Santana
won so many awards that he could dedicate honors to both his mother
and father, as well as anyone else close to his heart.)
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Crow, winner for best female rock vocal performance for
``Sweet Child O' Mine,'' found it prudent to thank Santana, for
``not being nominated in this category.''
</P>
<P>
   She also gave a shout out to the song's writer, saying,
``Thanks, Axl (Rose), for writing a great song. Now please come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles legend Poncho Sanchez won the first Grammy of his
long career for his album ``Latin Soul'' in the Latin jazz
category. He said he doesn't mind the current explosion of Latin
pop in the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Latin people have a lot to offer, a lot of flavor to give
to the world,'' the famed percussionist and bandleader said. ``I
think this is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Tito Puente, winner for traditional Latin performance, thought
Santana's Grammy sweep was great, noting that ``every time they
play `Oye Como Va' (a song Puente wrote), I get a nice royalty
check.''
</P>
<P>
   B.B. King won his ninth Grammy for his album ``Blues on the
Bayou.'' The elder statesman of the blues has no plans on slowing
down anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had friends who encourage me to retire,'' King said. ``My
answer to them is, `I will, five or 10 years after I'm dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   Singer Tony Bennett also won his ninth Grammy for his tribute
album to Duke Ellington. Bennett, likewise, has no plans to shut it
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like going back into the recording studio and coming
out with another one,'' Bennett said. ``That's how inspiring this
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran performer, Barry White, won the first two
Grammys of his career for his song ``Staying Power.'' And Black
Sabbath won its first for best metal performance, more than 30
years after its debut. Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward looked more
like an accountant than a rocker in his natty black double-breasted
suit and admitted as much backstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever would have imagined that `Black Sabbath' and `Grammy
winner' would be used in the same sentence?'' Ward joked.
</P>
<P>
   TLC's catchy ``No Scrubs'' was awarded best R&AMP;B group
performance and best R&AMP;B song.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our share of scrubs,'' said songwriter Tameka
Cottle, referring to the song's titular description of no-account
men. ``I guess it paid off.'' &QL;

WILL INQUIRY'S SHADOW CHILL ART AUCTIONS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the world's two dominant auction houses find themselves
embroiled in a widening federal antitrust investigation, experts at
both are racing to get major property for their important spring
auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out. With the deadlines less than a month away
for printing catalogs for sales that could exceed $500 million,
collectors must decide whether to sell a $5 million Picasso now or
wait for the potentially market-weakening commotion to die down.
</P>
<P>
   While officials at Christie's and Sotheby's say they will have
plenty of interesting and expensive art to offer in New York and
London in May and June, dealers and others in the art world say
there is bound to be an effect on the auctions. These people say
that some pieces could be withheld by nervous sellers and that
there is likely to be more haggling than usual over commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's good for anybody,'' said Alex Apsis, a
partner in the gallery C&AMP;M Arts in Manhattan and a former head of
the Impressionist and modern art department at Sotheby's in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while he did not think the investigation would
affect art prices, it might make it harder for both houses to get
property to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in one way the houses are oddly blessed. Debt, death and
divorce have traditionally kept them in business, but this spring
with a robust economy and few estates available, there is a dearth
of powerhouse collections whose withdrawal could severely damage
the season. Certainly, there are no estates with sales potential
that can match the collection of Victor and Sally Ganz, which was
auctioned by Christie's three years ago for $206.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   This makes Sotheby's and Christie's more reliant on so-called
discretionary sellers, who may choose to sell only a piece or two.
Still, given the investigations, shake-ups in the leaderships of
both houses and a change in the commission structure at Christie's,
some such sellers appear to be having second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from a collector in California who was planning
to sell several million dollars worth of pictures who said to me,
`I'm scared _ what should I do,''' said a prominent Manhattan
dealer who insisted on anonymity because of his relationships with
both houses. ``I do think this is going to hurt the spring sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. James Goodman, another Manhattan dealer,
said he had not heard from any concerned collectors, nor did he
think the recent problems would hamper sales. But, he added, the
scandal is likely to affect commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be all kinds of negotiations,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   Commissions are at the core of the inquiry. It is suspected that
the two houses colluded to fix commissions, leaving all but a
select few buyers and sellers with no room to negotiate rates.
Neither house has admitted or denied the accusations in public
statements, and both say they are cooperating with prosecutors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because the two houses sell more than $4 billion of merchandise
a year globally, the amount in extra commissions they could have
amassed the last several years could easily be tens of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   After Christie's announced that it was cooperating with the
inquiry, it changed its commission structure to favor sellers more
than do the rates Sotheby's still posts.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses are trying to put a good face on the situation.
``Nothing has been put off track by these events,'' said David
Norman, who runs Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He said sellers were eager to take advantage of the recent high
prices. So far, he said, the company had concluded deals to sell
works like a $6 million Modigliani, and an equally valued Cezanne
landscape. He said Sotheby's would also compete aggressively with
Christie's new commission structure by negotiating rates with
valued clients.
</P>
<P>
   Franck Giraud, head of Christie's 19th-century and 20th-century
art department worldwide, said he had already put together strong
sales for the spring.``Certainly people are being more cautious,''
Giraud said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added: ``At the end of the day the collectors are there,
and the money is there. There's big money to be spent.'' &QL;

   U.S. Loses Trade Dispute With Europe on Tax Policy
</P>
<P>
   The United States has suffered its largest defeat ever in a
trade battle, losing a dispute with Europe over tax policies that
forces American companies to pay billions more in taxes. A body of
the World Trade Organization has ruled that the United States must
scrap a law that allows companies to avoid paying taxes on some
overseas sales. The decision, expected to be announced today,
orders the United States to rewrite its tax code to end what the
decision calls an illegal export subsidy, or face sanctions.

give the new company a stronger line of products to compete in
North America. Serge Tchuruk, Alcatel's chairman and chief
executive, said the transaction would increase both growth and
income.

   Auction Houses Face Problems
</P>
<P>
   Christie's and Sotheby's, the two dominant auction houses, face
potential problems during their big spring auctions because of the
fallout from a federal antitrust investigation. Both the

HIGH-RANKING WOMAN AT CITIGROUP TO JOIN PRICELINE.COM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Heidi G. Miller, one of the most powerful women in
corporate America, is quitting her job as chief financial officer
at Citigroup to join Priceline.com, a two-year-old company that
sells discounted airline tickets, hotel rooms and other products
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The move will take Miller from the Manhattan boardroom of one of
the nation's most profitable companies to a Web concern, based in
Norwalk, Conn., that went public just last year and has yet to earn
a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was chief financial officer of Travelers Group for two
years before it merged with Citicorp and has worked closely with
Sanford I. Weill, the co-chairman and co-chief executive of
Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 46 and I think the world is changing,'' Miller said. She
called Priceline.com ``a great growth company with legs, not a
fly-by-night start-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is the latest in a parade of senior executives going from
big, established companies to Internet-based start-ups. She was not
the only high-ranking woman to announce plans Wednesday to make
such a leap. Deutsche Bank AG said Mary Cirillo, who ran some of
the bank's institutional businesses, was leaving to pursue
unidentified ``e-commerce opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   At Priceline.com, Miller will oversee finance and strategy as
part of a management triumvirate that will include Richard S.
Braddock, a former president of Citicorp, and Daniel H. Schulman,
who previously ran the AT&AMP;T Corp.'s consumer businesses. Braddock
said that Miller had received no assurance that she would succeed
him as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, it will evolve in various ways,'' he said, after
stating that ``I'm very old for the Internet; I'm 58.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller succeeds Paul E. Francis, who is moving over to two
affiliated companies. He will be the chief financial officer of
Priceline WebHouse Club, a private company that licenses
Priceline.com's online bidding system to sell groceries over the
Internet, and nonexecutive chairman of Priceline Perfect YardSale.
</P>
<P>
   Braddock declined to say how much money it took to draw Miller
away from Citigroup, but he suggested that her compensation package
included a lot of stock options, whose value would increase in step
with the company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly traded for less than a year, Priceline.com's stock has
more than tripled from its $16 offering price. It closed Wednesday
at $51.875, up $1.75, in trading on the Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
   At that price, Jay S. Walker, the founder of Priceline.com, owns
shares worth more than $3 billion. Braddock's stake is worth about
$570 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly view that the major part of her compensation will
be in the realization of options,'' Braddock said. ``She'll make a
lot of money, I hope. But this is not about money for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., said she was not looking
for a job when she went to a Christmas party given by a friend,
Nancy B. Peretsman, an investment banker with Allen &AMP; Co. who is a
director of Priceline.com. At the party, she met Walker, the
founder of Priceline.com and became interested in the company, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller appeared on the cover of Fortune magazine last fall
because she ranked second on the magazine's annual list of the
``most powerful women in American business.'' She posed alongside
four women, including Mary Meeker, an analyst at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter &AMP; Co. who has been called the Queen of the Internet.
Morgan Stanley managed Priceline.com's initial stock offering last
year. Peretsman ranked ninth on Fortune's list.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said she broke the news to Weill on Friday night. ``I
think he was disappointed,'' she said, but added that ``Sandy was
very encouraging about the quality of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said she was ``not leaving a bad situation'' or because
she felt that she could not advance at Citigroup. ``I am not
leaving because I am a woman,'' she said. ``I would have expected
an opportunity to run a large business at Citi. It was just a
matter of time.''

STRAWBERRY ORDERED OFF THE FIELD UNTIL SELIG ENDS INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Darryl Strawberry loped around the outfield here
Wednesday morning, joking with teammates, fielding fly balls and
grounders. For one more hour, he was a baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   But while Strawberry waited for his turn in batting practice, he
was ordered to leave the New York Yankees' spring training workout,
under a directive relayed from Commissioner Bud Selig's office,
which is close to concluding an investigation of Strawberry's most
recent failed drug test. Strawberry quietly walked off the field
through a back exit, unnoticed by fans, in what may have been his
last appearance in Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry and his wife, Charisse Strawberry, met Tuesday with
Selig and Robert Dupuy, a high-ranking baseball lawyer. Baseball
officials say Selig is considering suspending the slugger for at
least a year, for testing positive for cocaine Jan. 19. The
decision may come Thursday or Friday, or perhaps at the beginning
of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, who would not comment on the case Wednesday, suspended
Strawberry for 60 days after his first failed drug test in 1995,
and last year, Strawberry received a 120-day suspension after he
pleaded no contest to charges of possession of cocaine and
solicitation of prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Selig felt he was being lenient in handing down the 120-day
sentence, according to others in Major League Baseball, owing to
the fact that Strawberry was still being treated for colon cancer
at the time of his offense. Without such mitigating circumstances
in place this time, Strawberry is in greater jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, sentenced to 18 months of probation last May 26 for
his arrest on cocaine possession and drug solicitation, does not
face further legal consequences for failing the drug test that was
administered on Jan. 19. Shelley Tomlinson, a probation specialist
for the state of Florida, recommended that Strawberry undergo
further evaluation, testing and treatment, and a judge has agreed
with that recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball administered the January drug test that
Strawberry flunked, according to two officials with the state of
Florida. In compliance with the terms of Strawberry's probation,
they then reported the results to the state's Department of
Corrections. Baseball officials say that in the aftermath of the
failed test, Selig's office waited for the corrections report, and
that once it was filed on Feb. 8, Major League Baseball intensified
its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is a repeat offender of baseball's drug aftercare
program, and he is not contesting the result of the drug test,
according to Joe Papy, a regional director for the Department of
Corrections. ``We have a positive result,'' Papy said Wednesday.
``He's admitted to using cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, lives in Tampa and is
well-connected here. But Wednesday he said he did not know of
Strawberry's latest troubles until Monday, when the player and his
wife met him in his office here at Legends Field. The Strawberrys,
Steinbrenner said, were remorseful, ``very, very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Charisse Strawberry is five months pregnant with the couple's
third child, the fifth child fathered by the player. ``They came up
because he wanted me to know,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I feel for the
kid, I really feel for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry and his wife met with Selig in Milwaukee Tuesday
afternoon, and in the meeting Selig assured Strawberry that his
purpose was not solely to punish people, but to help them.
Strawberry then left Selig's office feeling somewhat hopeful about
his situation, according to a baseball official. Strawberry also
thought Selig gave him approval to resume his workouts until a
ruling is handed down. The story of Strawberry's positive drug test
broke Tuesday evening, and Yankee officials were not sure whether
he would be allowed to practice in the team's first full-squad
workout Wednesday. As Strawberry drove to Legends Field Wednesday
morning, Manager Joe Torre called him. Initially, their
conversation was awkward, but they agreed that so long as
Strawberry was going to be at the park to meet with the news media,
he might as well work out.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his teammates learned Tuesday evening about Strawberry's
failed test. David Cone was called by a friend from New York, Derek
Jeter heard from another patron in a restaurant and Tino Martinez
saw a report on the local news. The players who had spoken with
Strawberry in recent weeks said they had no inkling of his relapse
and reiterated their support for him. ``It just shows you what the
effect of drugs can do,'' Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no blank stares, no one overcome by emotion. Some of
the players spoke with reporters before seamlessly making the
transition into the usual clubhouse banter with teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry appeared on the field briefly to speak with
reporters, his eyes red; he had just met with Torre, and his lower
lip was quivering slightly. ``I came here today because this is
where I feel I want to be,'' he said, declining to elaborate on his
situation. He then returned to the clubhouse, and after Cone and
Bernie Williams and others greeted him with hugs, Strawberry pulled
on his uniform, the Yankee-blue jersey with No. 39.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Torre began the Yankees' team meeting, Strawberry addressed
the team briefly, his tone light, but he acknowledged his trouble.
``I need your support,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry had said that by coming to Legends Field, he wanted
to show that he would not run or hide. When the rest of the
Yankees' position players emerged for the workout, however,
Strawberry did not take the same route as the others, through the
dugout. Rather, he walked in the runway beneath the right-field
stands, out of sight from the hundreds of fans who had gathered to
watch the workout. Only when the Yankees jogged around the field,
warming up, did Strawberry draw near the stands. Several fans
called his name. None of them referred to the failed drug test, or
the suspension that appears inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry and the others stretched in center field, and
Steinbrenner appeared on the field. He approached the group of
players and then went over and put an arm around Strawberry's
waist; with dozens of reporters watching, it was clearly an attempt
to show support for Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stand by him,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I'm going to
see that he rights his life. If it's in baseball, fine. If it's
outside of baseball, fine. That's up to Bud.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry took turns fielding fly balls with other outfielders,
and when Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch began to take batting practice,
Strawberry settled in right-center field, chatting with the former
outfielder Mickey Rivers, a spring training instructor. At 11:29
a.m., it was time for Strawberry to take his round of batting
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than join Paul O'Neill and Martinez, however, Strawberry
strolled back to the runway underneath the stands. He had been
summoned by Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, who
informed him that Selig's office did not want him on the field.
``There had to have been some confusion about that,'' one baseball
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said: ``We have been asked by Major League Baseball,
with the pending investigation and the circumstances, it's
ultimately best for Darryl to at least shut his practice down;
we've honored that. As did Darryl.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry showered, dressed and departed quickly, while his
teammates practiced, climbing into a black sports utility vehicle
and pulling out of the players' parking lot. He won't be back
Thursday. No one knows if he will ever be back.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The jurors in the trial of four police officers
accused of murdering Amadou Diallo began deliberating Wednesday
after the judge instructed them for nearly four hours on the legal
reasons that could justify the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Joseph C. Teresi of state Supreme Court described six
times and at length to the jurors three legal reasons they could
use to acquit the officers. The shooting could be justified, he
said, if the officers believed they were being attacked, if they
believed that a robbery was being committed or if they were making
an arrest for a felony.
</P>
<P>
   The jury adjourned about 8:30 p.m. after deliberating about six
hours. The justice released them after they sent out a note saying
they were tired. They are being sequestered at an undisclosed
location.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions to the jury were the subject of lengthy
negotiations between the officers' lawyers, prosecutors and Teresi
last week. The prosecutors strongly objected to the inclusion of
two of the legal reasons that would justify the shooting, arguing
that there was no evidence that Diallo was involved in a robbery or
a felony, but they were overruled by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors, four of them black and eight white, have been
hearing evidence in the racially charged case for nearly three
weeks. The officers, all white, fired 41 shots at Diallo, an
unarmed black man who was standing in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building a year ago. They are charged with second-degree
murder, second-degree manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide
and reckless endangerment. Their minimum penalties, if they are
convicted, range from probation to imprisonment for 15 years to
life.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York state law, the lesser charges of manslaughter and
criminally negligent homicide are included in a murder charge, and
jurors are routinely instructed to consider them during a murder
trial. During this trial, lawyers for both sides agreed to their
inclusion. The justice told the jurors to first consider the most
serious charges, murder.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi began the morning by dismissing one juror, a young white
woman, for talking about the case to friends, one of whom contacted
the justice. The first alternate, a young white man who had
described himself as an activist for gay and lesbian rights, took
her place. In all, there are now seven white men, one white woman
and four black women on the jury. During jury selection three weeks
ago, the defense lawyers had tried to remove three of the four
black women from the jury, but Teresi denied the requests.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours after they began deliberating, the jurors asked
that parts of the testimony of two of the officers, Sean Carroll
and Edward McMellon, be read back to them. They wanted to hear the
officers' accounts of what happened from the time they stepped out
of their car on the night of the shooting until they left the scene
a few minutes after the shooting ended.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also asked for a rereading of the testimony of Schrrie
Elliott, a defense witness who said she was an eyewitness to the
shooting, but who made contradictory statements on several crucial
points. She was the only witness, other than the officers
themselves, who testified that one of the officers shouted ``Gun!''
just before the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the jury asked the justice to clarify the meaning
of murder with depraved indifference and of intentional murder.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the officers thought Diallo had a gun is a critical
element in their claim that the shooting was justified. All four
officers said they believed that Diallo had pulled a gun from his
pocket. It turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, members of the New York Police Department's Street
Crime Unit, were riding in an unmarked car the night of the
shooting when Carroll noticed Diallo on the steps of his apartment
building on Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview section and decided to
stop and question him. Carroll said he believed Diallo was acting
suspiciously, sticking his head out to peer up and down the street,
then retreating toward the building's vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, the officers said, ran inside the building and began
digging in his pocket, then turned toward them with what they
believed was a gun. They began firing, and hit Diallo 19 times.
Carroll and McMellon each fired 16 shots, emptying their
semiautomatic pistols. Officer Kenneth Boss fired five shots and
Officer Richard Murphy fired four.
</P>
<P>
   There are three ways the jurors could find the officers' actions
justified, according to Teresi's instructions. One is under a state
law that permits the use of deadly physical force if a person has a
reasonable belief that deadly force is about to be used against him
or another person.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision of that law says that a person can use deadly
physical force to defend against a robbery or an attempted robbery.
Officer Carroll testified that he suspected that Diallo might be a
lookout for a robber pushing his way into an apartment. Although
Carroll said he did not convey that suspicion to the other
officers, Teresi said that that theory of justification could be
applied to all four defendants.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had objected strongly to the application of that
section of the law, noting that there was no evidence Diallo was a
robber. Out of the jury's hearing, lawyers for two of the officers
also complained about the instruction on robbery, saying their
clients never testified that they believed a robbery was in
progress. Outside court, they said they feared the instruction
might confuse the jury.
</P>
<P>
   The third possible justification applies only to police
officers. They are entitled to use deadly physical force while
making an arrest for a felony, Teresi told the jurors. In this
case, it could have been an arrest for robbery or criminal
possession of a weapon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors had objected to that instruction, saying that
there was no evidence that Diallo was committing a felony or that
the officers were trying to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been leading demonstrations
against the police officers, said outside the courthouse, ``I think
that it is extremely interesting that we are hearing a charge based
on self-defense of a robbery that never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Teresi also told the jurors Wednesday that under New York law,
police officers have wide latitude to question people on the street
and, if necessary, frisk them.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in the courtroom was tense, with the officers,
their families and the Diallo family showing equally somber
expressions. Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx district attorney, came
to the courthouse for the first time Wednesday, and said he planned
to stay until there was a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was moved to Albany from the Bronx after the defense
lawyers argued that they could not get a fair trial in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   As the jury began deliberating, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said during a news conference in Manhattan that he did not
expect any violence if the officers were acquitted, but he added
that the Police Department was making ``appropriate preparations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the verdict is going to be,'' Giuliani said.
``I don't know any better than anyone else. But people do not have
a right to act unlawfully. I don't think people will. I think
people in New York are lawful, decent, civilized people. I think we
want to show the entire city and the rest of the country that we're
that way.''

SELIG CAN SHOW BASEBALL THAT HE'S MR. TOUGH GUY
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Chad Curtis, a recent baseball refugee
from New York City, only concerned himself yesterday with the human
side of the Darryl-Does-More-Drugs story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how the commissioner now handles this, although
we were told the last time was Darryl's last chance,'' said Curtis,
the new Rangers outfielder who spent the past three seasons with
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Darryl's baseball future is really no longer important.
He's dealing with a much bigger issue in his life. Knowing Darryl,
there is no doubt in my mind he wants to beat his drug habit. He
wants to stop, but he can't. This is a substance that has a grip on
him. Darryl can't break that grip.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry is a drug loser. And he's also New York's drug
loser. The news broke two days ago that Strawberry had again tested
positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago he was arrested on a charge of cocaine
possession. Five years ago, he served a 60-day baseball suspension
for a positive cocaine test. Two other times in his career,
Strawberry has been sent away for substance abuse rehab.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Strawberry, such as Chad Curtis, say he's worth
the worry. A good guy with a bad problem. And despite Strawberry's
sordid history, New York baseball fans treat the former
Met-turned-Yankee with a strange reverence. They adore him, as does
Yankees bossman George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, there was indignation in New York after Fenway
Park fans had greeted Strawberry with a chant of ``Just say no.''
But those Boston voices now get the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there is some value to this human side of Strawberry's
sad saga, but all that is basically confined to New York's baseball
boundaries. To each his own, but personally, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   The man on the spot here is not Strawberry, who can't say nope
to dope. Instead, the man to watch is commissioner Bud Selig, and
if the Rangers' spring training camp yesterday was any indication,
all of baseball is eagerly awaiting Selig's ruling on Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   This is juicy stuff. Less than a month after Selig went
overboard _ right to the point of grandstanding _ with his
suspension of John Rocker, we now find out if this commissioner is
really Mr. Tough.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker opened his mouth and said dumb things that bordered on
racist comments. Ironically, he was giving a opinion on life in New
York City, of all places.
</P>
<P>
   Selig suspended Rocker for spring training and the first month
of the season, a decision the players' union has appealed.
</P>
<P>
   There is no defense for Rocker, but if nothing else, he was a
first-time offender.
</P>
<P>
   But who is the biggest embarrassment to baseball _ Rocker or
Strawberry, with his continuing drug failures? Which one does more
damage to the game's image?
</P>
<P>
   Does Selig, with his office in New York, now cave in to a New
York baseball lobby that will want its beloved Darryl treated
kindly?
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's career should be over in baseball, and will be if
Selig reacts to this case the same as he did the Rocker case. But
will the commissioner have the guts to impose a career ban?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I doubt it. And even if Selig shows that muscle, you
then have to factor in the very, very powerful players' union,
which has always coddled its members who repeatedly violate the
game's drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Steve Howe,'' Rangers pitcher Rick Helling said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. Steve Howe's name was certain to come up. ``Didn't he
flunk like nine drug tests and was still allowed to pitch?'' asked
Helling.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was nine. Maybe seven. Whatever, it was way too many.
But long after his retirement, Howe remains a skid mark on
baseball's image.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, by the way, is a member of the union's executive
committee, which gives him a vote in the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   ``A precedent was set long ago with the Steve Howes,'' added
Helling, ``and I don't know if the commissioner can do much more
than follow those guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Rocker, Mr. Selig was breaking new ground. No one had
ever been suspended for those kind of verbal remarks. But when it
comes to a player with a drug problem, many cases have been dealt
with by a variety of commissioners.''
</P>
<P>
   If Helling is right, Strawberry might be back in a Yankees
uniform this season. Then again, we have all been assured that
Selig is the most powerful commissioner of our time. The baseball
owners have granted him more muscle than any commissioner since
Kenesaw Mountain Landis in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   How the union might eventually ``protect'' Strawberry is not the
immediate issue here. Instead, let's see first how tough Selig will
be in his first test case after the Rocker ruling. And I strongly
suspect all of baseball outside of New York City wants to see a
Selig fastball on this one.

 &HT;    Gore promises Florida retirees he'll reduce costs of drugs
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. _ Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday
promised nearly 2,000 elderly voters at Century Village to reduce
the cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   High drug costs is a hot issue among the elderly, especially
those on fixed incomes. With prices continuing to climb, Gore said
he would use the federal budget surplus to start a new program
called Medi-coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is not entirely a new one. President Clinton has
proposed a similar program, as has Gore's rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
Gore's plan would cost at least $35 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proposed prescription drug coverage more than five months
ago,'' said Kristen Ludecke, Bradley's spokesman. ``Time and again,
Bill Bradley has set the pace and Al Gore follows.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants Medicare to pay half of an individual's annual drug
costs up to a $5,000 limit in exchange for a $44 monthly premium.
Seniors near poverty would pay no premium or co-payment.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposes a $500 annual deductible, $25 monthly premium
and 25 percent co-payment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the addition Gore advanced on Wednesday, once a
beneficiary has reached an annual floor of $4,000 in out-of-pocket
prescription expenses, Medicare would pick up all additional costs.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Republicans of pandering to the extreme right wing of
their party, Gore said both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona
Sen. John McCain oppose issues important to the elderly, such as a
patient's bill of rights that would give them more control over
medical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a wide-ranging verbal assault, Gore said: ``Neither
of the Republican candidates have a plan to move toward universal
health coverage. Neither of the Republican candidates see anything
wrong with flying the Confederate battle flag over a state
capitol.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gore, ``Both of the Republican candidates have been in
favor of weakening Medicare through a form of privatization known
as medical savings accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler (D-Boca Raton) noted the importance of
prescription drug legislation to the elderly voters in his district
by joking during his introduction of Gore that, ``this is the
congressional district that has the highest per-capita use of
Viagra in the country. We've got to have the coverage, Mr. Vice
President.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is leading Bradley in most polls and the two men face a
crucial series of primaries March 7. Bradley has said that if he
fails to win several key states that day it will be unlikely that
he will win the nomination.

 SF CHRON   Business Magazines Boost Salaries for Tech-Savvy Writers 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The romantic notion of crusading journalists righting wrongs for
low pay is going the way of the manual typewriter.
<P>
   Top writers at the new breed of business magazines are routinely
drawing six-figure salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be, only senior people in management got six
figures,'' says Ned Desmond, president and editor of eCompany Now,
the forthcoming magazine being launched in San Francisco by Time
Warner's Fortune Group. ``Now, star writers are getting that. This
is, frankly, a good thing. Journalists have too long been
underpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Desmond remembers his early days in journalism, working for
$15,000 a year in 1983 as a reporter at a small daily in suburban
Boston. While some scribes still struggle to make ends meet,
Web-wise college grads are finding their way to high-paying
magazine jobs a lot sooner.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco's tech mag circles, gossips are pinning blame
on eCompany for spurring salaries to their new heights, but Desmond
doesn't buy it. He says he's turned down some prospective hires
because their prices are too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't taken somebody who was making $75,000 and brought
them to $100,000 or taken taking  &LR; someone making $100,000 and taken
taking  &LR; them to $125,000. Young writers in general are doing really
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Desmond wouldn't discuss any specific salaries, including
reports that he's paying one young writer $125,000. Desmond said
his own salary is under $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond blames skyrocketing salaries on escalating competition.
The Industry Standard, Red Herring and Business 2.0, all based in
and around San Francisco, are all hiring writers and editors in
bunches, to say nothing of Upside and Wired. Meanwhile, journalists
are jumping online, either to pure media ventures or to startups
that desire some quasi-journalistic content.
</P>
<P>
   Standard President and CEO John Battelle says he's paying from
the ``high five figures to the low six figures. ... And rightly
so.''
</P>
<P>
   He likened the magazines' wooing editors to Silicon Valley firms
wooing engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talent is the most valuable thing we have,'' Battelle says.
``That's why we have stock options, and benefits, and massage
therapists. ... Do you have to coddle your editors? Yes. They're
the backbone of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   At Red Herring, some staffers are even earning more than Editor
Jason Pontin, who's been with the company for nearly five years.
(Pontin, of course, has stock options that will boost his pay above
his employees' _ if the Herring ever goes public.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last five years, the average salary has probably
doubled,'' says Chris Alden, CEO of the Herring.
</P>
<P>
   Alden says that while the Herring is competitive, ``ultimately,
at the end of the day we cannot play the NFL recruiting game where
money is the only thing that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Battelle, a former managing editor of Wired, doesn't mind. He's
gratified to see editors treated like executives. ``I feel pleased,
after toiling 15 years as a journalist, that I could take a small
part in raising the valuation of an honorable field,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The role of journalists role has traditionally been to comfort
the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. It bears watching
whether that remains the case now that so many journalists are
joining the ranks of the comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ALDEN TIMES: &QL; 
In an interview last week, Red Herring CEO and co-founder Chris
Alden expounded on a few of the issues facing his San Francisco
magazine and Web company this year:
</P>
<P>
   _A potential public stock offering: ``At some point in the
future, will our expansion needs require we tap the capital
markets? Yes,'' Alden said. But the recent announcement of $28
million in funding does not signify that an IPO is around the
corner. ``It's not our style to do what John Battelle (at the
Industry Standard) is doing (in saying an IPO is in the works). If
there's an opportunity there, we'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   _The America Online-Time Warner merger: ``Here was a big to-do
about pure-play Internet companies, but we believe integrated media
is the way to go... The AOL-Time Warner merger is a watershed event
that suggests convergence is going to become much more
fashionable,'' Alden said, adding that the news validates the
Herring's strategy to grow its online business while publishing a
profitable magazine. ``Our dot-com audience is already four to five
times the size of the magazine audience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _The search for a new CEO for Red Herring ``is still going on,''
said Alden, who took the role last year on an interim basis.
Although rumors persist that the company is close to hiring
someone, Alden said, ``we're not in a hurry to do this. We're going
to find the right person.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Herring Editor Jason Pontin said to
watch for the magazine to follow Business 2.0's lead and double its
frequency later this year, from monthly to biweekly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BUSH BACKING:
</P>
<P>
   As long as I'm on a roll with Red Herring, I might as well get
it out of my system: How could Tony Perkins, the company's
co-founder and its editor in chief, interview Texas Gov. George W.
Bush for a piece in his magazine when Perkins is an active
fund-raiser for Bush's presidential campaign?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an American citizen,'' Perkins says, asserting that he was
within his rights to take part in the interview as long as his bias
was disclosed, which it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a subjective world,'' Perkins says. ``You try to make
your case as intelligently as possible... If we have a bias, we
should express that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins notes that Herring editor Jason Pontin also sat in on
the interview, giving some balance. And he says the magazine has
tried vigorously to get Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley to participate in similar Q&AMP;As, without success.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very focused, technology-centric trade and economic
interview with potentially the next president of the United States
is a benefit to Red Herring readers,'' Perkins says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Perkins' role as a fund-raiser probably helped secure
Bush's participation. As the famed New Yorker press critic A.J.
Liebling once observed, freedom of the press belongs to anyone who
owns one.

UTAH SENATE FUNDS DRIVE TO PROSECUTE POLYGAMISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Subs to add words `in the state' to 4th graf and to insert
the word Utah in the 12th graf.) 
 (DW) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a century after Utah outlawed polygamy, state
lawmakers are still trying to fight polygamist clans.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate voted 28-1 Wednesday in favor of a bill that
would earmark $500,000 for prosecution of abuse and fraud in
polygamous societies and pay for a hot line and emergency shelter
for women and children who leave polygamous enclaves. The bill now
goes to the House, where a similar bill that some lawmakers called
a ``witch hunt,'' was defeated last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it clear that this is not about people with
different religious beliefs or consenting adults,'' said the bill's
sponsor, Sen. Ron Allen, a Democrat. ``This is about felonies in
these communities. It's a focus on a specific group, and they're
called felons.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he believed there were about 50,000 polygamists in
Utah and that about 300 women and children left polygamous families
in the last year. Polygamists in the state trace their beliefs to
Mormonism, but the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints long
ago disavowed the practice and Utah, as a condition of statehood,
outlawed polygamy in 1896. Polygamy, a third-degree felony, is
rarely prosecuted because many of the marriages, while performed in
a church, are not registered with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's come to my attention in the past couple of years that
there are a number of human rights violations in our state in these
closed societies,'' Allen said. ``Some are the same types of crimes
that occur in nonpolygamous society, such as child abuse and
incest, but also welfare and tax fraud. There is a preponderance of
empirical evidence that these crimes are quite common and may even
have the tacit approval of some community members.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said that the extra money and resources were needed
because there should be more aggressive investigations and
prosecutions, which have to penetrate what he called the ``secret
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are taught to not talk to the outside world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited cases of women and children who left their families
behind and had nowhere to go. ``We believe it's a first major
step,'' Allen said, ``and we are giving women and children an
opportunity to set their own directions and have a sense of freedom
in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Matt Throckmorton, a Republican, called the proposed
legislation discriminatory prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a religious belief about plural marriages, they do
not have a religious belief that these crimes are acceptable,''
said Throckmorton, who voted against the bill in the House,
</P>
<P>
   ``We currently have laws to deal with these crimes. We don't
need a new prosecutor or new money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Utah attorney general's office in Utah has about $75,000 in
its budget for investigations of crimes in isolated communities.
</P>
<P>
   The jailing of two prominent polygamists for child abuse last
year put a spotlight on the issue. A father pleaded no contest to
beating his 16-year-old daughter after she ran away from a marriage
to her uncle, who was convicted of incest.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the passage of the bill shows that the state is trying
to clean up its image for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt
Lake City, but Allen disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an interest in this issue before the Olympics came up,
and I was not compelled by the Olympics,'' said the senator who
introduced a similar bill last year. ``There is no doubt in the
community's mind that we have let this go on far too long, and it's
probably time to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Varela, a spokeswoman for Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, said he
supported the bill.

 Lawsuit Against Visa, MasterCard Gets Class Status  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman

In a major challenge to Visa and MasterCard, a federal judge has
granted class-action status to a retailer lawsuit that accuses the
associations of using their muscle in credit cards to force
merchants to accept their debit cards as well.
<P>
   The antitrust suit, filed in 1996 by Wal-Mart, Sears Roebuck,
Safeway and other giant retailers, asks for more than $24 billion
in damages to compensate for higher transaction-processing fees
that the plaintiffs claim Visa's and MasterCard's policies
produced.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling Tuesday, U.S. District Judge John Gleeson certified
in the class every business and individual that has accepted Visa
and MasterCard credit cards in recent years and has also been
required to take the association's debit cards. The class includes
millions.
</P>
<P>
   Without class-action status, ``millions of merchants will lose
any practical means of obtaining damages,'' the Brooklyn federal
judge concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Visa and MasterCard said they will appeal the decision and took
comfort from Gleeson's unusual language urging a federal appeals
court to review his class-action certification.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a narrowly cast, technical ruling,'' said Visa
spokesman Kelly Presta. ``We are optimistic'' that an appeal will
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are Visa and MasterCard rules that require merchants
that accept their credit cards to take all other forms of payment
that carry the associations' brand names.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is separate from the antitrust case brought by the
Justice Department which challenges rules of the associations that
prohibit member banks from issuing credit cards from third parties
such as Discover or American Express.
</P>
<P>
   The retailers claim that U.S. merchants have incurred $8.1
billion in extra costs in recent years to process Visa and
MasterCard debit payments. The suit asks triple damages or $24.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   If Visa and MasterCard lose the suit, it could cost them huge
sums of money and disrupt their operations. That could prompt banks
that issue Visa and MasterCard products to charge cardholders
higher fees. And some debit customers might be unable to use their
Visa and MasterCards for some purchases.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, consumers could benefit if the suit lets
merchants trim transaction costs, provided they pass along savings
to shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be an overstatement, lawyers for the retailers
claimed the suit will fundamentally reshape the way consumers pay
for purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is of transcendent importance to every consumer, merchant
and bank in the United States,'' said Lloyd Constantine, lead
attorney for the plaintiffs. ``The broader issue is who is going to
control the payment system.``
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts cautioned that it's too early to draw such a
conclusion. ``Certification of the class doesn't mean (the
retailers) have won the lawsuit,'' said Anita Boomstein, a New York
banking attorney with the firm Hughes Hubbard &AMP; Reed. ``And even if
they prove their case, it's unlikely they will be awarded those
kinds of damages.''
</P>
<P>
   Most retailers feel obligated to take Visa and MasterCard credit
cards since they are so popular with customers. But many don't want
to accept their debit cards, which transfer funds directly from a
consumer's bank account, because cheaper alternatives are
available.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, many retailers prefer debit cards issued by
regional ATM networks, such as the Star System in the West, which
hit merchants with a processing fee that is one-fifth or less of
the roughly 1.5 percent fee the bank card associations typically
impose for some transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The prices vary sharply partly because the two types of debit
cards are different. Visa and MasterCard products function like
credit cards. Consumers sign a receipt and the charge is posted to
a bank account several days later.
</P>
<P>
   The regional network products work like ATM cards. Consumers
punch a PIN number into a terminal at the point of sale and funds
are instantly debited to their accounts.

</P>
<P>
   TIES TO HISTORY: Sen. John McCain received an unexpected boost
Wednesday from the 82-year-old granddaughter of Teddy Roosevelt, a
president McCain frequently invokes to describe his iconoclastic,
reformist message. During a ferry ride across Puget Sound, the
granddaughter, Edith Williams, presented McCain with a copy of a
book about her grandfather called ``The Bugle That Woke America,''
by Hermann Hagedorn. Williams, who has lived on Vashon Island in
Puget Sound since 1949, praised McCain. ``He's a reformer, he's a
crusader, and that's what my grandfather was,'' she said. Williams,
a lifelong Republican who confessed to one Democratic indiscretion
_ ``I voted for Clinton, yes'' _ said she had waited her whole life
for a president ``who sounded the bugle cry just like my
grandfather. For the first time in a hundred years the bugle is
sounding again.''

 New Palm Inc. Unveils More Products  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The former Palm Computing is about to spin off from parent 3Com _
the initial public offering is scheduled for next week _ and to
celebrate, the new Palm Inc. this week announced not only its first
color model, but also a variety of other new products and improved
services.
<P>
   _Palm IIIxe. Priced at $249, the IIIxe is similar to the model
it will replace, the IIIx, except that the new one has twice as
much memory _ 8 megabytes _ and a nearly black ``dark slate'' case
in place of the previous model's lighter gray.
</P>
<P>
   _Collapsible keyboard. The $99 Palm Portable Keyboard has the
same key spacing and layout as a standard computer keyboard, plus
special keys for launching the basic Palm applications. But it
weighs only 7.9 ounces, and for travel it folds down to just 3.6 by
5.1 by .8 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Palm will offer two versions of the keyboard, one for the Palm
III series and the Palm VII, the other for the Palm V series.
They're based on a third-party product, the Stowaway from Think
Outside of Solana Beach (San Diego County).
</P>
<P>
   _OS update. The models announced this week run on a new release
of the Palm OS, Version 3.5. Enhancements include a new view that
shows appointments and to-do items for one day on the same screen;
access to menus by tapping at the top of the screen, as an
alternative to pressing a button; a new option to ``mask''
confidential data so it appears only as a gray bar until a password
is entered; faster data synchronization speeds; built-in support
for wireless synchronization via infrared; and a new ``snooze''
button in the alarm-clock feature.
</P>
<P>
   The new software will also run on the Palm III, IIIx, V, Vx and
VII, but not the IIIe. Handspring's Visor, a competing handheld
that runs the Palm OS, is not upgradeable to the new version.
</P>
<P>
   Palm OS 3.5 will be posted for downloading at www.palm.com/
support/downloads by the end of March, according to Palm.
</P>
<P>
   _Unlimited wireless plan. A new service option for owners of the
Palm VII offers unlimited wireless communications through Palm's
Palm.net service for $44.99 per month. Metered-access plans remain
available at $9.99, $24.99 and $39.99 per month.
</P>
<P>
   _Wireless enhancements. By the end of this month Palm will also
implement new features that make it easier to receive messages
addressed to ``POP3'' Internet mail accounts through Palm.net, plus
a scheme enabling users to manage their Palm.net mail through a Web
browser on their desktop PC or Mac.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Nestle SA Gobbles Up PowerBar  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Berkeley's PowerBar Inc., the inventor of the energy bar, has
agreed to be acquired by Nestle USA Inc.
<P>
   Nestle USA and its parent company, Switzerland's Nestle SA,
intend to use their global marketing and distribution muscle to
turn PowerBar into a worldwide brand _ something privately-held
PowerBar has had difficulty doing on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the sale were not disclosed, but one knowledgeable
source indicated that the price was roughly proportionate to that
of Balance Bar Co., which is being acquired by Kraft Foods for $268
million. Since PowerBar's sales are 40 percent higher than Balance
Bar's, its purchase price would be approximately $375 million.
</P>
<P>
   PowerBar's founders, Brian and Jennifer Maxwell, who cooked up
the first energy bars in their Berkeley kitchen in 1983, have
entertained many overtures for their fast-growing company over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Maxwells were spurred to sell last month after Kraft
agreed to buy Carpinteria (Santa Barbara County) -based  &LR; Balance
Bar, PowerBar's biggest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (decision to sell) recognizes that the game is changing,''
said Brian Maxwell, a former Olympic marathon runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``PowerBar is the clear leader today, but with the kind of
distribution and logistical resources that could be brought against
us, that might not be the case in three to five years,'' Maxwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   PowerBar also considered going public, but consumer-product
stocks are currently out of favor on Wall Street, Maxwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, PowerBar put itself up for auction and received several
bids. Last Friday, two hours after Jennifer gave birth to the
Maxwells' fifth child, the PowerBar board approved Nestle's offer.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close in about six weeks. Many details,
including who will run PowerBar and whether its headquarters will
remain in Berkeley, have not been nailed down. Nestle USA is
headquartered in Glendale (Los Angeles County). , &LR;  Ca. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  PowerBar posted 1999 sales of $142 million, up dramatically
from $120 million in 1998. PowerBar claims a 42 percent share of
the energy bar category while Balance Bar, with sales last year of
$101 million, accounts for about half that. Both also sell gels,
drinks and other consumeables for athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The other major bar makers are MET-Rx, with about 12 percent of
the market, and Emeryville-based Clif Bar, with 10 percent. A Clif
Bar spokesman said his company plans to stay private and
independent.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxwells own a majority of PowerBar stock. San Francisco
investment firm Hellman &AMP; Friedman, which bought a stake in the
company in 1996, owns about 15 percent. PowerBar employees own the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   PowerBar employs a total of 275 people, 150 at its Shattuck
Avenue headquarters and more than 100 at a plant in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell said it is too early to say whether any layoffs will
occur, but Nestle has put together severance packages that include
four months' salary for any employees who lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   As an independent company, PowerBar has had difficulty getting
distribution in chain stores, Maxwell said. ``Last year we
introduced some great products, including a chocolate-covered bar,
but we still have less than 50 percent distribution across the
country'' among supermarkets, drug stores and mass merchants,
Maxwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company like Nestle can put those into 95 percent-plus
distribution in just a few months,'' Maxwell said. ``In some parts
of the country, it's hard to find a PowerBar.''
</P>
<P>
   Penetration is even more difficult in Europe, where PowerBar
operates a Munich, Germany, office staffed by 18 people. ``What we
have had to tell them is, `Go grow a PowerBar business, but don't
ask us for any resources, and good luck,''' Maxwell said.
</P>
<P>
   PowerBar insiders consider Maxwell a good manager and credit him
with signing high-profile athletes, such as Steve Young and Dale
Jarrett, as spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxwells, along with a third company founder, William
Vaughan, are also credited with envisioning and developing the
energy bar concept from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Canadian-born Brian was a track coach at the
University of California at Berkeley and Jennifer, a nutrition
major and his girlfriend, was a star runner. They cooked up various
combinations of bars using ingredients like peanut butter and oats,
which they sold out of their car at local track meets and other
running events.
</P>
<P>
   Still, PowerBar has lost sales over the years by failing to
recognize the market potential of other types of products,
including bars targeted at people who are not serious athletes but
who like a pick-me-up in the afternoon or during a hike.
</P>
<P>
   PowerBar has diversified from its chewy core product in just the
last couple of years, introducing more flavorful bars with broader
consumer appeal.

SPORTS COLUMN: DISMISSAL DOESN'T SEEM SO NOBLE
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the New York Knicks completed a grand show of
conscience by announcing that the team would not train in South
Carolina this spring as a protest against the state's flying the
Confederate flag over its capitol. On the same day, the Knicks
fired Ed Tapscott, the oldest and highest-ranking African-American
in the organization, a man who at one time was seen as a prime
candidate to be the Knicks' first African-American general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Layden, the Knicks' executive vice president and general
manager, was not available for comment Wednesday but issued a
statement thanking Tapscott for his service.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Checketts, the Garden president, was flying from California
and was also not available. There was no explanation, but what is
there to say?
</P>
<P>
   This sort of thing happens everyday in corporate culture, with
the spate of mergers, downsizing and companies going in ``new
directions.'' In this sense, Tapscott's dismissal was colorblind.
That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   His departure marks the final scene of a crazy epoch in Knicks
history. This was effectively the end of the Ernie Grunfeld era.
Grunfeld, the former president who was dismissed last spring, and
Tapscott put together the guts of last year's team _ Allen Houston,
Marcus Camby and Latrell Sprewell _ that jelled and streaked to the
NBA finals. There was bitter in-fighting all the way: coach Jeff
Van Gundy versus Grunfield; Grunfield versus Checketts.
</P>
<P>
   Tapscott was Grunfeld's protege and they sat together during the
recent All-Star Game. ``He's my friend,'' Tapscott said. ``He's the
reason that I'm in the NBA.'' And now, Grunfield is the main reason
he is out of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing Frederic Weis as the Knicks' top draft choice last
summer didn't help either.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 50 years, African-Americans have made astounding
progress in the major professional leagues. In many ways, the NBA,
the NFL and Major League Baseball set the tone for integration, or
at least hinted of the possibilities. Baseball and football
integrated before the armed forces; all three were integrated
before Brown vs. the Board of Education in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   But the last decade has seen a stubborn resistance to pulling
African-Americans into executive echelons with the frequency or
enthusiasm with which they are pulled onto the field. This has
created the paradox of a large, rich self-replenishing pool of
black and brown athletes and a microscopic pool of
African-Americans pointed toward upper management.
</P>
<P>
   This is at the heart of Tuesday's coincidence: the Knicks firing
Tapscott in the morning and announcing that they are pulling out of
South Carolina in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate battle flag was adopted by several Southern
legislatures in the 1950s as an act of defiance against sweeping
civil rights legislation becoming law in the United States. We
Southerners, they said, would not be bullied into desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   This element of resistance to the promotion and elevation of
African-Americans in sports is at the core of a current push by
some players and politicians against the NFL, the NBA and the major
leagues. Tapscott, a lawyer and former agent and college coach, was
pulled into the loop nine years ago amid bells and whistles. But he
chose the losing side.
</P>
<P>
   Tapscott let the Knicks off the hook. When Layden was hired,
Tapscott was asked whether he felt he had been unjustly passed
over, whether he thought complications caused by race had been was
a factor. He declined to bring race into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remembered Tony Dungy,'' Tapscott said, referring to
the head coach of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. ``Dungy was
passed over and disappointed a lot before he got his shot as a head
coach. He carried himself with a lot of dignity; I admired that.
That's how I chose to carry myself and respond.''
</P>
<P>
   He gambled that by being a good soldier, the Knicks would take
care of him. He lost.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season started, Tapscott struck a deal in which he
would work until July, scouting colleges before bidding the Knicks
adieu.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my plan,'' he said Tuesday night. ``The plan I had
agreed upon with Dave. ``There was a change of plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' decision to pull out of South Carolina was the
correct way to protest a symbol that many find offensive. But
treating a symptom is one thing, curing the disease is something
else. The Knicks have made a statement: they oppose the flag of
race-based resistance wherever it flies. That's a noble stand; the
organization should take it to heart.

NONSCREAMER HEFNER NEAR TOP OF CLASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  This is the third in an annual four-part series on the best
and worst of sports media in Los Angeles. Today: the
colormen/analysts.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He speaks softly and carries no schtick.
</P>
<P>
   Which, in today's world of college basketball play-by-play
sidekicks, won't get him attention. As if Jim Hefner really cares.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth year as the analyst on USC basketball's radio
coverage, Hefner's understated approach sounds more like an FM man
on an AM station. But Hefner _ a Trojans assistant and top
recruiter for head coach Bob Boyd in the mid-1960s and '70s and an
assistant athletic director at the university in the '80s _ doesn't
have the urge to be a screamer to convey his knowledge of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I have an ego to start with,'' said the
56-year-old Hefner, who sat on Boyd's bench for 13 years, including
the season USC finished 24-2 and ranked No. 2 in '71. ''Some guys
who do are hard to work with because they're seen as a threat to
the other broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have to !ital!be controversial to be controversial.
But the guys I see on TV sometimes aren't the guys I want to be.
The guys who are so egocentric really bother me. Some, I really
can't listen to. I have to mute them.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the radio doesn't have a mute button, you couldn't do that
to Hefner if you wanted to. Instead, you sometimes have to turn the
volume up just to catch the meticulous point he's making over the
din of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And as USC's basketball team makes noise this season as a
possible NCAA Tournament contender, the Trojans broadcast on
XTRA-AM (690), simulcast on KCTD-AM (1540), has drawn more
attention and in turn given Hefner a larger-than-usual audience.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did TV work with Mike Walden and Tom Kelly on
college basketball in the '80s for ON-TV and Prime Ticket, Hefner
found broadcasting to be a secondary vocation during his 10-year
stint as the athletic administrator overseeing budgets and travel
for the school's football, basketball and baseball teams under
then-athletic director Dick Perry in the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   When Mike McGee took over as AD and drew the line of not
allowing university employees to work on TV games, Jerry Buss
offered Hefner a position with John Jackson at Forum Boxing in
marketing, promotions and sales, which Hefner eventually took.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hefner's wife Susy died suddenly and he found himself a
single parent of 12-year-old daughter Brooke. Many of the Forum
Boxing events were taking place in Las Vegas and Hefner couldn't
leave his daughter alone. So he respectifully resigned to be a
full-time dad.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I did OK,'' Hefner said modestly of how he reared his
daughter, who last May graduated from USC's School of Journalism
and is working on an internership with Al Gore's presidental
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hefner recently remarried and he and his wife Jackie live in
Hermosa Beach, where he's been for the last 27 years _ within
walking distance of a little Boogie Board action in the ocean or a
bike ride along the Strand.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it came out of the blue when Larry Kahn called him
to see if he'd be interested in doing basketball for the school
just before the '96-97 season. Kahn and Mike Lamb had the radio
broadcasting rights to USC athletics, and Kahn needed a colorman
for basketball after Lamb did it the previous year. Kahn had never
met Hefner, but he went on a recommendation by then-USC football
coach John Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Hefner and Kahn were paired for two seasons until Kahn's
contract ended. When current athletic director Mike Garrett took
the broadcasts in-house, he wanted to keep Hefner on the games and
hired play-by-play man Rory Markas from the Clippers to work with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Markas had also never met Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the best guy I've ever worked with,'' Markas said. ''He's
not in the business to draw attention to himself _ it's because he
loves basketball so much.
</P>
<P>
   ''I learn a lot about USC because his knowledge of the school is
impeccable. And he listens to me and reacts to the things I say.
It's not canned; it's real. And I love his preparation. It's
old-school, not something computer generated from printouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefner's 3-to-4 hour preparation for each game includes tiny
writing in red and black pen on two sides of legal-pad-sized sheets
that he keeps with him at the broadcast table for reference. But
his general feel for the game _ anticipating what will happen and
explaining why _ is where his coaching background comes through
more efficiently than a recent ex-player. He also injects things
such as his opinions about rule changes to give the broadcast depth
without stepping on the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   These days, cross-town rival UCLA relies more on TV exposure,
which helps justify employing no analyst on its basketball radio
broadcasts _ the budget allows for an engineer and play-by-play
man. That makes USC's two-man setup for radio a much more solid
foundation for listeners who want first-hand information from those
close to the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''The preparation is so much different for radio than TV,'' said
Hefner. ''There's much more needed for a radio broadcast. But I
wouldn't feel comfortable if I put in any less time.''

Bruins' win-loss record.
</P>
<P>
   __ 2. Stu Lantz, Lakers TV and radio: Not a true colorman since
he's like a point-forward _ doing a secondary play- by-play to set

   __ 3. Daryl Evans, Kings radio: When Cammi Granato had to excuse
herself after one season, Evans was a logical choice. But the
problem with most rookies is getting the routine down. Hate to put
Evans here, but like those before him, he should only improve with

 _ SF CHRON  
 Palm Brightens World of Organizers With Color Screen  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Poor Microsoft.
<P>
   In its increasingly desperate efforts to hold off the Palm
juggernaut in the handheld-organizer market, the Windows CE camp
has had only one compelling advantage: superior screens. And now
Palm comes along and takes even that away from Gates and company.
</P>
<P>
   What did that trick is the Palm IIIc, a new $449 model released
this week. It doesn't have the sleek, high-touch styling of the
Palm V line, or the wireless communications capabilities of the
Palm VII. What it does have, as the letter ``c'' suggests, is
Palm's first color display.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs color, you might be asking, in a device designed
mainly to store phone numbers, calendar entries and to-do items?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is that color lets you do more than that _
things you probably wouldn't want to do on a dingy gray-green
screen, like look at digital photos and play backgammon. (The IIIc
comes with programs for both those functions, although, curiously,
you have to go out of your way to find and install them.)
</P>
<P>
   And you'll soon have lots more color-oriented options to
consider: Rand McNally, for example, is developing a Palm IIIc
version of its Street Finder Deluxe 2000 software, which will let
you generate detailed maps, as well as directions, to any address
you specify. Kodak is even planning a $149 hardware device, the
Kodak PalmPix, that will snap onto the IIIc and turn it into a
digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   For most users, though, I doubt any of those applications would
justify the IIIc's price tag, not to mention the extra cost of the
third-party options.
</P>
<P>
   The real value of the color screen lies elsewhere: Because it's
so much brighter and clearer, it's much more readable than previous
Palm displays. And that makes using the device _ even basic
applications that have nothing to do with graphics and no real need
for color _ much easier and (let's admit it) more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Technically speaking, the screen in question is an active-matrix
thin-film-transistor LCD _ the same technology used nowadays in all
but the least expensive notebook computers.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, it's not quite as good as good  &LR; as the best the
Windows CE world has to offer: It measures 2.25 by 2.25 inches (160
by 160 pixels), the same as previous Palm screens, whereas the
color display on Casio's comparably priced Cassiopeia &LR;  CQ- one s in
co., 2 in product name &LR;  E100 is 2.25 by 3 inches, with a resolution
of 240 by 320 pixels. The IIIc also displays fewer colors (256,
compared to 65,536 on the Cassiopeia), and the shiny Palm screen is
much more susceptible than Casio's to annoying reflections.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, to its credit, has also done a better job than Palm
of integrating color into its user interface: In most of the Palm
applications, the only color you see is in the window title bar,
whereas Windows CE uses shades of gray and other colors to
distinguish the different elements of its screens. (Cynics might
say that's useful only because CE's interface is excessively
complex.)
</P>
<P>
   Only one standard Palm IIIc application _ an enhanced calculator
called powerOne, developed by Infinity Softworks _ makes heavy use
of color, but not, to my mind, to very good effect: To me yellow
outlining around the black numerals on the keypad is just clutter.
</P>
<P>
   But these are relatively minor quibbles. The main point is that
the IIIc screen is bright, clear and easy to read _ something I for
one wouldn't say about any previous Palm display. Like other LCDs,
it's hard to read in bright outdoor light, but indoors it's a
pleasure to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Palm pretty much lived up to its promise not to
sacrifice other values that have contributed to the popularity of
its products _ notably, small size and long battery life _ for the
sake of color. The IIIc is about a quarter inch longer than
monochrome Palm III models, but at a thickness of .67 inches and a
weight of 6.8 ounces, it's scarcely any bulkier; it's also a couple
of ounces lighter and a shade thinner than the Cassiopeia or
similar color Windows CE devices from Compaq and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Battery life is a little trickier. The sad fact is that color
screens use more power than monochrome ones. While the monochrome
Palm III models typically last up to two months on a pair of cheap
AAA alkalines, the IIIc appears to run only about eight or nine
hours on one charge of its built-in lithium ion battery pack.
</P>
<P>
   Just what that means for you depends on how you use the device.
If you use it a ``normal'' amount of time, which according to Palm
is about 40 minutes per day, and you leave the brightness control
at its default position, you'll be able to use the IIIc about two
weeks on one charge. If you use it more, or turn up the brightness,
obviously a charge won't last as long.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Palm has made it easy to recharge the IIIc. Like
the Palm V (and the color CE models), it comes with a cradle for
exchanging data with a PC that also has a charger built in _ just
plug the AC adapter cable into the cable that connects the cradle
to a PC serial port, and the device will recharge whenever you put
it in the cradle.
</P>
<P>
   For those who rarely connect their Palm to a PC, the company
offers two separate recharging kits, one that plugs into an AC
outlet, the other for use with the cigarette outlet adapters in
most cars and the power plugs now found (I'm told) in the first-and
business-class sections of most airliners. Each charger is $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, battery life in the IIIc is more of a concern
than in the older models, but Palm has done a good job of making
the problem manageable. If you use your cradle regularly, you'll
never notice the power issue _ and you'll have the satisfaction of
knowing that you're not filling your local landfill with toxic
disposables.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, at $449 the IIIc's virtues don't come cheap, and even
those who can easily afford it will face a tough choice. Instead of
arranging its products in a single good-better-best hierarchy, as
most tech companies do, Palm now has three separate high-end
models, each with its own unique special feature: the Palm Vx (now
$399) is the lightest and most elegant, while the VII (now $449) is
the only model with built-in wireless capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you can't have it all (unless you've just cashed
in your options and you want to pick up one of each). But if
readability is your biggest concern, or if you're among those who
have some other use for color, the IIIc is a big step forward for
the Palm family.

   JABALIYA REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip _ Seven months into her
seventh pregnancy, Hanan Suelem fidgeted, shifting her weight on a
hard bench in a bare-bones clinic. Beneath her floral headscarf,
primly fastened at the chin with a butterfly pin, her face was
mournful, the face of an old woman.
</P>
<P>
   She is 34, she said, but very tired. Her first two children were
planned, the next four ``accidents.'' This time, after one accident
too many, she begged Islamic clerics to grant her permission to
have an abortion. They told her, she said, that she would be
``killing a soul.'' She told them that her soul was dying, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this, no more, never,'' she said, speaking almost in a
whisper. ``I have learned now about the IUD. Right after I deliver,
I'll have them put one in. There are too many children all
around.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Outside the clinic, as if to make her point, the area's schools,
which operate on two and three shifts to accommodate the growing
Palestinian population, let out for the day. Thousands of girls
wearing pinstriped uniforms and boys in jeans took over the sandy
streets, kicking through rain puddles and climbing junk heaps on
their way to their tin-roofed, concrete shacks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The population explosion in the Palestinian-governed Gaza Strip
appears to be unrivaled in the world. Its population of 1.1 million
_ half of whom are under 15 _ are expected to double by 2014, which
would pose almost unimaginable strains on what is already a highly
congested area with few jobs, severely inadequate housing and
almost no natural resources. (The current population of just over 3
million in the West Bank and Gaza combined is expected to rise to
5.5 million by then.)
</P>
<P>
   Gaza's extremely high fertility rate of seven children per woman
is comparable with Somalia's or Uganda's. But unlike those
countries, almost all of Gaza's babies survive and adults live a
relatively long life, fueling a boom that is now forcing difficult
choices on Palestinians and their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Family planning is a central issue in Gaza _ central, at least,
to many young Palestinians who say they do not want their children
to suffer as they did in oversized poor families. But, for the
young Palestinian government, with its conservative, male-dominated
Islamic society, family planning is culturally sensitive and
politically complex. Large families are not only traditional but a
point of nationalist pride.
</P>
<P>
   For the five-year-old Palestinian Authority, the population
issue has been a challenge, although one that has not been publicly
acknowledged. Officially, Palestinian leaders have long advocated
population growth as a way to outnumber the Israelis on the land
the two groups share.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, however, Palestinian health and education
officials, working with foreign donors and international
organizations, quietly support family planning through a steady
expansion of clinics and community outreach services. Women are
taught about the different methods of contraception that are
acceptable under Islam _ anything except permanent means, like
sterilization or tubal ligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically speaking, our leadership believes very strongly
that the demographic route is the way to settle the score with the
Israelis,'' said Dr. Hassan Abu Libdeh, director of the Palestinian
Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their speeches, they are in favor of more children,'' he
said. ``But practically speaking, they are trying to promote the
opposite. The Health Ministry and the Education Ministry are doing
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies show a growing acceptance and use of birth control over
the last few years, especially the IUD, or intrauterine device,
followed by birth control pills. Few women bother to bring home
condoms from the clinics, because men in Gaza refuse to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Health and education officials are careful not to advocate
population control. They refer delicately to the ``spacing'' of
children, underscoring that they are not talking about placing
limits on family size, which would violate Islamic teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them it is normal and natural to take at least three
years between babies,'' said Dr. Amna Abed, who runs a clinic at
the Red Crescent Society in Gaza City. ``We tell them that it is
written in the Koran. Our God orders us to breast-feed for two
years. And then follows nine months of pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Abd Al Karim Kahlout, the mufti of Gaza, is just as
involved as the health officials, an advocate himself of
``spacing.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At his office in Gaza City, he offered a discourse on the side
effects of the IUD and the pills. He is an older man and blind, and
it was an unexpectedly frank speech, which his personal scribe
interrupted several times to make sure he understood. ``Excessive
bleeding?'' he asked, his pen poised. ``Lactating?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The mufti said that he receives at least 20 calls a day from
couples seeking birth control advice. He recommends the imperfect
method of suppressing fertility through continued breast-feeding,
which many Gazan women had abandoned when international
organizations started supplying them with formula that allowed them
to wean their babies early. But he counsels women to visit clinics
to get more modern methods if they need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Middle East, after the wars ended and advanced medicine
conquered the diseases that would kill babies, family planning
became an essential issue,'' he said. ``Islam believes that baby,
child and mother must live a good life, with dignity. That means
taking a long breather in between children. We don't want women to
be so burdened they throw their children into the street.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the mufti said, ``Muhammad did say, `Get
married, make many children and I will be proud of you in front of
all the nations.' ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The religion sends mixed signals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So does the government. During the uprising, or intifada,
against Israel that began in the 1980s, Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, personally urged women to give birth for the
cause, to produce male fighters to replace those who had been
``martyred.'' Young men used to vandalize family planning clinics,
which were seen as defeatist, Abed said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fertility rates did rise during the intifada, perhaps partly
because of official encouragement, but also because Gazans lived
through five years of nightly curfews, locked in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   When the Palestinian Authority took over with its meager budget,
it faced the fruits of the Palestine Liberation Organization
campaign, the intifada years and entrenched norms: a population
with one of the highest fertility rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Women in Gaza average seven children. In the West Bank, where
fertility rates are lower, they still average a very high 5.6
children per woman. That compares to about 2.7 children in Israel,
the same figure as the worldwide average.
</P>
<P>
   But Gaza is a statistical oddity. Whereas its fertility rates
are similar to those of desperately poor countries like Somalia,
nutrition and health care are much better. This is largely because
most Gazans receive prenatal and primary care for their children
from the many nongovernmental organizations based there, especially
in the United Nations-run refugee camps like Jabalya.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a much higher proportion of Gazan babies survive
and live a long life. In Somalia, 122 of every 1,000 infants die
before they reach their first birthday. In Gaza, that number is
only 21. Somalians generally live only until their mid to late 40s.
Gazans' average life expectancy is 73.
</P>
<P>
   This creates the unusually high rate of population growth in
Gaza, which, judging from international statistics, is the highest
in the world: over 4 percent a year. Israel, in comparison, is
growing at the rate of about 2 percent a year, which includes high
levels of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's population of 6 million, of which about 5 million are
Jews, is expected to reach about 8.3 million by the year 2025. The
Palestinians predict that 25 years from now their population will
rise from just over 3 million, with 1.1 million in Gaza, to 7.4
million, with 3 million in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   For Gaza, already so densely populated, this seems unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind if Gazans continue producing babies, but they
will have to move somewhere else,'' said Dr. Abu Libneh, the chief
statistician for the Palestinian Authority. ``They simply will not
fit into their current geography _ forgetting about feeding and
employing them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He said only the most aggressive family planning program could
make a dent in the rate of growth. But the Palestinian government
is not involved in population planning at all, he said, not
recognizing the growth as a problem or priority.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian advocates for a sustainable development policy are
advocates for women. They are pushing fiercely, but without great
hope, for a law that would raise the legal age of marriage to help
delay the start of child-bearing. Half of Palestinian women marry
before they reach the age of 18, and it is legal to do so at 15 in
Gaza, and 17 in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a woman is married at the age of 15, she doesn't go to
school,'' said Dr. Rabah Muhana, a male physician who campaigns for
women's reproductive health and empowerment. ``If she stays at home
and doesn't have seven or eight children, what will she do?''
</P>
<P>
   Culturally, women are encouraged to keep having children until
they have at least a couple of boys. ``They don't count the females
when they calculate family size,'' said Dr. Mouna Farra, who runs
clinics in Gaza. ``They start paying condolences when the mother
has a female. `OK, so she will help you,' people say. `But try
again. Maybe you'll get lucky next time'.''
</P>
<P>
   By such standards, Hameed Daya, 48, a real estate developer, is
very lucky.
</P>
<P>
   He is the father of 10 boys. His wife never wanted to stop
trying for a girl. Eight years ago, she gave up, and Daya was
thrilled. But his wife falsely believed she was too old to get
pregnant. Now, at 43, she is expecting again _ an 11th boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can field a soccer team,'' Daya said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was from a poor family, and I never wanted my children to
suffer what I suffered,'' he said. ``Somehow God gave me more money
whenever I had more children. But there is a limit and I've reached
it. How can I give them all an education, a wedding, a house? I
tried to get my wife an abortion. I went to see the mufti, and I
lied to him. But he told me this was `harab' _ taboo. He scared
me.''

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan defended the Federal Reserve's
recent interest rate increases Wednesday as necessary to keep the
current prosperity on track, and denied that he was putting the
entire economy at risk just to rein in the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Greenspan,
the central bank chairman, parried questions from members of both
parties about whether he was putting too much emphasis on the
strains that rising stock prices might be creating in the economy,
and too little on the benefits of low unemployment, steady growth
and low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on comments he made last week, Greenspan said that
while he was not aiming at stock prices, he had to be concerned
about how the run-up on Wall Street translated into increased
consumer spending and a broader increase in demand for goods and
services. That ``wealth effect,'' he said, was contributing to an
imbalance between demand and the economy's ability to produce the
supply needed to meet it, the classic precondition for an outbreak
of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he sees no evidence of inflation outside of
rising oil and commodity prices. But as he did during an appearance
before the House Banking Committee last week, he suggested that the
Fed will continue raising rates in small steps until the economy
slows from the blistering pace it set in the second half of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've tried to argue today is not that we are on the edge
of instability, but that we have an extraordinary economy which is
growing at a pace which is somewhat above the level which is
sustainable over a longer term,'' Greenspan said during a long
question-and-answer session with the Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates four times in eight months, in
quarter-point increments. Analysts are all but certain that the
central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will
push its benchmark federal funds rate _ the target rate for
overnight loans among banks _ up another quarter point, to 6
percent, at its next policy-setting meeting, on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   With inflation quiescent, the interplay between the stock market
and the economy has emerged as one of the trickiest and most
critical issues facing the Fed, and Greenspan spent much of
Wednesday's session trying to explain his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   By the Fed's estimate, ``perhaps 2 to 4 cents out of every
additional dollar of stock market wealth eventually is reflected in
increased consumer purchases,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Multiplied by the trillions of dollars of wealth created by the
long bull market, that is one powerful engine of consumer demand.
(Much the same phenomenon causes corporations to invest freely in
new technology and equipment.) By the Fed's estimates, the booming
market has, on average, added about one percentage point a year to
gross domestic purchases for five years.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Greenspan said, rising stock prices are an
expected and entirely justified response by investors to the most
fundamental change in the economy in decades, the surge in
productivity, or output per worker for each hour worked.
</P>
<P>
   The point, he said, is not whether stocks are overvalued.
Greenspan said his views on that are no more or less valid than
anyone else's. But that does not mean that rising stock prices _
or, more specifically, the huge and growing pool of new wealth
created by the market _ are not a factor in the economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the additional oomph that market-generated
wealth gives to demand is not replicated on the other side of the
economy's balance sheet _ supply, or the economy's ability to meet
that demand.

   ``It is firmly documented that when people have significant
capital gains, a small part of them do induce an increase in
consumption,'' Greenspan said. ``It is the nature of a capital gain
not to increase supply accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan tracks the scale of the wealth effect by watching a
ratio of household net worth to income. Since income growth is a
rough proxy for growth in the nation's productive capacity, a rise
in wealth relative to income implies an expansion of the gap
between demand and supply, the very imbalance of most concern to
Greenspan.

</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said that the Fed has tracked the ratio back to 1922,
and that it did not change in a way that had a big effect on the
economy until the mid-1990s. According to the Fed's statistics,
household wealth remained between 4.8 and 5.1 times income from
1988 until 1996, when it began surging. By 1997, wealth was 5.7
times income; last year it was nearly 6.3.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of economy, which is creating a huge surge in
wealth, could create a huge surge in consumption and growth if
there were the people to produce the goods to meet the demand,''
Greenspan said. ``And the point at issue is we do not.''
</P>
<P>
   In prepared testimony delivered to both the House and Senate
committees, Greenspan said that squeezing inflationary pressures
out of the economy would have to involve bringing the growth in
asset values into line with the growth in income.
</P>
<P>
   After Greenspan set out that equation for the House committee
last week, some economists took it to mean that slowing the growth
in stock prices until they came in line with income growth had
become a goal of monetary policy. Responding to a question
Wednesday, Greenspan said that was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is merely a diagnostic tool to make a judgment as to
whether a wealth effect is indeed functioning in the economy,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the stock market is by no means the only source
of growing demand; rising real incomes, driven by productivity
growth, play a huge role as well. Some analysts suggested that in
an election year, Greenspan might find it less politically
sensitive to suggest that the problem facing the economy is the
stock market rather than low unemployment and rising wages.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, members of the committee pressed Greenspan Wednesday to
explain the distinction between using monetary policy to slow the
whole economy, with all that could mean for jobs and incomes, and
using it to curb the wealth effect by taking some air out of the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole new theory being laid out here,'' said Sen.
Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, the panel's ranking Democrat, ``that's
going to justify raising rates, curtailing the economy, when there
is no inflation. And it's all being done on the basis of this
wealth effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan never completely explained the distinction, if there
is one. Rather, he emphasized that what he was dealing with was
``not a theory, it's merely an analysis of what in fact is
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously for a Fed chairman who is often viewed as omnipotent,
Greenspan said the central bank was playing only a supporting role
in addressing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market forces, not the Federal Reserve, are driving up
interest rates to close the gap between supply and demand for
funds, which is a counterpart to goods and services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that Greenspan views the situation with
a growing sense of urgency. By his account, the economy has
absorbed the growth in demand relative to supply over the past few
years through two ``safety valves.'' They are an increase in
imports and a decline in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But with the unemployment rate at 4 percent, a 30-year low, the
economy is fast running out of workers, as the Fed sees things. And
with the nation's trade deficit at a record high, the United States
cannot afford to continue importing goods with abandon for much
longer.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Greenspan said, is that there is no longer much
of a buffer between increased demand and an inflationary spiral in
wages and prices _ especially as long as the stock market continues
to stoke demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wealth effect cannot persist indefinitely because it
relies on two safety valves, both of which are limited,'' Greenspan
said.

FEW UPSETS BUT LOTS OF EXTRA HOLES AND WATER IN MATCH PLAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Most of the top-seeded players advanced, four
matches went extra holes, rain suspended two matches and everyone
who won breathed a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Day 1 of the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship was
nerve-racking and wet, but only three of the top 10 seeded players
were eliminated: Vijay Singh (No. 6), Nick Price (No. 8), and Phil
Mickelson (No. 9).
</P>
<P>
   Last year, renowned players fell like leaves on an autumn day,
but Wednesday the majority of top-seeded players advanced. Tiger
Woods romped over Michael Campbell, 5 and 4. David Duval manhandled
a struggling Angel Cabrera, 4 and 3. Four world-class players who
were first-round victims last year came away victorious: Davis Love
III, Ernie Els, Lee Westwood, and Tom Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   So after the opening round at La Costa Resort &AMP; Spa, the stage
was set for an interesting week, as the first World Golf
Championships event of the season began to take shape. Some players
won with ease, like Lehman and Hal Sutton. Others barely escaped,
like Sergio Garcia, who won his match against Loren Roberts on the
second hole of sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in match play, it does not really matter how well you play,
as long as you win. So those who advanced to the second round were
simply thankful not to be packing their bags.
</P>
<P>
   How fickle is match play? The players in last year's final four
were defeated Wednesday _ defending champion Jeff Maggert, Andrew
Magee, John Huston, and Steve Pate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have played better, but I won,'' said
Duval, who lost in last year's second round. ``I get to play
tomorrow. I just hope it doesn't rain.''
</P>
<P>
   It did rain heavily Wednesday afternoon, forcing the day's final
two matches to be suspended before they could be finished. Colin
Montgomerie was 1-up on Dennis Paulson through 16 holes, and Thomas
Bjorn was 2-up on Glen Day through 16 holes. Those matches will be
resumed Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 completed matches were played in conditions that were
windy, soggy, and challenging, making the course play longer, and
giving a slight advantage to longer hitters.
</P>
<P>
   That was fine for Woods, who had little trouble with Campbell in
an eagerly-anticipated match that turned out to be one-sided.
Campbell had won three of his last four starts, and was rising
rapidly in the world ranking to qualify for this tournament. Before
the match, Campbell said he was eager to face Woods. But Woods
jumped on Campbell early, making birdies on two of the first three
holes, winning three of the first four holes, and never looking
back.
</P>
<P>
   One of the day's most entertaining matches was Mickelson vs.
Billy Mayfair, which ended on the second playoff hole, the par-5
No. 2, when Mayfair made a 45-foot bunker shot for eagle to win. It
was a stunning conclusion to a match between close friends.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson looked as if he would win after he hit his second shot
on No. 2 to within eight feet of Mayfair's ball in the bunker. But
Mayfair, who is blessed with an excellent short game, hit a
beautiful shot that floated onto the green, rolled toward the pin,
then disappeared into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair pumped a fist, leaving Mickelson with an eight-footer
for an eagle that he needed to keep the match going. Mickleson
missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very fortunate,'' said Mayfair. ``Nine out of 10 times,
I should get up and down for birdie on that bunker shot. I had a
good lie. But this time, I was just fortunate that it went in. In
this tournament, it's like every day is Sunday. If you don't win
your match, you're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Garcia, won on the second playoff hole, when Loren
Roberts bogeyed, missing a six-footer for par.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult but I won, that's the most important thing,''
said Garcia, who recovered to save par on his final hole after his
second shot at the par-5 No. 2 hit a cart path and bounced 25 yards
to the left. ``I said I expected a tough match. And I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the remainder of the tournament, expect more drama, and
more surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said: ``When you play at this level, it doesn't matter
what the seeding is. Anything can happen.'' &QL;

ON PATH TO SPEEDY TRIAL, A JUDGE WITH A FIRM HAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DIALLO-TRIAL, DIALLO-FYFE) 
(js) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If Lance Ito, the judge in the O.J. Simpson
trial, came to define one extreme of the administration of justice
_ slow and indecisive _ Joseph C. Teresi, the presiding judge in
the trial of the four police officers charged in the killing of
Amadou Diallo, has come to define the other.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly three weeks after lawyers delivered opening arguments in
the case, the jury began deliberating Wednesday, surpassing even
the most optimistic predictions of how quickly the trial would
move. The credit, participants in the case and legal commentators
agree, goes to Teresi.
</P>
<P>
   Since his ascension to the state Supreme Court here in 1993,
Teresi has acquired a reputation for refusing, sometimes testily,
to tolerate unprepared or unfocused lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   His impatience has certainly been on display in the Diallo
trial, but the testiness has been absent _ perhaps because the case
has been on national television. Instead, the judge has adopted a
stern tone, laced with humor that sometimes slips into sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through this'' or ``we've been down this road'' he
would reprimand lawyers when their questions began to address
ground already covered. ``Move on.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, he left lawyers grasping for words when they raised
objections and he responded with a brusque ``Grounds?'' At other
times, he chided the lawyers on their approaches.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Warner, you are not a witness in this case, and you will
never be a witness in this case,'' he lectured Eric Warner, the
lead prosecutor, at one point. ``Stop testifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Court officials said Teresi was selected on the basis of
availability, scholarship, expertise and demeanor. But local
lawyers say the brisk pace of his courtroom was most likely a
factor as well.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has he frequently prodded the lawyers to move more
quickly, he has sharply restricted efforts to broaden the trial's
scope to examine everything from other crimes in Diallo's
neighborhood to the attitudes of members of the Street Crime Unit,
where the four officers on trial were assigned.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to drive Teresi is protecting the jurors from the
lawyers. ``Not on the jury's time,'' he said several times in
rejecting lawyers' requests for bench conferences. And, with a few
exceptions, he insisted lawyers have witnesses on deck no matter
how near the end of the day. His days have been long: beginning at
9:15 a.m. and going until 5 p.m., or longer.
</P>
<P>
   What also seems to drive the judge _ along with other Albany
officials _ is a desire to prove wrong the critics of the change of
venue, who had implied that Albany was a homogenous backwater.
Teresi presided over a jury selection that resulted in a panel
one-third black, more diverse than any in the county in decades,
according to several Albany lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in response to a defense question of why the case
exhibits were being sent into the jury even before they asked for
them, Teresi said, ``It's the custom here in Albany County.''
</P>
<P>
   If Teresi is proud of his city, he is also proud of his
heritage. On one occasion, he began the day by saying to a defense
lawyer, Michael A. Marinaccio, ``for the members of counsel who are
not of your and my persuasion'' _ both men are of Italian-American
descent _ ``would you please explain what agita is.'' Marinaccio
did, saying that agita formally means upset stomach, but is used
more broadly to describe nervousness or aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have agita this morning,'' Teresi said, and then explained
that a reporter from The Times Union of Albany had called one of
the jurors at home the night before. Wednesday, he again called on
Marinaccio to discuss agita, and said that he had it again, this
time because he had learned that a juror had been discussing the
case outside his courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   While Teresi has earned much praise, he has not entirely been
spared criticism. No one would accuse Teresi of an excess of
charisma, particularly after Wednesday, when in a monotone
impervious to the drooping heads throughout the courtroom his legal
instructions to the jury stretched to nearly four hours. Some
lawyers said that his sometimes muddled jury charge reflected his
lack of experience presiding over criminal trials, since he usually
handles civil cases.
</P>
<P>
   And others criticized his decision to give the jury the option
to find the officers' actions legitimate because they were
defending against a robbery, when only one officer testified that
he thought Diallo might be a robber.
</P>
<P>
   After he read the charge, Teresi gave lawyers on both sides a
chance to express reservations about the instructions. Then he
responded in characteristic fashion. ``Exceptions noted,'' he said.
``Requests denied.''

 &HT;    Griffey is caged in first hit attempts
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ The 1,845 people who elbowed their way
Wednesday into the small standing area between the practice fields
at the City of Sarasota Sports Complex mostly went away
disappointed, unless all they cared about was a glimpse of Ken
Griffey Jr. in a Cincinnati Reds spring training uniform.
</P>
<P>
   If they came to snap a close-up photo of Junior, obtain his
autograph and/or watch him destroy baseballs during his first live
batting practice session for the Reds, they came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a spring training workout of this nature draws 50
people, but they streamed into the complex all morning to watch Kid
Legend.
</P>
<P>
   When the team started the morning's practice with a jog around
the fields, the fans applauded when Griffey ran by.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time for Junior to face pitchers Pete Harnisch and
Denny Neagle, fans lined up along a fence down the right-field line
and three deep behind the outfield fence.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey did not hit a single ball out of the batting cage on the
first eight pitches from Harnisch. When he lined one to right field
on the ninth pitch, the crowd cheered, and Junior turned to them
and doffed his batting helmet with a sweeping bow.
</P>
<P>
   For the day, he took 17 swings and hit only three balls out of
the cage _ two fly balls, one line drive, four swings-and-misses
(all against Harnisch) and 10 foul tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was nothing more than past history,'' Griffey said. ``On
the first day, I'm happy to get one out of the cage. Just call Jay
(former Seattle teammate Jay Buhner) and ask him how many balls he
thinks I hit out of the cage today. He'll say none.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Griffey faced dead-arm pitching, as bullpen coach Mark
Berry lobbed balls across the plate. For fans who stayed that long,
Griffey made the day worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   On the last pitch from Berry, Griffey grunted and sent one high
and deep ... very deep. It cleared the center-field fence. It
cleared a road behind the fence. It cleared some palm trees across
the road. It cleared the center-field fence of Ed Smith Stadium,
where the team plays its exhibition games, and landed in its center
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 500 feet,'' general manager Jim Bowden said as fans
oohed and aahed.
</P>
<P>
   After the workout, Junior headed directly for the clubhouse,
ignoring autograph requests. A smattering of boos erupted and one
fan yelled, ``Your dad would have signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior was stunned at the turnout and said, ``Yes, I'm surprised
and, no, I've never seen that many people at a workout.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a large phalanx of cameras recording his every twitch
and the media stopped him at the clubhouse door for an impromptu
post-workout interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first day ... just a chance to get warmed up,'' he said.
``The only thing different from other first-day workouts is I have
new colors (red instead of Seattle blue).''
</P>
<P>
   And the nonstop attention. Asked about finding himself in a fish
bowl, Griffey said, ``It's a little tough because I want to do some
things and be normal. I don't want to disrupt the club. I don't
want all this to be a distraction. It takes 25 guys to win a
championship and I don't want to be the one guy they follow
around.''
</P>
<P>
   So Griffey finds himself trapped in the Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa Syndromes _ center stage every moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, McGwire hit 70 home runs and Sosa hit 60,'' he said.
``I'm just the small guy, a little guy who only hit 50-some.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Cincinnati and Sarasota, he is The Man.

CONE OFFERS HIS HAND, BUT IS IT TOO LATE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ David Cone locked his skinny right hand into
Darryl Strawberry's massive right hand, then reached over and
wrapped his arms around his troubled, troubled teammate. Cone was
the first Yankee to greet Strawberry awkwardly after he
surprisingly came to Legends Field Wednesday for his first official
spring workout, a workout that was curtailed by Major League
Baseball. Strawberry's season should be next
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here for you,'' Cone whispered to Strawberry, and
Strawberry nodded.
</P>
<P>
   But it is probably too late to save Strawberry's career. Again.
Strawberry will be suspended, most likely for the season, for
violating baseball's aftercare program for the third time. It will
be extremely difficult to find any teams interested in signing an
aging designated hitter with a history of substance abuse problems
and zero at-bats on his baseball card for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Strawberry will finally realize that the addictions that
long ago robbed him of the chance to hit 600 homers and get into
the Hall of Fame have turned him into another Steve Howe and, quite
possibly, have killed the last stages of his perplexing career.
Strawberry tested positive for cocaine last month and even hoped
his career would not be threatened if the results were not
publicized. They were, of course, and now Strawberry, showing
another trait of an addict by denying culpability, awaits his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the question we're all thinking about today. If this is
all true, is this the end?''' Cone said. ``I'm sure that's the
question that everybody wants to know. As I said, I hope not.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone has more perspective than any other player in the Yankees
clubhouse, which is why he was surrounded by reporters 10 seconds
after he ambled through the metal doors Wednesday morning. Cone
understood the delicate subject and expected the questions,
sheepishly mentioning that he had covered this ground regarding
Strawberry before and that the reporters were probably weary of his
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt I feel for the guy,'' Cone said. ``I'm not
going to abandon him now because of his addiction. I'm still going
to support him. He's my friend. I'll do anything I can. Certainly,
it hurts. There's no two ways about it _ it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   When Strawberry sat between Manager Joe Torre and General
Manager Brian Cashman in the first-base dugout to tell reporters
that he was not hiding from his problems, his brown eyes were thin
and puffy. It was a surreal day. Why was Strawberry even here? Who
thought that was a good idea? Were the Yankees letting him have one
last fling in the sun before the inevitable darkening?
</P>
<P>
   Cone seemed befuddled after Strawberry was ordered to leave the
field, and Cone promised to call the players association for a
clarification. But Cone knew the banishment was more distressing
news for Strawberry, a player he has watched rise, fall, rebound
and falter and somehow still survive colon cancer surgery and bouts
with cocaine and alcohol addiction to win four World Series rings
and continually convince people that he had changed. Not anymore,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' Cone said, ``and I'm very worried about
him as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   So are others. If Strawberry, who turns 38 next month, is out of
baseball for a year, he will not have the routine that is so
important to him. For an addict, idle time is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not the end for him because I don't know what that
would mean,'' Torre conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was a 24-year-old rookie with the Mets in 1987 when
Strawberry was one of the leaders of a talented bunch of miscreants
who, Cone said, ``played hard and partied harder.'' Strawberry had
that gorgeous uppercut swing, that splendid ability to smack
baseballs 400 feet and that charisma. Torre called Strawberry
``Willie McCovey with speed.'' When Strawberry entered a room, Cone
said, he became the room. Cone, like everyone else, was in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of those guys,'' Cone said, ``players stopped to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   But Strawberry was on top of a treacherous hill, always poised
to tumble. He has tumbled and tumbled and tumbled again. As a
father of four, it might be time to forget baseball and focus on
staying alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl has been a hero, especially in New York, probably long
before he could have handled that,'' Torre said. ``He was real
young. I'm not sure that's doing players favors, having that
happen. You can't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone is passionate about changing the treatment of young players
so that there will be fewer Darryl Strawberrys in the future. While
Cone stressed that he was not making excuses for Strawberry, he
criticized the practice of signing players out of high school and
failing to properly educate them. Cone wondered if it was abnormal
to expect a kid from Compton, Calif., who did not know his father,
to handle having money and fame thrust upon him in his 20's, and in
a tempting city like New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, be level-headed about it,'' Cone snapped. ``Handle it
well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Strawberry did handle things well in the beginning. The
problems started as he achieved more success with the bawdy Mets,
earned millions and, as Torre speculated about many young stars,
felt as if he were immortal. That is why Strawberry will not be
playing baseball soon. The game is about to end.

beginning at the moment of conception _ an attempt to criminalize
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Man: But now Gore says:
</P>
<P>
   Voice of Al Gore: I have always supported a woman's right to
choose.
</P>
<P>
   Woman: Gore voted against strengthening an assault weapons ban,
and against gun control so often the National Rifle Association
said, ``We could have made Al Gore NRA Man of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   Man: But now Al Gore says he's for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Woman: As vice president, Al Gore said he'd fight for health
care for all.
</P>
<P>
   Man: But now Gore says we can't afford it. And when it comes to
health care, some Americans will be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Woman: So when it comes right down to it, what does Al Gore
really stand for?
</P>
<P>
   Man: To learn more go to wwww.moreaboutgore.com. That's
moreaboutgore.com, to see for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY:
</P>
<P>
   The spot is very well documented, though in many cases, it is
referring to aspects of Gore's political life well before he became
vice president. On the companion Web site, the Bradley campaign
supplies supporting letters and citations from newspaper and
magazine articles. For instance, to bolster its claims about Gore's
pliability on gun control, it includes a 1984 letter from the
National Rifle Association that says, ``Since being elected to
Congress in 1976, Gore has been there each and every time sportsmen
and gun owners have needed a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Gore 2000 Web site, the vice president's campaign takes
exception to some of the claims regarding Gore position on
abortion. It notes that he, not Bradley, was endorsed by the
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, and it
attempts to provide some nuance to his position on the issue.
``During his 1984 Senate campaign,'' the Web site says, ``Al Gore
stated that while he personally opposed abortion, he believed that
they shouldn't be outlawed by the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD
</P>
<P>
   The 60-second commercial, a dramatic departure in tone from
Bradley's previous advertising, picks up on themes he emphasized in
a raucous debate with Gore at the Apollo Theater in Harlem on
Monday. The new spot is the first of the Democratic campaign in
which one of the candidates criticizes the other by name.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is also notable for its innovative use of the Web
as a kind of archives for material supporting the advertisement's
claims. The Web site, contains detailed postings criticizing Gore's
record on, among other things, abortion, gun control and health
care. To respond, the Gore campaign went to the Web, too. On a
portion of its Gore 2000 Web Site, it has created the ``Bradley
Information Bureau,'' to answer Bradley's claims. At the top of the
Web page is a quotation: ``It takes discipline to be positive
because it's easy to slip the other way.'' The Gore campaign
attributes the words to Bradley.

 &HT;    Top names hang on in rain during World Golf
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ There will be no repeat winner at the
Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship this year. As a matter
of fact, there are guaranteed to be four new semifinalists in the
$5 million World Golf Championship event.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's first round not only wiped out defending champion
Jeff Maggert, but also eliminated U.S. players Steve Pate, John
Huston and Andrew Magee, the uncelebrated group that stagnated TV
ratings a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   While three players in the top 10 lost their first-round matches
Wednesday _ No. 6 Vijay Singh to Duffy Waldorf; No. 8 Nick Price to
Mark Calcavecchia; and No. 9 Phil Mickelson to Billy Mayfair _ it
was better for marquee name purposes than last year, when five of
the top 10 were ousted in the first round and Maggert, then 24th,
became the highest seed in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Rain is the big problem this time. If the La Costa Resort and
Spa gets any more water-logged, the players might need to strap
sponges to their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The final two matches, which were halted when heavy rains made
conditions unplayable, will be finished at 12:30 p.m. today, with
Scotland's Colin Montgomerie leading DennisPaulson of the United
States, 1-up, through 16 holes and Denmark's Thomas Bjorn 1-up on
American Glen Day after 15 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing it yet out of standing water,'' said David
Duval, who beat Argentina's Angel Cabrera and today meets Tim
Herron, ``but we might be soon if this keeps up.'' ``The golf
course is so wet. The greens are really tough to read,'' said Ernie
Els, a 2 and 1 winner against Bernhard Langer.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 seed Tiger Woods managed an easy 5 and 4 victory against
New Zealander Michael Campbell, but a few other big names are gone.
Fred Couples (23) was ousted by Japan's Joe Ozaki, 1-up, and Mark
O'Meara (14) eliminated No. 51 Greg Norman, 1-up.
</P>
<P>
   The doorslammer was Mayfair, who defeated his friend Mickelson
on the second extra hole by holing a 45-foot bunker shot for eagle.
Mickelson then pushed an 8-footer for his eagle to end the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult to play Phil,'' Mayfair said. ``And then
going extra holes....I think both Phil and I just hoped that one of
us wouldn't give each other the match.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Maggert nor Magee, who played in the finals last year,
won a hole. Maggert was thumped by Bob Tway, 6 and 5. Magee lost to
Tom Lehman 5 and 4. Pate, a semifinalist last year, lost in 20
holes to Bob Estes. The other 1999 semifinalist, Huston, was ousted
by Japan's Shigeki Maruyama, 1-up.
</P>
<P>
   Second-round matches begin at 1 p.m. today.

BRIDGING THE LAW AND DNA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying that science has overtaken the state penal code, Gov.
George Pataki of New York proposed Wednesday the most aggressive
laws in the nation for solving crimes using DNA analysis. The
proposals would abolish prosecution deadlines for 16 felonies and
require every person convicted of a crime to provide a biological
sample for a state database.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, Pataki's proposals, submitted as two bills to
the Legislature, would keep many more felony cases open
indefinitely and develop the DNA database at a much faster rate
than current law allows, meaning more cold cases could be solved in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The crimes for which statutes of limitations would be eliminated
include rape, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault, robbery,
burglary, second-degree arson, illegal firearm sales, gang assault
and aggravated assault on a police officer. Currently, the state
cannot initiate prosecution on these crimes five years after they
occur. But Pataki said that DNA databases had made such deadlines
obsolete, particularly for sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no statute of limitation that allows a violent
offender to walk scot-free after five years, while the victim is
still languishing in emotional pain,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's second bill would expand DNA sampling of convicted
criminals, providing an ever-larger computer index of genetic
profiles to compare against evidence collected at crime scenes. The
current sampling law, passed last year, requires people convicted
of the most common and violent felonies to submit to DNA profiling,
and covers about 65 percent of all felony offenders. Pataki's
proposal would mandate profiling for anyone convicted of any state
crime.
</P>
<P>
   If passed, the bill would force 126,000 people each year to
submit DNA, including people convicted of minor offenses like
subway fare-beating or resisting arrest. The current law requires
30,000 felons to submit DNA each year.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the proposals was uncertain Wednesday. The governor,
a Republican, has often seen his criminal justice bills stymied by
the Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats. And an aide for
Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the Assembly, said Silver had not
reviewed the bills and did not yet have a position.
</P>
<P>
   But one important Democrat, Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentol, a
Democrat from Brooklyn and the chairman of the committee that
reviews criminal justice bills, said the proposals merited
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the DNA database is concerned, I don't see any
reason why we wouldn't work with the governor to extend the
sampling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lentol did have some reservations, however. He said the state
crime lab already had a backlog of DNA samples, so more money or a
slower approach might be in order. He also said that although he
supported extending statutes of limitations for sex crimes, or any
crime that typically yields DNA evidence, he was opposed to
extending statutes for an entire class of felonies.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states now require certain offenders to submit DNA, and
at least 15 state legislatures are reviewing bills this year that
would expand its use, according to Christopher H. Asplen, executive
director of the National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Asplen said that Pataki's bills were the most aggressive yet.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said his bills were prompted in part by an article in The
New York Times about the backlog of expiring rape evidence. His
proposal to eliminate statutes of limitations would be retroactive,
to a degree. It would keep the statutes open on all cases that had
not yet expired and eliminate the statute for future crimes. And
because more cases expire each week, he said, ``it is important to
pass this quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the governor's bills were met with immediate concern by
civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said he might support extending the statute of
limitations for rape, but he shared Lentol's concerns about
extending the statutes for other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   And he was opposed to expanding the database, which, as the
governor proposed it, would include taking DNA from people who
chain themselves together at civil demonstrations, which often
leads to a misdemeanor conviction for resisting arrest.

<P>
   WEST VALLEY, N.Y. _ Here at the opposite end of New York state
from the site of the Indian Point nuclear accident on Feb. 15 lies
one of the country's biggest radioactive stains, left behind at a
long-mothballed recycling plant for spent nuclear fuel rods.
</P>
<P>
   An army of nearly 1,000 scientists and engineers has spent 18
years and $1.5 billion so far on a cleanup involving
custom-designed robots and remote-controlled ovens that bake liquid
wastes into solid glass cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are testing the ultimate in low technology: a mineral
better known as a prime ingredient in cat litter.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state energy experts and a task force of residents
are closely watching the project, which involves digging a deep
trench and burying a wall of zeolite _ the same stuff found in
millions of cat boxes _ to sop up radioactive material tainting the
ground water. The contaminant is seeping toward a stream that feeds
Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of things that are simple that turn out
better,'' said Joe Patti, the owner of a West Valley hardware store
and a member of the task force. ``It's too early to say whether
it's going to work, but if they don't try to do something, we're
going to have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeolite is actually a family of 48 minerals that absorb odors
and moisture. They are commonly found in many varieties of animal
litter, and it turns out that the most abundant one,
clinoptilolite, has a strong affinity for strontium 90, the
radioactive isotope that tainted ground water beneath the plant
when acid ate through a concrete and steel foundation several
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists and officials involved in the test are eager to
play down the latest strategy's quirky pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zeolites are used for all kinds of things, and one of those
markets happens to be cat litter,'' said Alan J. Rabideau, an
associate professor of engineering at the State University at
Buffalo who ran the laboratory studies and is monitoring the pilot
project.
</P>
<P>
   At the university and the West Valley plant site, the cat litter
connection has often dominated discussions, he said, adding, ``That
has sort of trivialized the science.''
</P>
<P>
   After Rabideau's lab tests in the spring of 1999 were
successful, cleanup managers began a field test of the buried
zeolite wall in December. The 3,300-acre West Valley site sits on a
rural windswept slope 30 miles south of Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   If the test goes as planned, for at least the next 25 years the
porous mineral wall, 30 feet across and 26 feet deep, will act like
a giant molecular sieve, letting water flow downhill but capturing
any strontium 90 molecules.
</P>
<P>
   The method could not only be expanded at the West Valley site,
but could also help restore water quality at many other nuclear
waste sites, federal energy officials said. The approach could
sharply reduce the need for costly pumping systems for treating
ground water.
</P>
<P>
   Results should be evident by the spring, said Beth A. Fallon,
the project manager for West Valley Nuclear Services, a subsidiary
of Westinghouse that is handling the cleanup for the Department of
Energy and the state, which owns the land.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The state built the fuel-processing plant in the early 1960s in
hopes that the emergent atomic power industry would revive the
economy of western New York. But the plant ran for only six years,
from 1966 to 1972, chopping up spent fuel rods and extracting
uranium and plutonium in acid baths. The process left radioactive
residue above and in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the underground strontium leak, totaling about 200
curies of radiation, represents a minuscule fraction of the
contamination at the West Valley site, which harbors 30 million
curies.
</P>
<P>
   (A curie is the amount of radiation given off by one gram of
radium. The 12 radium dots on the dials of the radium watches
popular in the 1920s emitted about three one-thousandths of a curie
of radiation. By comparison, the accident at the Three Mile Island
nuclear power plant released about 50 curies into the air;
Chernobyl released tens of millions of curies. And if any radiation
escaped in the brief puff of steam and gas that was released from
the Indian Point 2 reactor in Westchester County on Feb. 15,
engineers say it would have been measurable only in millionths of a
curie, if that.)
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the radioactive waste at the West Valley
site has been contained in the solid glass blocks, but the
remaining waste includes radioactive sludge in rusting underground
tanks and the contents of two nuclear waste dumps, which hold a
melange of chopped-up casings for fuel rods, old gloves and other
debris.
</P>
<P>
   The underground plume of strontium was detected about seven
years ago, Fallon said. The leak was stopped years ago, plant
officials said, but the strontium has been slowly spreading ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of the 700-foot-long amoeba-shaped plume _
which is spreading downhill from the old factory _ has approached
the surface of the gravelly soil in some places and, if nothing is
done, could eventually make its way into several creeks and
possibly Lake Erie, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Private environmental groups, the nearby Seneca Indian Nation
and neighboring towns have long been concerned about that
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, West Valley Nuclear Services began drilling
wells and pumping the contaminated water through filters to capture
the strontium 90, but the method costs nearly $400,000 a year and
creates its own new batch of radioactive waste each time the filter
material has to be replaced, Fallon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways,'' she said, ``you're creating more of a problem
than you're solving.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, engineers began searching for an alternative and
quickly focused on an emerging toxic cleanup method: allowing
ground water to pass through underground berms of materials that
can catch or break down hazardous chemicals. One variation of this
technique, using buried walls of iron filings, is increasingly
being used to remove chlorinated solvents, like dry-cleaning fluid,
from ground water.
</P>
<P>
   Small tests of zeolite as a strontium snare at the nuclear site
in Hanford, Wash., were successful, and the material has been used
for decontamination at Chalk River, a nuclear site in Ontario. But
Rabideau said the West Valley test was the first large-scale effort
to use the mineral in a completely passive way.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers hope that the zeolite will not have to be replaced for
a relatively long time, eliminating the need for frequent pumping
and treating of ground water, and for the disposal of newly created
radioactive waste. And over time, the strontium will decay and lose
much of its radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
   The project is still in its early stages. Water samples are
taken every other week, Ms. Fallon said, and by March the team
should have enough data to see if the project is working. The goal
is to see a rise in concentrations of strontium in the wall, and a
drop levels in the ground water downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is enthusiastic about the mineral wall. Ray
Vaughan, who lives halfway between the plant and Buffalo and has
been tracking the cleanup for 22 years as a member of several
community groups and the citizens' task force, said the test
``appears to be a useful idea.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that he and other residents wanted the cleanup to
proceed as rapidly as possible. They think that it has to include
pumping and treating of the most heavily contaminated water.
</P>
<P>
   A formal report on the test is to be issued in late spring,
Fallon said, adding that if it works, the wall will be extended for
about 100 feet to intercept the leading edge of the entire plume.
The total cost is expected to be less than $1.5 million, she said,
far less than it would cost to continue pumping and treating the
water year after year.
</P>
<P>
   If the technique catches on, it will mean a new line of business
for Glen and Marie Teague, who own the mine in eastern Oregon that
supplied the mineral being used for the test _ at $180 a ton.
</P>
<P>
   Teague said she and her husband sold their zeolite mainly as an
additive for poultry and livestock feed _ it improves the health of
the animals by absorbing some toxins _ and as a deodorizer for
horse stalls.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, as cat litter. The Teagues sell it in 40-pound
sacks.

ARRESTS IN NEW YORK BREAK UP DRUG NETWORK RUN BY ISRAELIS,
OFFICIALS SAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A drug-dealing network run by Israelis who sold
millions of dollars worth of Ecstasy, the illegal stimulant of
choice in nightclubs, was broken up with the arrest of most of its
members, law enforcement officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which sold as many as 100,000 Ecstasy tablets each
week in the New York region alone, was one of the major suppliers
in the area and maintained a distribution system that stretched
along the East Coast, to California and around the world, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vehicle to make large amounts of money,'' said Lewis
Rice Jr., the special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration's New York office. ``If you have the nose to make
money in a criminal way, this is the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that while the pills could be produced for a few
cents each in laboratories _ most of them in Holland, Belgium and
Luxembourg _ they sold for about $6 to $8 per tablet wholesale and
an average of $25 retail.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brown, the Queens district attorney, said the sale of
200,000 tablets would generate profits of more than $1 million. He
said the trade also proved lucrative for the nightclubs where it
was sold, because dehydration was one side effect of the drug and
the clubs sold bottles of water for $5 to $7.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy is the popular name for MDMA, a chemical combination
that is energizing and mildly hallucinogenic. It reduces
inhibitions and suppresses the need to eat, drink or sleep, thereby
getting those who use it through hours or even days of extended
concerts or other activities. The effects from one pill usually
last up to six hours, but an overdose can cause accelerated
heartbeat, high blood pressure, fainting, muscle cramps or panic
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that organized crime based in
Israel, having gained control of the major share of the market in
Europe, now dominated the smuggling and distribution of the drug in
this country as well. Once limited to use in large cities, the drug
has mushroomed in popularity and is now found in small towns and
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said that while confiscations in New York amounted to a few
thousand tablets before 1995, more than two million had been taken
in 1999. The arrests announced Wednesday included the seizure of
more than 300,000 tablets, worth $7.5 million, and about $550,000
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that 27 people had been arrested in the case,
including 5 Israeli citizens, over the last two weeks. Ten suspects
are still at large, they said, including an Israeli man identified
as Oshri Amar. The authorities accused him of running the ring from
his apartment in the Forest Hills neighborhood. He is believed to
be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the investigation started 10 months ago when
undercover agents bought Ecstasy from Amar and then put wiretaps on
his telephone and those of 35 associates.
</P>
<P>
   All those arrested were charged with conspiracy to sell and
distribute a controlled substance, plus various counts of criminal
possession or sale of the illegal drug.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph D. Keefe, who runs the DEA's special operations division,
said that federal guidelines specified a maximum of about five
years in jail for someone caught with more than 20 pounds of the
drug, or roughly 40,000 pills. ``From a trafficking standpoint,''
he said, ``the risk is low.''

   DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. _ Memo from Al Gore and Bill Bradley to
the universe: Hello! There is still a Democratic primary going on,
even if no one is watching.
</P>
<P>
   While the political world and its lumbering apparatus of media
and spinmeisters are swept up in the Republican primaries, Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley struggle to earn a
patch of airtime on television or a splotch of ink in the
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore offered a forlorn cry Wednesday for attention. ``I come
here to make a national proposal,'' Gore told retirees here as he
described a plan to pay for prescription drugs for Medicare
recipients. But being a politician of some experience, Gore knew
that the only way he might win some notice was by referring to the
Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   So he added that neither Sen. John McCain of Arizona nor Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas would support his proposal. Then he segued
into a pan of their candidacies, on topics from their lack of
support for health care to their lack of concern over the
Confederate battle flag flying in South Carolina. (``They echo one
another in their efforts to attract the extreme right wing,'' he
said.) Still, national television hardly touched it.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, way behind Gore in the polls, is in an even more
desolate position. He came in a relatively close second to Gore in
the New Hampshire primary three weeks ago. But McCain's resounding
victory over Bush, and the Republican see-sawing, has captivated
the nation and completely overshadowed Bradley's challenge to Gore,
whom many observers had long perceived as the foregone nominee
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's success in appealing to independent voters whom Bradley
has sought has hurt Bradley further.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bradley headed off to the northwest corner of the
country, Washington state, to make his last stand. The primary
there on Tuesday is nothing more than a beauty contest and offers
no delegates. But Bradley thought the electorate there might be
more conducive to his independent candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, McCain, the man of the moment, also decided that
Washington could keep his boat afloat, so he descended on the state
and drew a massive press entourage _ leaving Bradley in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   While a visit by a vice president always draws a flock of local
media attention, Gore has been reduced to being a bystander in this
segment of the campaign. But for him, irrelevancy is not
necessarily a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for Gore, bad for Bradley,'' said Bill Carrick, a
Democratic consultant based in Los Angeles. ``Gore didn't want
Bradley re-energizing his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is this helpful to Gore in the short-term, Carrick
said, but he also benefits in the long-term by the slugfest on the
other side. He said that if Bush won, he will have to have
positioned himself to the right of McCain, allowing Gore to
continue painting him as a tool of the right wing. If McCain wins,
Carrick said, ``all bets are off,'' because the senator has already
proved attractive to independents and some Democrats and could
siphon those votes away from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore admitted Wednesday that he was trying to appeal to
precisely those voters. ``I'm appealing to independents and
independent-thinking Republicans,'' he told a television
interviewer here.
</P>
<P>
   In his riff against the Republicans on Wednesday, Gore gave
McCain and Bush equal billing. He is asked repeatedly by local
television stations as he zooms around the country which Republican
he would rather run against. ``Whichever one loses,'' he jokes,
staying steadfastly neutral and continuing to ignore the 2-ton
elephant in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Carrick said that the only way for Gore and Bradley to gain
attention is to ``try to inject themselves into the Republican
race,'' hence the Democrats' references to the Confederate flag and
Bob Jones University, two subjects on the Republican side. Bradley
even made a foray into South Carolina during the Republican primary
there, to little avail.
</P>
<P>
   While no one has been watching, the Democrats took a turn for
the nasty Wednesday in dueling radio commercials in Washington in
which they both, for the first time, mention each other by name.
Bradley's went up first. It says that Gore voted against abortion
and gun control while he was in the House and directs listeners to
a new Web site (www.moreaboutgore.com) where they can ``learn
more'' about Gore's record.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's commercial, made Wednesday in response to Bradley's,
says: ``Attack ads, negative campaigning. Bill Bradley sounds more
like a Republican every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain and Bush are tearing each other apart, some
Republicans are gloating about the wash of media attention and
thrilled that the Democrats are being ignored. ``No campaign
manager would say his inability to make news is a good thing,''
said Bill Pascoe, a spokesman for the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are paying attention to us the way they paid attention
to Sammy Sosa and Mark McGuire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley acknowledged Wednesday that McCain's surge, strengthened
by the independents he himself is courting, may have hurt him in
some places. He offered a two-pronged strategy to deal with that:
let Democrats and independents know how conservative McCain is and
point out Gore's potential weakness in the face of McCain's
campaign finance proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with WCBS-TV in New York on Wednesday, Bradley
said of Gore: ``I think he's a real risk as we go into a fall
campaign, particularly if John McCain does better and better.''

POLICE REFORMER DRAWS ON HIS EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ill.)  (See also DIALLO-TRIAL, DIALLO-JUDGE) 
(js) 
 By JAN HOFFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big guy, Jimmy Fyfe, all hulking 6 feet 7 inches
Norwegian-Scottish-Irish of him, with the coarse street talk of a
Brooklyn cop, abruptly gets tearful. In June 1998, he recounts, his
son-in-law, a black graduate student at the University of Illinois
who was a political refugee from the Ivory Coast, was stomped to
death by a white bouncer outside a tavern in Champaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched my daughter go through what Mrs. Diallo is going
through now,'' he says, referring to the mother of Amadou Diallo,
the Guinean man hit by 19 of 41 bullets fired by four white police
officers in the Bronx. ``We have an understanding of this stuff: I
have a little black grandson without a father.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, James J. Fyfe, who left the New York City Police
Department after 16 years and became a nationally recognized expert
on deadly force, usually testifying against the police, chose to
defend the officers in the Diallo killing.
</P>
<P>
   Fyfe, 58, a professor of criminal justice at Temple University,
was the final witness in the Diallo trial last week, forceful and
crusty, insisting that the officers had followed procedure. To
underline his vehemence, he refused to be paid for his time.
Prosecutors chose not to cross-examine him.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's death was a tragic mistake, he believes, ``but the
killing was justifiable and understandable.'' The Diallos, he adds,
``were dealt a great wrong and deserve to be compensated,'' but
through civil liability, not prosecution. He faults the training of
the officers and the 16-round 9-millimeter guns they carried. ``It
was an accident waiting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought justice would not be served by convicting those
cops,'' Fyfe adds, drinking coffee in his home in Princeton, N.J.,
watching the closing arguments on television. ``This was not police
brutality _ it's about the criminalization of professional
discretion, a decision made in seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the upper echelons of policedom, Fyfe's position was
startling and, given his long career developing training and
regulations to limit violence by officers, almost counterintuitive.
This is the man who testified in police brutality cases in 33
states _ and was an expert 40 times just against the Philadelphia
police: ``I testified against the Los Angeles police many times
when Daryl F. Gates was held liable.''
</P>
<P>
   His doctoral dissertation in 1978 on shootings by New York City
police officers led to now commonplace rules that forbid warning
shots and firing at moving vehicles. His research on when the
police can shoot at fleeing felons bolstered the landmark Supreme
Court case Tennessee vs. Garner; countless departments adopted the
restrictions he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Fyfe's testimony on behalf of Tracey Thurman, the savagely
battered wife whose cries for help were ignored by the police in
Torrington, Conn., was central to the impact of that famous case:
police departments around the country re-examined their response to
domestic violence calls. And he was the expert against the New
Jersey state troopers in the 1996 racial profiling case, in which
17 turnpike arrests were thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   As a working-class intellectual and a progressive, ``Jimmy is
reviled and feared and revered in police circles,'' said Michael A.
Julian, a former chief of personnel for the New York City police.
``But he has done more to change policing than anyone else in this
country.'' After a Staten Island man in custody wrestled with
officers and died, Julian asked Fyfe to design a protocol to
prevent such deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this unspools from a bright, ambitious beat cop's
long-ago desire to become, as he puts it, ``a cop's boss.''(``I
loved the cops _ the problem was the bosses.'') His father, a
shipfitter at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, an hourly wage man who
endured stretches of layoffs, was relieved when his son, flailing
as a bank teller and part-time college student, joined the force _
steady wages, benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Fyfe calls policing ``a wonderful job,'' counting
among his best friends guys from the 84th Precinct in downtown
Brooklyn. On a long afternoon, he tells tales of wise guys and
riots and the snout of a Walther PPK stuck in his belly and the
Brooklyn law school dean who beat an illegal U-turn ticket by
claiming to have made ``two left turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, the Police Department figured it had a live one: he
scored second on the sergeant's exam out of 18,067 candidates and
third on the lieutenant's exam. He finished up his bachelor's, got
his master's and eventually his Ph.D, leaving patrol for the Police
Academy, where he ran departments and got the ultimate street cop's
revenge: training the bosses.
</P>
<P>
   But when Fyfe was passed over for captain because lower scorers
with seniority had priority, he quit for a very different life,
with grants and research, at the Police Foundation, American
University and Temple. He's now analyzing factors common to New
York City officers who were dismissed or forced to resign between
1975 and 1996. A father of three daughters, he lives with his
second wife, Candace McCoy, a Rutgers criminal justice professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most police academics study deployment issues and grand
policy,'' says Fyfe with a dismissive wave. ``My interest has
always been what the cops do on the street, how to help them where
the rubber meets the road.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the 12-member board of the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey holds its monthly meeting Thursday, the agenda
will be limited to routine capital expenditures instead of the
grand bridges, tunnels, airports and development projects the
agency has pursued in its 79 years.
</P>
<P>
   Such initiatives exist in abundance, but a long-simmering civil
war between New York and New Jersey members has made agreement on
them impossible. As a result, the agency has all but halted for the
last year actions that could generate billions of dollars from such
things as the privatization of the World Trade Center, the leasing
of air rights over the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the approval
of a long-term lease meant to keep the container terminal at Port
Elizabeth competitive with other East Coast ports.
</P>
<P>
   Historians, former agency officials and some board members call
the stalemate the worst in the history of the agency, which is the
nation's oldest congressionally approved compact between two
states.
</P>
<P>
   The agency was created in 1921 to coordinate the two states'
transportation and port projects and enhance commerce in the
metropolitan region. The authority built and operates all of the
tunnel and bridge crossings between New Jersey and New York City,
manages ports in both states, operates the PATH rapid transit
system linking several points in New Jersey and lower Manhattan,
and owns the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   The current impasse grows out of a squabble between New York and
New Jersey about the allocation of Port Authority expenditures,
which have amounted to $14 billion over the years. As a
complicating sidelight, the agency has become the target of New
York City's mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani. While other mayors have
silently suffered the Port Authority's presence in their midst,
Giuliani has publicly lacerated it as an unaccountable and
unnecessary anachronism that ought to be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the situation is the makeup of the board, which
is top- heavy with members politically tied to the two governors.
</P>
<P>
   The result has crippled the authority and significantly dimmed
its reputation as a businesslike body able to rise above politics
and bureaucratic red tape to get things done.
</P>
<P>
   The port agency's board has met only five times in the last 10
months, with New York members actually boycotting the December
meeting. A repeat of such acrimonious tactics is not likely
Thursday, said Charles A. Gargano, the vice chairman and a New York
representative. But he added: ``There are minor things on the
agenda, and none of our major resolutions. So the impasse
continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, internal efforts to sort out differences have slowed to
a crawl, said the chairman, Lewis M. Eisenberg, a New Jersey
appointee, and some other top officials have openly talked of the
need for an outside study to see if major changes must be made in
the compact or whether alternatives to the agency are needed.

RAP PERFORMER IS CHARGED WITH BRIBERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hours before he appeared at the Grammy Awards in Los
Angeles Wednesday night, the rap impresario Sean Combs was indicted
by a Manhattan grand jury Wednesday on charges of bribing a
witness, stemming from a Dec. 27 Times Square nightclub shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, who has already been indicted for illegal gun possession
in the case, was accused in the new indictment of offering his
driver $50,000 to take responsibility for a gun found in Combs' car
after he fled the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Combs, denied the charges and
called the timing of the indictment ``unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was intentionally timed to embarrass Mr. Combs on the
eve of the Grammy Awards in California, I would be terribly
disappointed in the Manhattan district attorney,'' Brafman said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Brison, a spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney's
office, said the timing was coincidental. ``The grand jury schedule
was set without any relation to the Grammys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, better known as Puff Daddy, was nominated for a Grammy
this year for best rap performance, though he did not win.
</P>
<P>
   At a bail hearing on Feb. 10, Assistant District Attorney
Matthew Bogdanos gave an unusually detailed description of what
prosecutors say was Combs' role in the shooting. Bogdanos accused
Combs of sparking the shooting by being belligerent and of
endangering his companion that night, the singer and actress
Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Bogdanos also said Combs offered his driver a diamond ring, a
birthday gift from Lopez, as collateral for the $50,000 bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Combs' bodyguard Anthony Jones was also indicted Wednesday on
charges of bribing a witness. Both are due back in court on Feb.
29. If convicted of the illegal gun possession and bribery charges,
Combs faces up to 15 years in prison.

FIRST LADY'S CONGRESSWOMAN PULLS WELCOME MAT AND GOES ON THE
ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT KISCO, N.Y. _ Rep. Sue Kelly says she sees nothing unusual
in her relationship with her most prominent new constituents, the
first couple, whose new house in Chappaqua sits squarely in the
19th Congressional District Kelly has represented for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will represent them,'' she says matter-of-factly, ``just
like I represent everybody else.'' On the other hand, not every
couple sees their congresswoman fly around the state proclaiming
them a threat to the general welfare. And rather than rolling out
the welcome mat, Kelly has been enlisted by the national Republican
Party as a prime point person against Hillary Rodham Clinton in her
campaign for the New York Senate seat being vacated by Daniel
Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the battle for the vote of suburban women expected
to be important in Clinton's race against New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, Kelly has been identified by Republicans as
artfully positioned to make the case against Clinton. ``She is a
carpetbagger,'' said Kelly, a Republican who lives 10 miles from
the Clintons in Katonah. ``She does not know New York. You need to
live here. You need to have the background and understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the normally genial Kelly was born in Ohio but
has lived in the district, which includes the northern part of
Westchester County, Putnam County and parts of Dutchess and Orange
Counties, for 40 years. She is also running for office, seeking a
fourth term, and considers Giuliani a friend (by way of his wife,
Donna Hanover, whom Kelly admires for supporting her when she ran
as a virtual unknown in a crowded primary race in 1994.)
</P>
<P>
   The accusations come early and often: The Clintons' security
needs in Chappaqua and its environs are a drain on municipal
coffers. Clinton is wasting taxpayer money by using government jets
for her own political purposes. The Clintons callously ignore
residents' concerns about the heating oil price crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a neo-socialist cause she won't shove down our
throats,'' Kelly said in a letter earlier this month on behalf of
Conservatives for Effective Leadership, a group raising funds for
Giuliani. Giuliani welcomes Kelly's support, a campaign spokeswoman
said, and may even campaign with her. But it is safe to say the
Clintons will not be calling on their Congresswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not very neighborly of her,'' Howard Wolfson,
Clinton's campaign spokesman, said of the attacks. Wolfson said
Kelly's actions ``belie her image as a moderate.'' And he
criticized her for ``politicizing the first lady's security
needs,'' which include police protection and a secure government
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks strike some congressional observers as out of
character for Kelly, 63, who is generally considered a
middle-of-the-road moderate whom liberals have thumped for her
associations with Newt Gingrich and conservatives have trumped as a
closet Democrat because she is an abortion rights advocate and has
favored gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th District, long held by liberal-minded and moderate
Republicans, voted for President Clinton in 1996 by 7 percentage
points but gave Kelly a decisive 30-point victory in 1998 over her
Democratic opponent, Dick Collins. Its political ideology
encompasses Gov. George Pataki, who lives in Garrison in Putnam
County, as well as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who lives in Mount Kisco.
ItIt is an eclectic district, as Kelly notes, that takes in Sing
Sing prison, West Point and Vassar College. ``Do I have an
interesting district?'' she said. ``Yes I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a former real-estate broker, junior high teacher and
hospital patient advocate, has a reputation for caution. Red-meat
tactics do not seem to come easy to a person who one day would like
to publish a book on walking tours of the historic hamlets she
represents and counts doting on her grandchildren as her favorite
pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, and by extension the national party, have something to
gain by Kelly's stridency. Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the
Marist College Institute of Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, said he
did not believe that Kelly's jabs could greatly influence the
Senate race, But he added that they could deflect any conservative
challenge in her congressional campaign, a problem she has faced in
the past, while helping the GOP establish credentials with suburban
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Republicans, it's nice to have a woman making some of
these jabs,'' Miringoff said. ``It takes some of the gender gap
sting out the charge.''

BUSH'S LESSON: NEW YORK DOESN'T BELIEVE IN SLIP-UPS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOYCE PURNICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The political take on New York, as it gears up for its March 7
primaries, is that it is one tough place. Especially for outsiders,
sometimes even for insiders.
</P>
<P>
   It is. Probably only in New York would Hillary Rodham Clinton be
expected to answer for an offensive statement someone else made at
an event before she even entered the room. Or would Alfonse D'Amato
expect to see a crude remark he uttered in private turn up in
headlines, and maybe cost him his job in the Senate. In New York,
you don't even say you'll march in the St. Patrick's Day Parade _ a
seeming no-brainer _ until you do your homework and learn that gay
groups, banned from the parade, oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, at the same time, New Yorkers demand candid
candidates, willing to speak their minds at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore it is of more than passing interest that George W.
Bush, expected to be campaigning here in the next few weeks (when
he isn't campaigning in California) has had nice things to say
about the Nation of Islam. You know the Nation of Islam. Its leader
is Louis Farrakhan, who has offended more groups of people than
even John Rocker has.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked about the Nation of Islam during an appearance on
a Fox television program that first ran on Jan. 30. The governor's
remarks got limited attention until Fox replayed the interview
Tuesday night after the Michigan primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said ``faith-based organizations ought to be allowed to
compete to be able to provide government services.''
</P>
<P>
   The interviewer, Tony Snow asked, ``Is the Nation of Islam a
faith-based organization?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush answered: ``I think it is. I think it's based upon some
universal principles. It's certainly not the religion I accepted.
But I believe that the folks _ the Muslims who accept, you know,
love your neighbor like you'd like to be loved yourself, and whose
hearts are set right to help a neighbor in need.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added, ``I don't like taxpayer money to support any
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   With reluctance, we remind readers _ and Bush _ of a few of
Farrakhan's comments. He has said that Judaism is a ``gutter
religion''; that Jews are ``bloodsuckers'' and ``wicked
deceivers.'' He has called the Pope an ``antichrist,'' and Hitler
``wickedly great.'' He has denounced whites and gays.
</P>
<P>
   To hear a mainstream candidate running in a New York campaign
sound as though he is admiring of the Nation of Islam is nothing
short of breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he really thinks Farrakhan believes in `love thy neighbor,'
and represents universal principles, Bush has no sense of what
intolerance is all about,'' said Rep. Peter King, a Long Island
Republican who switched his support this week from Bush to Sen.
John McCain of Arizona. ``If he doesn't know what the Nation of
Islam is, how can he run for president? Imagine coming into New
York City's ethnic neighborhoods with the Nation of Islam wrapped
around your neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine indeed. One would think that the Bush camp would have
cleared this up. Fast. Was he really talking about the Nation of
Islam, or the Muslim religion? Clarification took awhile, though. A
long while.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith, suggested in a Feb. 2 letter to Bush that the
governor might not be aware of the racist and anti-Semitic history
of the Nation of Islam. He has yet to get a response, said his
spokeswoman, Myrna Shinbaum.
</P>
<P>
   The National Jewish Democratic Council, an issues advocacy group
of Jewish Democrats, criticized Bush in a Feb. 1 statement that got
no response, nor did articles that ran in Jewish newspapers early
this month get a direct answer.
</P>
<P>
   Not until last night did a Bush spokesman, Ari Fleischer,
clarify the governor's remarks: ``He answered about the religion of
Islam,'' Fleischer said in a telephone interview. ``He has said
previously he does not believe Louis Farrakhan preaches peace. He
interpreted the question to be about Islam, not Farrakhan, not the
Nation of Islam. The governor doesn't think anybody who preaches
hate would qualify for the program's funding. And Farrakhan
preaches hate.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a relief to hear that clarifier, even if it comes more
than three weeks late. Good thing it's a long campaign. But
mistakes like this, even if unintentional, have a cost in politics,
especially in New York politics.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides have already met _ Tuesday night _ with Jewish
community leaders and rabbis, seeking and getting support; they
cited, among other factors, that Bush interview on Fox.
</P>

   Unfair? Maybe. But this is New York. As we said, a tough place.

   For the second straight year, The New York Times was selected as
one of the 10 best sports sections in the country by the Associated
Press Sports Editors. The Times was named in the daily and Sunday
categories in judging that ended Wednesday in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Times was also cited in several individual categories.
Selena Roberts, who covers the Knicks, was selected in the
game-story category for her account of Allan Houston's winning shot
in the playoffs against Miami last year.
</P>
<P>
   Two writers from The Times placed in the top 10 for features:
James C. McKinley, for his tale of the families left behind in Cuba
by baseball players who defected to the United States, and Bill
Pennington, for a behind-the-scenes look at the work week of a pro
football coaching staff. Finally, the sports department's coverage
of the Salt Lake City Olympic scandal was cited in the
investigative category.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News of New York was also named among the top 10 for
daily and Sunday sections. Three papers _ The Boston Globe, The
Dallas Morning News and The Chicago Tribune _ were named in the
daily, Sunday and special section categories.

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
CARLSBAD, Calif. _ The good news for last year's Final Four of the
Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship is that they can get
together today and have their own private skins game away from the
crowds and the rain at La Costa Resort.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's bad news for defending champion Jeff Maggert but perhaps
a blessing for ABC and anybody else hoping the marquee players make
a better showing at this unique event than they did a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert, The Woodlands resident who beat Andrew Magee with a
sudden-death chip-in last year for the title, was convincingly
flushed out of the first round by Bob Tway before torrential rains
practically flushed away the La Costa course. Maggert joined Magee,
Steve Pate and John Huston _ 1999's four semifinalists _ on the
sideline after the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Left standing, however, are Tiger Woods and the rest of the top
five seeds. Also, 20 of the top 32 advanced, with two matches
suspended because of the rain. This is a significant change from
last year, when 18 of the higher seeds lost in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a bit of relief after getting through the
first round,'' said David Duval, the world's No. 2 player who
whipped Argentina's Angel Cabrera 4-and-3. ``Everybody was curious
this year to see if the top seeds were going to leave early like
they did last year. So it's nice to play well and get by.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert wasn't able to say the same thing. He was dusted by Tway
6-and-5. Maggert was 5 over par for his 13 holes. It was a far cry
from '99, when he swept through everybody, including Woods in the
quarterfinals, for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I've only lost one match at this tournament and I've
won six,'' Maggert said of his two-year record. ``Bob just played a
good, steady round of golf. I didn't hit the ball very well. That's
a bad combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing to lose. But the fact that it came in the
first round doesn't mean much. You're playing to make it to the
weekend, and whether you lose on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday is
pretty insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert, the 20th seed, said before the tournament began that he
knew it would be an uphill climb to successfully defend his title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, everyone would have loved to have seen Tiger and
David play for it all on Sunday last year,'' Maggert said. ``And
who knows, maybe that's the way it will turn out this year. But the
odds are against it. Who knows, it could end up with a couple of
nobodies like myself again.''
</P>
<P>
   It will have to be different nobodies this time.
</P>
<P>
   But the somebodies so far are getting the upper hand. Woods made
quick work of New Zealander Michael Campbell, who must have had a
spy in Woods' closet because both players came dressed in exactly
the same Nike outfits. The only difference was Campbell's lucky red
socks, which failed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice not only to win your first-round match but to
play well in the first round,'' Woods said. ``That obviously gives
you a little bit of confidence going into your next match that you
went out there and won. The guy didn't give it to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' match with No. 64 seed Campbell was billed as a contest
between the two hottest players on the planet. But it never
developed as Woods went 3-up after four holes and eventually won
5-and-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's been playing pretty well of late (winning three of
his last four tournaments), but hopefully everybody didn't forget
that I've played pretty well, too, over that stretch,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Campbell: ``Every time he was over a chip or a putt, you
thought he was going to hole it. That's a scary thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Also playing well was Duval, who won five of six holes beginning
on No. 7 and rolled to a 4-and-3 victory over Cabrera. No. 3 Colin
Montgomerie was in one of the two matches that didn't finish, but
he was 1-up on Dennis Paulson with two holes to play. No. 4 Davis
Love III and No. 5 Ernie Els also posted solid wins.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the underdogs didn't have their moments.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Mayfair pulled off one of the biggest upsets, nicking No.
9 Phil Mickelson in dramatic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair and Mickelson were tied after 18 holes, but on the
second sudden-death hole, Mayfair quickly turned the tables. After
driving 50 yards past Mayfair, Mickelson hit his second shot on the
par-5 to within 6 feet of the pin. Mayfair already had hit into the
greenside bunker.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayfair blasted out from about 12 yards and watched his ball
roll into the cup for an eagle. Mickelson's putt never had a
chance, and Mayfair advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every putt was nerve-racking coming down the stretch,''
Mayfair said. ``That's what's different about this format. Usually
you don't feel that way until Sunday. Or at least Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the final hole, I took the water out of play with my second
shot and I had a pretty simple bunker shot. I should get that ball
up and down nine out of 10 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he'll make it on the other try.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh was the highest seed to fall. Entered as the sixth
seed, he was beaten by Duffy Waldorf. Others pulling off surprises
included Japan's Shigeki Murayama, who beat Huston, and Scott Hoch,
who overcame Stuart Appleby's 9-iron shot for an eagle on No. 8 to
win 1-up.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the top seeds, however, it was a day to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense of relief, because you start back at even in
the next round,'' said No. 11 Hal Sutton, who beat Ted Tryba
4-and-3. ``A few minutes ago, I was 4-up. Now I'm even. That's the
way it is in this.''

CLASSIC MOVIES TO HIT DVD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Feb. 25) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the Academy Awards season, if you hadn't noticed, and Fox
Home Entertainment is going into its vaults on March 7 to release
several Oscar-nominated and Oscar-winning films for the first time
on DVD _ among them, ``An Affair to Remember,'' ``How Green Was My
Valley,'' ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing'' and ``Gentlemen's
Agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gregory Peck as a journalist who poses as a Jew in
order to discover what it was like to be a victim of religious
prejudice, ``Gentlemen's Agreement'' won the 1947 Best Picture
award as well as the best director award for Elia Kazan. A
heartfelt attempt to explore an issue that was previously much
ignored in Hollywood, the film seems dated now, but Kazan (``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``On the Waterfront'') wrings moving
performances from his cast _ including Celeste Holm, who won as
best supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Affair to Remember'' wasn't a major contender in the 1957
Oscars, but this soapily amusing Cary Grant-Deborah Kerr love story
has endured. A remake of Leo McCarey's 1939 ``Love Affair'' with
Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer, the 1957 version was used as an
integral plot point in the 1993 hit ``Sleepless in Seattle'' and
was remade into ``Love Affair'' with Warren Beatty and Annette
Bening 1994. How much magic the movie maintains really depends on
your mood, though.
</P>
<P>
   The 1941 film ``How Green Was My Valley'' received 11
nominations and won five Oscars, including best picture and a
statuette for its director, the legendary John Ford. Volumes have
been written about Ford, a taskmaster who helped shape careers in
Hollywood, most notably that of John Wayne. ``Valley'' is told
through the eyes of a young boy (the late Roddy McDowall) at the
turn of the last century as he sees his tight-knit Welsh family and
those living in the beautiful surrounding countryside suffer at the
hands of greedy mineowners. Although filled with sentimentality,
anyone wanting to learn how to tell simply and economically for the
screen would be wise to study this film.
</P>
<P>
   (As an interesting side note, Darryl F. Zanuck, the film's
producer, wanted the film shot in Wales but budgetary constraints
forced him to shoot it in a California Valley _ the San Fernando.
He had the entire Welsh village, coal mine and adjacent buildings
constructed on 80 acres and it took 150 workers six months to
create the authenthic-looking sets.)
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Zanuck had worked together the year before on 1940's
``The Grapes of Wrath,'' based on John Steinbeck's novel and
starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, the Depression-era Okie who
refuses to be be beaten down. Ford picked up an Oscar for directing
on that one, too, though Fonda and Zanuck were shut out.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Ford films, there is a marked degree of
sentimentality in the film, but it's difficult not to be moved by
this film, especially by Fonda's farewell speech to his mother:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be everywhere, wherever you can look. Wherever there's a
fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a
cop beating up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be there in the way guys
yell when they're mad. I'll be there in the way kids laugh when
they're hungry, and they know supper's ready, and when people are
eatin' the stuff they raised, and livin' in the houses they built,
I'll be there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda's sensitive, stirring performance should have won him the
Oscar as best actor, but he lost to Jimmy Stewart for ``The
Philadelphia Story.'' Stewart said he felt Fonda should have won
and had cast his own vote for his friend. &QL; 
_____
</P>
<P>
   ``An Affair to Remember,'' ``How Green Was My Valley,'' ``Love
Is a Many Splendored Thing'' and ``Gentlemen's Agreement'' will be
released on DVD ($24.98) and VHS ($14.98) on March 7. ``Grapes of
Wrath,'' ``Anastasia'' (1956), ``Anna and the King of Siam''
(1946), ``The Diary of Anne Frank'' (1959), ``Laura'' (1944) and
``Titanic'' (1953) will be re-released on VHS ($14.98). &QL;

BIG DIG OFFICIALS FAILED TO DISCLOSE OVERRUNS AT MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN C. MOONEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite internal tracking reports indicating Big Dig
costs were at least $500 million over budget, the project's
director last fall assured bond underwriters that there were no
cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   The assertions by Patrick J. Moynihan, project director, at a
meeting last Sept. 13, appear to be part of a pattern of
concealment and even deception, dating back more than a year, on
the part of Big Dig officials.
</P>
<P>
   The subterfuge surrounding the cost overruns collapsed Feb. 1,
when Massachusetts Turnpike Authority Chairman James S. Kerasiotes,
czar of the project, admitted publicly that the estimated cost of
the Central Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel project will increase by
$1.4 billion, to $12.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating
whether inaccurate information was included in bond offerings late
last year by the state and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority. Any SEC sanction would be an embarrassing blow to a
state that has struggled for a decade to restore its fiscal
credibility on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Jeremy Crockford, the project's chief
spokesman, acknowledged for the first time that the project was
$500 million over budget as of last June. He said: ``$500 millioj
was showing as an exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Crockford also conceded that while the project routinely tried
to offset those amounts with cuts in other areas, many of them were
speculative or, as another Big Dig official said, ``were falling
off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moynihan strenuously denied Wednesday that he gave
misleading information to bond underwriters last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall any specific questions being raised as to
specific overruns,'' said Moynihan, who assumed the director's post
in January 1999 and made an updated review of project costs a
priority. ``In reference to any suggestions to overruns, I was
referring to the fact that if we had cost pressures, we believed we
had offsets, and that to the extent we did not, we were always in
the position thit the Turnpike Authority was in a position to cover
them. I'm not going to go to a meeting like that and provi$e
information that is not complete or accurate, or speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   But several sources who attended the Sept. 13 ``due diligence''
meeting before issuance of a $500 million state bond offering nine
days later, quoted Moynihan as stating flatly there were no cost
overruns on the giant construction project. Besides several lawyers
and state officials, a representative of the lead bond underwriter,
Goldman Sachs, attended the meeting at the State House. Several of
those present took notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shocked us by saying there were no cost overruns, but said
if there were to be any, the Turnpike Authority could pay for them
out its own resources,'' said one source, whose account was
confirmed by two others who were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The offering's official statement reflected Moynihan's account
and the now-discredited $10.8 billion net project cost estimate.
The SEC is also expected to delve into a $200 million MBTA
transportation bond issue last December. That offering also made no
mention of any cosT overruns.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his meeting on the September bond issue, Moynihan
knew, or should have known, that the Big Dig's own cost monitoring
was consistently flagging projected overruns on a monthly basis
throughout 1999 and that the project was running out of potential
cuts to offset those increases.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the overrun estimates were artificially low because
they failed to include credible or up-to-date projections in some
areas and omitted other big-ticket items, among them aj extra $260
million in fees for Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, the Big Dig's
management consultant, and most of $300 million in additional costs
for intensified construction work to keep the project on schedule.
Those amounts were finally included in the $1.4 billion overrun
figure coughed up by Kerasiotes on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's statement at the bond meeting was neither the first
nor last time the project served up dubious, incomplete or
inaccurate references to the skyrocketing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, when the inspector general's office of the US
Department of Transportation estimated construction costs could
soar another $942 million over budget, Moynihan fired off a
scorching counterattack, upbraiding the federal watchdog's
methodology and scoring ``factual errors, misstatements, and
misleading calculations.'' At the time, Moynihan's office knew the
project was way over budget and well on its way to calculating the
$1.4 billion excess.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wednesday, Moynihan admitted that ``by mid-December, we
had an internal assessment in the $1.4 billion range.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite drawing that conclusion, Moynihan still forwarded a 1999
finance plan to Governor Paul Cellucci's office Dec. 23 that
sidestepped the Big Dig's bottom line. Cellucci aides were stunned
to find it omitted _ for the first time _ any estimate, old or
updated, of the project's final price tag. It did, however, include
a cover letter from Moynihan suggesting the final cost could rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That waved a huge red flag,'' said Andrew Natsios, Cellucci's
secretary of administration and finance. He immediately told
Cellucci, who became alarmed and instructed Natsios to alert bond
rating agencies. Cellucci and other state officials had met with
rating agencies early that month, seeking an upgrade in the state's
credit rating. On Jan. 6, state officials contacted the agencies to
inform them that Big Dig costs were increasing, though the
dimensions of the problem remained a closely held secret of project
officials until Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan defends the omission, saying the report, as required,
accurately reflected the financing needs, as of the previous June,
and that the Federal Highway Administration knew an updated
estimate of potential overruns was in the works.

HEINLE'S GROWTH IS KEY FOR MATADORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At times, Brian Heinle is brilliant. He's a
basketball center who can make a reverse driving layup and then
drop in a few hook shots.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-10, he can lead a fast break and flash out beyond the
3-point line and make a 22-footer. Heinle, in his third season at
Cal State Northridge, is a reliable scorer.
</P>
<P>
   He hates that label, though: scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I need to do is rebound and play defense, and if I can do
that consistently, then everything else will come,'' Heinle said.
``If I need to score, I can do that. This team needs me to score,
but this team needs me to rebound and defend just as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm going to be trying to do to finish out this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Now's the time. CSUN (15-8, 7-5) plays Big Sky Conference leader
Eastern Washington (13-9, 10-2) at Matador Gym tonight at 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   More important, it's the first of four consecutive games at home
for Northridge. For the Matadors to be successful over this
two-week stretch, Heinle, the team's leading scorer, must be
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   As Heinle goes, so does Northridge. He knows this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to play well and finish out these four games, I'm
going to have to play well,'' he said. ``I'm ready to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be bad news for Eastern Washington, and Portland
State which comes in Saturday, and every other team CSUN plays the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle can be the best player on the court. He was the best at
Fresno State on Nov. 30 when he scored a then career-high 25 points
in CSUN's 69-66 upset.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle had 34 at Weber State on Jan. 29. He leads the Matadors
with a 15.1 average, which ranks 12th in the nation among Division
I centers, and he leads all D-I centers with 33 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when you look at him and you say, `Boy,
(Heinle)'s got NBA written all over him,' '' CSUN coach Bobby
Braswell said. ``He's got good size, he's got skills. He's had
stretches like that this year, even on the defensive end.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinle is just as good at letting his emotions affect his play.
When he's called for a foul, he makes a face that looks like he
just bit into the sourest of lemons. It's the same when he misses a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best attributes of Brian is his competitiveness . .
. and sometimes that can be his enemy, too,'' CSUN coach Bobby
Braswell said. ``That competitiveness and that desire to win can
cause some frustration on his part. Whether it's the officials, or
the way he's playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to play with emotion, but you have to control those
emotions. You have to maintain a sense of level-headedness, and
that's (where) we've worked hard with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger can fuel Heinle, but it can also overcome him, especially
when it comes to officials. He says the No. 1 reason he would like
to someday be a team captain is so he ``could talk to the refs
during the game.'' Heinle has matured, though, since he was a
standout at Sheldon High in Eugene, Ore. _ even if his reputation
for being overconfident bugs him.
</P>
<P>
   He laughs at a story that describes him as dunking the ball and
on the same play, taking a seat in the stands and high-fiving his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's not true,'' he said. ``There's a lot of crazy
stories about me in high school. I don't know if half of them are
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, everyone thought I was a jerk or cocky. I
never talked trash. I never taunted.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinle's father, Gene, saw every game Brian played at Sheldon.
``I don't think (Brian) would ever show anybody up in a game. I
didn't even realize he had this reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brian) is very much a perfectionist and he puts a lot of
pressure on himself,'' Gene said. ``I think he blames himself when
(Northridge) loses.''
</P>
<P>
   That is true. No Matador seems to take a loss harder than
Heinle. After some losses this season, he's come out to do
interviews with tears welling in his eyes. Other times, he's been
disoriented and complained of headaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very careful about not having people put
unneeded pressure on themselves,'' Braswell said. ``(Heinle)
definitely knows he has to be a leader on the floor. When he's
playing well, we're playing well. He has that burden.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is in contrast to Heinle's normal personality. He's
laid-back, a carefree spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a sweet kid,'' Braswell said. ``He's got a great
heart. He's the team clown. He's the guy that keeps everyone
laughing. I just want him sometimes to make sure he's focused and
ready to go before games.''

 &HT;    Ford chooses Trilogy to put business on Web
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ford Motor Co., in a frantic race with General
Motors Corp. to exploit the Internet, has tapped Trilogy Software
Inc. of Austin to steer its transformation into a giant of
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture, which will be based in Austin, will develop
and manage all Ford Web sites, linking the world's No. 2 automaker
with customers, dealers and suppliers, the companies said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to move virtually all of Ford's business onto the
Web within about three years.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, which doesn't have a name yet, will employ more
than 300 people within a year and will have revenue of hundreds of
millions of dollars, said its chief executive, Chris Porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it will become the dominant Internet platform in the
auto industry,'' said Porch, 32, a co-founder of Trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives might argue the point. The No. 1 automaker
recently teamed with CommerceOne, a California-based Internet
company, to accelerate its online efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Watching two of the world's biggest companies, each nearly 100
years old, scramble to adopt a radical new way of doing business
shows the turmoil that is rocking the $500 billion U.S. auto
industry, said David Cole, director of a University of Michigan
center that studies the transportation industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's tremendous anxiety,'' he said. ``Everybody's running
at 100 miles per hour. They don't know where they're going, but
they're trying to get there fast.''
</P>
<P>
   With combined sales last year of $340 billion, Ford and GM will
have a huge impact on the Internet, Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The e-world desperately needs to link with industries that
make things that people need to live, like food, like clothes and
like cars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to journalists in a phone call from Detroit, Ford and
Trilogy executives predicted that the Internet's demonstrated
advantages of efficiency, customer contact and sharing of
information will lower operating costs for Ford and thousands of
dealerships and improve their profits while lowering costs to
customers and building their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kelley, president of Ford ConsumerConnect, said Ford.com
will become an indispensible site for Ford customers, giving them
information about their cars, contact with their dealers and
interactive features such as updated local traffic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Porch said other offerings likely may include extended
warranties and discounted services from related businesses, which
would pay to advertise on the Ford site.
</P>
<P>
   Trilogy, which employs about 1,200 people in Austin, makes a
family of software programs that manage buying and selling
databases for some of the country's biggest corporations. It is
privately held, so its revenue and earnings are not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been a Trilogy customer for about two years, and their
relationship was the genesis of the deal announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategic link with Ford is significant for a small
company that is little-known outside the database niche. Ford has
made other deals to build its Web business, including an agreement
last fall with Oracle to auction auto parts online.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Ford, which will own a majority stake in the new
venture, fell 44 cents to $43.63 on the New York Stock Exchange on
Wednesday.

COURT HEARS CHALLENGE TO HMO'S COST-CUTTING INCENTIVES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill.)  (Eds: SUBS to expand arguments, add quotes from justices,
background; no pickup.) 
 (nk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Grappling for the first time with the complexities
of managed health care, the Supreme Court raised a blizzard of
questions Wednesday about a patient's challenge to a health
maintenance organization that offered financial rewards to doctors
as an incentive to hold down costs.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing arguments for an hour on issues that could affect
more than 160 million Americans in employer-sponsored health plans,
the court appeared skeptical about letting patients sue HMOs in
federal court for offering such bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Ginzkey, the lawyer for the patient, Cynthia Herdrich,
said, ``I am not asking this court to outlaw financial
incentives,'' the payments doctors receive for holding down costs.
Rather, Ginzkey said, the court should prohibit HMOs from offering
financial incentives that have ``an undue influence'' on a doctor's
decisions and can hurt the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   The questions raised by most of the justices echoed a broader
political debate over what role the government should play in
regulating health plans. The justices asked, for example, whether
Congress, which has encouraged the development of HMOs since 1973,
intended to limit the techniques used to control costs.
</P>
<P>
   Through her husband's employer, Herdrich received health
coverage from the Carle Care HMO, a doctor-owned health plan in
Illinois. In 1992 she suffered abdominal pain, sought treatment
from Lori Pegram, a doctor at the HMO, who scheduled her for an
ultrasound procedure eight days later at a distant hospital
affiliated with the HMO. While Herdrich was waiting for the test,
her appendix ruptured and she developed a life-threatening
infection.
</P>
<P>
   She filed a medical malpractice suit in Illinois state court and
won damages of $35,000. She came to the Supreme Court seeking
permission to challenge her health plan in a federal suit that
attacked the financial incentives given to doctors to control
costs. She contends that the HMO violated its legal duty to act
solely in the interest of workers and their dependents
participating in an employer-sponsored health plan.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments in the case, Pegram vs. Herdrich, No. 98-1949,
came as Congress is considering legislation that would set new
standards for managed care and make it easier for patients to sue
HMOs. President Clinton strongly supports such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawyers across the country have filed at least 16
class-action suits accusing HMOs of skimping on care and misleading
patients by failing to disclose the techniques they use to control
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The task facing the Supreme Court is not to design a national
health policy, but to decide whether federal law, as it stands now,
opens the federal courts to Herdrich and patients like her. The
issue before the Supreme Court is whether Herdrich, having won a
jury verdict in state court, may pursue her claim that the HMO
violated its duty to her under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In the Supreme Court on Wednesday, Herdrich's lawyer, Ginzkey,
had an answer to every question asked of him. But he sometimes
seemed to lose his way in the legal swamp surrounding the statute
at the heart of the case, the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, known as ERISA.
</P>
<P>
   The law, prompted by abuses in the operation of pension plans,
also defines the obligations of the people who run
employer-sponsored health plans. Under the law, such trustees must
act ``solely in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries'' of a health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Ginzkey said Herdrich's HMO was riddled with conflicts of
interest. The same doctors own the health plan, treat patients,
decide whether to pay claims and are eligible to receive bonuses as
a result of cost savings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a standard plain vanilla HMO,'' Ginzkey said.
</P>
<P>
   Herdrich and her lawyer contend that the HMO and its doctors had
``a fiduciary duty'' to her under federal law. But, several
justices asked, do the managers of an employee benefits plan also
have a legal duty to conserve its assets for the benefit of all the
people who get coverage through the same group?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, ``what's in the
best interest of a particular plaintiff could be against the
interest of a class of beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said that ``other
beneficiaries are going to suffer'' if the health plan decides
every issue in favor of the person filing claims.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked Ginzkey, ``Why should the
courts get involved in this messy business'' of deciding whether
some financial incentives go too far?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the courts get into this slippery slope problem?''
she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ginzkey conceded that some financial incentives to doctors were
acceptable, but he said they should not be allowed if they had ``an
undue influence'' on a doctor's decisions and adversely affected
patient care. Rehnquist called this standard ``extremely vague.''
</P>
<P>
   A decision in the case is expected by early summer.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, a leading advocate for patients' rights, said:
``Even if Herdrich loses, the patients' rights movement may win.
The Supreme Court may not be willing to expand the scope of federal
law, but may allow patients to pursue remedies in state court,
where they have recently had more success in recovering damages for
their injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Court is the advocacy director at the Foundation for Taxpayer
and Consumer Rights, in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, at the suggestion of the Nixon administration, Congress
passed legislation to foster the development of HMOs. Justice
Stephen G. Breyer said Wednesday that he found it ``hard to
believe'' that Congress ``wanted to gut its own HMO legislation''
when it passed ERISA in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical HMO, Ginzkey said, there is a managed-care company
owned by stockholders, doctors treat patients and employees of the
company decide whether to pay claims. But in Herdrich's case, he
said, ``all three groups are one.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, Ginzkey argued, ``you have to have somebody
making claims decisions who isn't receiving money to deny the
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice David H. Souter said that in any HMO, the health
plan and its employees had a strong financial interest to hold down
health costs. ``Unless they do so,'' he said, ``the HMO will go out
of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter G. Phillips, a lawyer for the Carle Clinic HMO, said that
if its financial incentives violated ERISA, ``then all managed care
does so as well,'' because most health plans use financial rewards
and penalties to promote cost-conscious behavior by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips acknowledged that ``an error in judgment'' had occurred
in Herdrich's case. But he said she had ``a perfectly valid
remedy'' under state law, filing a malpractice suit. And he said
there was no evidence that Congress intended to expand the right to
sue under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department opposed Herdrich's effort to pursue her
case in federal court. The HMO provides medical services to an
ERISA plan, but is not itself subject to the ``standards of
fiduciary duty'' set by federal law, so the HMOs compensation
scheme does not violate those standards, it said.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The jurors in the trial of four police officers
accused of murdering Amadou Diallo began deliberating Wednesday
after the judge instructed them for nearly four hours on the legal
reasons that could justify the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Joseph C. Teresi of state Supreme Court described six
times and at length to the jurors three legal reasons they could
use to acquit the officers. The shooting could be justified, he
said, if the officers believed they were being attacked, if they
believed that a robbery was being committed or if they were making
an arrest for a felony.
</P>
<P>
   The jury adjourned about 8:30 p.m. after deliberating about six
hours. The justice released them after they sent out a note saying
they were tired. They are being sequestered at an undisclosed
location.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions to the jury were the subject of lengthy
negotiations between the officers' lawyers, prosecutors and Teresi
last week. The prosecutors strongly objected to the inclusion of
two of the legal reasons that would justify the shooting, arguing
that there was no evidence that Diallo was involved in a robbery or
a felony, but they were overruled by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors, four of them black and eight white, have been
hearing evidence in the racially charged case for nearly three
weeks. The officers, all white, fired 41 shots at Diallo, an
unarmed black man who was standing in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building a year ago. They are charged with second-degree
murder, second-degree manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide
and reckless endangerment. Their minimum penalties, if they are
convicted, range from probation to imprisonment for 15 years to
life.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial was winding down, lawyers for both sides
recommended to Teresi that he allow the jury to consider the lesser
charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. In
giving his instructions Wednesday, the justice told the jurors to
first consider the most serious charges, murder.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi began the morning by dismissing one juror, a young white
woman, for talking about the case to friends, one of whom contacted
the justice. The first alternate, a young white man who had
described himself as an activist for gay and lesbian rights, took
her place. In all, there are now seven white men, one white woman
and four black women on the jury. During jury selection three weeks
ago, the defense lawyers had tried to remove three of the four
black women from the jury, but Teresi denied the requests.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours after they began deliberating, the jurors asked
that parts of the testimony of two of the officers, Sean Carroll
and Edward McMellon, be read back to them. They wanted to hear the
officers' accounts of what happened from the time they stepped out
of their car on the night of the shooting until they left the scene
a few minutes after the shooting ended.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also asked for a rereading of the testimony of Schrrie
Elliott, a defense witness who said she was an eyewitness to the
shooting, but who made contradictory statements on several crucial
points. She was the only witness, other than the officers
themselves, who testified that one of the officers shouted ``Gun!''
just before the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the jury asked the justice to clarify the meaning
of murder with depraved indifference and of intentional murder.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the officers thought Diallo had a gun is a critical
element in their claim that the shooting was justified. All four
officers said they believed that Diallo had pulled a gun from his
pocket. It turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, members of the New York Police Department's Street
Crime Unit, were riding in an unmarked car the night of the
shooting when Carroll noticed Diallo on the steps of his apartment
building on Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview section and decided to
stop and question him. Carroll said he believed Diallo was acting
suspiciously, sticking his head out to peer up and down the street,
then retreating toward the building's vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, the officers said, ran inside the building and began
digging in his pocket, then turned toward them with what they
believed was a gun. They began firing, and hit Diallo 19 times.
Carroll and McMellon each fired 16 shots, emptying their
semiautomatic pistols. Officer Kenneth Boss fired five shots and
Officer Richard Murphy fired four.
</P>
<P>
   There are three ways the jurors could find the officers' actions
justified, according to Teresi's instructions. One is under a state
law that permits the use of deadly physical force if a person has a
reasonable belief that deadly force is about to be used against him
or another person.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision of that law says that a person can use deadly
physical force to defend against a robbery or an attempted robbery.
Officer Carroll testified that he suspected that Diallo might be a
lookout for a robber pushing his way into an apartment. Although
Carroll said he did not convey that suspicion to the other
officers, Teresi said that that theory of justification could be
applied to all four defendants.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had objected strongly to the application of that
section of the law, noting that there was no evidence Diallo was a
robber. Out of the jury's hearing, lawyers for two of the officers
also complained about the instruction on robbery, saying their
clients never testified that they believed a robbery was in
progress. Outside court, they said they feared the instruction
might confuse the jury.
</P>
<P>
   The third possible justification applies only to police
officers. They are entitled to use deadly physical force while
making an arrest for a felony, Teresi told the jurors. In this
case, it could have been an arrest for robbery or criminal
possession of a weapon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors had objected to that instruction, saying that
there was no evidence that Diallo was committing a felony or that
the officers were trying to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been leading demonstrations
against the police officers, said outside the courthouse, ``I think
that it is extremely interesting that we are hearing a charge based
on self-defense of a robbery that never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Teresi also told the jurors Wednesday that under New York law,
police officers have wide latitude to question people on the street
and, if necessary, frisk them.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in the courtroom was tense, with the officers,
their families and the Diallo family showing equally somber
expressions. Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx district attorney, came
to the courthouse for the first time Wednesday, and said he planned
to stay until there was a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was moved to Albany from the Bronx after the defense
lawyers argued that they could not get a fair trial in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   As the jury began deliberating, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said during a news conference in Manhattan that he did not
expect any violence if the officers were acquitted, but he added
that the Police Department was making ``appropriate preparations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the verdict is going to be,'' Giuliani said.
``I don't know any better than anyone else. But people do not have
a right to act unlawfully. I don't think people will. I think
people in New York are lawful, decent, civilized people. I think we
want to show the entire city and the rest of the country that we're
that way.''

EDITORIAL: THE REPUBLICAN IDENTITY WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Understandable jubilation _ and abundant positive thinking _ led
Sen. John McCain to proclaim the emergence of a ``McCain majority''
after his victories Tuesday. The odds against McCain's insurgency
campaign remain formidable. As Gov. George W. Bush never tires of
saying, the Arizona senator failed to attract the support of most
Republican primary voters in Michigan and may have trouble doing so
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the exit polls and comments from voters also suggest that
McCain has spawned a genuinely new phenomenon that could defy the
logic of the professionals and keep right on building. Bush has to
figure out how to overcome it or risk being washed away.
</P>
<P>
   Several bits of evidence suggest that McCain's success is of a
different order than anything seen in many years. His presence on
the ballot is driving voter turnout, starting in New Hampshire and
sweeping through South Carolina and Michigan, where twice the
normal number of voters went to the polls. He pulls big crowds that
clearly adore him. Their excitement undercuts the conventional
wisdom about citizen apathy, as does the explosion of Internet
fund-raising that has brought him $3 million in the space of a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Republican leaders are assuring each other that
McCain's appeal is personal rather than based on issues like
campaign finance reform and using the budget surplus to save Social
Security and Medicare. The more likely case is that McCain's
popularity among Republicans, independents and Democrats is
intertwined with his challenge to the leadership of his party on
these issues. Were he to run as a war hero and servant of the
status quo, he probably would not seem so attractive to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Whether McCain can keep the excitement going is unknowable. But
it is important to remember that when Bush was riding high in the
polls last year, he, too, was operating on a reputation as a
Washington outsider, a man of integrity and someone with a moderate
record who had reached outside his party's base and won in Texas.
The governor's credentials on inclusiveness worked in his favor
among the very party faithful who the professionals say fear McCain
now. That gives the senator an opportunity to woo these same
centrist Republicans whom Bush once counted on. If he does this, he
could keep racking up primary victories in the busier rounds to
come.
</P>
<P>
   But the terrain gets tougher. Half of the March 7 and March 14
primaries allow only Republicans to cast votes that count in the
delegate tallies. As the two men battle over card-carrying
Republicans, California becomes increasingly important. McCain
signaled his understanding of the Golden State's importance by
linking the words Reagan, Republican and reformer in speech after
speech. Although former President and Mrs. Reagan issued a
statement saying they would not take sides, McCain will try to
figure out a way to invoke his longtime friendship with the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans have made a mistake in recent years in thinking
that Reagan's popularity within the GOP could be duplicated by
anyone with the loyalty of the Christian right, and Bush might be
making the same error. Reagan's appeal went far beyond these
extremely conservative legions. In fact, his presidency did little
to advance many of their issues, including opposition to abortion.
Bush's embracing of the right-wing agenda and his condemnation of
McCain's ability to win votes outside his party have carried the
Texan away from his original message for fellow Republicans.
Indeed, his visit to Bob Jones University has become a symbol that
could hurt him in California, New York and other more progressive
GOP venues.
</P>
<P>
   After New Hampshire, the governor complained that his opponents
had ``defined'' him and he would not let it happen again. But now
he is losing the definition contest all by himself. If he cannot
reverse that problem, the McCain ``phenomenon'' could spread and
engulf him in the weeks ahead. &QL;

   BRADLEY (Seattle) _ Hoping for a symbolic victory in Washington,

   PARIS _ Fears that the United States, Britain and other
English-speaking countries are using a Cold War eavesdropping
network to gain a commercial edge roused passions across Europe
Wednesday, even after the notion had been flatly denied in
Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
   The subject kept the European Parliament in Brussels entranced
for hours and drew banner headlines across the Continent. One
political cartoon showed Britain in bed with the United States,
despite Britain's membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The hubbub grew from a report prepared for the European
Parliament that found that communications intercepted by a network
called Echelon had twice helped U.S. companies gain an advantage
over Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of the latest allegations, suggestions of
commercial spying have surfaced regularly in recent years. They
have infuriated many Europeans who seem to have little trouble
believing that military espionage systems developed during the Cold
War would now be used to help businesses in English-speaking
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Echelon is a network of surveillance stations stitched together
in the 1970s by the U.S. National Security Agency, with Australia,
Britain Canada and New Zealand, to intercept select satellite
communications, according to recently declassified information in
Washington. But both Washington and Downing Street quickly rejected
the idea that they might be using any secret information to bolster
their own economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No is the short answer,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair of England
said in London. ``These things are governed by extremely strict
rules, and those rules will always be applied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. intelligence agencies are not tasked to engage in
industrial espionage or obtain trade secrets for the benefit of any
U.S. company or companies,'' said the State Department spokesman,
James Rubin, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we cannot comment on the substance of the report, we
can say that the NSA is not authorized to provide intelligence
information to private firms,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The denials did little to quell European fury, especially in
France. French Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou said that French
companies were being encouraged to encrypt sensitive information to
avoid detection by U.S. espionage operations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She said Echelon had been set up as a military system dating
originally to 1948 to eavesdrop on the Soviet Union and its allies
during the Cold War but had since been converted to be used ``for
economic espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it appears the network has been diverted to the purposes
of economic espionage and for keeping a watch on competitors,''
Guigou said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The flare-up was prompted by the publication of a report
commissioned by the European Parliament 18 months ago, after
initial allegations of commercial espionage. The 18-page report,
which was written by a free-lance journalist, Duncan Campbell, and
based in large part on newspaper accounts, claimed that Echelon had
been used by the United States to gain the advantage in a least two
deals involving major European companies.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell described Echelon as a vast, coordinated system that
includes a system of satellites and at least 10 listening posts
worldwide that can intercept telephone calls, e-mails and faxes.
</P>
<P>
   The report drew skepticism from conservative members of
parliament, some of whom said the document had failed to provide
sufficient proof.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``well-informed'' press reports from 1995, Duncan claimed
that information learned through Echelon had been given to Boeing
Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. when they were trying to win a $6
billion contract from Saudi Arabia. His report said that the spy
network intercepted calls between the European consortium Airbus
and the Saudi airline and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also charged that spy information had helped U.S.
Raytheon Corp. win a bid for a $1.3 billion surveillance system for
the Amazon forest against Thomson-CSF, a French company.
</P>
<P>
   But few details were offered about how the information was of
any use to the U.S. firms. Each example was described only in a
short paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's executive commission has refused demands to
crack down on industrial espionage of the type described Wednesday,
saying that charges have not been proven.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's only a rumor and I don't deal in rumors,'' the
commissioner responsible for the European Union's single market,
Frits Bolkestein, said at at parliamentary hearing on data
protection earlier this week, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Echelon, which is run jointly with the NSA's
counterparts in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, has
also been widely criticized in the United States as an excessive
intrusion into the private communications of Americans and their
allies. Some say the system developed by the National Security
Agency emerged from the Cold War as a kind of Big Brother without a
cause.
</P>
<P>
   R. James Woolsey Jr., who headed the CIA from 1993 to 1995, said
in Washington that ``basically the United States does not conduct
industrial espionage.'' But he said the government might look into
some economic areas, like questions of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You collect intelligence on bribery by some of our friends
abroad ... and then you tell the U.S. government so they can try to
get the other government not to award the contract,'' Woolsey said
Wednesday at the Council on Foreign Relations.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't go to the American corporation and say `Hey,
you're about to lose.'''

SPITZER URGES FURTHER LIMITS ON ADS FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer called
Wednesday for legislation to bar all tobacco companies, not just
the industry giants, from advertising or marketing their cigarettes
in places likely to be seen by children.
</P>
<P>
   Although the nation's largest tobacco companies _ Philip Morris,
Brown &AMP; Williamson, Lorillard Tobacco and R.J. Reynolds _ agreed to
restrict their advertising as part of a 1998 settlement with 46
states including New York, those restrictions do not apply to
smaller tobacco companies that were not part of the settlement,
Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ensure that any and all tobacco companies _ in
business today, or in the future _ will not be able to target
children,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes at a time when there is growing concern
nationwide over cigarette smoking among teen-agers. In New York
alone, about 87,000 people under 18 begin smoking every year,
according to statistics provided by Spitzer's office.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer is lobbying for a host of restrictions to bar tobacco
companies from advertising at sporting and cultural events,
sponsoring youth teams and putting up billboards, among other
things. The fines would range from $100 to as much as $10,000 for
repeated violations.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said
Pataki would support legislation to limit tobacco advertising but
declined to comment specifically on Spitzer's proposals. Several
lawmakers and their aides expressed cautious support.
</P>
<P>
   But several advocacy groups were quick to praise Spitzer for
calling attention to a loophole in the tobacco settlement. ``We
don't want nonparticipating tobacco companies to be the kids'
tobacco companies,'' said Blair Horner, legislative director of the
New York Public Interest Research Group. ``We want this option to
be snuffed out.''

SAMUELSON RETAINS OLYMPIC DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The real intrigue about Saturday's Olympic marathon trials for
women is whether the 1984 gold medalist, Joan Benoit Samuelson, can
make a serious run at qualifying for the 2000 Summer Games in
Sydney, Australia, by which time she will be 43 years old. To
qualify, Samuelson must win the trials or run under 2 hours 33
minutes, the Olympic qualifying standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put that kind of pressure on myself,'' she
said Wednesday in a teleconference call. She added that she was
competing in the trials in Columbia, S.C., because it was a new
century, she was over 40, and her two children were now old enough
to appreciate the process of trying to qualify for an Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   She also wants to improve her time from the 1996 trials, when
she finished 13th in 2:36:54.
</P>
<P>
   One of her main concerns is the temperature, which is expected
to be near 70 degrees, about 15 degrees hotter than the optimum
marathon temperature, and 50 degrees to 70 degrees warmer than her
recent training runs in Freeport, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to concern me, being that my weekend runs were
done in subzero temperatures,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She only decided to run in late November, she said, after
encouragement from a training partner. Since then, she has been
putting in training weeks of 80 to 90 miles, all of it outdoors,
except for a few indoor speed workouts. ``I have a treadmill,''
Samuelson said. ``It's all ready to go, but I've avoided it like
the plague.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 12-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son, Samuelson
said her priorities had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more to life than running,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her running magazines remain in the wrapper, and last
weekend, she went alpine and cross-country skiing on a family trip
to Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine, not the usual method of training
for a marathon. She does not recover as quickly from workouts as
she once did, she said. Still, she rated her training as an 8 on a
scale of 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's going to run really well,'' said Libbie Hickman,
the top qualifier. ``I wouldn't put anything past her. She knows
the distance, she cares about running a good race. I wouldn't count
her out.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson's American record of 2:21:21 stands more than 14 years
after it was set at the 1985 Chicago Marathon. Why hasn't there
been another Joan Samuelson, she was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passion for the sport, first of all,'' she said. ``Second,
scholarships were just being introduced at the time I was exiting
the collegiate ranks. I think there is a lot of pressure in college
to compete hard for four years. When athletes leave the collegiate
system, they're injured beyond repair or totally burned out.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: DISARMAMENT DEADLOCK IN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 24:
</P>
<P>
   The peace that has prevailed in Northern Ireland for the past
two and a half years will not be truly secure until the Irish
Republican Army and Protestant paramilitary forces give up their
weapons. But bitter differences over disarmament, which may take
months to resolve, should not be allowed to upend the rest of the
carefully constructed peace effort. Regrettably, through a series
of miscalculations by all sides in recent weeks, that is just what
has happened.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse over disarmament has already led to the suspension
of the power-sharing government and threatens to undermine other
gains as well. Before the Good Friday understandings unravel any
further, Northern Ireland's political leaders, the British and
Irish governments and independent monitors of the agreement like
Gen. John de Chastelain need to step in with imaginative new
proposals to rescue the original vision of peace.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest responsibility lies with the IRA, whose refusal to
make any meaningful move on disarmament until recently is the most
important factor in the crisis. Sinn Fein, the organization's
political wing, must press the IRA to resubmit the disarmament
proposal it briefly offered earlier this month. That still-secret
offer apparently accepted the necessity for disarmament and
discussed a ``context'' for carrying it out. De Chastelain, who
heads the independent monitoring panel on disarmament, called it
``valuable progress'' offering ``the real prospect of agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The de Chastelain panel, which all sides recognize as
independent, is the best judge of further disarmament progress.
London, Dublin and the various Northern Irish parties only
complicate matters by trying to manage disarmament questions that
are better left to the judgment of de Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
   Three related steps need to be taken in the coming days. The IRA
should commit itself to resubmitting its disarmament plan in
coordination with the restoration of local rule in Northern
Ireland. Ulster's leading Protestant politician, David Trimble,
should withdraw his threat to resign his party leadership over the
disarmament issue. Based on these moves, Britain can then revive
the power-sharing government institutions in Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's threats and deadlines have proven counterproductive.
His early Febrary deadline for disarmament to begin, a date that
appears nowhere in the Good Friday agreement, set off the latest
crisis, and his resignation threat triggered Britain's decision to
suspend local governance.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's tactics have helped him consolidate his party
leadership, but the larger cost has been high. He should recognize
that threats undermine the process of reconciliation and
confidence-building on which further progress in Northern Ireland
depends.
</P>
<P>
   These steps will require political courage all around. But the
people of Northern Ireland, who have suffered through 30 years of
violent conflict and have now invested their hopes in the Good
Friday peace formula, deserve no less. &QL;

STADIUM TAX PLAN WOULD HIT COUNTY ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A statewide bed tax envisioned to help pay for a new Valley
football stadium will be scaled back in an effort that proponents
hope will make it more palatable to lawmakers and winnable at the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed revision, a 1 percent hotel bed tax would be
enacted only in Maricopa County, scrapping an additional
half-percent tax that had been suggested for the rest of Arizona.
The revision will cut about $200 million from the revenue raised
for the stadium by bed taxes over the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The bed tax is one of several public revenue sources proposed by
Gov. Jane Hull's stadium task force to help pay for a $329 million
football stadium to house the Arizona Cardinals and the Fiesta
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals and the NFL would kick in $75 million. Some of the
money raised by the plan would fund state tourism programs and new
facilities for Cactus League spring training.
</P>
<P>
   The retooling comes as proponents try to finesse through the
Legislature a bill that many lawmakers consider political poison. A
publicly funded stadium proposal was rejected by East Valley voters
last year, and there was a backlash against public funding of Bank
One Ballpark when the county approved it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the preliminary discussions with legislative leaders, it
is likely that the public would vote on authorizing any (new)
stadium plan,'' said Peter Hayes, a spokesman for Hull's task
force.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents also want the geographic area of the vote to
correspond with the area to which the tax would apply.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the statewide bed tax in the plan would, therefore,
require a statewide vote, something proponents hope to avoid
because citizens outside Maricopa County are less likely to support
it.
</P>
<P>
   In dropping the statewide component, however, architects of the
plan have had to retool how the money will be used. The largest
chunk of money still will go to retire stadium construction bonds,
but a sizeable share raised over the next three decades that was to
have been used for statewide tourism promotion now will be targeted
in the Valley, where the tax applies.
</P>
<P>
   Hull aide Ted Ferris said ``there would still be a significant
amount of tourism promotion that benefits the rest of the state''
in the new scheme.
</P>
<P>
   By dropping the statewide bed tax, proponents also expect more
lawmakers from outside Maricopa County to support the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the out-county legislators, they felt their
constituents . . . didn't want to pay for it,'' said Debbie
Sweeney, executive director of the Valley Hotel and Resort
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new plan will reduce slightly the amount of money
available for tourism promotion, Sweeney said the hospitality
industry tentatively supports it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the plan is lingering in legislative limbo as proponents
shop for a legislative sponsor to get the measure rolling. Ferris
said the bed-tax component could change again _ to a special
district or municipal tax within Maricopa County _ if needed to
build legislative support. &QL;

ADVERTISING: BEST WESTERN BEEFS UP TV SPENDING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a record TV budget, Best Western International has created
an ad campaign that it hopes will raise the profile of its brand as
it battles higher-spending competitors in the lodging business.
</P>
<P>
   A nonprofit membership association that provides marketing,
purchasing, training and other services to 4,200 independently
owned and operated hotels in 84 countries, Best Western in recent
years has been outspent on TV advertising by other midmarket hotel
companies like Bass Inc.'s Holiday Inn and New World Hotel's
Ramada.
</P>
<P>
   According to Competitive Media Reporting, from January through
October 1999, Best Western spent $4.4 million on TV advertising,
Holiday Inn spent $19 million and Ramada spent $7.5 million. In
1998, Holiday Inn's TV budget of $13.3 million was almost double
that of Best Western.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Evans, who joined Best Western as president and chief
executive in late 1998 after holding senior management posts at
Promus and Hyatt, revamped the advertising strategy, winning
approval in October from Best Western's board to more than triple
the group's 1999 TV expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a TV campaign that will run an estimated $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investment before was not enough to break through, we
needed to make an investment in the brand,'' Evans said. ``And in
the year 2000 _ an election year, an Olympics year, a dot-com year,
a year when we estimate our primary competitors will invest over
$200 million in all media _ if we stayed where we were, we would
have been invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans instructed Best Western's agency, BBDO West, part of BBDO
Worldwide, a unit of the Omnicom Group, to research Best Western's
image among consumers and develop a new campaign, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Wielgus, Best Western's vice president for worldwide
marketing and sales, said the research showed that ``people were
most impressed, yet a little surprised, to learn that Best Western
is the world's largest lodging chain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was to take this information,'' he added, ``and
develop a campaign that effectively lets the public know there are
a variety of reasons people travel, and there is a Best Western
nearby.''
</P>
<P>
   The new commercials replace BBDO's previous Best Western TV
spots, which featured two bellhops in humorous situations. The new
spots are intended to illustrate the reasons people travel.
</P>
<P>
   In one, a swimsuit-clad woman in her 60s jumps off a spectacular
waterfall in Maui, because, the ad says, ``you always promised
yourself you would.''
</P>
<P>
   In another, two men, one of them blind, walk up to the rim of
the Grand Canyon; when his sighted friend starts to speak, the
blind man hushes him so he can listen to the wind, because, as the
ad says, ``everyone should experience it once.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third, a senior executive asks a staff member to go to
Tulsa, Okla., on business the next day; the trip is passed from
employee to employee until it is dumped on an obviously junior
executive, because, as the ad says, ``someone's got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   All spots carry the tag line, ``For every reason to travel,
there's a Best Western to stay in,'' plus the specific number of
Best Western hotels in the featured destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the reasons people travel, one thing remains the
same: there is an emotional connection people have to the
experience,'' said Ken Mandelbaum, BBDO West's chief creative
officer. ``This campaign attempts to capture these emotional
experiences, and lets the simple statement, `The world's largest
hotel chain,' answer all their lodging needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots appear through early May on prime-time sitcoms, dramas
and news magazines, plus early morning, late night and sports
programs like ``The Tonight Show'' and ``SportsCenter.'' They are
aimed at both business and leisure travelers aged 25 to 54.
</P>
<P>
   Similar print ads, budgeted at another $5 million, will appear
in travel trade magazines and other specialized publications.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel industry observers gave Best Western's new strategy mixed
reviews. Bjorn Hanson, who follows hotels for
PricewaterhouseCoopers, said Best Western ``does have a different
story than any other brand, in terms of size and of diversity in
price and style, which is not an easy message to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe,'' he said, ``it's a clever campaign to communicate
that they can appeal to almost every traveler's needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Peter Yesawich, president and chief executive of
Yesawich Pepperdine &AMP; Brown, a marketing services firm in Orlando,
Fla., said, ``The strategy to communicate the size and diversity of
Best Western's portfolio is a good idea.'' He added, ``Whether or
not the creative executions deliver against the strategy may be
another question.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ader, a senior managing director of Bear, Stearns, was the
most critical, suggesting that ``it's not clear if any new
marketing campaign can change the public's perception of a brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ader added that Best Western ``has an uphill battle, because the
consistency of its product is varied. The public's perception is
disconnected from the image they're trying to portray. It's more
about fixing the product, not spending money on advertising.''

   After more than two years of negotiations, the United States and
the European Union said Wednesday that they had reached tentative
agreement on privacy laws governing the gathering of personal data
about European consumers by American companies.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides characterized the agreement as a breakthrough,
key details, including how it would apply in practice, remained
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans are protected from the commercial gathering and
selling of personal data without their informed consent while in
the United States, business is allowed to police itself.
</P>
<P>
   David Aaron, undersecretary of commerce for international trade,
said the Europeans had agreed in principle to accept the American
model. But the few details disclosed Wednesday suggested that in
fact, American companies would be leaning closer to the European
model since they would need consumer consent to transfer personal
data to the United States and would be required to post notice of
how the data would be used.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that violated their stated practices would be subject
to prosecution by the Federal Trade Commission and the states, and
would be publicly sanctioned.

BUSH VISITS A DIVERSE CHURCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles International Church, which Gov. George W. Bush
visited Wednesday, is an inner-city megachurch whose Pentecostal
worship style has attracted a diverse membership. It was founded in
1994 by a father-son team of pastors from Arizona, Tommy and
Matthew Barnett, and has grown to include about 2,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   They support an array of more than 200 social service programs,
known as the Dream Center, aimed at the low-income Echo Park
neighborhood where the church is based, including a food program, a
school, drug rehabilitation and medical services.
</P>
<P>
   The polyglot church holds separate services in Russian, Spanish,
Tagalog, Samoan and other languages. On Friday nights, it offers a
``Messianic Jewish Service,'' which church publicity says
``demonstrates the richness of Jewish custom and tradition combined
with the Truth of Jesus Christ,'' adding, ``The Torah is read and
Christ is preached.'' Messianic Judaism has been denounced by most
mainline Jewish groups.
</P>
<P>
   Sheilah Griggs, spokeswoman for the church, said the church did
not invite the candidate to visit. Instead, ``George W. Bush heard
about us through contacts. He called us and asked if he could
come.''

 &HT;    Ohio's elections chief endorses Bush
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, a
Republican, endorsed Texas Gov. George Bush on Wednesday, saying
the presidential primaries have shown Bush is winning the heart of
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell had been national campaign co-chairman for publisher
Steve Forbes, who withdrew from the race. Nearly every major
Republican office holder in Ohio has endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) is one of only four Republican
senators to back Arizona Sen. John McCain. DeWine also is a
national co-chairman of the McCain campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In Dayton on Wednesday, Blackwell said he is supporting Bush
because the Texas governor has a stronger domestic agenda than
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain scored a victory in Michigan on Tuesday _ running strong
among Democrats and independents who voted in the open Republican
primary. But Republican voters overwhelmingly supported Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Republican president must have the respect in the heart and
soul of his party,'' Blackwell said.
</P>
<P>
   He said McCain's approach to getting support from others,
without shoring up his own party's support, is similar to the
formula Jimmy Carter used to win the 1976 election, a tact
ultimately hindered his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Bush's) position of having a solid Republican base,
and reaching out to like-minded independents and Democrats, is the
way to go,'' Blackwell said.

NETS CAN'T STOP MOURNING, OR BEAT THE HEAT

<P>
   MIAMI _ Too much Alonzo Mourning Wednesday night prevented the
New Jersey Nets from winning their third straight game this season
from the Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning, the Heat's All-Star center, scored 43 points, 29 more
than any other Miami player, as the Heat held off the Nets, 99-85,
at the American Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning, who hit his first 13 shots, also had 16 rebounds in 33
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets had beaten Miami by one point and by seven points in
their only two meetings his season. But Wednesday night's loss,
which dropped them to 21-33 for the season, was their 21st on the
road in 26 games.
</P>
<P>
   Miami scored the game's final seven points to finish off the
victory. And fittingly, Mourning's 3-point play wrapped up the
scoring. Clarence Weatherspoon, with 14 points, was the only other
Heat in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles led the Nets with 24 points and Stephon Marbury
had 21. Keith Van Horn had 16 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors at least started fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets used 11 points from Kittles and nine from Van Horn to
forge a two-point lead after the first quarter, even though they
could not find a solution for Mourning and were outrebounded, 14-5.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning mustered 17 points on 5-of-5 field goal shooting and
seven free throws. And never mind that he was wearing tape instead
of a mask over the nose he broke Monday night against the Detroit
Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Scott Burrell hit him on the nose once, but Mourning
otherwise had his way. The Nets started Jim McIlvaine against him,
but he sustained two fouls in the first minute of play and yielded
to Evan Eschmeyer, who didn't do much better.
</P>
<P>
   Eschmeyer was whistled for three fouls in four minutes and also
departed. A frustrated coach Don Casey of the Nets even drew a
technical in complaining about the third foul. That left Jamie
Feick, who somehow played the quarter's final seven minutes without
committing a foul.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets overcame Mourning early with 11-of-22 field goal
shooting, led by Kittles and Van Horn, who each sank 4 of 6 shots.
Kittles made his team's last two baskets of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat began to assert itself in the second quarter, though,
and carried a 59-51 lead into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nets on top, 33-31, after Van Horn's pair of free
throws, the Heat went on a nine-point run. Stephon Marbury ended
that streak with a jumper, but then Heat backup shooting guard
Voshon Lenard buried a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the teams virtually traded baskets until halftime.
Van Horn provided a highlight when he drove hard from the left
baseline and made a flying, right-handed dunk a la Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   That stopped a seven-point run and the Nets, down 13 at one
point, eventually drew within eight on Marbury's two free throws
with 26.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing, however, was that Mourning continued to score freely
(seven points) in the second quarter and Miami extended its rebound
edge with 13-10 work.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the Nets were unable to mount much of a
comeback and Mourning continued to frolic. He peppered the Nets'
interior and Miami pulled out to a 14-point lead entering the final
period.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Gill followed a missed shot with a dunk and made a nifty
drive during the quarter, but it took a 3-point shot by Kittles
with 1:05 left to draw the Nets within 10 and spark some excitement
on their bench.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't last. Miami scored the final four points, on two dunks
by Clarence Weatherspoon. The last one added an accent to Miami's
edge. Anthony Carter, on a fast break, threw a high pass that
Weatherspoon timed perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes. Mourning scored another 14 points in the quarter.

CHINESE IMMIGRANTS LOSE SAVINGS AND HOPES IN CITIZENSHIP SWINDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a familiar swindle, but it worked, as it often
does, like a charm: A fly-by-night operation promises to smooth the
way to citizenship _ for a fee. Then the schemers pull up stakes,
and the once-hopeful immigrant is left poorer and afraid of being
deported.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the victims were Chinese living in Brooklyn and
Manhattan. As many as 1,000 paid up to $750 each to a Brooklyn
company that guaranteed that they would become naturalized U.S.
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no shortage of immigration fraud cases, this
could be one of the biggest. ``In terms of the number of people
affected,'' said Jules Polonetsky, the city's commissioner of
consumer affairs, ``this is the largest case I've heard about.''
The state attorney general's office and the Brooklyn district
attorney are also investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration con game is not new, and it also often depends
on the complicity of the victim, who may be suspicious of the
transaction yet takes the chance to win citizenship or working
papers. There is no evidence that these schemes are more prevalent
in Chinese communities, but, according to immigration experts,
recent arrivals from China feel unusual pressures to seek
citizenship, and so are particularly vulnerable to swindlers who
say they can help them.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred of these immigrants complained in January of
being duped by First U.S. Citizens Service Center, which had
offices in Chinatown in Manhattan and in Sunset Park in Brooklyn
and advertised in newspapers and on radio stations catering to the
Chinese community. Polonetsky said the offices have shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In return for fees of $500 to $750, First U.S. Citizens Service
Center promised the immigrants, most of them elderly, that they
would sail through the naturalization process, according to the
Brooklyn Chinese-American Association, a social service agency that
reported the complaints to the city's Department of Consumer
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants have always been easy prey for the unscrupulous. In
the 19th century, swindlers would descend on newcomers even before
they got off the boat. Partly to cut down on these crimes, the
Castle Garden immigration station was established at the southern
tip of Manhattan in 1855.
</P>
<P>
   As immigration laws tightened, many swindlers, usually of the
same ethnic group as their victims, began exploiting fears of
deportation by offering help in obtaining visas and green cards in
exchange for exorbitant fees.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of all immigrant groups, the Chinese are among the most likely
to seek citizenship, which enables them to bring relatives over and
gives them an extra layer of protection if they wish to visit their
homeland, said Dr. Xiao-huang Yin, a history professor at
Occidental College in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Asian immigrants, the Chinese were not allowed to
become U.S. tates citizens until 1943. For older people, Yin said,
the involvement of Asians in the campaign fund-raising scandals and
the investigation of a Taiwan-born nuclear weapons scientist on
spying charges have evoked fears that the door may close once
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always something there to remind Chinese people that
they may again become targets of anti-immigrant sentiment,'' he
said, ``and that if they do not seize the opportunity to become
citizens, that right might be taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Mark, the program director of the Asian-American Legal
Defense and Education Fund, said many Chinese immigrants,
especially those in the low-paying garment industry, desperately
want to become citizens to qualify for welfare benefits when they
retire.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although immigration fraud cases can be tough to prosecute,
there have been some recent successes. A South African national,
Curtis Van Stuyvesant, who prosecutors say bilked 300 people of
$350,000, is serving a prison sentence of 20 to 61 years after
being convicted by a Manhattan jury in July of grand larceny and
unauthorized practice of law. In another case, William John Newman
of Sunnyside, Queens, pleaded guilty in January to posing as an
immigration lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   And in January, a Jamaican immigrant, Clover Richards, of
Hempstead, was arrested by Nassau County authorities and accused of
taking more than $75,000 to arrange green cards for at least 19
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors who deal with immigration fraud often find
themselves bedeviled because the victims are frequently terrified
of coming forward, the crooks may be hard to track down, documents
are likely to be missing, and it may be impossible to recover the
stolen money. Then, too, some of the victims may have knowingly
violated the law and fear deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mak, the president and chief executive of the Brooklyn
Chinese-American Association, said most of the people who
complained to him about First U.S. Citizens Service Center had not
suspected that anything was improper. The immigrants were referred
to doctors who would certify that they were disabled, enabling them
to avoid interviews with the federal Immigration and Naturalization
Service that would reveal their poor English skills. Under the law,
a candidate for citizenship must demonstrate the ability to read,
write and speak English and a knowledge of the basic history and
form of government of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said the INS did occasionally waive the
tests for people with disabilities and permit some elderly
immigrants who are longtime United States residents to use an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Kam Chai Wu Tse, 57, a garment factory worker, has been in
America for only a decade and does not qualify to be examined in
her own language. But in a recent interview, she said through a
translator that employees of First U.S. Citizens told her that they
were not concerned about her English skills.
</P>
<P>
   Wu Tse said the company sent her to a doctor who examined her
eyes but performed no other tests. Yet in a signed immigration
agency document, a doctor, Dr. Chizheng Zhong, stated that she
suffered from several ailments, including rheumatoid arthritis,
hypertension, hearing and visual impairment and ``forgetfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls for Zhong at the number given on the document
were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Pei Lam Pan, 68, who immigrated from Taisan, China, a decade
ago, can no longer work in a garment factory, she said, because her
back aches and her eyes are weak. But without citizenship, she
cannot qualify for welfare benefits. She and her husband, Zhong Gun
Pan, paid First U.S. Citizens $1,000 in November to help them
become citizens, but they assume that the money is now lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a hard time saving that kind of money,'' Pan said.
</P>
<P>
   Another immigrant, Yong Kum Luo, 68, a retired laborer who used
to perform odd jobs at a factory, said he filed a citizenship
application in 1996. Last year, a friend told him about First U.S.
Citizens, saying, ``If I pay $500, everything is going to be OK''
</P>
<P>
   He is still waiting. ``If I'm not a citizen,'' Luo said
dejectedly, ``I'm nothing.''

EDITORIAL: EXPOSING MEDICAL MISTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Feb. 24: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton moved aggressively on Tuesday to cut down on
medical mistakes at the nation's hospitals. Mirroring the
recommendations made last November by the Institute of Medicine, he
called for mandatory reporting of serious medical errors and for
creating a federal headquarters to oversee patient safety. These
measures require approval by Congress and the states. On his own
authority, Clinton required hospitals that treat Medicare patients
_ meaning most hospitals _ to institute programs to improve patient
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the plan will be embraced by the medical community,
patients and Congress. But organizations representing doctors and
hospitals fear that mandatory public disclosure of errors that
cause death or serious injury will subject doctors and hospitals to
ruinous lawsuits, driving doctors to hide their mistakes. Mandatory
reporting, says Dr. Nancy Dickey, former president of the American
Medical Association, could ``drive underground the very information
you need to improve safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's plan takes due account of these fears. Under his
proposal, reports of serious errors would go to state authorities
and the public, identifying the hospitals where patients were
injured. That would flag the attention of regulators and potential
patients. But the reporting programs, while mandatory, would not
disclose the names of individual physicians or patients. The
proposal would also allow doctors and hospitals to investigate
mistakes without fear that the information would later be used in
lawsuits. Given these safeguards, the administration argues,
hospitals should not be inhibited from rooting out and correcting
problems. New York state has already successfully instituted a
system of mandatory reporting of serious medical errors combined
with confidential status for internal reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would spend about $20 million to create a center on
patient safety to oversee the development of standardized forms for
hospitals to report medical errors. The center would also organize
research on patient safety and distribute information on systems
that best prevent mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's goal is to cut medical mistakes in half over the next
five years. The Institute of Medicine estimates that up to about
100,000 patients die each year in hospitals because of medical
mistakes. Recent studies show that about 3 percent of hospital
patients suffer injuries, about half of which are preventable. The
institute, which is affiliated with the National Academy of
Sciences, called for focusing on faulty systems rather than
careless doctors and physicians. For example, if systems for
administering drugs are designed carefully, errors will be caught
before they harm patients.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of Clinton's proposals is that they no longer
leave hospitals solely responsible for improving patient safety.
That safety will now also be a federal and state responsibility.

STANLEY MATTHEWS, 85, KNIGHT AND SOCCER STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Stanley Matthews, a legendary figure in British soccer who
played professionally until he was 50 years old and was the first
pro soccer player to be knighted, died Feb. 23 at a hospital in
Newcastle-Under-Lyme, England. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned more than three decades, Matthews was
one of soccer's premier players, renowned as the Wizard of Dribble
for his playmaking skills. He was also known as the First Gentleman
of Soccer, having never received a warning from a referee or been
expelled from a game for rough play.
</P>
<P>
   Playing outside right, Matthews was the first Englishman to be
named European Footballer of the Year, achieving the honor twice.
His signature game was the 1953 Football Association Cup final
when, at age 38, he set up the last three goals, enabling Blackpool
to defeat the Bolton Wanderers, 4-3, before a crowd of 100,000 and
Queen Elizabeth II at Wembley Stadium in London. That game,
bringing Blackpool its first title, became known as ``the Matthews
final.''
</P>
<P>
   When he retired in 1965, having played 33 seasons, he had made
some 700 league appearances, for Stoke City and Blackpool, and had
played in more than 50 games for England in international matches.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair paid tribute to Matthews on Wednesday
as a ``model sportsman.'``
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Matthews, the son of a longtime professional
featherweight boxer, Jack Matthews, was born near Stoke-on-Trent
and joined the Stoke City team while a teen-ager. He became a
full-time professional in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews played his last international match in 1957, against
Scotland, and that year was made a Commander of the Order of the
British Empire. He was knighted in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews received a formal send-off at Stoke City's grounds on
April 28, 1965, when he led a team of British stars that faced many
of Europe's great players of the previous decade in a matchup
serving as a tribute to him. He displayed some of his old skills,
but his team lost by 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The thinly built Matthews, 5 feet 9 inches and 157 pounds, was a
superb stylist, known for his extraordinary balance, passing skills
and bursts of speed. He was a master of moving the ball past
opposing players after one his feints had left them sprawled on the
grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of timing,'' he once said. ``You can never plan
your moves before the game.''
</P>
<P>
   During workouts, Matthews concentrated on 20-yard sprints,
explaining how ``when a situation develops, the player who is
quickest off the mark has the best chance of getting the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   His reputation for sportsmanship suffered a mild setback during
a game in the 1950s, when he was playing for Blackpool against the
Wolverhampton Wanderers, who were known for their rough play. One
Wolves player sought to humiliate Matthews by pulling his shirt out
of his pants. After being tugged a few times, Matthews pushed the
player away. The referee saw the push but missed the shirt-pulling
and awarded a free kick to the Wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting the incident, William R. Conklin wrote in The New
York Times how ``in terms of rarity, this penalty against Matthews
could be compared to Sir Winston Churchill's slaking his thirst
with water.''
</P>
<P>
   After a spotless playing career, Matthews ran into trouble with
English soccer authorities in 1968 while managing Port Vale, a
Fourth Division team. Matthews and other club officials were found
to have paid unauthorized signing-on fees to new players and
bonuses to the team for winning matches. Port Vale was expelled
from the English League.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews moved to Malta in 1968, managing a local soccer team,
and later lived in Canada before returning to the Stoke area in the
late 1980s. His wife died last year. There was no report on
immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Matthews' death came before a friendly match between
England and Argentina at Wembley. A moment's silence was observed
and the players wore black armbands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the greatest players the game has even seen,''
said Bobby Robson, a former manager of the English team. ``He ranks
alongside players like Pele, Maradona and Cruyff _ and he was one
of ours.''

OFRA HAZA, 41, ISRAELI SINGER WHO CROSSED CULTURAL BOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Israel)  (js) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ofra Haza, one of Israel's leading pop singers and songwriters,
died Wednesday at a hospital in Tel Aviv, where she was admitted 13
days ago. She was 41.
</P>
<P>
   She suffered massive organ failure, The Associated Press
reported. A hospital staff member, Dr. Zeev Rortenstein, refused to
say why she had been hospitalized or what had caused the organ
failure, the report said. Haza crossed cultural boundaries with her
voice, a tender mezzo-soprano that was equally at home with the
finely turned ornaments of Middle Eastern music and the phrasing of
Western-style pop. She had club hits in Europe, Asia and the United
States, and sang the theme song for the movie ``Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as her audience became an international one, Haza proudly
asserted her background as a Yemenite Jew, performing in
elaborately beaded and brocaded traditional clothing. She sang in
Hebrew, Arabic and English, with a repertory that spanned
traditional songs, pop anthems and dance music.
</P>
<P>
   Haza was born in the poor Hatikva district of Tel Aviv, one of
nine children. Her parents had left Yemen in 1949 to escape
religious persecution. She learned old Yemenite songs from her
parents, while also soaking up Israeli folk songs, the Beatles and
Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, said she represented the
Israeli success story. ``Ofra emerged from the Hatikva slums to
reach the peak of Israeli culture,'' he said. ``She has left a mark
on us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Haza began performing in a local theater company, Hatikva, when
she was 13. As a teen-ager, she entered a national singing contest
and won; she also appeared in television variety shows and in
Israeli movies. She released her first album when she was 18.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in the army, she returned to singing, releasing
pop albums that were best-sellers in Israel; in all, she had 16
gold and platinum albums there. One of her early hits, in 1979, was
``The Tart's Song,'' a defiant assertion of a young woman's
prerogatives. She won the Israeli equivalent of the Grammy Award
for best female singer in 1980, 1981 and 1986, and won second prize
in the 1983 Eurovision Song Contest.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1985 she decided to change direction. She returned to
songs she had learned from her parents, modernizing them for her
album ``50 Gates of Wisdom: Yemenite Songs'' (Shanachie), based on
poetry by a 17th-century rabbi. ``I wanted to do an album to make
my parents happy,'' she said. Dance-music remixes of the songs
``Galbi'' and ``Im Nin'alu'' became international club hits.
</P>
<P>
   The album was a hit in Europe and Asia, and was released in the
United States in 1987. Hip-hop producers discovered it; samples of
her voice showed up in the remix of Eric B. and Rakim's ``Paid in
Full'' and on Marrs' ``Pump Up the Volume.'' On Feb. 3, 1987, she
survived an airplane crash on the Israel-Jordan border, and
afterward celebrated the date as a second birthday.
</P>
<P>
   She toured the United States in 1988 as Sire Records released
her album ``Shaday,'' which sold 1 million copies worldwide. Her
1990 album, ``Desert Wind,'' featured songs in English, and her
1992 album, ``Kirya,'' included a guest appearance from Lou Reed.
``Kirya'' was nominated for a Grammy Award in the World Beat
category.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Haza sang at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony for Yitzhak
Rabin, Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   She married Doron Askhenazi, who survives her, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1990s, Haza performed on recordings by British and
American performers. &QL;

 McCAIN APPEALS FOR INCLUSIVE GOP  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sen. John McCain, riding into Washington on a wave of
national publicity from his big win over Texas Gov. George W. Bush
in Tuesday's Michigan primary, sought to keep the momentum going by
appealing for what he called ``a party of addition and not
division.''
</P>
<P>
   The state appeared to be smiling on McCain on Wednesday. He drew
an overflow crowd of college students in Spokane, Wash., gained a
standing ovation from the Seattle Rotary Club and reveled in the
company of fellow ex-Vietnam POWs and Theodore Roosevelt's
granddaughter on a trip across the water to Bremerton, where
several thousand cheering supporters greeted him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is hoping that his one-primary-at-a-time strategy will
find fertile ground here next Tuesday, in what he described as ``a
reform-oriented, populist state with a strong environmental
consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, who also landed a primary win in his home
state Tuesday, appealed to Republican voters to support a candidacy
that was carried to victory in Michigan and New Hampshire by
crossover independent and Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a proud conservative Republican. I am a Reagan
Republican,'' he told the Seattle Rotary Club. ``Have no doubt
about that. I have to convince and tell our Republican Party
establishment: It's great over here. Come on in. Join us. Join us
in this effort to be an inclusive party. Join us in this effort to
reach out.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain joked about what he called the fear generated in the GOP
establishment by his attacks on pork barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   He extolled former Washington Sen. Dan Evans, who is backing
him, but noted he has had conflicts with Sen. Slade Gorton, a Bush
backer and member of the Senate Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have battled him (Gorton) on pork barreling and
earmarking projects since he entered the Senate,'' McCain said.
``That's why he attacked me on the Senate floor.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with Northwest reporters between campaign stops,
McCain did not conceal his fury at TV attack ads, push polls and
other tactics used by Bush and his supporters to beat him last
Saturday in South Carolina. He singled out the tactics of pro-Bush
TV evangelists of the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bush) proudly displayed his relationship with Jerry
Falwell and Pat Robertson, and all the hate stuff. He's going to
carry that for the rest of the campaign,'' McCain said on a flight
from Spokane to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that the Bush campaign has filled the airwaves in
Virginia and Washington with negative TV spots depicting McCain as
a phony reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to remind him that he is no more a reformer than I
am an astronaut,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, a top McCain adviser, offered to put up $1,000 if
either Bush strategist Karl Rove or former Christian Coalition
director Ralph Reed would take a polygraph test disavowing
involvement with a vitriolic phone message in which Robertson
described McCain as a threat to Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a Bush aide, responded by saying that McCain is a
poor loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain can continue to make excuses for his loss in
South Carolina and continue to pit Americans against each other,''
she said. ``But George W. Bush is going to continue to focus on his
message of compassionate conservatism, which drew thousands of new
voters to the polls in South Carolina and to carry that message to
places like Washington state.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to arrive in Washington on Sunday and has
scheduled election-eve appearances in the state on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also was strongly critical of the Bob Jones University
appearance at which Bush kicked off his South Carolina campaign.
The university bans interracial dating by its students. Its leaders
have described Roman Catholicism as a cult and depicted the pope as
the antiChrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' McCain replied when asked if he would have addressed
the college, ``I would have told them they were cruel idiots. The
ban on interracial dating is offensive to me, as the father of a
girl from Bangladesh. When they describe the pope as the
antiChrist, it is offensive not only to Catholics but to all
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   During an appearance at Gonzaga University, a Catholic
university in Spokane, McCain was asked why he refused to support
removal of the Confederate battle flag that flies atop the South
Carolina statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Governor Bush avoid the question: What is your
response?'' asked Nathan Palmer, 22, a Gonzaga senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we should intervene in a state issue,'' McCain
replied in a restatement of what he said last week in South
Carolina. He added that when Arizona debated whether to adopt the
birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as a holiday, ``We did not
like it when a politician with ambitions was parachuted into our
state and told us what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer disappointed Palmer. ``I don't think the response was
adequate,'' he said. ``I was much more impressed when the
Democratic candidates, Gore and Bradley, said take it down.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake in Tuesday's primary are 12 of the 37 delegates
Washington will send to this summer's Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has hoped for a series of momentum-building victories
leading up to March 7, when populous California and New York hold
their primaries.
</P>
<P>
   A victory Feb. 29 in Washington ``will help a lot in
California,'' Murphy said. ``It will give specific momentum which
is priceless in a race like this.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spoke to a number of issues Wednesday, offering more
specifics on foreign policy than domestic concerns. These included:
</P>
<P>
   _ Trade: McCain described himself as ``the most free-trade
senator you will ever know.'' He took issue with the Clinton
administration's effort to link other issues to trade pacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not add environmental or labor conditions to any trade
agreements,'' McCain told the Rotary. But he pledged not to ignore
working conditions or environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
   _ China: McCain came out in favor of China's admission to the
World Trade Organization. At the same time, without going into
specifics of what he would do, McCain said he would warn China's
leaders not to pursue any aggression against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want China to know the consequences of aggression would far
exceed anything they would gain from it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bilingual Education: McCain advocated what he called ``total
immersion'' in the English language as the best path for immigrant
children to fully participate in American life. ``Most bilingual
education programs have failed to achieve their goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _Salmon Recovery: Last fall, McCain's web site included in its
list of pork barrel projects a pending appropriation of $80 million
for Pacific Coast salmon recovery and implementation of the
U.S.-Canada salmon treaty.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Wednesday that he objected ``to the process'' by
which spending items were included in the 2000 budget, not
necessarily the appropriation itself. ``I'm not against salmon
recovery,'' he said. ``I am against a process that doesn't allow
fair competition (for federal dollars).''
</P>
<P>
   _Dam Removal: Asked about controversial proposals to take down
dams on the Snake River, McCain said he would ``leave it on the
table'' as a possible option for recovery of decimated salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   He would approve such a measure only ``if I could see sufficient
scientific evidence gathered.'' McCain said it is his understanding
that no such evidence has been gathered.
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged that he is fighting an uphill battle against
Bush. ``We're still Luke Skywalker trying to escape from the Death
Star,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, McCain and his wife, Cindy, will spend a quiet day at
their cabin between Cottonwood and Sedona in northern Arizona. It
will be the senator's first day off since Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, however, he will have campaigned in San Diego,
Columbus and Cincinnati in Ohio, and in the Virginia suburbs near
Washington, D.C.

 &HT;    Host Rosie O'Donnell, Whitney Houston toss it up at Grammys
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Surely somewhere in Los Angeles there are security
people still trying to keep Rosie O'Donnell and Whitney Houston
apart. O'Donnell, the host of the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards on
Wednesday, tried to take a couple potshots at Houston during the
opening monologue because marijuana was reportedly found in the
singer's purse as she left a Hawaiian airport in January.
</P>
<P>
   But before O'Donnell could get started, Houston _ sitting with
gospel legend mom Cissy and R&AMP;B bad boy husband Bobby Brown _
lowered her head and raised one arm like, ``Please, don't.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell simply said, ``Aloha!''
</P>
<P>
   Before Houston's medley of ``It's Not Alright/But It's Okay''
and ``I Learned From The Best,'' O'Donnell introduced the
multi-Grammy winner by saying, ``She's a huge fan of the Doobies
... ''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   When Houston won the Grammy for female R&AMP;B vocal performance
(for ``It's Not Alright/But It's Okay''), she returned the favor.
She began her acceptance speech by ``First giving thanks to
almighty God, Rosie. Heh. Heh.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell had told prospective winners that she ``bumped into
God backstage, and he said, `You're welcome.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch! Ouch!
</P>
<P>
   For this ongoing catfight the two receive our award for ``best
reason to watch Rosie so an otherwise lackluster job as host. ''
</P>
<P>
   The other winners of awards not presented, but surely deserving:
</P>
<P>
   _ Best use of floral material: Singer/actress Jennifer Lopez,
who as the first presenter during the televised broadcast had
Gloria Estefan gasping and the rest of us gazing at the wide open
spaces her robe/dress revealed. In one line: She looked like a
mermaid that had been gutted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best opening act: Former Grammy host Ellen DeGeneres for
carrying a specimen cup around hoping someone would donate the
genetic goods, as David Crosby did with couple Melissa Etheridge
and Julie Cypher.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best way to sing Kid Rock's ``Bawitdaba'' (as offered to
DeGeneres by Rock): ``Have a couple of Budweisers and some pork
rinds, and it'll be flowing off the tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Best onion-stored-in-a-stocking look: The hairdo of Lisa
``Left-Eye'' Lopes of pop trio TLC.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best promoter of an upcoming project: Hip-hop's Busta Rhymes,
who mentioned his female act Rah Digga's solo debut as many times
as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best line to get past the censors: Kid Rock's ``we're coming
to your town. We'll pull your panties down.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Best parting shot: When Shania Twain didn't show up for her
best female country vocal performance, Clint Black said she was
having her belly waxed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best use of a circus theme: Well, it was never used
particularly well, but it sure showed up a lot in Ricky Martin, TLC
and Britney Spears' performances.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best performance since Ricky Martin's last year: Santana's
``Smooth'' with Rob Thomas, though Diana Krall, Erykah Badu and
George Benson's ``I Can't Give You Anything But Love'' deserves
more than a worthy mention.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, O'Donnell did have a winner with this one: ``In
light of recent events, there's been a new award this year. The
nominees: David Bowie, Mick Jagger and David Crosby. The category:
Best male performer with an old organ.''

MARINERS' PRACTICE IS FULL, BUT SOMETHING IS MISSING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ The player sitting in front of the locker is the
son of a former major leaguer, but his father is not Ken Griffey
Sr. The locker's occupant is the son of Julian Javier.
</P>
<P>
   ``A locker's a locker, no?'' Stan Javier said, using the locker
for the first time and making no big deal out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The locker might look like all of the other lockers in the
Seattle Mariners' spring training clubhouse, but it is not the
same. This one belonged to Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners held their first full-squad workout Wednesday, and
Griffey was not part of it. The back of Javier's shirt was hanging
out of his pants as he took batting practice, but no player wore
his cap backward a la Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey apparently has a major league copyright on that style,
and he did not bequeath it to anyone when he went east. No longer a
member of the Mariners after 11 years, he is missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior's absence is a huge void,'' Jay Buhner, his longtime
friend and outfield partner, said. ``It's almost like looking at it
from the standpoint that he's on the disabled list. I keep hearing
his voice from time to time. But that's the rude reality of the
game, the business part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will obviously miss Griffey's bat and glove, but
with a few players who have been around him, his absence will have
a greater impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss the player,'' Edgar Martinez, a career-long
teammate, said. ``I'm also going to miss the friend, the teammate,
the leader. It's so much more than missing a player. There are a
lot of new guys around here who haven't played here for many years
like I have. I just know from my point of view what I'm going to
miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner could talk for hours about his relationship with Griffey
and what he will miss by no longer having him as a teammate. He
didn't want to get into it, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just say we were buddies,'' he said. ``That's about all
I'm going to say about that. It's tough, no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who hit 398 home runs for Seattle, is gone because the
Mariners traded him to the Cincinnati Reds rather than have him
play this season with them, then lose him as a free agent and get
nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Mariners tried to induce Griffey to stay by
offering him an eight-year, $138 million contract. They tried a
similar approach with Alex Rodriguez, their power-hitting
shortstop, who also has one year left on his contract. They offered
him an eight-year, $128 million contract. Both players rejected the
offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with Junior, and he indicated he wanted to be traded,''
Chuck Armstrong, the club's president, said Wednesday, referring to
a meeting last November. ``We met with Alex, and he indicated he
didn't want to be traded. He wanted to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez also said he had no intention of signing a
contract extension and every intention of becoming a free agent.
Club officials met with him Wednesday to determine if he still felt
that way, but just before the meeting but Rodriguez reiterated his
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to play out the year,'' he told a reporter after the
Mariners' workout.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have said they don't plan to trade Rodriguez, but
their thinking can change. Players who were asked were aghast at
the prospect of losing Rodriguez, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into that,'' Martinez said. ``I hope that
doesn't happen. I don't even want to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A major reason the Mariners traded Griffey was their concern
that his lame-duck presence would create a fatal distraction. What
about Rodriguez, then?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think A-Rod's very good at doing and saying the right
things,'' Buhner said. ``I think A-Rod is going to do everything in
his power not to make it a distraction. I don't see it being a
distraction, but the fuse hasn't been lit yet. If it comes to that,
there's no telling what could go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will proceed with the belief that Rodriguez will be
their shortstop this year, not to mention the big hitter in their
depleted lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we're going to have to make some adjustments,''
manager Lou Piniella said. ``You have to when you lose 50 home runs
or so out of your lineup. We're going to stress more contact, more
hitting and running, being much more aggressive on the bases first
to third, hitting behind the runners. We're going to do some things
that Seattle teams have not done in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in offensive style, Piniella added, is necessary
because of Griffey's departure but also because the team plays in a
bigger park now than before.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the change was in full view Wednesday. As one player
took batting practice in the batting cage on the main practice
field, another player bunted pitches from a pitching machine that
was set up behind the cage.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are so serious about refining the little parts of
their game that partial foul lines were drawn from home plate in
the bunting area. Even Rodriguez has been asked to take his turn in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Had Griffey still been here and asked to take bunting practice,
he probably would have approached it with some skepticism but a lot
of humor. Piniella said he personally will miss Griffey, whom he
managed for seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed having him here all those years,'' the manager said.
``He had a tremendous career in Seattle. But now we have to go
forward. He's not going to be here. We can't dwell on it. We have
to prepare for the championship season.''

MGM GRAND OFFERS $3.3 BILLION FOR MIRAGE   
(DW)

   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MGM Grand Inc., the casino company controlled by the billionaire
Kirk Kerkorian, made an unsolicited $3.3 billion offer Wednesday to
acquire Mirage Resorts Inc., the struggling company created by Las
Vegas impresario Stephen A. Wynn.
</P>
<P>
   While MGM Grand said that it wants a friendly merger, the offer
could set off a battle between two of the richest and most powerful
people in Las Vegas if, as expected, Wynn rejects the offer and
attempts to hold onto his empire. Mirage issued only a brief
statement Wednesday saying its board would consider the proposal in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Wynn, MGM Grand offered to pay $17 a share for
Mirage, 56 percent higher than Mirage's closing price of $10.875 on
Tuesday. Mirage shareholders could elect to receive the entire
amount in cash, or $7 in cash and $10 in MGM Grand stock.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn is credited, more than anyone else, with setting off a boom
in Las Vegas by transforming the city from a gambling haven into a
tourist mecca by building themed hotels such as the Mirage, with
its erupting fake volcano, that offered entertainment beyond just
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   But his usual ability to gauge consumer tastes seems to have
failed him recently as Mirage spent well more than $2 billion to
build two extravagant hotels _ the Bellagio in Las Vegas and the
Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Miss. _ that have not lived up to
expectations. The company's earnings have been weak and its stock,
which was at $26 last May, fell to $10.975 Tuesday, putting Wynn's
kingdom at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's vulnerable,'' said Jason Ader, an analyst at Bear
Stearns &AMP; Co. He said Mirage is likely to reject the first offer
but that MGM could offer a price as high as in the low $20 range a
share and still have the deal add to its earnings per share
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they would do this and not be serious,'' Ader
said of MGM Grand. ``Kirk is not one to come into a situation like
this in a passive way.''
</P>
<P>
   MGM Grand said that the merger would create a powerhouse in the
gaming business. ``The combination of these two companies is
checkmate in our industry,'' said James J. Murren, the president
and chief financial officer of MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would be second in overall revenue to Park
Place Entertainment, the gambling spinoff of Hilton Hotels that has
just acquired the Caesars casinos. But the combined company would
probably be the leader on the Las Vegas Strip, putting together MGM
Grand's 5,000 room flagship hotel and its New York-New York casino
with Mirage's Mirage, Bellagio and Treasure Island and its half
ownership of the Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the combined company would dominate the business
of catering to high rollers. It could achieve substantial cost
savings by not having to spend so much to compete for these high
rollers and because MGM Grand's management, which has been bringing
in strong profits, could impose a cost discipline on Mirage that
Wynn has never had.
</P>
<P>
   But Wynn, who is used to running things his own way, is not
expected to simply step aside. While the letter from MGM said that
all board members of Mirage would be offered spots on the board of
the combined company, it did not specify any other role for Wynn.
</P>
<P>
   Mirage's stock rose $3.625 Wednesday, to $14.50, still below the
price of MGM's offer, a sign that investors are not convinced the
deal will go through. MGM Grand shares rose $1.4375, to $41.8125.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the casino industry said it would be relatively
easy for Mirage to reject the offer by promising to take steps to
improve its performance and raise the stock price above MGM Grand's
offer. Wynn owns 12 percent of the stock and is said by industry
executives to have firm control over his board, one of whose
members is his wife, Elaine.
</P>
<P>
   A big factor could be the attitude of Mirage's institutional
shareholders. Wynn's relationship with Wall Street has been
strained by the stock's decline and because Wynn, who some industry
executives say would probably prefer if his company were private,
has at times seemed indifferent to investor concerns about cost
controls and profits.
</P>
<P>
   But MGM Grand for now is not making a tender offer directly to
the shareholders because hostile takeovers are frowned upon by
gambling regulators who would have to approve any merger, according
to people in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it is possible, but not likely, that another
company will bid for Mirage. The most likely candidate is Harrah's
Entertainment, because it is not that strong in Las Vegas. A
spokesman for Harrah's did not comment on Mirage, but said Harrah's
believes the gambling industry needs more consolidation and it will
look at different opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Kerkorian signaled his interest in Mirage last September when he
bought a little under 5 percent of Mirage's shares. But the
82-year-old investor, who tends to operate behind the scenes, sold
the shares a few weeks later. Neither he nor MGM Grand now own any
Mirage stock, according to the letter sent to Wynn.
</P>
<P>
   Kerkorian has three times built what were, at the time of their
construction, the largest hotels in Las Vegas _ the Las Vegas
Hilton, Bally's Las Vegas and the MGM Grand. He also controls
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the Hollywood studio. In 1995 he tried to take
control of the Chrysler Corp. He failed but ended up with a huge
profit when the car company was purchased by Daimler-Benz.

LOTS OF TRASHY, A LITTLE BIT OF CLASSY AT THE GRAMMYS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Guys in rhinestone tiaras, girls with rhinestone tattoos and
couples in leather pantsuits with studs the size of Hershey kisses.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like Hollywood Boulevard on prom night, but it was the
Grammys. And the night when fashion independents come out in force.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Martin, who went for a more elegant Armani suit with a
long black coat, called it an intense night for the music
community.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Goo Goo Dolls with the blond spiked hair,
satin shirts and paisley pants. Dressed to thrill, the guys said
their clothes were by Gucci, and they hoped their look would appeal
to the Dixie Chicks.
</P>
<P>
   But Brian McKnight and his wife, Julie, were an awesome pair in
ensembles by Richard Tyler. Usually the fashion press zeroes in on
the women's gowns, and Julie's was sassy in deep green velvet, but
Brian's caramel-colored leather suit (and matching shoes) with an
apricot shirt was a Grammy-winning ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Also looking glam were Clint and Lisa Hartman Black, he in a
tuxedo with a black cowboy hat (he says that's as Western as he
gets). Lisa was in pants and a tight top covered in lavender
sequins by Rogani. Marc Anthony was more subdued in a gray
turtleneck and suit, but his fiancee Dayanara Torres, whom he
called his lucky charm, was glittering in beads and sequins over a
baby blue gown.
</P>
<P>
   Red leather two-piece ensembles that showed toned and taunt
midriffs and an occasional diamond belly ring were the hot tickets.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many classy/trashy ensembles on the narrow red
carpet that cowboy hats and huge Mad Hatter hats were bumping into
each other. The fur flew, both real and faux (think leopard and
zebra), seen on hats, shoes and those must-have Fendi purses.
</P>
<P>
   With all of the fun-and-funky fashion, and glittery chokers and
bracelets, those who dressed down actually raised their style
status.
</P>
<P>
   Britney Spears was one of the standouts. Her take on Old
Hollywood glamour was a clingy white jersey gown by Randolph Duke
accented with a long white fox fur and rhinestone sandals. Sarah
McLauchlin also was looking good in a gold A-line gown by Sully
Bonnali.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lopez made a mad (late) dash for the awards literally
falling out of her floral chiffon gown. She was quite an eyeful,
but Christina Aguilera was the sex siren of the night in her
shimmery silver Versace cocktail dress with huge butterflies and
stiletto sandals with pink flowers. Her eyes were rimmed in bright
green crayon, which could be the next big trend.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the fashion parade ended, the fashion press was
weary of men with cowboy boots and big gold necklaces and women in
leopard in python pants. But jeweled chokers and green eyeliner,
and those Fendi bags. They were hot tickets to wear for the next
big event. &QL;

 &HT;    `Supernatural' night for Santana ties Grammy record
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He said an angel named Metatron prophesied that
``molecules and light would come together'' to give him a comeback
on radio. But even the cosmically smooth Carlos Santana could never
have predicted that, 30 years after his hippie heyday at Woodstock,
he would dominate the first Grammy ceremony of the new century with
eight awards.
</P>
<P>
   Santana tied Michael Jackson for the record of most Grammys ever
awarded to one artist in a single year, taking home trophies for
album of the year for the 11-million selling ``Supernatural,'' and
the first No. 1 single in his career, ``Smooth.'' (Jackson won
eight trophies in 1983 for his work on ``Thriller.'')
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old rock guitar legend, with gray flecking his
trademark mustache and long curly locks, was recognized for his
work on ``Supernatural,'' the album that paired the guitarist's
distinctive, Afro-Latin instrumental style with vocals from rock
and hip-hop artists such as Lauryn Hill, Everlast and Matchbox 20
vocalist Rob Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smooth'' got the evening's top honors for song of the year and
record of the year, with trophies going to Santana, Thomas and
Atlanta producer Matt Serletic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic _ this is very cool,'' Serletic said just moments
after winning his first Grammy. ``You're so caught up in the
creative process when you're making the music you don't even think
about awards, but the energy comes back in a moment like this. It's
such a creative rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Metatron must have been watching over pop hitmakers TLC as well.
In addition to their hot pink live performance, the Atlanta trio
nabbed two Grammys for best R&AMP;B performance by a duo/group with
vocal and best R&AMP;B album for ``Fanmail.'' East Point, Ga., native
Kandi Burruss _ along with co-writers Tameka Cottle and Kevin
``She'kspere'' Briggs _ got an early Grammy for best R&AMP;B song for
TLC's single ``No Scrubs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be partying tonight _ with my mom _ but we're
still gonna have a great time,'' said Burruss from backstage
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Although nominations of teen acts such as Britney Spears and
Backstreet Boys made it look like the recording academy was dipping
into the Clearasil this year, the evening was punctuated by awards
to over-40 acts.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-aged Sting bounced Latin hunk Ricky Martin off his bon
bon to win for best male pop vocal performance. Cher nabbed her
first Grammy ever for best dance recording (for ``Believe''). Elton
John performed the 1975 disco hit ``Philadelphia Freedom'' with the
Backstreet Boys _ then walked away with a legend award. Outrageous
metal rapper Kid Rock wound up his moment onstage by segueing into
Grand Funk Railroad's ``We're an American Band.'' And here's
something you thought you'd never see: Black Sabbath, a heavy-metal
band that came of age in the 1970s, won for best metal performance
while '70s sex crooner Barry White was named best male R&AMP;B vocal
performer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the show's few surprises came when a genuinely shocked
Christina Aguilera, 19, accepted the best new artist trophy.
</P>
<P>
   In a year where Latin music broke through to mainstream America,
the Grammys were in step with searing live performances by salsa
crooner Marc Anthony and unlikely Cuban movie favorites Buena Vista
Social Club. Martin, who last year electrified the audience, seemed
tame by comparison. From the presenter's stand, Aguilera and Jimmy
Smits even announced the recording academy would be launching a
Latin-only awards telecast in September.
</P>
<P>
   Host Rosie O'Donnell fell excruciatingly flat with most of her
jokes, even confessing she's a ``Barry Manilow/Neil Diamond kind of
gal.'' It showed. Her leaden one-liners about Whitney Houston and
marijuana and Puff Daddy's arrest on gun charges (which turned out
to be particularly tasteless as he was indicted just before show
time on bribery charges) showed little insight into the world of
music and its clever possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Country's Dixie Chicks had one of the best live moments on the
show, performing the quirky, husband-killing tune ``Goodbye Earl,''
featuring a bewigged Dennis Franz (of ``NYPD Blue'') in a video
backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Jennifer Lopez' show-it-like-it-is dress and Martin's
pelvic thrusts, this Grammy show provided some provocative scenes.
But for all the bared flesh, the evening seemed sometimes
passionless _ until the last song. That's when Santana picked up
his red guitar and put the ``molecules and light'' together when he
threw back his head and soared into the now classic opening notes
of ``Smooth.''
