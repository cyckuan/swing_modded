<HEADLINE> Ruling Party Official Quits Parliament in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Mpumalanga premier
Mathews Phosa announced Thursday that he is leaving parliament and
the government service for the private sector.
</P>
<P>
But he dispelled earlier speculation that he was to quit
politics.
</P>
<P>
"It is my intention to remain an active African National
Congress (ANC) member and continue serving my country, but from a
different platform," he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Phosa said his decision followed consultation with the ANC
leadership as well as colleagues who had been deployed in the
private sector or those who were there for their own account.
</P>
<P>
"From all these consultations I have received nothing but good
advice, support and encouragement," he said.
</P>
<P>
He rejected suggestions that he was bitter at having been
replaced as Mpumalanga premier to become an ordinary backbencher
in parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said his experience from years in politics showed him that
the country still had a long way to go before reaching the ideal
of a better life for all.
</P>
<P>
"Our struggle has not only been a political one, but has had an
economic focus as well. Without economic support for our political
objectives we have no hope of achieving our goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Phosa was one of three ANC premiers who had been axed before
the June 2 general election. His province was plagued by
allegations of corruption and party in-fighting.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ordered to Pay 90,686 Dollars in Paula Jones Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal judge Thursday
ordered President Clinton to pay 90,686 dollars for false
testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who issued a historic
contempt ruling against Clinton last April, said she would order
him to pay for depositions and other costs that resulted from his
January 1998 deposition for Jones' lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions are being imposed, not only to deter others who
might consider emulating the president's misconduct, but to
compensate the plaintiff by requiring that the president pay her
any reasonable fees and expenses caused by his willful failure to
obey this court's discovery orders," Wright wrote in her order
filed in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Jones accused Clinton of making an unwanted sexual advance in a
Little Rock hotel room in 1991 while he was governor of Arkansas
and she was a state employee.
</P>
<P>
At the deposition, Clinton was asked about his relationship
with Lewinsky, a former White House intern. Clinton testified that
"I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky."
</P>
<P>
Months later, after Clinton's DNA was found on a dress
belonging to Lewinsky, he acknowledged an "inappropriate intimate
relationship" with her.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's testimony in that case led to his impeachment by the
House and eventual acquittal in a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was en route to the Balkans for a summit at the time
the judgement was released, the White House had no immediate
official comment. However, White House sources said they were
not surprised by the ruling and would pay the fine from
Clinton's legal defense fund.

<HEADLINE> S. African Economy to Bottom Out: Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It is expected that economic growth will be just below one
percent in 1999. However, it is believed that most of this growth
will only materialize in the second half of this year," the group
noted in its latest quarterly economic review.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's economy grew by 0.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
ABSA predicted that the economy would grow by two percent in
the second half of 1999 compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Positive spin-offs from the demutualization of the country's
leading insurer, Old Mutual, a slight increase in the commodity
price and lower interest rates will support the recovery in the
economy, it said.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth of two to 2.5 percent is forecast for the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
ABSA was less optimistic about the continuation of the surplus
on the current account of the balance of payments that was
registered in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
"Despite an expected increase in international commodity prices
in the remainder of 1999, a recovery in the domestic demand, a
lower international gold price, agricultural imports and a high
oil price, may push the current account back into deficit in the
second half of 1999."
</P>
<P>
The banking group remains bullish on the short-term
inflationary outlook.
</P>
<P>
"Low inflation in trading-partner countries and the relative
stability in the rand exchange rate will most probably support a
stable to lower inflation rate in the next six months."
</P>
<P>
It forecast the consumer inflation could fall below five
percent in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, the downward
trend of interest rates might well continue into 2000, it said.
</P>
<P>
ABSA expects a prime lending rate of 15.5 percent by year-end,
with a bottoming-out at around 14 percent during 2000.

<HEADLINE> New Molecule Helps Improve Bone Marrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli researchers have
developed a new molecule that can keep the body's original cells
multiplying without maturation, an achievement that may improve
bone marrow transplantation and advance gene therapy research.
</P>
<P>
Professor Michel Revel and his team at the prestigious
Weizmann Institute of Science created the new molecule which can
allow blood stem cells, the most primitive and immature cells in
the body, to survive and proliferate in test tubes, according to a
report released by the institute Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In bone marrow transplantation, stem cells are infused into a
patient to replace defective or malignant marrow. But presently it
is difficult to make stem cells of the donor multiply without
changing their properties because they quickly mature into
various types of blood cells when isolated in test tubes.
</P>
<P>
In their study, Weizmann Institute scientists developed a new
molecule by fusing together a molecule stimulating stem cells to
form clusters with it and its receptor molecule.
</P>
<P>
When the new molecule, called "chimera," was added to isolated
stem cells together with other cytokines, the cells were able to
survive in the test tube for two weeks and their numbers increased
significantly.
</P>
<P>
By transplanting the treated human stem cells to mice with
severe combined immunodeficency, the scientists verified their
ability to repopulate the bone marrow and produce all types of
blood cells, demonstrating that the stem cells had indeed remained
immature.
</P>
<P>
If the Weizmann Institute molecule is adopted for clinical
use, allowing stem cells to survive longer and increasing their
numbers, the success of bone marrow transplantation can be
improved, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The study may also provide a boost to gene therapy research by
giving scientists a larger window of opportunity for inserting
genes into human stem cells maintained in the laboratory, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Since transplanted stem cells repopulate the bone marrow of
the recipient and produce billions of blood cells every day,
inserting a gene in these cells prior to transplantation would
ensure a steady supply of the protein made by this gene,
compensating for the genetic defect causing diseases, the report
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department reported
Thursday that Employment Cost Index, considered the best measure
of changes in wages and benefit costs, increased 1.1 percent in
the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
It is the biggest quarterly increase since 1991, but followed a
record low 0.4 percent rise during the first three months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The lowest unemployment rate in 29 years has raised fears that
employers scrambling for workers will have to raise wages, and
therefore prices.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, meanwhile, the Labor Department said that
the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits
dropped last week to the lowest level in two years, indicating the
labor market continues to tighten.
</P>
<P>
Jobless claims fell 40,000 to 275,000 in the week ending on
July 24, lowering a four-week moving average of claims to 300,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 29 (Xinhua) (C The Tanzania-Italian
Petroleum Refinery (TIPER) has resumed production following
availability of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
TIPER halted production early this month because the importer,
Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) had problems in
securing a letter of credit from its bank in favor of the
supplier.
</P>
<P>
Yona Kilagane, the managing director of TPDC, the supplier,
said in Dar es Salaam Thursday that TIPER has recently received
86,000 tons of crude oil estimated at 12 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kilagane said TPDC has sorted out the financial issues with its
 banker late last week and that ultimately the letter of credit
was opened in favor of Messrs Addax of Switzerland that supplied
the crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fate of privatizing TIPER, which is capable of
processing 650,000 tons of oil annually, will be known before the
end of this year under the policy of liberalizing the oil
industry, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak to Hold Talks Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is
due to be in Egypt on Saturday for talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Alexandria on the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks, a Palestinian diplomat said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zohdi al Qedra told reporters
that Arafat and Mubarak are expected to "lay down a mechanism for
action for the coming period to put the Middle East peace process
on the right track."
</P>
<P>
"Playing with time and ideas and procrastinations has raised
doubts over (Israeli Prime Minister Ehud) Barak's intentions
toward peace," al Qedra said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority "firmly rejects Barak's
proposal to delay withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank
and combine the Wye River accord with the final status talks," he
said.
</P>
<P>
After the elections in May, Barak has repeatedly expressed
readiness to carry out the Wye accord signed last October by
Arafat and former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who
then froze the deal after the first of the three-phase troops
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Barak has proposed to combine the third phase of pullback with
the more complicated final status talks after implementing the
second phase.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat has said he would not accept any modifications to
the agreement and insisted on quick Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Al Qedra urged the United States, a key mediator in the Mideast
peace process, to "stand by the side of the Palestinian legitimate
rights" and pressure the Israeli government to enforce the signed
agreements, foremost the Wye River agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is the sponsor of and witness to the peace process
and should not lose its credibility in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian diplomat praised Egypt's leading role in
supporting the Palestinian cause and activating the peace
process.

miners who are trapped in their working tunnels at Nchanga's only
shaft number one.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM manager for corporate affairs, Sam Equamo, has confirmed

ISLAMABAD, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
managed to hold the strategically important district of Nejrab in
control as their summer offensive against the northern alliance
forces entered the second day Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Figures of casualties from various sources indicated that at
least 120 Taliban soldiers had been killed in the battle around
the district of Nejrab, northeast of the capital city of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the district and the main city of Nejrab

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Announces Strike for Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi opposition will
stage a 30-hour hartal (destructive strike) early next month to
protest the government's decision on Wednesday to study the
transshipment of Indian goods through Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the major opposition - the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the Jatiya Party, the
Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya Jote, made the announcement
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The hartal will start at 6 a.m. on August 2 and ends at 12 noon
on August 3.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the opposition announced a countrywide demonstration
on August 3, to protest against the "price hike rise in
electricity rate and deterioration of law and order."
</P>
<P>
The opposition organized a three-day road march from Sunday to
Tuesday, the second of its kind this year, to different corners of
the country to intensify the anti-government agitation.
</P>
<P>
Oli Ahmed, member of the BNP Standing Committee, denounced the
government decision on transit to India, saying that "The cabinet
decision about conceding transit facility to India would
ultimately jeopardize security of Bangladesh," a press report
said.
</P>
<P>
He refuted the suggestion that the transit would bring economic
benefit for Bangladesh. "It's a bluff to divert the people's
attention," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Sustain International Pressure on UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Thursday
reiterated that it will sustain its strong international pressure
on Angola's rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) through strictly abiding by relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions on sanctions.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in a statement by EU president which was
handed to Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda Thursday by
Portuguese and French ambassadors and EU representative in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The EU will strictly abide by U.N. resolutions which include
arms, diamond export sanctions and oil embargo on UNITA, the
closing up of UNITA' s offices abroad and prohibition of foreign
visit by UNITA officials.
</P>
<P>
The statement signed by the 15 EU members also urged Jonas
Savimbi, chairman of the rebel movement, to stop all war
operations which have been incurring humanitarian tragedy to the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
In the mean time, the EU expressed its appreciations of the
Angolan government for its reform measures aimed at stabilizing
national economy and financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Since the country's civil war was renewed at the end of last
year, the Angolan government has repeatedly accused some European
and African countries of providing secretly weaponry and logistic
goods to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the U.N. Security Council has set up an ad hoc
committee to investigate violations of relevant resolutions.

<HEADLINE> USAID Experts to Visit Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A group of experts from the U.S.
International Development Agency (USAID) will start their visit to
Angola on Friday to inspect and study the situation of
humanitarian aid in the country.
</P>
<P>
Heather Evans, an official with USAID, told local press
Thursday that the 5-member group will consider the possibility of
offering humanitarian aid to those victims of war living in places
with access difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Evans refused to reveal the details of their mission in Angola,
but said that the group would contact the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
In Angola, there are 1.7 million displaced people, two million
victims living in rebel-besieged areas and 750,000 abandoned or
handicapped children and orphans. According to the Angolan
authorities, the country needs a minimum humanitarian aid of 200
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council
(UNESC) held in Swiss this month, the United Nations solicited the
international community for a humanitarian aid of 105 million U.S.
dollars, but obtained only 40 million dollars in donations.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The World Bank has agreed to extend loans of 1.6
billion U.S. dollars this year to six Arab states, namely, Egypt,
Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Yemen and the Palestinian National
Authority, to help finance 25 development projects in these
countries.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Arab daily "Al Hayat" quoted a recent World Bank
statement as saying that 550 million dollars will be allocated to
Egypt, 210 million dollars to Jordan, 440 million to Morocco, 194
million to Tunisia, 54 million to the Palestinian self-rule areas,
and 181 million to Yemen.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi government will pay back some 770 million
rials (25 million dollars) of debts to local farmers and
contractors this week, the Al Hayat reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bankers in Saudi Arabia anticipate a rise of some 30 billion
rials (8 billion dollars) in government revenues this year as a
result of improved oil prices and the government measures to
stimulate non-petroleum income resources.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Health Ismail Sallam anticipates
a rise in Egypt's export of medical drugs to exceed 340 million
dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Egyptian daily "Alam Al Yom" quoted him as saying
that Egypt's export of medical drugs have already exceeded 300
million dollars since the begining of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-made drugs meet about 95 percent of domestic needs, he
said, adding that market prices have not changed since 1997.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABIE -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is the third
largest re-export center in the world, after Hong Kong and
Singapore, the Alam Al Yom reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a recent study by the economic research
department of the UAE Industrial Bank as saying that the volume of
re-export trade in UAE has reached 24 billion dirhams (6.5 billion
dollars), or one third of the country's trading sector.
</P>
<P>
The study said Iran is the foremost destination of UAE
re-exports, accounting for 20 percent of the total, followed by
India.

<HEADLINE> 8 Iraqi Civilians killed in Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Eight Iraqi civilians were killed
and 26 others injured on Thursday in U.S. and British warplanes
bombardment of some civilian and service facilities in southern
and northern Iraq, said an Iraqi military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 6:10 (0210 GMT), eight formations of
enemy warplanes coming from Saudi bases violated southern Iraqi
airspace over Muthana, Najaf, Kerbala and Wasit provinces.
</P>
<P>
These warplanes attacked some civilian and service facilities
in Wasit province, 180 kilometers to the southeast of Baghdad,
killing eight civilians and injuring 25 others, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
This is the second heaviest civilian casualties caused by
U.S. and British air raids in two weeks this year in their
regular attacks on Iraqi civilian and military targets.
</P>
<P>
On July 18, U.S. and British bombardment of civilian
buildings in southern Iraq led to the deaths of 17 civilians
and the injuries of dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:30 (0630 GMT), nine formations
of U.S. and British warplanes coming from Turkish airspace also
violated northern Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil
provinces in the day.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes bombed some civilian and service
installations in the region, leading to the injury of one
civilian, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the invading
enemy planes and forced them to flee, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency said that residents in Kut, capital
city of Wasit province, held funeral procession for the victims
of the bombardment later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim
of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims
in the south from any possible attacks by the government
troops.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's U.S.-British airstrikes, Iraq has
declared that it does not recognize the restricted zones because
they were imposed unilaterally by the U.S. and Britain without
the authorization of the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Leaders Gather For Post-Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Finnishi President and current
European Union president Martti Ahtisaari said here Thursday that
the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe should become a turning
point.
</P>
<P>
He opened a two-day summit of Stability Pact when leaders of
states and governments from Balkan region gathered in Sarajevo,
the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that this meeting will be developed to
constructive brainstorming about how to begin implementation of
the tasks of the three working tables in the Stability Pact:
Democracy and human rights, economic reconstruction, development
and cooperation, and security issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari also noted that tensions and crises have erupted
throughout the the Balkan region, caused refugee flows and
instability, devastated economies. "These crises have cost
southeastern Europe precious time and set it back in its
aspiration to join the rest of Europe," he added.
</P>
<P>
He believe it is high time to make up for lost time, saying the
successful management of transition throughout the region is a
prerequisite for functional integration into broader European and
international structures. "The challenges of integration are
extraordinary, but so are the potential rewards."
</P>
<P>
The Balkan leaders are trying to set out their priorities for
the region before the full-scale summit starts on Friday, which
will be attended by some 40 world leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday's summit was attended by the leaders from Albania,
Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Hungary, Romania,
Slovenia, Switzerland, Turkey, Former Yugoslavia republic of
Macedonia and some international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The countries neighboring Yugoslavia suffered a lot during
NATO's 78-day air bombing against Yugoslavia. They want the West
to give them compensation for the their loss from the war.
</P>
<P>
Donors of rich countries and international financial agencies
promised on Wednesday in Brussels 2.1 billion U.S. dollars for
urgent humanitarian aid in Kosovo before Winter sets in and to
launch the reconstruction process in the whole region except for
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But the summit meeting here is more symbolic than substantial
as analysts predict. "To ensure sustainable peace we must build on
a comprehensive vision of longer-term democratic governance,
economic growth and security cooperation," Ahtisaari said.
</P>
<P>
The Stability Pact is an initiative which seeks to bring
together not only the countries most affected by regional
instability, but also all their partners at the highest political
level, he said.

<HEADLINE> Legal System Can Not Be Damaged by Falun Gong: Officials and People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Officials and people from all
walks of life of the country stressed today that the great
achievement made in China's construction of socialist legal system
will not allow to be damaged by Falun Gong or other superstitious
activities.
</P>
<P>
We will never allow Li Hongzhi and the illegal Falun Gong
attempts to destroy the building of China's socialist legal system,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Police officers in Tianjin Municipality said that preventing
Falun Gong practitioners from receiving medical treatment in
hospitals impinges on people's rights, and the attack and siege of
news media units and governmental departments violate legal
regulations on demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
A civil administration official in east China's Shandong
Province said that the Research Society of Falun Dafa acted
against the law on the registration of associations, and the
illegal organization was never approved by related authority.
</P>
<P>
Li developed a tight organization system in Beijing and many
other parts of the country, the official said, and this violated
the law and the ban on organizations that spread superstitious
fallacies and destroy social stability.
</P>
<P>
The ban ensures the people's natural rights to life and health,
and guarantees a normal social order. This demonstrates China's
policy insisting on managing state affairs in accordance with laws
and developing a socialist country with a legal system.
</P>
<P>
Employees of publishers in east China's Anhui Province have
noted that the books and materials on Falun Gong are full of
superstitious fallacies and pseudo-science, and Li and his
followers printed these illegal publications for sale at high
prices for quick and huge profits.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the knowledge of law should be further
spread among ordinary people to help them spurn fatuity and see
the true face of Li and the illegal Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily and the Guangming Daily today jointly hosted
a seminar attended by a group of Beijing-based scholars who
criticized Falun Gong from the perspective of politics, theory,
philosophy, science, and medicine.
</P>
<P>
They strongly condemned the political nature and great harm of
Li Hongzhi and the Falun Dafa he concocted.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Children Discuss Environmental Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 children from all
parts of Kenya gathered here Thursday to open the first Kenya
National Children's Conference on Environment with a focus on
links between communications and environment.
</P>
<P>
The young delegates aged nine to 13 are expected to present
their papers on environmental issues and answer questions from
fellow representatives.
</P>
<P>
"Each year, millions of children die of environmental causes.
Children' s health is an index of the quality of the environment,"
said Shafqat Kakakhel, deputy executive director of the United
Nations Environment Program (UNEP).
</P>
<P>
The first of the major two objectives for the conference is to
promote environmental awareness among children and the second is
to share their views and aspirations on environmental protection,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The discussions of the participants cover such topics as "Poor
communications and environmental pollution", "Creating
environmental awareness for the conservation of wildlife" and
"Media and the Environment".
</P>
<P>
The conference is set to be a forum at which children will
articulate their vision for the next millenium.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also a follow-up to the International Children's
 Conference on the Environment, held in Nairobi in 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Slows Abruptly in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. economic growth slowed
abruptly to 2.3 percent during the second quarter, according to
advance estimates released Thursday by the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that the gross domestic product, the
nation's total output of goods and services, increased by 44
billion dollars from April through June to an inflation-adjusted
7.8 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deceleration in GDP in the second quarter primarily
reflected a deceleration in personal consumption expenditures and
a downturn in government spending that more than offset an upturn
in exports, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The second-quarter slowdown came after the economy surprised
many analysts by growing at a bigger-than-expected 4.3 percent
annual rate during the first three months of 1999. Economists have
been predicting that slower growth would calm fears that the
economy could overheat. They noted new restraint by consumers,
whose purchases account for two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity, was largely responsible for putting on the brakes.
</P>
<P>
The report said consumer spending grew by 4 percent from April
through June, compared with a torrid 6.7 percent during the first
three months of 1999. It was the slowest spending increase since
the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
An inflation gauge tied to the GDP showed consumer prices rose
more quickly during the Spring, at an annual rate of 2.1 percent,
compared to 1.2 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Worrying that economic growth is too rapid and might spark
inflation, the Federal Reserve in June raised interest rates by a
quarter of a point. In his midyear report to Congress this week,
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan repeated warning the nation's central
bankers have not ruled out another rate increase this year if
inflation flares.
</P>
<P>
During the lingering international financial crisis, overseas
markets for American products have dwindled and a flood of imports
from troubled countries trying to unload their own goods here at
discount prices has helped keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been some recent improvement in the trade
picture as foreign economies have begun to recover. The record
U.S. trade deficit shaved just 0.75 percent off total economic
growth in the second quarter of 1999, compared to a 2.23 percent
offset in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Investment by U.S. businesses, spending on new equipment and
plants, picked up from April through June, growing by 10.8
percent, compared to 8.5 percent in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, rising mortgage rates dampened the
housing market, with spending on new homes and apartments growing
by 5.1 percent, much slower than the 15.4 percent rate in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Although consumers tempered their buying spree in the second
quarter, they are still spending more than they earn. The personal
savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income, fell
to a record low -- negative 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the Department emphasized that the second-quarter
"advance" estimates are based on source data that are incomplete
or subject to further revision by the source agency.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Mourns Over Slain Tamil Parliamentarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan cabinet of
ministers Thursday expressed their grave sorrow and sadness over
the killing of Tamil parliamentarian Neelan Thiruchelvam by a
suicide bomber.
</P>
<P>
The ministers observed two-minute silence in his honor at their
cabinet meeting, the Government Information Department said in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
Thiruchelvam, 55, a member of the moderate Tamil United
Liberation Front (TULF), was killed instantly Thursday morning at
a stone's throw from his home in Colombo's upmarket diplomatic
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The bomber jumped off the back of a motorcyclist and onto
Thiruchelvam's car as it approached a busy intersection, police
said.
</P>
<P>
The bomber also was killed in the explosion, police said. Five
others were injured in the blast, including two of the
parliamentarian's bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility, but officials blamed the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which is fighting a
16-year war for an independent Tamil homeland.
</P>
<P>
Thiruchelvam's TULF party said his killing highlighted the need
for a settlement of the burning ethnic issue in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
"The tragic death...once again emphasizes the urgent need to
evolve a peaceful political resolution to the country's national
conflict," a TULF statement said.
</P>
<P>
The deaths of three other TULF politicians have also been
blamed on the LTTE rebels, including the assassination of the
party's founder Appapillai Amritalingam in the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Leaders Gather for Post-Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President and current
European Union president Martti Ahtisaari said here Thursday that
the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe should become a turning
point.
</P>
<P>
He opened a two-day summit of Stability Pact when leaders of
states and governments from Balkan region gathered in Sarajevo,
the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that this meeting will be constructive about how
to begin implementation of the tasks of the three working tables
in the Stability Pact: Democracy and human rights, economic
reconstruction, development and cooperation, and security issues,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari also noted that tensions and crises have erupted
throughout the the Balkan region, caused refugee flows and
instability. "These crises have cost southeastern Europe precious
time and set it back in its aspiration to join the rest of
Europe," he added.
</P>
<P>
He believes it is high time to make up for lost time, saying the
successful management of transition throughout the region is a
prerequisite for functional integration into broader European and
international structures. "The challenges of integration are
extraordinary, but so are the potential rewards."
</P>
<P>
The Balkan leaders are trying to set out their priorities for
the region before the full-scale summit starts on Friday, which
will be attended by some 40 world leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday's summit was attended by the leaders from Albania,
Bulguria, Bosnia and herzegovina, Croatia, Hungary, Romania,
Slovenia, Switzerland, Turkey, Former Yugoslavia republic of
Macedonia and some international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The countries neighboring Yugoslavia suffered a lot during
NATO's 78-day air bombing against Yugoslavia. They want the West
to give them compensation for their loss from the war.
</P>
<P>
Donors of rich countries and international financial agencies
promised on Wednesday in Brussels 2.1 billion U.S. dollars for
urgent humanitarian aid in Kosovo before winter sets in and to
launch the reconstruction process in the whole region except for
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But the summit meeting here is more symbolic than substantial
as analysts predict. "To ensure sustainable peace we must build on
a comprehensive vision of longer-term democratic governance,
economic growth and security cooperation," Ahtisaari said.
</P>
<P>
The Stability Pact is an initiative which seeks to bring
together not only the countries most affected by regional
instability, but also all their partners at the highest political
level, he said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union president stressed that the solutions for
the region must be generated within the region. "Sarajevo, where
the tortured history of this century can be seen to have begun,
can now help launch a new century of peace, prosperity and
democracy," he said in his opening statement at the first day of
the two-day summit.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Lowers Maize Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) --- Kenya cut its tariff on maize
imports to 25 percent from 32.5 percent Thursday in a bid to
increase supply shortly after the state-run National Cereals and
Produce Board said commercial stocks were running low.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry announced that it was also waiving an
additional 50 percent suspended duty on maize after an expected
poor harvest meant Kenyans would have insufficient supply of
their major food.
</P>
<P>
The suspended duty is an additional discretionary tax which the
 government usually imposes to protect its farmers when imports
are seen to harm local growers.
</P>
<P>
The National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) said Tuesday its
stocks had fallen to 700,000 bags (90 kms per bag) from 2.3
million at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of remaining stock is government owned for use mainly
for famine relief, NCPB said.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said the country needed to import at least two
million 90-kg bags to meet its needs in one to two months before
the next harvest.
</P>
<P>
Scarce rains during the main rainy season between March and
June have undermined crop prospects for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kenya did not officially export any maize from the 1998 crop
but analysts reported smuggling to neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Four-year Economic Plan Approved by Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government's four-year
economic blueprint, the Dpef, crossed its last parliamentary
hurdle Thursday when it won approval by the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
The Dpef, the document giving the economic guidelines and
forecasts on which next year's budget will be based later in the
year, was approved by the Italian Senate Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The final version makes no mention of the contentious pension
reform issue, which will be taken up with the trade unions in
September.
</P>
<P>
It cites only plans to "rationalize" welfare agencies and to
boost supplementary pension schemes. Overall, it aims to get the
budget deficit down to just 0.1 percent of gross domestic product
by 2003, cutting public debt below 100 percent of GDP by the same
year.
</P>
<P>
The government motion on the blueprint also includes an
explicit request for moves with Italy's European Union partners to
review the criteria for evaluating how members of the euro zone
calculate their deficits.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of deficit to GDP is a key factor in membership of
the euro zone, whose members are governed by a Stability and
Growth Pact designed to ensure that they maintain their finances
within the euro zone's requirements.
</P>
<P>
According to the motion, given the euro zone's economic
stability and low inflation, the pact should be revised to exclude
from the reckoning public expenditure to stoke growth.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Italy to Cut Number of Ministries to Twelve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Italian cabinet Thursday evening
approved a reform that will eventually cut the number of
ministries from eighteen to twelve.
</P>
<P>
The reform will be made by incorporating some ministries into
others, merging some with others, and getting rid of some.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema has been a strong
proponent of the move as a way of achieving a more wildly and
efficient executive.
</P>
<P>
No changes are envisaged for the interior, foreign, justice,
agriculture and defense ministries.
</P>
<P>
Two economic ministries will be created, one merging the
Treasury and finance ministries, the other merging the
communications, industry, farm and foreign trade ministries.
</P>
<P>
Two other new ministries "for the territory" will be set up to
incorporate environment, transport, public works with navigation
and land protection with infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
The education ministry will be merged with that of universities
and scientific research, and there will be a single ministry for
cultural activities and the cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
The health ministry will be merged with the labor and social
policy ministries.
</P>
<P>
Alongside the ministries, twelve new agencies will spring up to
speed the wheels of government.
</P>
<P>
The reform will come into effect with the next legislature but
some effects such as the reforms of the finance and education
ministries and the creation of new agencies are expected to take
place sooner.

<HEADLINE> Another British GM Crop Test Site Attacked by Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- British police confirmed Thursday
that a test site of genetically-modified (GM) oilseed rape in
northern England has been damaged by environmental activists, the
second such attack in Britain in a week.
</P>
<P>
The 2.5 acre crop, near Malton, North Yorkshire, was damaged on
Wednesday, the police said. The test site was trampled by foot or
something being dragged across the crop.
</P>
<P>
A person claiming to be an activist rang two local newspapers
claiming responsibility for the destruction, and a farm manager
confirmed the damage.
</P>
<P>
Farmer Robert Hambridge, who owns the field, said that the
protesters had "spoiled a very useful trial", the results of which
are believed to be answering some of the questions in the current
debate about GM crops.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't set up for commercial purposes, it was for the
environment, to see the effect of GM crops," Hambridge was quoted
by a BBC report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The attack comes after police arrested at least 20 people in
eastern England on Monday after Greenpeace activists destroyed
half a test crop of genetically modified maize.

WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- At least nine people were

City of Georgia State in the United States Thursday, reports

Mayor Bill Campbell said four of the fatalities were in the

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell sharply
Thursday as a government report on wage rise triggered fears about
higher interest rates among investors.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 180.78 at
10,791.29. The blue index fell as much as 258.04 in the session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also sharply lower. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 24.37 at 1,341.03 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 65.83 at 2,640.01.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged as the Labor Department reported that its
Employment Cost Index rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter, the
bigger-than-expected rise after a 0.4 percent increase in the
first quarter. The index is considered the best measure of changes
in wages and benefit costs.
</P>
<P>
Investors feared that The Federal Reserve would use the data as
a reason for raising interest rates to curb inflation. The Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan told the House Banking Committee
last week that if new data suggest that the pace of increase in
labor cost and price will be picking up, the Federal Reserve will
have to act "promptly and forcefully" to prevent any revival of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Concerned with the data release, investors did not get any
pleasure from the other report on GDP. The Commerce Department
said in the report U.S. economic growth slowed abruptly to 2.3
percent in the second quarter, showing no overheating in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 9.59 at 630.81 and the American
Stock Exchange index fell 5.01 at 784.59. The Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 5.09 at 441.58.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,250 down, 799 up and 497
unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 762.00 million shares from 688.93

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The stability pact for the Balkans
that will be launched in Sarajevo Friday should put the accent on
reinforcing ties between the area's countries, Italian diplomatic
sources said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Italian news agency of ANSA, quoting Italian diplomatic
sources, said that Italy has been particularly active in trying to
set concrete goals for the gathering-both at an international
level with its Group of Eight partners, and at a domestic level,
involving all the government departments concerned.
</P>
<P>
Italy wants to highlight certain guidelines, starting with the
need to start concrete forms of inter-regional cooperation by
building on existing cooperation and aid programs, the Italian
foreign ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
In Italy's view, the Sarajevo summit should lay out, in its
final statement, a clear picture of the concrete moves to be taken
over the coming months.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Seize Strategic Hill in Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
Friday occupied a strategic hill on the third day of its summer
offensive against the rival Northern Alliance bases north of
capital Kabul.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Afghan Islamic Press quoted a spokesman for
opposition commander Ahmad Shah Masoon as saying that the Barekab
height overlooking the Bagram airbase fell to the Taliban, who
were now just six kilometers away from the airbase.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman promised a "bloody fight" in the coming days as
the Taliban had advanced about seven kilometers on the so-called
New Road leading to the opposition-held Bagram and Qara Bagh
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban Friday also launched two attacks on the Kohistan
district from Nejrab, which were repulsed by the Northern
Alliance, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban occupied Nejrab on the first day of their
offensive. Nejrab is the seventh known entry to the Panjsher
valley, the stronghold of Masood, former defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the Taliban warplanes bombed
Charikar, capital of the Parwan province, Kohistan and other
adjoining areas.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban were reported to be advancing on Charikar from the
Pul-e-Matak side after crossing the Ghorband pass.
</P>
<P>
The AIP said that the Taliban forces suffered heavy casualties
in their attack on the Bagram airbase as the area was heavily
mined. At least 50 people from both sides were killed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the AIP said that the Taliban have launched a major
offensive against the Mahmoud Raqi, the opposition-controlled
capital of northern Lapisa province.
</P>
<P>
Other reports reaching here from Kabul said that most of the
Masood forces have retreated from the strategic Bagram airbase
north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The opposition troops have taken positions to the north and
west of the airbase while the Taliban forces were advancing from
the eastern and southern sides, said the reports.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income Rises 0.7 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. personal income rose in
June and outpaced spending for the first time since January.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said Friday that personal income, which
includes wages, interest and government benefits, rose 0.7 percent
last month, the biggest income gain since a 0.9 percent rise in
last November.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spending picked up only 0.3 percent in June, the
smallest increase since November 1998, when spending rose 0.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Since consumer spending has repeatedly outpaced incomes, the
nation's savings rate has set a string of record lows this year.
</P>
<P>
But in June, the savings rate was minus one percent, better
than the record low of negative 1.4 percent set in May.
</P>
<P>
June's 0.7 percent increase in income followed gains of 0.3
percent in May and 0.5 percent in April, while June's 0.3 percent
rise in spending followed increases of 0.6 percent in May and 0.5
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Economists said a major reason for the negative saving rate is
that the strong stock market is boosting Americans' net worth and
making them feel more comfortable about dipping into savings to
pay for their spending spree.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that U.S. wages and
benefits surged in the second quarter of the year by the largest
amount since 1991. The news sent stocks tumbling on investor
worries that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again,
possibly as soon as its August 24 meeting.

<HEADLINE> Annan Sends Message to Sarajevo Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan said on Friday that the Stability Pact Summit taking place
in Sarajevo today marks a new beginning in the efforts of the
international community to end the Balkan wars of this century.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief delivered the message through Carl Bildt, his special
Balkan envoy. "After a decade of conflict that has taken us from
Croatia and Bosnia to Kosovo, we have now returned to Sarajevo with
a strong determination to achieve lasting peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"With this meeting, and with the extraordinary attention and
dedication devoted to overcoming the devastating results of the last
of the Balkan wars, the international community has the opportunity
to honor its pledges towards this region, and thereby enable the
peoples of the region to achieve stability in their own lives,"
said Annan who did not attend the Sarajevo summit.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sarajevo meeting will give all efforts of the United
Nations "new inspiration and new initiative" so that "we enter the
new century with renewed faith in lasting peace and prosperity for
the entire region".
</P>
<P>
Leaders from major western countries and Balkan nations and heads
of main international organizations ended the Stability Pact Summit
this afternoon after issuing a Declaration calling for integration of
Balkans into a single European model.
</P>
<P>
The stability pact was initiated and adopted by the European Union,
and agreed in principle by the leaders who participated in the summit.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said in their final declaration that they "welcome and
support the appointment of Mr. Bodo Hombach as the Special Coordinator
of the Stability Pact by the Council of the European Union, as
endorsed by the Chairman in Office of the OSCE (Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe)".
</P>
<P>
"We pledge our full cooperation to the Special Coordinator in the
achievement of our objectives," they said.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-Hui Should Not Be Insincere: Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Lee Teng-hui can countermand his "
two States" statement, but he should not act shamelessly in going
back on his own word, according to a signed article released here
today by the Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Lee denied that he had made the "two States" statement when he
talked to a Japanese scholar attending a seminar in Taiwan on July
26, and assumed an air of being treated wrongly, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Actually, on July 9 in an interview with a German radio station,
Lee said that cross-Straits relations should be defined as "state-
to-state or at least special state-to-state relations."
</P>
<P>
Then why did Lee Teng-hui deny what he had said? People can
find the answer in the opposition voiced by the international
community and people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits after Lee
's "two States" statement was dished out, the article says.
</P>
<P>
A great number of countries have reiterated their stance of
adhering to the "One China" policy and opposing the "two States"
statement. United States President Bill Clinton talked with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, reaffirming the U.S.'s steadfast
commitment to the "One China" policy and guaranteeing that the U.S.
policy remains unchanged. Some American politicians and portions
of the press criticized Lee as a "trouble maker" and a man who "
rocks the boat," and called his "two States" statement an "act of
provocation."
</P>
<P>
Because Lee still clings to the "two States" statement, all his
arguments speak insincerely and are, of course, unconvincing. He
failed to touch the crucial point: that his "two States" statement
is a negation of the "One China" principle, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
There is only a way out for Lee Teng-hui. That is to
countermand the "two States" statement, acknowledge his mistake,
and openly declare that he will not violate the "One China"
principle, the article concludes.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts Seminar Condemning  Lee Teng-hui's "Two-States" Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A seminar, attended by members of
the Beijing Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), members of Democratic Parties,
persons with no party affiliation, and representatives of Beijing-
based Taiwan compatriots, was held here today to condemn Lee Teng-
hui's separatist "two-states" statement.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Taiwan authorities must immediately stop
separatists activities and back to the policy of adhering to the "
One China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Xia Chao, deputy-director of the subcommittee of Hong Kong,
Macao, Taiwan, and Overseas Chinese Affairs of the CPPCC Beijing
Committee, pointed out that under the pressure of the
international communities, Lee has now begun using deception in an
attempt to cover his true nature.
</P>
<P>
Sophism just will not save Lee Teng-hui, nor can the Chinese
people at home and abroad be fooled, he said, adding that the only
way for Lee Teng-hui is to abandon the "two-states" statement and
resume the policy of adhering to the "One China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Weiying, associate professor at People's University in
Beijing, said that Lee's separatist remarks act against not only
the principle on a sovereign state according to law of nations,
but also the local law of Taiwan, which is based on the "One China
" policy.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jinfeng, a native of Taiwan who returned to the mainland
in the 1980s, said that more and more people in Taiwan are
realizing Lee's true nature as a separatist. Zhang believes that
the majority of Taiwan people maintain the tradition of patriotism
and desire China's peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Su Minsheng, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of
Taiwan Compatriots, and many other seminar participants, noted
that further strengthening of exchanges and cooperation across the
Straits is the common will of both the Chinese people in the
mainland and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that the Chinese government intends to resolve
the issue of Taiwan in a timely manner. Attempts to split Taiwan
from the motherland will never prevail, Chinese territory and
sovereignty can never be separated, and the cause of China's unity
can never be damaged.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Erodes Purchasing Power of Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The persistently high levels of
inflation in Zimbabwe have significantly eroded the purchasing
power of the Zimbabwean dollar and has led to increases of cash in
settling domestic trade transactions, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The upsurge in the demand for cash by the public is linked to
rising inflation, which increased year-on-year from 20.1 percent
in December, 1997 to 46.6 percent by the end of 1998 and further
to 55.2 percent in June, 1999," the central bank said in its
weekly Economic Highlights.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the rising demand for cash, currency issued by
the bank had correspondingly risen.
</P>
<P>
The demand for currency, which was stable prior to 1997, had
risen significantly in the last one-and-half years due to
inflation.
</P>
<P>
This represented annual growth rates of 25.6 percent and 47.2
percent in December, 1998 and May, 1999 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bank said although confidence in the use of cheques and
electronic money had increased substantially, some retailers and
merchants still insisted on cash to settle transactions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bank said, some wholesalers and retailers were
cutting down on long-term credit thereby increasing the need for
consumers to carry more cash.
</P>
<P>
The bank said most economic agents hedged against inflation by
investing in real assets.
</P>
<P>
It said high domestic inflation also encouraged economic agents
to hold foreign currency, not only as a store of value, but also
as a means of making domestic payments.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Moves to Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has instituted
measures to reduce poverty and curb crime in the country, chief
government spokesman Newstead Zimba said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Among the steps the government has taken is to strengthen the
agriculture sector so that all categories of farmers' produce
surplus are for sale, said Zimba, who is also Information
Minister.
</P>
<P>
The government is encouraging the private sector and the Food
Reserve Agency to make agricultural inputs such as seeds and
fertilizers available to the farmers in good time for the farmers
to produce good yields, he said.
</P>
<P>
The farmers will be exempted from paying duty on imported
agricultural machinery in order to help them boost production.
</P>
<P>
Zimba appealed on all able-bodied Zambians, especially the
youth, to take advantage of the conducive environment to engage in
productive farming.
</P>
<P>
"I call upon the youth especially to take this challenge
seriously. They do not need to start big, but in a small way," the
minister said, adding poverty reduction will help in curbing crime
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Deny Osama Leaving Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
Friday denied press reports that Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden
wanted the United States is planning to leave the country, said
the News Network International of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"It is an absolutely baseless report that Osama has either left
or is planning to leave Afghanistan," Maulvi Wakil Ahmed
Mutawakil, Taliban senior spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Afghan Islamic Press reported that Osama has
decided to leave Afghanistan fearing the United States might
attack the country.
</P>
<P>
Similar mixed messages had been heard from the Taliban on Osama
earlier this month as Maulvi admitted that the alleged terrorist
was still in Afghanistan only one day after Taliban supreme leader
Mulla Mohammad Omar rejected any knowledge about Osama's
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
Accused by the United Stated of masterminding the bomb blasts
at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August, Osama was
announced missing in February this year.
</P>
<P>
However, he was reported late June to have been seen in the
eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad and then the Taliban said he was
still in the country and under tight security.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been demanding the extradition of Osama
but the Taliban ruled out that possibility.
</P>
<P>
The latest rumors said Osama has expressed his desire to leave
Afghanistan and the Taliban have endorsed his decision.
</P>
<P>
On hearing the news, thousands of Afghan people Friday held
rallies and demonstrations in the eastern Afghan cities of Khost
and Jalalabad to protest against the U.S. policy on Osama, saying
that they would not hand their "guest" Osama over to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The United States stuck Khost with cruise missiles last August
following bomb blasts at its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Western Leaders Meet in Sarajevo on Balkan Stability Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from the 15 European
Union (EU) member states and 13 other countries gathered here
Friday to start discussions on the proposed Stability Pact for
Southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, whose country holds the
current rotating European Union (EU) presidency, said that the
proposed Southeast Europe Stability Pact envisions a Europe at
long last "undivided, prosperous and free, a Europe where war
becomes unthinkable."
</P>
<P>
"Let this vision guide our talks today," he said when giving
his opening speech as chairperson of the summit.
</P>
<P>
"Southeastern Europe has been in the focus of international
attention because of the crises and tensions associated with it in
the past decade. everyone has felt the destabilizing and
demoralizing effects of practicing ideologies of hatred,
intolerance and violence," Ahtisaari said.
</P>
<P>
"It is no coincidence that today's summit meeting is being held
here in Sarajevo. This city, which has taken its place in the
history of our century, is now being called upon to help launch a
new millennium," Ahtisaari said. "You all know the symbolic value
of this venue."
</P>
<P>
Ante Jelavic, chairman of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency,
said the stability pact to be adopted by the summit will enable
all the countries in the region to join Euro-Atlantic integration,
particularly the EU and the Partnership for Peace program.
</P>
<P>
"I also think that today's inauguration of the Stability Pact
will immutably change the way of communication between the
countries in the region, as well as the global attitude towards
the region of Southeastern Europe," Jelavic said.
</P>
<P>
"This new mode of cooperation and a strong integration
dimension will permanently end the cycle of brutal conflicts that
have characterized the region so far," he added.
</P>
<P>
The stability pact for Southeast Europe was agreed by major
western powers in June. Attending the summit are leaders from the
15 EU member states, nine non-EU European countries, the United
States, Canada, Japan and Russia, as well as major international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, leaders from the EU and the Balkan countries held
a brief meeting on the Germany-proposed pact, which has already
been endorsed by most Balkan countries.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Has Tight Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A recent investigation by the
Chongqing Public Security Bureau in southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality shows that Falun Gong is a well-organized and fast-
acting illegal cult.
</P>
<P>
The organization of Falun Gong in Chongqing has five layers:
the general station, sub-branches, first-level instruction centers,
second-level instruction centers, and exercising centers.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi, founder of Falun Gong, appointed the head of the
general station who named his two deputies.
</P>
<P>
The general station has three sub-branches, each with a
director and an executive deputy director.
</P>
<P>
The three sub-branches have 56 first- and second-level
instruction centers, and 890 exercising centers. The five layers
of organization have 358 leaders, and each layer has its own
division of work, the investigation reveals.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong practitioners have besieged some news media
organizations in Chongqing on many occasions beginning last year.
All these activities were under the control of the Li Hongzhi's
Falun Dafa Research Society (FDRS) in Beijing and instigated and
directly led by the general station in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The investigation proves that the dispatch and deployment of
local Falun Gong practitioners and their final retreat were
organized by the Chongqing general station and the FDRS in Beijing
through instructions sent via phone calls and faxes.
</P>
<P>
Under such tight organization, Falun Gong followers are easily
made use of by Li Hongzhi, said a senior official of the Chongqing
Public Security Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. Over Destruction of Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has protested to the United
Nations over the destruction of the samples of VX gas found in the
Baghdad laboratory of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
disarming Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A four-member U.N. technical team, charged with destroying or
removing toxic chemicals left behind by UNSCOM when it pulled out
of Iraq last December on the eve of a massive U.S.-British
airstrikes on Iraq, destroyed the samples on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said the U.N. unreasonably rejected
Iraq's demand to keep the samples for investigation of what Iraq
accused as UNSCOM's frame-up against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM announced in 1998 there were traces of VX on parts of
Iraqi missile warheads fragments.
</P>
<P>
A United States army lab said in July, 1998 its tests on Iraqi
missile fragments proved the charge, while a similar test in a
French lab was considered inconclusive and the results of a Swiss
examination were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi media have accused UNSCOM of having contaminated the
missile fragments with the VX samples, a suspicion raised by
Russia, China and France.
</P>
<P>
Iraq charged that the U.S. and Britain opposed the analysis of
the VX samples for fear that the UNSCOM plot be uncovered.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the U.N. team was defined on the basis of a
letter sent to the Security Council by former UNSCOM chairman
Richard Butler, an Australian who was accused by Iraq of spying
for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the U.N. Security Council members refused to
amend the mandate to include analysis of the VX gas samples found
in the UNSCOM laboratory
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in his letter that the U.N.'s refusal to change the
team's original mandate," despite that new truth had been
revealed," caused harm to the credibility and impartiality of the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
He requested that a neutral professional team with diplomats
representing the Security Council be sent to check everything
existed in UNSCOM headquarters in Baghdad "in order to get
acquainted with all the facts."

</P>
<P>
The population is estimated at 146 million as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
The number of new births in January-May dropped to 507,300 as

</P>
<P>
The number of marriages posted a slight increase during the

</P>
<P>
Fewer people entered Russia during the five months. A total of
134,000 people arrived in Russia from abroad compared to 202,000

percent from last year's figure of 129,300.
</P>
<P>
Valentina Matviyenko, deputy prime minister in charge of

<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A commentary released here today
by the Xinhua News Agency said that only by outlawing illegal
organizations in accordance with law can social and political
stability be achieved and the interests of the overwhelming
majority of Chinese be safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
Facts have demonstrated that the Falun Gong organization
controlled by Li Hongzhi is a tightly organized cult, the
commentary said, its supreme organ in China is the Falun Dafa
Research Society (FDRS) in Beijing. Under the FDRS, there are 39
general stations, 1,900 instruction centers, and 28,000 exercising
sites. Li Hongzhi sent his instructions through these general
stations, instructions centers, and exercising sites.
</P>
<P>
However, this large and tightly run organization failed to go
through any legitimate registration procedures. Therefore, it has
violated China's Constitution and the regulation on citizen
associations, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The illegal activities of Falun Gong such as spreading
superstition and stirring up disturbances have also violated the
country's regulation that social organizations should abide by the
Constitution and avoid harming the interests of the State and
deviating from social morality, the commentary concluded.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down On Illegal Foreign Exchange Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said today that a massive operation
carried out by related departments against illegal foreign
exchange trading has achieved initial results.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the SAFE said that by the end of June, more
than 260 people engaged in illegal foreign exchange trading had
been seized and more than 50 trading sites smashed, as law-
enforcement departments confiscated large sums of money used for
illegal trading.
</P>
<P>
Since China reformed its foreign exchange system in 1994, the
exchange rate of the yuan has been rectified, and foreign
exchanges are settled in banks with the currency convertible under
current accounts.
</P>
<P>
"The normal demand for foreign exchange by institutions and
individuals in China can be satisfied under the new system," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, lawless persons engaged in smuggling, tax
swindling, and money laundering have been found to use the black
market to obtain foreign exchange for their unlawful activities,
seriously disrupting the country's economic and financial order.
</P>
<P>
To stop such illegal practices, the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, China's top legislature, in December
1998 passed a decision to crack down on illegal foreign exchange
trading and to punish such crimes.
</P>
<P>
The operation was launched last April jointly by the SAFE, the
Ministry of Public Security, and the State Administration for
Industry and Commerce, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government's efforts in fighting against
illegal foreign exchange trading will not end as long as the black

<HEADLINE> IMF Praises Spain for Its Successful Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on Friday praised Spain's economic policies but expressed
anxiety about the country's high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"Executive directors praised the authorities for their
sustained implementation, over a long period, of coordinated
fiscal, monetary, and structural policies that had led to Spain's
becoming a founding member of the European Monetary Union (EMU),"
the IMF said in an annual review of the Spanish economy.
</P>
<P>
"These policies, and the attendant credibility gains, had
created a virtuous circle of strong growth and fiscal
consolidation, with inflation being reduced to historically low
levels," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
But the IMF said the unemployment rate was still at a
"worrisomely high level and remains Spain's most pressing economic
problem."
</P>
<P>
While noting that the labor market reforms of 1994 and 1997
were positive developments, the IMF urged the government to take
additional actions in creating new jobs. It forecast a 16.8
percent unemployment rate for this year, down from 18.8 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The IMF welcomed the authorities' commitment to eliminate the
fiscal deficit by 2002 and their intention to achieve this through
"restraint" in primary current expenditures.
</P>
<P>
"(Directors) were confident that Spain was well placed to
achieve these medium-term fiscal objectives," the IMF said.

<HEADLINE> Team Halti Claims Outdoor Quest Lead (Corrected) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALI, China, July 30 (Xinhua) -- On a day when athletes learned
the true spirit of adventuring racing, Team Halti took the lead
here at the Mild Seven Outdoor Quest on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Every team but Halti -- a team highly experienced in offroad
navigation -- missed a crucial turnaround point during the run
course. Halti was still awarded the stage victory, but the run
section of the race was excluded from total race standings.
</P>
<P>
"we regret the error in course making," Executive Race Director
Nick Freyer said in a post-race statement. "It would not happen
again."
</P>
<P>
The decision of Freyer and race director Murphy Reinschreiber
was that Day Two competition officially ended after the opening
mountain bike biathlon and offroad inline skating phases --
roughly two-and-a-half hours of intense racing.
</P>
<P>
With two days to go, a half-dozen teams stand a legitimate
chance of claiming victory when the event concludes on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Team Eco-Internet, who won the first-day competition on
Thursday, stood second with nine minutes behind Halti. Team Red
Bull-Buff of Spain is third.
</P>
<P>
Team Mild Seven, the top Chinese squad bounced back from a
disappointing showing on Day One and came seventh overall at 9:32:
48. Their incredible cycling, running and paddling skills mean
they stand in solid position to catch the leaders during Day Three
's 12 hours of competition.
</P>
<P>
Beginning at the majestic South Gate of Dali, teams competed in
a blazing-fast mountain bike biathlon leg, then switched into
offroad inline skates for another intense stage inside the Old
City.
</P>
<P>
Team Halti opened up a six-minute lead over Eco-Internet,
completely erasing a five-minute deficit from the opening day.
</P>
<P>
Shedding their skates, they quickly began another grueling
mountain bike biathlon stage that took athletes out of Dali to the
shores of Lake Erhai. From there, the plan of race organizers was
for athletes to leave their bikes behind and head up into the
mountains for 15 kilometers of trail running.
</P>
<P>
In traditional adventure racing, courses are not marked and
contestants depend on map and compass skills to navigate. But Mild
Seven Outdoor Quest officials prefer to keep the emphasis on pure
endurance competition and thus rigorously mark their courses.
</P>
<P>
While Halti had read the maps studiously prior to beginning Day
Two, other teams had not. So While Halti did the proper thing and
turned around at the crucial moment several kilometers into the
run, other teams did not. Rather than penalize teams for
continuing on the course, race organizers accepted all blame and
disallowed the run section of the course.
</P>
<P>
Halti, which saw their lead reduced from 37 minutes to nine,
took the news well. "We are all very tired now, " Halti's Mika
Hirvinen said. "We liked it a lot -- the scenery, the mental
challenge -- but it was very, very hard today. Right now we have
to put this behind and move on, because Day Three will be very
difficult."

<HEADLINE> 67 Percent Nigerians Below Poverty Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Poverty level in Nigeria has jumped
to a worrisome rate of 67 percent of its population from the 1960
figure of 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express newspaper Friday quoted government official as
saying that no concerted efforts had really been made in tackling
the roots of poverty by previous governments in the country
despite their various ad hoc policies and programs.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Joda, chairman of the Presidential Panel on Streamlining
and Rationalization of Poverty Alleviation Institutions and
Agencies, also lamented in Ibadan, capital of Nigeria's Oyo
state Thursday that the drastic reduction in the standard of
living arises from people's inability to get good food, potable
water, education, medical facilities and high rate of
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
According to Joda, who is on a working trip in the state, it
was in view of the array of problems in the society that President
Olusegun Obasanjo decided to set up the panel "so as to address
and coordinate solutions in a fashionable way."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the determination of the present
administration to provide basic social amenities for the benefit
of the masses.
</P>
<P>
Oyo state Governor Lam Adesina, when talking with him, remarked
that no poverty alleviation program put in place by the federal
government would yield its desired result until the state
governments are given their equitable shares of the Federation
Account.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigerians would continue to be impoverished if the
federal government continued to hold on to the lion's share of the
Federation Account and give only pittance to the states.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has dropped from the list of world's top 50 richest
countries into the poorest 20 since its independence in 1960.
It's widely believed that rampant corruption and mis-management
of its economy lie in the root of the west African country's
deepening poverty.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: "Rebuild Friendly Relations" With West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Friday that it is
a "strategic" task for Russia to "rebuild friendly relations" with
Western countries which were ruined after NATO's air strikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yeltsin said, Moscow would continue to stick to the
principle of a multipolar world. "We are fighting for this and
will not go back on it."
</P>
<P>
The "Yugoslav situation" should be "evened out" and Russia
should "rebuild the friendly relations with the United States,
Germany, France and other states that we had before," Yeltsin said
in the Kremlin before meeting with Russian Pension Fund Chairman
Mikhail Zurabov.
</P>
<P>
That is a "strategic, global task," the Interfax news agency
quoted Yeltsin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia froze its ties with NATO after the alliance launched
the 78-day bombing campaign against Yugoslavia and relations
plunged to their lowest ebb since the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Yeltsin, who returned to work
earlier this week after cutting short his summer vacation, had
called for relations with the West to be repaired in full.

<HEADLINE> China's Information Industry Sees Fast Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wu told a meeting that economic returns and service quality in
the industry have both been improved.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the January-June period, the turnover
of the post and telecommunication sector totaled 148.1 billion
yuan, up 32 percent over the same period last year, while the
electronics sector grew 25.7 percent to complete an added value of
36.67 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, the country completed
fixed assets investment of 38.8 billion yuan in postal and
telecommunications projects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the balance of postal savings deposits had
increased by a year-on-year 19.3 percent to reach 340.5 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the policy of adjusting average
telecommunications charges this March, especially the slashing of
installment fees on fixed phones, helped stimulate a surge in
business volume.
</P>
<P>
On July 19, China Telecom declared that it had 100 million
fixed-telephone customers.
</P>
<P>
The turnover in the mobile phone sector jumped 87 percent on a
year-on-year basis to reach 66.59 billion yuan during the period,
accounting for 47.8 percent of the total turnovers in
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The reform on China Telecom is also underway. By the end of
June, 27 provinces and municipalities had completed the separation
of mobile telecommunications from China Telecom branches.
</P>
<P>
Wu admitted that some difficulties still exist in the industry,
citing a slower growth of fixed-assets investment, and an upturn
in losses in the electronics industry.

<HEADLINE> Negotiations on Merger of HK Exchanges Conclude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
(SEHK) and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange (HKFE) Friday reached an
agreement on the terms of the merger of the two exchanges and
their associated clearing houses into the Hong Kong Exchanges and
Clearing Limited (HKEC).
</P>
<P>
The two exchanges, together with the HKEC, Friday jointly
announced the proposals for the terms of the merger, under which
the exchanges and clearing houses will become wholly owned
subsidiaries of HKEC.
</P>
<P>
The proposals will now be put to the shareholders of the
exchanges for their approval.
</P>
<P>
HKEC has agreed that no new eligibility to trading rights will
be granted for two years from the date that the proposals become
effective.
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, in the third and fourth years, no new eligibility
to trading rights will be granted by HKEC for less than 3 million
HK dollars (384,615 U.S. dollars) for the cash market and 1.5
million HK dollars (192,308 U.S. dollars) for the futures market.
</P>
<P>
The current SEHK and HKFE shareholders will also be able to
transfer their eligibility to trading rights, once only, for a
period of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposals, SEHK and HKFE shareholders will be offered
shares in HKEC and the opportunity to receive cash in place of
some or all of the shares in HKEC to which they are entitled,
subject to the overall aggregate limits on the amount of cash
being made available respectively to the shareholders of the two
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The consideration under the proposals represents an exchange
ratio as between SEHK and HKFE members of 70:30, respectively.
</P>
<P>
SEHK Council members and the directors of the HKFE believe that
the combination of the exchanges and clearing companies under HKEC
will reinforce Hong Kong's strength and competitiveness in the
international financial markets and is in line with the global
trend towards consolidation in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Both exchanges' ruling bodies believe that the market reform as
proposed by the Financial Secretary of the government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region is vital to the future
development of Hong Kong's financial services industry and that it
will be critical to maintain and strengthen Hong Kong's position
as a global financial center in the increasingly competitive
international securities and derivatives market.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his welcome to the agreement, Acting Financial
Secretary Rafael Hui of the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
said that this is no doubt an "all-win" scenario. Merger by
commercial terms will bring the greatest amount of benefits to the
members of the Exchanges as well as the market as a whole, Hui
added.
</P>
<P>
Hui urged the two chairmen to continue to lead the exchanges to
proceed as speedily as possible and put the proposals to their
members for voting by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will continue with the preparation of the
necessary legislative work with a view to introducing the
legislation into the Legislative Council in mid-October. This will
enable the timely implementation of the demutualization and merger.
</P>
<P>
"The government will also continue to provide all possible
assistance to the parties concerned to facilitate the early
implementation of the transaction," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
The merger of the two exchanges and their associated clearing
houses is a major component of the market structure reform
announced by the Financial Secretary in his Budget Speech in March.
</P>
<P>
The government is determined to achieve the objectives of the
reform in order to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong as a
global financial center.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Spokesman Refutes Taiwan's Distortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) has rejected a written speech by
Koo Chen-fu sent by the Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
today, saying it seriously violates the "One China" principle
already reached by both sides of the Taiwan Straits in 1992.
</P>
<P>
According to an ARATS official, ARATS President Wang Daohan
made a speech on July 12, demanding that his counterpart, Koo Chen-
fu, chairman of the SEF, clarify Li Teng-hui's and his own remarks
on redefining the relations of the two sides as "state-to-state"
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities made no response for 18 days, and this
afternoon faxed ARATS a letter and a written speech by Koo Chen-fu,
which preached more fallacies on the "special state-to-state
relations," the official said.
</P>
<P>
This once again lays bare the attempts of Lee Teng-hui to cling
to splittism. His acts have seriously deteriorated cross-Straits
relations and destroyed the basis of contacts and dialogue between
ARATS and SEF. Lee Teng-hui should bear full responsibility for
all the consequences arising from this, the ARATS official said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China, said in a speech delivered in 1995, "On
the premise that 'There is only one China,' we are prepared to
talk about any matter." However, Koo's speech intentionally
distorted and garbled Jiang's statement and dodged the "One China"
principle, the official said.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that there is only one China in the world
and Taiwan is a part of China. The government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing
the whole of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both the "two states" theory and "special state-to-state
relations" preached by Lee Teng-hui are opposed by the Chinese
people and can't be accepted by the international community, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
"We as always advocate that the "One China" policy should be
adhered to in handling cross-Straits relations, especially in
negotiations between the two sides, before realizing reunification
of the motherland. China's sovereignty and territorial integrity
brooks no separation. Only under the "One China" principle can the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits talk about reunification on the
basis of equality," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan racked its brains in vain in describing the
understanding by both sides of the Taiwan Straits on "adhering to
the 'One China' policy" as "One China with different oral
explanation," he concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A series of books exposing the
true face of Falun Gong, and publicizing atheism and historical
materialism have been released by several publishing houses
including the People's Publishing House and the People's Fine Arts
Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of books are "Circular of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China on Forbidding Party Members to
Practice Falun Dafa," "True Face of Falun Gong Unveiled," "On Li
Hongzhi's Malicious Fallacies," "The Harm of Falun Gong," "Life
and Times of Li Hongzhi," "Well-Known Articles on Atheism," and "
Knowledge of Materialism and Atheism."
</P>
<P>
All of these books have made a direct analysis of the true face
of Li Hongzhi's fallacies and malicious cult. The book "On Li
Hongzhi's Malicious Fallacies" considers 110 of Li's main points,
and refutes them as being hypocritical and misleading.
</P>
<P>
And "True Face of Falun Gong unveiled" analyses the process by
which Li turned from a "master" to a cheat, demonstrating Falun
Gong's great harm to society.

<HEADLINE> UN Officials: Situation in Kosovo Needs to be Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sarajevo, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Senior United Nations officials
agreed here Friday that situation in Kosovo needs to be improved
and they have to do their best to make things better there.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Paul Klein, special representative designated by the UN
secretary-general, told reporters that UN Balkan officials
attending the Stability Pact Summit here agreed that the Kosovo
issue is crucial and they will be doing everything to help Bernard
Kouchner, UN Interim Administrator of Kosovo, in doing the
daunting job there.
</P>
<P>
"But we cannot deflect attention from the real challenges that
remain elsewhere in the region. And I think we have all taken note
of the fact that the problems associated with the dissolution of
the former Yugoslavia cannot be created in a piecemeal fashion,
and that they require resolution in a broader European context,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have made real progress, but the road is long, the scars
are deep, and the needs are great," Klein added.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Stability Pact is "a new way of thinking, a
new approach, and a new context." It is the promise of the Balkans
' future integration into Europe, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Stability Pact for Southeast Europe, which was agreed by
major Western powers in June, is being launched today. The
Stability Pact Summit here involves the 15 European Union member
states, nine non-EU European countries, plus the United States,
Canada, Japan and Russia, as well as major international
organizations.

<HEADLINE> The Awakening of A Falun Gong Practitioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Yi, former deputy chief of Falun Gong's guidance station in
Zhucheng City, had been deeply involved in the organization.
Though advised to leave, he found himself unable to disentangle
himself from the group.
</P>
<P>
The Party's publication of its policies on Falun Gong, and the
exposures of Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi's true face, finally
woke him up.
</P>
<P>
"Is Master Li really that respectable," he now asks himself and
his fellow practitioners. Li falsified his date of birth to
coincide with that of Sakyamuni, masterminded his followers'
besieging of Zhongnanhai, the seat of the central government, but
denied he had played any role in this incident.
</P>
<P>
"These two things have made me realize that Li Hongzhi is
really a hypocrite. And where can we find the 'truthfulness,
benevolence, and tolerance' he has been preaching?"
</P>
<P>
Promoters claim that Falun Gong helps cure people's illnesses.
"I had practiced Falun Gong for four years, but there was no
improvement of my skin disease," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the guise of spreading Falun Gong, Li Hongzhi instigated
practitioners to besiege the Party and government headquarters. "
He pushed us into direct opposition to the government, and hurt us
greatly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Yi pleaded for his fellow practitioners to wake up
immediately and stop doing the absurd and being fooled by Li
Hongzhi and his malicious fallacies.
</P>
<P>
In another development, more than 127,000 people in north China
's Hebei Province have made a clear break with Falun Gong and its
malicious cult over the past week. So far, all of the Falun Gong
instruction stations in the province have been closed. More than
149,000 books, 71,000 pieces of publicity materials, 18,000
pictures, and over 10,000 audio and video tapes related to Falun
Gong have been confiscated.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Jiangsu Province, the majority of key Falun
Gong members are reported to have quit the organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 18 people were killed and
477 injured in a gale storm on July 28 in southwest China's
Sichuan Province, which also resulted in economic losses of 340
million yuan (about 41 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report from the provincial government,
most parts of Sichuan were hit by moderate to strong gales,
coupled with hail and rainstorms in some areas, two days ago,
affecting 4.3 million people in 16 cities and 50 counties across
the province.
</P>
<P>
The disaster also destroyed 200,000 houses, and 6,500 meters of
electric lines. At the same time, the gale hit 220,000 hectares of
crop land, causing the loss of 43 million kilos of grain, said a
local official.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, because of timely forecasts a few hours before the
storm, governments in a number of cities discharged some 1,800
shells to dissipate the hailstone clouds, considerably decreasing
losses, the official said.

</P>
<P>
The subsequent phases would involve divestiture of share
holdings in hotels, the country's five assembly plants, the four
refineries, the monopolies in the sectors of electricity and
telecommunications and the national airline.
</P>
<P>
The government's privatization program had been suspended by
the last military government after allegations that it was being
rushed to reward cronies and retired military officers.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said the council, which includes the ministers of
finance, justice, industry and the governor of the Central Bank,
would help improve the performance of state-owned companies and
stanch losses incurred in subsidizing them.
</P>
<P>
The president estimated the country had lost about 1.4 billion
U.S. dollars every year to "poor services" rendered by the
national electricity monopoly and inefficient fuel distribution.
</P>
<P>
"This does not include the human sufferings and losses of lives
due to fuel shortages," Obasanjo said, re-echoing sentiments
contained in his first budget submitted to the national
legislature last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president said citizens have "continued to be blighted by
poor performance" of the companies with performance ranging from
"low returns to outright national disgrace" in spite of
investments of about eight billion dollars in these companies.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the divestiture was intended to achieve the
quick recovery of the social life of the people, adding that the
exercise is expected to affect about 1,000 state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
The president pledged the exercise would be "comprehensive,
transparent and accountable," as the government recognized it as
the key to "reviving public utilities and foreign confidence" in
the economy, prostrate from years of mismanagement.

<HEADLINE> 18 S. African Miners Killed in Underground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen miners have been
confirmed dead in an underground explosion in Mponeng gold mine
southwest of Johannesburg on Thursday evening, local media
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 20 specially-trained rescue workers, who had been working
since the explosion at 6:00 p.m. Thursday, found the eighteenth
body before dawn Friday, South African Press Association (SAPA)
said.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers Friday morning were still looking for "any other
 casualties or survivors," but by mine owner Anglogold's reckoning
there was only one person left unaccounted for, Anglogold
spokesman James Duncan was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We will keep on going flat-out until we are satisfied everyone
is accounted for," Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty miners were lifted to safety Thursday night after the
explosion on 99 level, some 2,700 meters below surface. None of
the 20 were injured.
</P>
<P>
Duncan said the accident occurred as a dangerous gas --
probably methane -- ignited when the men were lengthening a major
access tunnel to a working area.
</P>
<P>
"They detected methane, the alert was given and the evacuation
was underway when the gas ignited."
</P>
<P>
It was unknown what had caused the gas to ignite.
</P>
<P>
He said the 18 men did nothing out of the ordinary and did not
deviate from safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki said in the early hours of
Friday that he was shocked and saddened to learn of the miners'
deaths and expressed his hope that no stone would be left unturned
to determine the exact cause of the disaster, and to determine
whether safety standards were adhered to.
</P>
<P>
"The president extends his heart-felt condolences to bereaved
family members, friends and colleagues," Mbeki's spokesman Ronnie
Mamoepa said before sunrise Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's accident is the worst mining disaster in the history
of Anglogold, the world's biggest gold producer, since 1995 when
104 people were killed in the Vaal Reefs mine west of Johannesburg
when an underground lift plummeted down the mine.

China churned out 1.5 million farm-use vehicles during the half-

Agricultural Machinery Industry Association.

Though the sector registered a 0.6-percent rise in total output
value, which stood at more than 12.7 billion yuan (1.53 billion U.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Angola Defense Minister Kundi
Payama accused South Africa of trying to measure its force with
Angola, the official Angolan news agency Angop reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa takes us for a rival," Payama said, adding that
there doesn't exist any confidence and solidarity between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Payama noted that South Africa regards Angola as main
competitor for regional leadership in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
With regard to South Africa's contribution to efforts to end
the civil war in Angola, Payama said that Angola received little
support from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that South Africa should make effort to
eliminate its hostility toward Angola.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that South Africa, eager to play a major role in
the on- going civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), considered that Angola had the advantage.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate comment from Johannesburg on the Angolan
defense minister's speech.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the civil war in the DRC, Angola and South
Africa have different points of view. Angola sent its troops to
support the legal government led by DRC President Laurent Kabila
while South Africa has been urging the warring parties to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
Payama also criticized Zambia of supporting Jonas Savimbi,
leader of the rebels National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), which Lusaka has denied.

<HEADLINE> China Life, CMG to Form Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China Life Insurance Company and
Austrilian financial services company Colonial Mutual Group (CMG),
announced here today that they had signed a contract to form a
joint venture life insurance company in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The projected joint venture has been approved by the State
Council and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), said
a joint media release faxed to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is expected to commence operation within the
next half year.
</P>
<P>
Chairman and President of the China Life, He Jiesheng said the
joint venture is the culmination of many years' hard work and long-
standing co-operation between the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
"China Life has chosen CMG as its partner because of its
extensive international insurance expertise, particularly its
strong track record of success operating joint venture insurance
businesses in Asia," she said.
</P>
<P>
CMG's Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Peter
Smedley said that CMG is honored to join China Life, China's
largest insurance company, to form the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
"CMG's worldwide business has achieved strong growth and
profitability. We look forward to achieving the same success in
China in conjunction with our partner," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dovish Israeli Minister Objects to Syrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A dovish Israeli minister said
Friday that the Israeli-Syrian talks can not be resumed if Syria
insists on an Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal from the
Golan Heights as the precondition, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, an architect of the historic
Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians, told the
radio that Israel's former Labor governments did not agree to
such a precondition in previous talks with Syria, which broke off
in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that former Israeli governments of prime
ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres had agreed in
negotiations to hand over the whole Golan Heights, a Syrian
plateau seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, and
demanded that the talks be resumed from where they left off.
</P>
<P>
Winning a landslide in the premiership race in the May
election, Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to revive the
peace process both on the Palestinian and Syrian tracks, largely
frozen in the three years of rule by his hard-line predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He has said that he is ready to make necessary territorial
compromises for reaching a comprehensive peace, but has not make
clear to what extent he is prepared to withdraw from the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
His top foreign policy advisers have said that Israel would
agree to pick up the talks from the point where they broke off,
but stressed that it has different interpretation of what the
point is.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Minister without portfolio Haim Ramon also voiced
doubts over the resumption of talks if Syria did not show
flexibility, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy urged the United States Friday to
intensify its efforts to help restart the Israeli negotiations
with Syria as well as with the Palestinians, expressing hope that
a shuttle mission by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
next month would spur progress.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton urged Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad in a letter this week to seize the opportunity for peace
offered by Barak's election victory.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Barak and Assad have exchanged messages
on the resumption of talks through third-party mediators.
Calling the messages "encouraging," Levy urged Damascus to move
beyond verbal signals by opening direct negotiations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Arab Israeli legislator Azmi Bishara
will go to Syria via Amman Saturday for talks with Assad, Israel
Radio said. A delegation of 13 Arab Israeli legislators is
expected to visit Damascus in the near future, the radio
said.

<HEADLINE> Team Halti Claims Overall Mild Seven Outdoor Quest Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALI, China, July 30 (Xinhua) -- On a day when athletes learned
the true spirit of adventuring racing, Team Halti took the lead
here at the Mild Seven Outdoor Quest on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Every team but Halti -- a team highly experienced in offroad
navigation -- missed a crucial turnaround point during the run
course. Halti was still awarded the stage victory, but the run
section of the race was excluded from total race standings.
</P>
<P>
"we regret the error in course making," Executive Race Director
Nick Freyer said in a post-race statement. "It would not happen
again."
</P>
<P>
The decision of Freyer and race director Murphy Reinschreiber
was that Day Two competition officially ended after the opening
mountain bike biathlon and offroad inline skating phases --
roughly two-and-a-half hours of intense racing.
</P>
<P>
With two days to go, a half-dozen teams stand a legitimate
chance of claiming victory when the event concludes on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Team Eco-Internet, who won the first-day competition on
Thursday, stood second with nine minutes behind Halti. Team Red
Bull-Buff of Spain is third.
</P>
<P>
Team Mild Seven, the top Chinese squad bounced back from a
disappointing showing on Day One and came ninth overall, just 19
seconds off Halti's pace. Their incredible cycling, running and
paddling skills mean they stand in solid position to catch the
leaders during Day Three's 12 hours of competition.
</P>
<P>
Beginning at the majestic South Gate of Dali, teams competed in
a blazing-fast mountain bike biathlon leg, then switched into
offroad inline skates for another intense stage inside the Old
City.
</P>
<P>
Team Halti opened up a six-minute lead over Eco-Internet,
completely erasing a five-minute deficit from the opening day.
</P>
<P>
Shedding their skates, they quickly began another grueling
mountain bike biathlon stage that took athletes out of Dali to the
shores of Lake Erhai. From there, the plan of race organizers was
for athletes to leave their bikes behind and head up into the
mountains for 15 kilometers of trail running.
</P>
<P>
In traditional adventure racing, courses are not marked and
contestants depend on map and compass skills to navigate. But Mild
Seven Outdoor Quest officials prefer to keep the emphasis on pure
endurance competition and thus rigorously mark their courses.
</P>
<P>
While Halti had read the maps studiously prior to beginning Day
Two, other teams had not. So While Halti did the proper thing and
turned around at the crucial moment several kilometers into the
run, other teams did not. Rather than penalize teams for
continuing on the course, race organizers accepted all blame and
disallowed the run section of the course.
</P>
<P>
Halti, which saw their lead reduced from 37 minutes to nine,
took the news well. "We are all very tired now, " Halti's Mika
Hirvinen said. "We liked it a lot -- the scenery, the mental
challenge -- but it was very, very hard today. Right now we have
to put this behind and move on, because Day Three will be very
difficult."

MAPUTO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi said here Friday that only through political negotiations
could the Angolan conflict be resolved.
</P>
<P>
"Never has any conflict been resolved through military means.
Therefore, the war in Angola could only be solved through
political means," He made the remarks at a press briefing here in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister denied that the country's Nacala Port in the
north is being used for transporting weapons for the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence in this regard after investigations
conducted by the government, he added.
</P>
<P>
Recently there has been speculation that Nacala Port is one of
the passages to smuggle weapons for the UNITA rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
"Nacala Port is not being used for supporting war efforts
launched by any opposition faction, or by UNITA," said Mocumbi.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in Angola was renewed at the end of last year.
The Angolan government has recently ordered the arrest of Jonas
Savimbi, the leader of UNITA.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Unfolds Agenda to Revive Power, Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Power and Steel Minister
Ajibola Ige has unfolded a phased revival agenda for the low
efficient power and steel sectors in the west African country with
a promise to eliminate incidents of public power failure within
24 months.
</P>
<P>
The minister also listed on Thursday 10-point strategies to
salvage the embattled steel and aluminium sectors, threatening to
sack officials who fail to meet set targets, the Guardian
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ige, who put the implementation of the agenda in phases of six,
12 and 24 months, said he would adopt "a missionary approach to
management, not just to clear away the debris of past errors and
to prevent new blunders, but to build up structures and procedures
that would make strategic achievements difficult to reverse."
</P>
<P>
The targets for the power sector, according to the minister,
were to "cut down incidents of wanton power failures by 50 percent
in six months, by 75 percent in 12 months and by almost 100
percent in 24 months.
</P>
<P>
"No excuses will be accepted or acceptable. Meet target or be
fired," he added, hinting at his determination to sort out the
problems in the long- neglected sectors.
</P>
<P>
"The government is determined to put an end to the criminal
destruction of Nigeria Electric Power Authority (NEPA)'s
facilities, some of which border on sabotage. Henceforth, any
person, acting alone or in collusion with NEPA staff, found
guilty of tampering with electric plants, fittings or towers will
serve jail terms without an option of fine," said the minister.

ANKARA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Eight rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in the military
operations in the past week in southeastern Turkey, an official
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by the office of the Emergency Regional

BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) rejected a letter from the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) this afternoon for the latter's
violation of the "One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
According to the ARATS, the letter which SEF sent to ARATS at
14:00 today, together with a "negotiation manuscript", has
seriously violated the agreement that "the two sides of the
straits adhere to the 'one China' principle", which was reached in
1992. Therefore, the ARATS refused to accept the letter.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of cross-straits
relations as "state-to-state, or at least special state-to-state
relations" on July 9 has strained the cross-straits relations and
aroused indignation worldwide.

will immutably change the way of communication between the
countries in the region, as well as the global attitude toward the
region of southeastern Europe," Jelavic said.

<P>
"This new mode of cooperation and a strong integration
demension will permanently end the cycle of brutal conflicts that
have characterized the region so far," he added.

southeastern Europe, involves the 15 European Union (EU) member
states, nine non-EU European countries, the United States, Canada

<HEADLINE> Forest Coverage Up in Central China's Tourist Attraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Forest coverage in Zhangjiajie,
the famous tourist attraction in central China's Hunan Province,
has jumped to 63.7 percent from 40 percent ten years ago, with the
forest coverage in its scenic spots soaring to over 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiajie, in northwestern Hunan, was approved by the State
Council in 1982 as the first national forest park in China, and
its Wulingyuan scenic spot was incorporated into the World
Heritage List by UNESCO in 1992.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Zhangjiajie Forest Bureau said that since
1988 when the city was established, Zhangjiajie has afforested an
area of 150,000 hectares, planted more than 50 million trees and
sealed off 220,000 hectares of mountains for afforestation.
</P>
<P>
The five nature reserves in the city, including one at state
level and three at provincial level, cover a total area of over 1,
000 square kilometers and are home to more than 4,000 species of
plants and wild animals, of which, over 3,000 species are high-
class plants and 75 are rare plant species under the state
protection.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zhangjiajie is striving to raise the city's forest
coverage to 67 percent by afforesting an additional area of 2,300
hectares and sealing off additional 3,300 hectares of mountains
for afforestation on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the '99 China Eco-Tour
International Forest Protection Festival, to be held in
Zhangjiajie September 20 to 27, will further increase public
awareness of forest protection and spur the afforestation efforts
in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Festival, whose theme is " Man and Nature, Fusion of Nature
and Culture", is sponsored by the National Tourism Administration,
State Forestry Administration, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and
Hunan Provincial Government.

<P>
LUSAKA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
introduced new prescription pads and stamps in some big hospitals
nation-wide to curb drug pilfering, media reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"A particular stamp for a given hospital cannot be used at
another hospital. It's a way of curbing drug wastage in hospital
countrywide." Zambian Health Minister Nkandu Luo told the press in
Lusaka Thursday
</P>
<P>
Doctors and other medical practitioners in Zambian state-run
hospitals have been banned from prescribing drugs outside their
designated places of work.
</P>
<P>
The health minister expressed her worry about the shortage of
drugs in hospitals despite adequate stocks being supplied.
</P>
<P>
She admitted that there were flaws in the current distribution
of drugs nationwide, alleging that some medical practitioners had
taken advantage of the laxity in the prescription system to use
government-procured drugs for their own selfish needs.
</P>
<P>
Luo said that her ministry has introduced specific stamps for
various hospitals to control and limit cross-breed of
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
The move will be carried out as a pilot project at some
hospitals in the southern African country, she added.

GUANGZHOU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China will end the first fishing
ban imposed on the South China Sea area as of 24:00 tomorrow,

</P>
<P>
The government has offered some subsidies to the fishermen who
had difficulty in making both ends meet as a result of the fishing
ban, Liu said, adding that the supply and prices of seafood
remained stable during the period thanks to the adequate store of
seafood and pelagic fishing.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Discuss Post-Crisis Reconstruction in Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sarajevo, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from major western
countries are gathering here Friday to join their counterparts of
the Balkan nations to discuss post-crisis reconstruction in
southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and other senior American officials
arrived here this morning among other world leaders to attend the
"Stability Pact Summit".
</P>
<P>
The summit, which constitutes part of the "stability pact" for
southeast Europe proposed by Germany, involves the 15 European
Union (EU) member states, nine non-EU European countries, the
United States, Canada and Japan. Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari chairs the gathering in the capital of Bosnia-
Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Also the current European Union president, Ahtisaari told
Balkan leaders Thursday at the first-day meeting that he hopes
this gathering will promote constructive brainstorming about how
to implement the three aspects of the stability pact: democracy
and human rights, economic reconstruction, development and
cooperation, and security issues.
</P>
<P>
The second day of the summit is aimed to reinforce the
political importance of the stability pact agreed by the major
western powers in June to consider the long-term future of the
region after the Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> Environment Assessment Required of HK's Major Theme Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Major theme parks and amusement
parks in Hong Kong are required to evaluate their potential
impacts on the environment under an amendment to the existing
legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Impact Assessment Order 1999 published in a
government gazette Friday provides for the inclusion of theme
parks and amusement parks with a site area of more than 20
hectares as designated projects, the construction or operations of
which will require an environmental permit.
</P>
<P>
Taking immediate effect, the amendment order makes it necessary
for such parks to take prevention and mitigation measures to
protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Planning, Environment and Lands Bureau
explained that the adoption of 20 hectares as the site size
threshold is consistent with the present schedules of the
ordinance.
</P>
<P>
Small theme parks or amusement parks are unlikely to cause
significant adverse environmental impact under normal
circumstances, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The amendment order will be implemented through the existing
approval and enforcement arrangements under the Environmental
Impact Assessment Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is in negotiation with Walt Disney corporation on the
possibility of construction of a Disney theme park.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Hits New Record High in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's unemployment rate hit a new
record high of 4.9 percent in June, with the rate for men reaching
an all-time high of 5.1 percent, the Management and Coordination
Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted jobless rate in June went up 0.3
percentage points from the previous month's level, the highest
since the Japanese government began compiling employment data in
1953, the agency said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate followed 4.6 percent in May and the previous
record high of 4.8 percent registered in both March and April, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The June jobless rate for men went up 0.2 percentage points
from the level in May, while the figure for women also rose 0.2
percentage point to 4.4 percent, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
The number of workers who were forced to leave their jobs
reached a record high of 1.18 million, far more than the 1.03
million who quit by themselves, it said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Japan's Labor Ministry said in a separate
report that the ratio of job offers to job seekers remained at a
record low of 0.46 for the second straight month in June on a
seasonally adjusted basis. The ratio means there were only 46 job
offers for every 100 job seekers.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the jobless rate and the offer-seeker ratio, the
country's employment situation is becoming increasingly severe,"
the ministry said.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A person who got to know Li
Hongzhi, founder of the Falun Gong, around 1992 in Li's hometown
has accused Li of deceiving his followers and taking their money.
</P>
<P>
Liu Fengcai, a 60-year-old journalist in Changchun, the capital
of Jilin Province, told Xinhua that the Falun Dafa was just
nonsense. He says that Li, who founded the Falun Gong cult, an
illegal organization, in 1992, used some sleight of hand and
ambiguous scientific jargons and malicious fallacies to deceive
people.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that he decided to break away from Li after he had
found out that Li was a braggart, a liar, and a swindler, who
promoted Falun Gong with the purpose of defrauding his followers.
Li's malicious fallacies about how the Earth will explode also
caused Liu to sever ties with Li.
</P>
<P>
Liu says that Li concocted Falun Gong to lure more followers
and to get more money from them. Liu estimated that Li had earned
more than one million yuan by 1994 from his lectures, training
classes, and books related to Falun Gong and from donations from
different sources.

<HEADLINE> Yasay Assures Pullout of ECA's Threat on PAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) said the European Credit Agency (ECA)
will not withdraw its support for the rehabilitation program of
the Philippine Airlines (PAL), Philippine News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was made by SEC Chairman Perfecto Yasay, Jr. in
an interview over reports that ECA was threatening to pullout its
support in PAL, after U.S. Eximbank disagreed to the terms and
conditions set in the PAL's rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, it is very remote that the agency will do
this considering that it is now supportive of the PAL's
rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
More than this, business tycoon Lucio Tan is finalizing plans
to negotiate for the Eximbank's withdrawal of its objection to the
rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
The PAL's rehabilitation plan prospered after Tan infused 200
million U.S. dollars from his own pockets to revive the
cash-strapped PAL, rather than see the flag-carrier fold up in
history.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank, it was learned, opted to petition in a U.S. court the
reduction of PAL's receivership from seven to only three. And it
demanded that officials comprising of the receiver committee would
be knowledgeable in the rehabilitation of distressed firms in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Yasay said the SEC and the creditors have also agreed not to
allow for the non-voting representative of the airline's secured
creditors into the rehabilitation committee.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Yasay said, they would be given the fullest
opportunity to input ideas on the rehabilitation of PAL and SEC
would also allow the secured creditors to have the opportunity to
protect their rights in the event that there is a material default
in the payment of obligations.
</P>
<P>
But this can only happen if the SEC has determined that the
default payment for PAL is no longer viable, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed confidence that Eximbank is close to
agreeing to the terms and it is hoped that the withdrawal of
Eximbank's objection can be made within a few days.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Tan expressed plans to pull out his 200-million-dollar
investment in PAL on account of the misunderstanding between some
of the creditors and Eximbank.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
Friday launched fresh attacks against the rival Northern Alliance
from a fifth frontline north of the capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here from Kabul said that fierce fighting
between the two Afghan warring factions is continuing.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a spokesman for the Northern Alliance led by
former defense minister Ahmed Shah Masood as saying that fighting
was also heavy at the New Road, 25 kilometers north of Kabul and
towards the east in the Koh-i-Safi mountain range after the
Taliban launched an infantry assault at Ghorband.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban launched their long-awaited summer offensive on
Wednesday in an effort to end the long-running civil war in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has focused on four fronts to the south of the
Panjsher Valley, the last stronghold of Masood.
</P>
<P>
During the last three days, at least 130 people from the both
sides are reported to have been killed. Meanwhile, four civilians
were killed and more than 10 others injured in rocket attacks by
the Northern Alliance at Kabul.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Launches Energy Efficiency Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday launched a
four-year industrial energy efficiency improvement project to
address the problem of inefficient and wasteful use of energy in
industrial facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The project at a cost of 80 million ringgit (about 21.052
million U.S. dollars) has targeted eight energy-intensive
industrial sub-sectors -- cement, ceramics, foodstuff, glassware,
iron and steel, pulp and paper, rubber and wood-based industries.
</P>
<P>
Launching the project here, Energy, Communications and
Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie said the project would focus on
promoting industrial energy efficiency using specific programs
that would facilitate voluntary initiatives on the part of the
industries.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Malaysian government was also studying
the option of introducing appropriate economic measures for energy
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The project to be implemented by the newly-established Malaysia
Energy Center is part of global efforts by the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The GEF
serves as the interim financial mechanism body for the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change.
</P>
<P>
It was envisaged that by the year 2004, GHG emissions from the
eight sub-sectors in Malaysia would see a decrease of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The project has received a grant of 29 million ringgit (about
7.631 million U.S. dollars) from the GEF and the United Nations
Development Program.
</P>
<P>
A national steering committee has been formed to monitor the
progress in the implementation of the project.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Prevent Total Foreign Participation in Restructuring: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will prevent complete
foreign involvement in restructuring and avoid selling assets
cheap, Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although foreign participation in the restructuring in Thailand
may be positive, Thailand is adjusting its system to avoid
complete foreign involvement, Tarrin told reporters when attending
the conference "Back to the Basics?".
</P>
<P>
World Bank chief economist Joseph Stiglitz cautioned Thailand
on Wednesday that a rush to sell off local banks to foreign
players might turn out to be simply giving away domestic assets on
the cheap, especially at a time of recovery.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister pointed out that restructuring is really
important for the Thai economy to emerge stronger, adding that the
authorities will review the economic growth target soon.
</P>
<P>
He said the Thai economy is recovering as fast as it can. The
Thai government has already retargeted the growth rate from one
percent early this year to 1.2-1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We are quite certain that we'll possibly grow this year," he
said.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the issue of non-performing loans (NPLs),
the minister said the NPL levels in Thai banks are relatively
stable now. NPLs in the Thai banking sector account for 47 percent
of total loans.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand and other authorities are urging the
sector to solve this problem as quickly as they can, Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has so far closed or intervened in 70
finance companies and banks and is now in the process of
privatizing four commercial banks.

reconstruction, making sure there is security and not tension in

Cook said the 15-nation European bloc was already working to
strengthen ties, although the summit will not be an open ticket
the countries of the Balkans to join the EU or NATO.
</P>
<P>
"We are actively under negotiation with both Macedonia and
Albania on stabilization and association agreements," he said.

<HEADLINE> Caffeine Good for Small Babies: Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AAP Friday reported that a study funded by the National Health
and Medical Research Council found that intravenous doses of
caffeine stimulates that part of the brain which signals the lungs
to inflate.
</P>
<P>
Dr Bruce Charles, from the University of Queensland's school of
pharmacy, was quoted as saying premature babies who suffered the
breathing problem, known as apnoea, also had problems eliminating
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The one currently used, theophylline, can cause the heart to
race and may lead to gastrointestinal problems, whereas caffeine
has none of these drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
"I've been interested in the way drugs are eliminated by these
babies because they have such tiny immature kidneys and livers
they have huge problems getting rid of drugs," Charles said.
</P>

Over the past three years Charles has studied 250 babies at
Brisbane's Mater Mothers' Hospital who have relied on a mechanical
ventilator to breathe because of apnoea.
</P>
<P>
Apnoea starves the blood of oxygen which can lead to brain
damage and death.
</P>
<P>
The study is the first to use caffeine for apnoea and has
attracted international attention.

"We expect it (caffeine) will be the drug which will replace

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Passenger Car Sales Increase Sharply in 1st Half 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Passenger car sales in
Malaysia rose by 107 percent in the first six months of this year,
4
according to the Malaysian Motor Traders Association (MMTA)
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sales during the period under review amounted to 106,840 units
against 51,605 units in the corresponding period 1998, MMTA said,
expecting a even better second half year performance.
</P>
<P>
MMTA said passenger car sales are expected to reach 215,000
units this year, an increase of 56 percent over 1998 when a total
of 137,691 passenger cars were sold.
</P>
<P>
It forecast that total sales of vehicles, covering commercial
vehicles and four-wheel drive vehicles also, for the whole of this
year would rise to 260,000 units from an earlier forecast of
200,000 units against total vehicle sales of 163,151 units for
1998.
</P>
<P>
Increased vehicle sales point to an improving economy under the
current economic backdrop as vehicle sales are often used as a
yardstick to measure the state of the economy.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of this year, national car sales
totaled 98,349 units against 47,416 units in the same period of
last year, up by 107 percent, MMTA said.
</P>
<P>
Proton, Malaysia's major passenger car manufacturer, selling
70,126 units in the January-June period this year, accounted for
66 percent of the total passenger car market, against 31,232 units
in the same period 1998 or 60.5 percent of total passenger car
market, according to MMTA.

<HEADLINE> Osama Desires to Leave Afghanistan: Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden
has expressed his desire to leave Afghanistan fearing an imminent
U.S. attack, sources close to Osama and the Taliban told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have endorsed Osama's decision to leave the
war-torn country, but insisted they would not force him to leave,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to increase the difficulties for Afghanistan and
its people by staying in the country," the sources quoted Osama as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi dissident, who is most wanted by the United States
for his alleged terrorist activities, said that he had started
searching for a suitable new place to go.
</P>
<P>
If he receives any invitation from any Islamic country, he will
proceed there, said Osama.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban militia have promised to facilitate
Osama in shifting to any other country.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban authorities announced that Osama was missing in
February this year. However, a Taliban spokesman admitted on July
8 that the 41-year-old Saudi dissident was still in Afghanistan
after the U.S. announcement of imposing economic sanctions against
the Taliban for his support to Osama.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's supreme leader Mulla Omar last week rejected the
U.S. demand for Osama's extradition from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The United States launched missile attacks on the alleged
terrorist bases in Afghanistan run by Osama in August last year.
</P>
<P>
Osama was blamed for masterminding car bomb blasts at the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August in which more than 200
people, including 12 Americans, were killed.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Raise Cashew Nut Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania aims to raise its
cashew nut production to 110,000 tons in this year, the Ministry
of Agriculture and Cooperatives has said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said this in a budget report presented to the
National Assembly earlier this month, Business Times reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the demand of cashew nuts in the world market is
high as Vietnam, one of the leading exporters, has less yields.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's processing plants are running short of raw nuts and
have to buy from other producers like Cote d'Ivoire and
Mozambique, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that prices of cashew kernels -- processed nuts
removed from their shells, have jumped to 3.2 U.S. dollars per
pound from 2.3 dollar per pound in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's cashew nut output in 1998/99 (from June 30, 1998 to
July 1, 1999) rose to 105,000 tons from 93,200 tons in the
previous year with the increase of prices of the crop in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
The Cashew Nut Association of Tanzania has said it will make
joint efforts with the government and farmers in raising the
cashew nut output.
</P>
<P>
With funds from the World Bank, Tanzania plans to improve the
processing capacity of the crop in the major growing areas along
the Indian Ocean coastal belt comprising Tanga, Coast, Lindi and
Mtwara regions.
</P>
<P>
The improvement program involves spraying pesticides to treat
"powder mildew" disease at the right time as well as proper crop
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Cashew nut production has shown marked increase in the past
five years. In 1993/94, output stood at only 46,600 tons.
</P>
<P>
As one of the traditional cash crops, cashew nut is a source of
 livelihood for an estimated 300,000 families, who tend about 30
million trees on 4,000 hectares of land.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Magazine Repudiates Falun Gong Fallacies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Li advocates truthfulness, what he has done is just
the opposite. His books are written by ghostwriters, his date of
birth was falsified to coincide with that of Sakyamuni, the
founder of Buddhism (565 B.C.-486 B.C.), and he saw doctors and
took medicines himself but told other not to do so.
</P>
<P>
As for benevolence, Li boasts that Falun Gong can convert
people, but he refused to recruit those people who were fatally
ill to his Falun Gong classes. Some Falun Gong practitioners lost
their lives just because of a refusal to see doctors or take any
medicines, whereas others comitted suicide when they tried to
locate the "Dharma Wheel" inside their own bodies. Where's the
benevolence in this? it queries.
</P>
<P>
Although he preached tolerance, Li and his followers have never
shown much tolerance themselves. They wouldn't put up with
criticism or opposition, it says, and for several months, Falun
Gong practitioners have harassed or threatened the people who had
different views and attacked at news organizations and even Party
and government headquarters, seriously disrupting the public order.
</P>
<P>
All this shows that Li Hongzhi is neither truthful, benevolent,
nor tolerant and that behind these three main tenets of the Falun
Gong, there exist nasty political motives. If unchecked, Li and
his followers will do great harms to the state and society, it
stresses.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Leaders of Western countries including Bill Clinton, Jacques
Chirac, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schroeder will be in Sarajevo,
Bosnia, on Friday to attend a three-hour summit aimed at opening a
new era in the Balkans after the war in Kosovo. Economic
development and democratization are at the center of the summit
which will adopt the Pact of Stability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
-- The on-going visit to Algiers by French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine is aimed at normalizing the relations between
France and Algeria, which are hot but bitter at the same time.
Vedrine will also test the ``new style'' of Algerian President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika and the margin of manoeuvre of the new
president.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The risks of inflation are being felt in the United States,
where the value of stocks dropped brutally on Thursday as
operators were expecting a raise of key banking interests rates in
the coming days by the Federal Reserve. The costs of salaries rose
by 1.1 percent from April to June and by 3.2 percent in the past
12 months in the United States, much higher than what economists
expected.
</P>
<P>
-- The French government announced a plan on Thursday on re-
organizing the country's nuclear energy industry, by buying 44
percent of the shares of the nuclear energy company Framatone from
the Alcatel telecommunication equipment group. By putting
Framatone under government control, the government intends to
establish a European giant of nuclear energy with the German group
Siemens.

<HEADLINE> Wang Lianying Doubtful for Title Defence at Military Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China's five-time world champion
Wang Lianying is doubtful for her title defence in military
pentathlon at the Military World Games in Zagreb, Croatia, next
month because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
"I have not trained for weeks," said Wang on Friday. "Whether I
will compete at Zagreb will depend on how well I recover. If not,
I will just try my best to do some logistic work for my teammates.
"
</P>
<P>
Wang injured her right calf muscles during training one month
ago and could only manage mild excercises now.
</P>
<P>
Her injury also dealt a blow to China's defence of the event's
team title at the August 8-17 games.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the 30-year-old major won her fifth consecutive world
pentathlon championship to become the first woman to achieve such
a feat in the history.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago at the inaugural Military World Games in Rome,
Italy, she won the individual title and was a member of the
champion team.
</P>
<P>
China is sending 145 athletes to the Zagreb games and hopes to
grab at least 13 gold medals.

<HEADLINE> Horticultural Exports Earn Kenya $103M in 1st Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenya earned 7.4 billion shillings
(around 103 million U.S. dollars) from exports of fresh
horticultural produce in the first six months of this year, a 68
percent increase over the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director Martin Mulandi of the country's Horticultural
Crops Development Authority said here Thursday that the volume of
crops export rose by 58 percent to 56,633 tons in the six-month
period from 35,840 tons for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Friday quoted Mulandi as
saying that exports of cut flowers went up by 24 percent to 19,283
tons, fruits by 87 percent to 11,998 tons and vegetables by 83
percent to 25,352 tons.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase of crop exports to the
rehabilitation of Nairobi-Mombasa highway which is the only outlet
to the seaport city of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Mulandi said this year's total value and volume of
horticultural exports are expected to surpass 14.38 billion
shillings (some 197 million dollars) and 231,067 tons recorded in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Manila Should Enhance Anti-drug Campaign: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government should
take comprehensive measures to stamp out drug menace, a senior
anti-drug official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jewel Canson, head of the National Drug Law Enforcement
Prevention and Coordination Center, said the plan should combine
the forces of law-making, law enforcement and educational campaign
in fighting the illegal drug scourge.
</P>
<P>
The illegal drug trade in the nation was estimated to have
reached 250 billion pesos (6.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998
alone, and some 1.7 million Filipinos have fallen victim to drug
addiction.
</P>
<P>
Canson said the government needs stronger legislation that
would give more muscles to the government's anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for specialized courts to handle drug
offense along with a specialized prosecution service for trial of
these cases.
</P>
<P>
A more effective way to treat and rehabilitate drug abuses is
also in need, Canson said, citing the "growing number" of young
people hooked to prohibited substances.
</P>
<P>
Preventive education, support and cooperation of Filipinos from
all walks of life are also important in the campaign against drug
abuse and trafficking, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the drug scourge will destroy the future of young
Filipinos if no tougher measures are adopted to curb the menace.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Signs Co-operative Agreement With Chinese Rating Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Moody's Investors Service, one of
the world's leading rating agencies, today signed an co-operative
agreement with a Chinese rating firm, the Dagong Global Credit
Rating Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, their co-operation will come into
two phases. In the first phase, the two sides will jointly develop
a rating system tailored to China's domestic capital market. And
Moody's will offer assistance to Dagong in credit analysis, credit
research and crediting training but will not be involved in the
rating of any specific projects.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, they will form a joint venture when the
time is mature.
</P>
<P>
Moody's President John Rutherfurd said the agreement "comes at
a good time for both organizations, as well as for China, whose
rapidly-growing economy has created a large demand for education
and training in credit risks and analysis."
</P>
<P>
"China's growth potential, Dagong's position in the market, and
Moody's century-old reputation as the most trusted name in credit
analysis should provide for a very constructive co-operation," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jizhong, chairman of the Dagong, said, "It is the desire of
all countries around the world to still more effectively analyze
and manage financial risk in a bid to maintain financial integrity,
and this co-operation with Moody's will assist Dagong in playing
an important role in serving the domestic markets in the People's
Republic."
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's rating agencies are still relatively young,
he said that co-operation with international rating agencies would
help narrow the gap between the country's rating agencies and
their international counterpart and would allow them to play a
still bigger role in protecting investors' interests, disclosing
and reducing financial risks and promoting the growth of the
Chinese capital market.

</P>
<P>
Kenya Times:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ethnic Group Saying Good-bye To Out-of-date Farming Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Yao ethnic group in China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has abandoned its older farming
methods of burning off the mountainside and has begun using more
ecologically-sound farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
The land-locked Yao villages are often poor and the people
there used to develop farmland by burning off the growth on
mountainsides for simple farming. Zhao Wenxing, of Jinxiu County,
for example, says that his family moved three times to make room
for this massive burning technique.
</P>
<P>
But, things began to change when more modern methods were
introduced after China's reforms in 1978. And, because logging and
the burning of forests were banned in the 1980s in the Dayao
Mountains, where many Yao people live, forest coverage has
increased to some 73 percent from 39 percent and fir and fruit
trees and spice bushes now cover the mountain slopes.
</P>
<P>
Anise is one spice being planted on the hillsides in Jinxiu and
it brought in 30 million yuan in export earnings last year. It is
a popular product in Hong Kong, Japan, and France.
</P>
<P>
In Bama, a Yao autonomous county, farmers have just said good-
bye to their small huts that dotted the mountains and some 3,400
households have moved into larger buildings. In Gongcheng County,
people have also given up the old habit of using straw and tree
branches for fuel and are using cleaner energy like marsh gas and
70 percent of the farmers have marsh gas pits in their courtyards.
</P>
<P>
The fruit they produce are "green products", because they use
decomposed straws from marsh gas pits, instead of chemicals, to
fertilize their fruit trees, says Liu Yumin, one local farmer.

the two companies will explore the possible use of Fiat India Auto
Ltd's plant in Mumbai, as a proposed joint engine production site.
</P>
<P>
The study, which is expected to be completed by the end of the
year, will cover engines of small- and mid-sized cars planned for
India by both the companies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese car giant Toyota is planning to introduce a
mid-sized car in India to cater to the needs of the growing
middle-class market and will consider introducing the passenger
car by 2004-2005.
</P>
<P>
Sachio Yamazaki, managing director of Toyota Kirloskar, said
Thursday, "The preference for the small cars in the country at
present is a compromise choice because of price factor and an
average middle class family really needs a mid-sized car."
</P>
<P>
As real income grows, the demand for bigger cars is expected to
increase, he added.
</P>
<P>
Toyota Kirloskar, which is an 87:13 joint venture between
Toyota and Kirloskars, also signed a memorandum of understanding
Wednesday with the Directorate General of Foreign Trade for
importing 544 million U.S. dollars worth of auto components in 5
years.
</P>
<P>
The company has already made an investment of 6 billion rupees
(140 million U.S. dollars) in the Indian venture and targets to
sell 31,000 vehicles in the first year of its operation.
</P>
<P>
Trial production of a multi-purpose vehicle for private and
commercial use has already began and commercial production is
likely to begin by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to get back on the profit track, Sekurit Saint-Gobain,
an 18 billion U.S. dollar industrial conglomerate of France, has
hiked its equity stake in its Indian arm Sekurit Saint-Gobain
India from 51 percent to 75.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the issue is to part-finance the new project
in Pune with a capacity to produce 2.4 million pieces of
tough-ended safety glasses for window and back glasses per annum
for the automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
The company has already started negotiations with new companies
which have set up manufacturing bases in India and are presently
importing their toughened safety glass requirements to sell its
products.
</P>
<P>
According to the Society of Indian Automobile Association,
sales of commercial vehicles went up by 24 percent to 31,834 units
in the first quarter of the current fiscal year ended in June, as
against 25,618 units sold in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Among them, the medium and heavy commercial segment saw a 44
percent increase in market with sales going up to 19,397 units as
against 13,470 units in the same period last fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> 13 Species of Wild Animals Extinct in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen out of 903 species of wild
animals in Bangladesh are extinct and 200 others are threatened,
according to a red book on threatened animals.
</P>
<P>
The book, prepared by the International Union for Conservation
of Nature and Natural Resources, Bangladesh, will be published
next month in five volumes in both Bangla and English, the
Independent daily newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total wild animals, data was deficient on 342
species, and 348 other species were not threatened, researchers
who prepared the book were quoted as stating.
</P>
<P>
The 342 animals on which data was deficient might include some
species that are already extinct or are threatened, they
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
The study based on published materials and recent observation
of experts and researchers has listed five genera of animals --
fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals -- and has shown
that out of the species that are extinct one is reptile, two are
birds and 10 mammals.
</P>
<P>
The aim of compiling the book is to create awareness among the
people in advance so that they took necessary conservation and
restoration measures.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the red book also includes a brief write-up on the
description, habitats, distribution, threats, conservation status,
conservation need and extra-territorial distribution of every
threatened species.

YINCHUAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The excavation site of the
mausoleum of the Xixia emperor in northwest China is open to the
public and is expected to attract a considerable number of
tourists.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists in charge of the excavation say that cemetery No.

outstanding of which is a stele in the form of a statue 140
centimeters high with a decorated face.
</P>
<P>
The site also has parts of steles engraved with characters,
three pedestals for stone statues, decorated bricks, porcelain
shards, coins, bronzeware, iron tools, and building adornments.

The Ningxia Archeology Research Institute began excavating the
site in August and September last year and the State Cultural
Heritage Administration calls some of the findings the most
important for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Xixia was established in what is modern-day Ningxia in the 11th
century and was inhabited by a number of ethnic groups. It was
then conquered by the Yuan Dynasty in 1227.

persuade Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to
consider Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's suggestions about
amending implementation of the Wye accords, a senior official

and are now trying to work out the details involved in
defining the exact "break-off point." According to a Jordanian
source knowledgeable about King Abdullah's mediation efforts, the
main point of dispute between Israel and Syria is over the
question of the exact border lines.
</P>

Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- During the meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak presented a

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- An investor upset over stock
trading losses opened fire Thursday in two brokerage offices in
Atlanta City, Georgia State, killing nine people and wounding 12
others before escaping, and then killed himself when stopped by
police.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the gunman's wife and two children were found beaten
to death in their suburban home.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said the gunman, Mark Barton, 44,
committed suicide after police cornered him in a dark green van at
a service station in Atlanta's northern suburbs about five hours
after the office shootings.
</P>
<P>
"He was pulled over, and then killed himself," Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
Two handguns were found at the scene and notes were found with
the family members' bodies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Barton, a chemist, walked into a brokerage office at Securities
Center in downtown Atlanta about 3 p.m. (2100 GMT), opened fire,
then walked across the street and began shooting at another
brokerage firm, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
Four of the victims were killed in one building and five in the
other, he said.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said U.S. Vice President Al Gore had telephoned to
offer condolences and federal assistance in coping with the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a grim wave of mass shootings at schools
and workplaces and was among the worst office massacres ever in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta was one of several cities in the United States to sue
gun manufacturers, seeking to recoup the costs of gun-related
violence. But the state legislature, heavily lobbied by the
National Rifle Association, swiftly passed a law prohibiting such
suits.
</P>
<P>
Georgia law requires no state permit to buy or own a gun but
does require a permit to carry a concealed weapon, according to
the National Rifle Association Web site.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. economic growth slowed abruptly to 2.3
percent during the second quarter, according to advance estimates
released Thursday by the Commerce Department.

The Department reported that the gross domestic product, the
nation's total output of goods and services, increased by 44
billion dollars from April through June to an inflation-adjusted 7.

The deceleration in GDP in the second quarter primarily
reflected a deceleration in personal consumption expenditures and

<HEADLINE> Colombo to Produce Compost Fertilizer out of Garbage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The four local municipal councils
in Sri Lanka's Colombo District plan to produce compost fertilizer
using bulk loads of garbage in a bid to stop garbage dumping
activities, local officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed project, four compost manufacturing plants
will be set up in the district, with technological support from
India and financial support from the World Bank, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Mayors of the four municipal councils are presently touring
India to learn about the Indian garbage disposal system.
</P>
<P>
The project, with a total expenditure of around 80 million U.S.
dollars, will solicit the latest technology and other needy
machinery from a pioneer compost manufacturer in India while
seeking a soft loan facility from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The compost fertilizer is to be sold to the farmers at cheap
prices.
</P>
<P>
At present nearly 1,400 metric tons of garbage is collected per
day in the four municipal councils to be dumped in selected sites,
which has provoked the opposition of environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
A Sri Lankan court has issued a stay order to stop the garbage
dumping activities in one of the municipal councils.

<P>
HANOI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai urged all the country's administrative and economic sectors
to finish the plans to prevent the Y2K problem before November 15,
1999, Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his message on July 28 to high-ranking government officials,
business leaders and heads of other organizations, Khai asked them
to solve key issues relating to the Y2K problem, give priority to
the repair and replacement of equipment and submit periodical
reports on the Y2K situation to the National Steering Committee
for the Year 2000 Computer Incident (Y2K) Prevention.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Khai also required that all tests to ensure the
defeat of the millennium bug must be done before Wednesday,
October 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's National Steering Committee for Y2K Prevention said
provincial people's committees and industrial departments have yet
to fully assess the possible impact of the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the sluggishness to a low awareness of the
potential difficulties among managers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Report Finding Sexual Differentiation 1.8 Billion Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese scientists announced
today that sexual differentiation can be dated back at least 1.8
billion years, in sharp contrast to previous figures put at around
620 million years.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Shixing, of the Tianjin Geology Institute, came to this
conclusion with fellow researchers after analyzing some newly-
discovered fossilized algae from the Yan mountains in Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
When examined under microscope, the fossilized algae were found
to have sexual organs with a sperm sac and an egg sac and the
scientists have even discovered some sperm and eggs in the sac
after magnifying them 2,500 times with an electron microscope.
</P>
<P>
The fossils were buried in a rock layer of the early
Proterozoic period, Zhu says, and these are the earliest sexual
organs ever found and the finding is encouraging because it helps
explain how life evolved.
</P>
<P>
Sexual differentiation made the reproduction of living things
more complex and increased their genetic information and provided
the potential for evolution, according to Zhang Yun, a biologist
at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that for a long period of time after life
forms emerged on earth some four billion years ago, the highest
form of life consisted of only single-cell organisms that had no
sexual differentiation, something like the amoeba in modern times.
</P>
<P>
Before this new discovery, the only reliable evidence for
sexual reproduction of multicell organisms was the 620 million-
year-old fossils of multicellular plants with indications of
sexual organs that were discovered in 1996 by Beijing University
scientists.
</P>
<P>
Many scientists have guessed that sexual reproduction occurred
around two billion years ago, but they haven't been able to find
any concrete evidence. And a few scientists are skeptical about
the new discovery. Xing Shengyu, a former curator of the China
Geology Museum, says he can not believe it because it is very
difficult to identify the fossilized structure of plants that are
so old.
</P>
<P>
But Zhu insists that his group have used solid methods to
examine the fossils and rock samples and have been very careful in
drawing their conclusion.
</P>
<P>
A panel of paleontologists and geologists from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences have examined Zhu's research results, which
appeared in today's Chinese Science Bulletin, the most
authoritative academic natural science journal in China.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Seminar Held To Criticize Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Two Beijing newspapers, People's
Daily and Guangming Daily, held a seminar on Thursday to criticize
Falun Gong and expose its dangers.
</P>
<P>
Participants said that Falun Dafa, which was developed by Li
Hongzhi, goes against modern science and civilization and the
drive to build socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The illegal Falun Gong organization has done great harm to
society, they said, and the ugliness of its motives, the
strictness of its organization, and the absurdity of its preaches
are shocking and the country will have endless troubles if it is
not banned and thoroughly exposed.
</P>
<P>
Yang Muzhi, the deputy director of the State Press and
Publication Administration, said that Li's Doomsday idea is the
theoretical basis of his milicious fallacies, and that he says
nothing new and embodies the denial of the real world and has
strong anti-social and anti-government tendencies,
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhu Bokun of Beijing University said that Falun Gong
is actually a superstitious secret society under the guise of
qigong and physical exercise and has harmed a lot of people's
bodies and minds.

BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China's Air Force has made
untiring efforts to train better pilots, recruiting from military
academies and non-military colleges and is exploring new ways of
training people with master's degrees.
</P>
<P>
The larger proportion of high-caliber pilots has improved the
air force's combat effectiveness, sources say, and as a result,
the air force has made tremendous progress in tactical training
and maneuvers under different weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the air force has placed the same importance
on improving weaponry and training qualified personnel to adapt
itself to modern warfare, they say.
</P>
<P>
China's military academies are playing a significant role in
training these personnel and have been successful in research on
warfare and military techniques.
</P>
<P>
In introducing a postdoctoral program in its engineering
institutes, the air force has also doubled the number of military
academies that are authorized to award master's and doctor's
degrees.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Condemns Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has unreservedly condemned the cruel assassination of
Neelan Thiruchelvam and called on the people to embrace the vision
of ethnic harmony and peace that he was committed to.
</P>
<P>
In her message of condolence issued Thursday night, the
president said the aim of terrorists who seek to decimate such
eminent and democratic intellectuals of rare quality is to
establish the terrorist leadership of the Tamil rebels as the only
valid leaders of the Tamil people.
</P>
<P>
Thiruchelvam, vice-president of the Tamil United liberation
Front (TULF) and a parliamentarian, was killed instantly Thursday
morning in a suicide bombing attack at a stone's throw from his
home in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The bomber jumped off the back of a motor cyclist and onto
Thiruchelvam's car as it approached a busy intersection.
</P>
<P>
The president said Thiruchelvam had won the affection and
respect of not only the Tamil-speaking people but also all the
communities in the country.
</P>
<P>
He was a distinguished academic who had earned the plaudits of
a broad spectrum of the international community, the president
noted in her message.
</P>
<P>
"Knowing fully well the threats and dangers to his life, he
carried on an untiring and inestimable effort through many years
to find solutions to the ethnic crisis that we continue to face,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
However, the president added that savage assassinations of this
type only help underline the fact that in order to obtain the true
 rights and freedoms of the Tamil people, it is necessary to have
more leaders of the caliber of Thiruchelvam, who have respect for
the rights of man.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Striker Kurniawan Fails Doping Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's best striker Kurniawan
Dwi Yulianto has made hot news again after his failure in the pre-
competition doping tests conducted by the National Sports Council
(KONI) just prior to the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games.
</P>
<P>
SEA Games training director Imron Z.S. said that Kurniawan, 23,
tested positive for amphetamines after KONI and the Jakarta doping
laboratory conducted the tests in June and this month.
</P>
<P>
"KONI decided to ban Kurniawan from competing in Brunei. I have
contacted the secretary-general of the All-Indonesian Soccer
Federation (PSSI) and told him to find a substitute otherwise the
national team should play with the remaining 17 players," he said.
</P>
<P>
The national soccer team left Indonesia for Brunei on July 27
as it must prepare for its first match in Group B against Cambodia
on Saturday. KONI withheld Kurniawan's passport and ticket in
order to prevent him from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
"Two members of the soccer team tested positive for the
substance in the first test. I informed PSSI chairman Agum Gumelar
and its officials, asking them to get them cleaned up in the
remaining six weeks. I didn't know Kurniawan was addicted to the
substance," he said, refusing to name the other player.
</P>
<P>
"Kurniawan also failed the second test on July 22, but I'm not
immediately taking stern action against him. I first had to tell
the PSSI chairman the results," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Amphetamines, which is included as a banned substance on the
doping list, is usually used to reduce weight and to relieve
depression.
</P>
<P>
Kurniawan declined to comment on the matter when visited by
reporters in his room in Hotel Atlet Century Park in Senayan.
</P>
<P>
PSSI secretary-general Noegraha Besoes said PSSI was awaiting a
second opinion on the tests from the federation's medical team of
Dr. Moh. Nasrun and Dr. Supriyantoro.
</P>
<P>
Agum is expected to announce the results to the public soon.
</P>
<P>
"I have received the test results from KONI and reported to the
chairman, and he told me to recheck. So we set up the medical team.
This is not a small problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noegraha said the decision of whether to send Kurniawan to the
Games remained with KONI only if tests by PSSI's medical team were
negative.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala's Economy Grows 3 Percent in First Half of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala's economy in the
first half of 1999 grew by three percent over the same period last
year, central bank president Edin Velazquez said Thursday,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Velazquez said the country's economy has had "a quite
satisfactory global result" in the first half of this year, in
spite of the difficult international situation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the government target of 3.9
percent growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) for 1999 will
be attained.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bank of Guatemala noted negative performances in
the country's exports, citing a 48.5 percent slide in the earnings
of coffee exports in the first half of 1999 compared with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Another factor darkening the horizon is the growth of the
government's internal debt, which went from about 844 million U.S.
dollars last December to 900 million dollars in May.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Clashes Claim 9 Lives in Batam, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Violent clashes between migrant
groups from Sumatera and Flores continued in Indonesia's Batam,
just 35 kilometers southeast of Singapore, on Thursday night,
claiming at least nine lives.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency said nine were killed and seven others
seriously injured, mostly from sharp weapons. But Batam Police
chief Lt. Col. D.A. Wibawa confirmed 11 victims during the riot,
which erupted when drivers from the two ethnic groups quarreled as
they competed for passengers in Muka Kuning subdistrict on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although Security Director of Batam Authority Brigadier General
Eric Wotulo has issued a shoot-on-sight order on Thursday,
residents preferred to stay indoors, Antara reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the initial clash between the two groups
of drivers broke out on Sunday, killing one in Buralimar areas. On
Monday, two more people were killed there.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people fled their homes following the violence,
with many of them now sheltered at the local police station.
</P>
<P>
"Shops closed and streets were deserted soon after today's
(Thursday) brawl," Hasan from the Riau Post said.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between representatives of the two ethnic groups and
the local administration on Thursday failed to reach a truce.
</P>
<P>
Batam authorities have appealed to the central government to
restrict the number of poorly educated migrants in the industrial
island, which is a half-hour boat ride from Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Batam is a special industrial zone and also a popular tourist
destination for Singaporeans.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican Stock Exchange
closed sharply down at 5,267.69 on Thursday with the benchmark IPC
index falling 267.69 points, or 3.94 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the decline was influenced by falling stock
prices in the United States and Brazil because of a possible
increase in the federal reserve interest rate.
</P>
<P>
Operators changed 106.11 million shares for about 120.06
million U.S. dollars on Thursday against 84.25 million shares at a
value of 152.20 million dollars on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican currency peso stood at 9.60 to one dollar for sale
and 9.25 for purchase in the main exchange house in the Mexican
capital, compared with 9.50 for sale and 9.20 for purchase on
Wednesday.

<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- Premier Zhu Rongji has urged local officials to prepare for
possible flooding and to redouble efforts to secure the Yangtze
River embankments.
</P>
<P>
During his July 26-28 visit to Anhui Province, he also called
for earnest efforts to implement the Party's economic policies and
do a better job in the latter half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Despite successes in the first phase of flood-control in east
China's Anhui Province, Zhu said vigilance must be kept about
possible flooding and no complacency will be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
-- A commentary urges the Chinese people to further understand
the nature of the struggle against Falun Gong, though initial
achievements have been realized.
</P>
<P>
"We should recognize that the current efforts of exposing Li
Hongzhi, founder of Falun Gong, is a struggle which has an
important bearing on the fundamental faith of communists, on the
ideological basis for uniting the Chinese people, and on the
destiny and future of the Communist Party and the government," it
says, "it is a political struggle in the ideological sphere about
winning over the broad masses of people."
</P>
<P>
Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- Officials and people from all walks of life of the country
voiced their opinions stressing that they will not allow the great
achievements made in China's construction of socialist legal
system to be damaged by Falun Gong or other superstitious
activities.
</P>
<P>
Many said that they will never allow Li Hongzhi and the illegal
Falun Gong attempts to destroy the building of China's socialist
legal system.
</P>
<P>
Police officers in Tianjin Municipality said that preventing
Falun Gong practitioners from receiving medical treatment in
hospitals impinges on people's rights, and the siege of news media
units and governmental departments violate legal regulations on
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
-- A commentary released by the Xinhua News Agency warns the
Taiwan authorities against playing tricks on relations between the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
China Daily
</P>
<P>
-- Every means should be employed to ensure the growth of
exports and foreign direct investment in China, State Councilor Wu
Yi urged at the national mid-year conference on foreign trade and
economic cooperation held in Beijing from July 27 to 28.
</P>
<P>
Both China's exports and foreign direct investment dipped
during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
-- The Ministry of Public Security has issued a wanted notice
for the arrest of Li Hongzhi, head of the "Falun Dafa Research
Society" and his Falun Gong organizations.

<P>
CARACAS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. anti-drug czar Barry
McCaffrey met here Thursday with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
and discussed cooperation between their two countries in fighting
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, McCaffrey told reporters that he agreed with
Chavez that the anti-drug effort in the Western hemisphere could
be expanded into the field of combating money laundering
</P>
<P>
He expressed worries that Colombian criminal groups will make
incursions into the United States via Venezuela, the neighbor of
Colombia, which is the world's largest cocaine exporter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. top anti-drug official, who arrived here Wednesday
evening for a two-day visit from Colombia, denied allegations by
the media that his country is using the war against local drug
dealers as a pretense to send troops to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said his country ruled out an intervention in the
countries of the Western hemisphere like Colombia, where there
exist internal armed conflicts between the government and
guerrilla groups.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Sports Council Regrets Mia's Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) Vice Chairman Arie Sudewo has expressed regret over
Mia Audina's plan to follow husband Tylio Lobman's move to
Rotterdam and supported a Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI)
decision to expel her if she makes the move.
</P>
<P>
"She's our backbone and I regret her decision. But I threw my
weight behind the PBSI decision to expel her. If Mia moves to the
Netherlands, who will supervise her training programs? Who will
be responsible for her? If she is being coached here, we have her
day-to-day progress report," Arie said.
</P>
<P>
Mia recently announced plans to reside in Rotterdam but
continue playing for Indonesia until the Sydney Olympics. She said
her husband had obtained a better job there and she wanted to
erase the pain surrounding the death of her mother Lanny
Susilawati, who passed away in April.
</P>
<P>
PBSI's comeback was to offer Mia two options: first, stay in
Indonesia and play for the country at the Olympics or second,
resign from the National Badminton Center.
</P>
<P>
Mia, who will turn 20 on August 22, denied she had made the
decision to move to the Netherlands, but said she might train with
the Netherlands national team. She said formal discussions with
the team's coach were yet to take place.
</P>
<P>
"KONI supported the PBSI decision because we believe that the
decision was not made overnight. It had to be discussed among top
officials. I also believe PBSI officials asked Mia to reconsider
her plans. If she has made a decision, then that's her right, her
privacy. She's a married woman and I consider her an adult. Just
give her time to reconsider her plan and decide her next move in
relation to the PBSI options," Arie said.
</P>
<P>
Arie said KONI was not overly concerned if Mia left the country.
</P>
<P>
"Why should we worry about her plans. We have a lot of young
talent in the country. PBSI only has to take the right talent and
develop them to become the country's future hopes," he was quoted
by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arie said Mia's performances had not been the best lately, but
that she was ready to regain form.
</P>
<P>
With Mia currently ranked 18th in the world, her recent weight
gains might preclude her from reaching the top three positions.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arbia raised its hopes
of entering the semifinals as it recorded a convincing victory
over Egypt 5-1 in the Confederations Cup here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Marzouk Al Otaibi scored four goals with Ibrahim Al Shahrani
added the other in the 63rd minute.
</P>
<P>
By exploiting Egypt's weak defense, Al Otabi scored the opener
in the seventh minute and added the second in the 33rd minute for
a 2-0 lead at half break.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians responded with rough play, which led to three
expulsions, and only netted their lone goal through penalty kick
by Ibrahim Samir in the 69th minute.
</P>
<P>
With only nine Egyptian players left on the field, Al Otaibi
added goals in the 77th and 84th minutes.
</P>
<P>
The game virtually eliminated Egypt's chances for the
semifinals, while gave hope to Saudi Arabia, which lost 5-1 to
Mexico in its opener of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Bolivia were to play later Thursday.

<P>
BRASILIA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Transport Minister
Eliseu Padilha on Thursday announced the end of the transport
worker's national strike.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Brazilian authorities had expressed a
hope to end the four-day strike. They said the nationwide strike
and the road blocks caused gasoline and food shortages throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian truckers launched the strike on Monday demanding the
cancellation of price hikes on fuels and tolls. They also set up
road blocks in many major cities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso convened
an emergency meeting of his ministers to tackle the crisis. The
president said he would use the army and the police to lift the
road blocks. The blocks on certain roads were causing serious
traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
The transport workers, however, allowed ambulances, firemen and
buses of foodstuff and fuels to pass unimpeded.

ROME, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian Police have tracked down an
international enriched uranium-trafficking ring and arrested more
than a dozen of its members in Rome and Palermo, capital of Sicily,
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In March 1998, policemen who disguised as uranium buyers
penetrated into the ring, leading to the recovery of one 10-
kilogram ingot of enriched uranium and the arrest of 15 suspects.
</P>
<P>
Further investigation showed that the group had stolen
altogether 10 ingots of enriched uranium, which were meant for
shipment from the United States to Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The police are searching for the other nine missing pieces.
</P>
<P>
Enriched uranium can easily be used in the production of
nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Hits Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The recent heat wave has turned
the Chinese capital into a sauna.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists say that Beijing is having its hottest summer in
100 years, with temperatures reaching 42 degrees centigrade. An
egg can fry on the pavement in some places, people say.
</P>
<P>
The often noisy, bustling city has calmed down a bit and the
numbers of vehicles and pedestrians are half what they usually are.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists say that this weather is a result of a high
pressure warm air mass that has been hovering over northern China.
Many people in Beijing have suffered heatstroke and some have even
died. The Beijing First-Aid Center says that more than 20 people
have been hospitalized and a 76-year-old man died of a stroke this
week. Big factories like the Beijing Iron and Steel Corporation
have installed more air-conditioners and provided health exams for
workers.
</P>
<P>
However, the heat has not dampened tourists' enthusiasm. One
retired military man from the southern city of Shenzhen said that
this was a rare chance for him and the weather could not stop him
from climbing up the Tiananmen Rostrum, which had been a big dream
of his.
</P>
<P>
Swimming pools, libraries, and grassy places are where some go
to escape the heat. The number of swimmers is five times that of
normal years and many people are going to air-conditioned bars and
theaters at night. The hot weather has done one good thing,
according to Meng Lu, an actress, it has enriched night life.
</P>
<P>
Police, garbage collectors, and bus drivers however can't take
the day off. Beijing's 5,000 buses and trolleys are continuing to
transport the 9 million urbanites daily.
</P>
<P>
The biggest beneficiaries may be refrigerator, air-conditioner,
and ice-cream sellers. Dahua Electric Appliance Company located in
northern Beijing has been selling an average of 50 air-
conditioners daily, twice its earlier sales figures.
</P>
<P>
There have been electricity shortages, and sources at the
Beijing Electricity Supply Bureau say that there are three times
the number of electrical problems that they had during the same
period last year. The bureau has had to send 1,000 people out for
emergency repairs.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists say that rain is expected in the next few days.

of killing up to 12 people in Atlanta, committed suicide on
Thursday,Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
At least nine people were killed and 12 others wounded as the
gunman, identified as 44-year-old Mark Barton, opened fire in an
office building in Atlanta City of Georgia State in the United
States Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Three relatives of Barton were found dead at an apartment in
Stockbridge, a town 26 kilometers southeast of Atlanta where
Barton lived, police said.
</P>
<P>
The gunman killed himself a few hours later Thursday after
being pulled over by police at a suburban gas station, Campbell

It was the latest in a grim wave of mass shootings at schools
and workplaces and was among the worst office massacres ever in
the United States.

Campbell said four of the fatalities were in the office
building and five in another across the street.

about 3 p.m. summer time (2100 GMT), opened fire, then walked
across the street and began shooting at another brokerage firm
there, the mayor said.

<HEADLINE> "La Nina" Causes Lower Temperatures in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador and other South American
countries with coasts facing the Pacific Ocean are registering
temperatures below normal due to the climatic phenomenon of "La
Nina," experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The lower temperatures in Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Chile
contrast with the extremely high temperatures in other countries,
according to investigators from the Oceanographic Institute of the
Armed Forces (INOCAR) and the Permanent Commission of the South
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The "La Nina" phenomenon will last until October and will very
probably be more intense in the last quarter of the year, experts
affirmed.
</P>
<P>
The scientific investigation ship called the "Orion," which is
operated by Ecuador's army, detected last month the presence of
the Humboldt cold current facing the country's coasts.
</P>
<P>
"La Nina," in contrast with the climatic phenomenon "El Nino,"
causes a descent in temperatures and a reduction of rains on the
South American coast facing the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, trade winds have grown intense in
southern Ecuador, especially in the oceanic region of Guayaquil
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The air temperature in this zone fluctuates between 19.5
degrees centigrade toward the south and 25.5 toward the north.

<HEADLINE> World PC Market Up 26 percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The personal computer industry
received a boost in the second quarter this year as worldwide
shipments grew more than 26 percent over the same period of 1998,
according to two market reports issued this week.
</P>
<P>
U.S. research firms Dataquest and International Data
Corporation (IDC) reported very similar estimates of worldwide PC
shipments in the second quarter, between 25.3 million and 25.6
million units.
</P>
<P>
All regions of the world experienced strong PC shipment growth
during the past three months. Dataquest said that the growth was
driven by lower system prices, economic recovery and the Internet,
while IDC attributed the increase to strong consumer demand and
continued growth of the low-cost segment.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide volume growth was led by the United States, which
expanded a robust 35 percent to more than 10 million units in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Markets in Asia-Pacific, driven by a return in business
confidence together with Internet-related consumer PC demand,
continued to gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
Sales of commercial PCs in western Europe were healthy and
offset slowness in consumer demand throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
The Latin American market also did well as Brazil showed signs
of recovering from the exchange rate crisis in January.
</P>
<P>
Among major vendors, Compaq remained number one in the PC
market worldwide, with shipments of 3.7 million units and 14.6
percent of world market share. The rest of the top five vendors
were Dell, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Gateway.

longer than that. There are no plans to operate at this stage."

LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United should play in
the FA Cup and have treated their fans "shabbily", new British
Sports Minister Kate Hoey said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hoey took over from Tony Banks on Thursday and immediately
nailed her colors to a different mast as far as the FA Cup is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Banks had strongly defended United's decision to pull out of
the competition in order to play in the World Club Championships
in Brazil in January, but Hoey wants the Treble winners to change
their mind.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Hoey said: "I think it is
something that should not be happening. Manchester United should
be playing in the FA Cup."
</P>
<P>
"I still hope that something will happen that will make them
able to play in it after all."
</P>
<P>
"I am just amazed that they have actually treated their
supporters in what I would say was quite a shabby way."
</P>
<P>
Hoey also courted controversy by lamenting the announcement
that the twin towers at Wembley will not be included in the new
National Stadium.
</P>
<P>
"I am not trying to be outrageous but I have to say that it is
a real shame that the architects could not come up with some way
of keeping them," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I am disappointed personally but it is not really a matter for
government policy," she added.

WINNIPEG, Canada, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Mexico showed their stuff
once again in the long distance track competitions, sweeping the

Joel Sanchez crushed the field to walk away with the gold,
clocking a time of four hours six minutes and 31 seconds to beat

Philip Dunn of the United States came a distant third in 4:13:
45.

to be replaced by four sky-scraping masts, under a massive
redevelopment of the home of English football.
</P>
<P>
The futuristic glass and steel design, which was unveiled by
its architect Lord Foster and Culture Secretary Chris Smith, will
cost 475 million pounds, an increase of 155 million pounds
compared with the original estimates of 320m.
</P>
<P>
But organisers insisted the increase did not represent an
overspend, saying it in fact represented the bill for a series of
enhanced facilities not included in the original design brief.
</P>
<P>
After months of speculation it was confirmed that the towers
would be demolished - despite a campaign from football supporters
to retain them.
</P>
<P>
Instead of the landmark, the north-west London ground will
boast a quartet of steel masts, towering 400ft over the entrance.
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment of the ground will turn it into the
centrepiece of England's campaign to host the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Smith praised the design, saying the new Wembley would be "the
finest arena in the world".
</P>
<P>
He said: "Trying to match a stadium as legendary as the current
Wembley was a daunting challenge, but Norman Foster and his team
have come up with a stunning design.
</P>
<P>
"There will be nowhere on earth better to stage the 2006 World
Cup Final," he said.
</P>
<P>
Glass walls surrounding the expanded structure will provide a
spectacular backdrop for spectators as they walk up a refurbished
Wembley Way - before taking their places in six tiers of seating
overlooking the pitch.
</P>
<P>
The pitch is expected to be rotated through 90 degrees from its
current position and the arena will be given a running track, an
indoor warm-up area, improved dressing room facilities, as well as
themed bars and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Conservation body English Heritage earlier confirmed they were
withdrawing their objections to the removal of the towers.
</P>
<P>
The architects considered keeping the existing towers - but
early plans meant they would end up sitting in the middle of the
pitch. There was a proposal to build replica towers, but this is
believed to have been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
Lord Foster explained that keeping the towers would have
involved a massive engineering operation costing at least 20
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have a pretty good justification for doing that
and for me I can't think of a strong justification," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The towers were emblematic at their time, but that was a long
time ago and things have moved on."
</P>
<P>
The new stadium will increase the ground's capacity from 75,000
to 90,000.
</P>
<P>
The existing structure will be demolished next year and the new
structure is scheduled to open its gates by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The former owners of the stadium, Wembley plc, sold the ground
to the English Football Association (FA) earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Lord Foster is famous for numerous multi-million pound projects
all over the world, from Germany to China, including airport
terminals, skyscrapers, museums and public buildings.

<HEADLINE> Walker 'Relief' at Drugs Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- European 200m sprint winner Doug
Walker of Scotland revealed he got drunk with his family to
celebrate his acquittal over a failed doped test Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
And the 26-year-old Scot star told a packed media conference of
his "total relief" following governing body UK Athletics' decision
to end his suspension.
</P>
<P>
Walker was suspended after traces of banned substance
nandrolone were found in his urine in an out-of-competition test
last December.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the authority said: "The ingestion of the
substance was of a wholly innocent and accidental nature. Clearly
no systematic doping was involved."
</P>
<P>
Walker has been given the all-clear to compete again, but he
says his comeback will probably need to wait for next season.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long struggle and I'm just relieved it's all over,
"said Walker.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long seven months and obviously has been playing
on my mind every day. I've no explanation for it at all.
</P>
<P>
"I had a few friends and family over last night and we drank
some champagne. They have supported me all the way and we got
quite drunk.
</P>
<P>
"I can't see myself back on the track this season because I
just want to do myself justice.
</P>
<P>
"I've still been training every day just to get away from it
all but I lack the competition experience.
</P>
<P>
"I'll get into my winter training programme sooner than normal
and then set my sights on the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Confirmation of Walker's acquittal came as a welcome present on
the day of his 26th birthday.
</P>
<P>
His legal team is now seeking talks with UK Athletics over a
compensation package for his loss of earnings.
</P>
<P>
"Today is not about compensation, but it will need to be
discussed at another time and place," said Walker's lawyer Nick
Bitel.
</P>
<P>
"Doug has suffered tremendously both emotionally and
financially.
</P>
<P>
"I've already spoken with UK Athletics Chief Executive David
Moorcroft and he knows that we will need to talk at a later date.
</P>
<P>
"Athletes are the aggrieved party here, and I strongly believe
cases should not be made public until innocence or guilt is
declared.
</P>
<P>
"Diane Modahl nearly destituted herself when she tried to clear
her name, and that cannot be allowed to happen again."
</P>
<P>
The governing body had to restructure in the wake of the Modahl
case after fighting off bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Athletics chiefs will be keen to settle the case quickly, but
they will also be concerned by the increasing number of positive
tests for nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
There are theories that the substance can occur in the human
body naturally.
</P>
<P>
Moorcroft said: "It costs the athletes and the sport massive
amounts of money to conduct these cases - but what's the
alternative?
</P>
<P>
"It's important that the sport continues to protect innocent
athletes from those who break the rules."
</P>
<P>
Moorcroft suggested further cases should be handled by an
independent doping agency.

<HEADLINE> Banks Steps Down as British Sports Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Tony Banks steps down as British
Sports Minister to become a "special envoy" for England's bid to
get the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
He may also be planning to stand as Labour's candidate to
become the first directly-elected mayor of London, which would
mean taking on both Ken Livingstone and now Glenda Jackson.
</P>
<P>
The outspoken 54-year-old has been Sports Minister since the
1997 general election. He will join Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir
Geoff Hurst at the forefront of the attempt to bring the
tournament to England in 2006 for the first time since 1966.
</P>
<P>
England face stiff competition, notably from South Africa and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Football's world governing body FIFA will announce the
successful bidder in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
Germany received a boost in their bid earlier this month when
the man heading its bid to beat England was nominated by FIFA
president Sepp Blatter as his ideal successor.
</P>
<P>
Blatter is keen on the 2006 tournament being held in Africa -
which has never hosted the World Cup before - but his public
tribute to Franz Beckenbauer will be viewed in Germany as a boost
for their bid.

<HEADLINE> Lazio Close Door on Anelka Signing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian football giants Lazio have
said they will definitely not be signing Arsenal's want-away
striker Nicolas Anelka.
</P>
<P>
Vincenzo Morabito, the agent who has been working for the club
in their negotiations with Arsenal, blamed the Gunners for the
talks collapsing.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The negotiations are definitely closed. We wanted to
bring Anelka to Rome but Arsenal's demands were crazy and
unreasonable. A 20-year-old with a year's experience rated at 23
million pounds is madness."
</P>
<P>
Anelka has failed to report back to Highbury for training
because he says that he is suffering from "stress".
</P>
<P>
Arsenal took the troubled player off the transfer list on
Tuesday, apparently bringing to an end his protracted attempt to
leave the club.
</P>
<P>
But Anelka, who sent a sicknote to the club from his home in
Paris, has branded the Gunners' attempt to recall him "comical"
</P>
<P>
"I think they'll be waiting for me a long time. I'm fine. I'm
calm," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, this break from soccer will be good for me. I've
recharged my batteries for this season which looks like being a
long one."
</P>
<P>
Anelka had threatened legal action if his desire to join Lazio
was not met. It is unclear if he still intends to proceed with any
action.
</P>
<P>
Anelka's latest move is unlikely to endear him to an already
hostile British sporting press and increasingly disgruntled
Gunners supporters.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the London club has made clear its intention to
hold on to Anelka, after he failed to agree personal terms with
Lazio by the Tuesday deadline set the London club.
</P>
<P>
A statement on Arsenal's Internet site said: "It has always
been Arsenal Football Club's wish to retain the services of
Nicolas Anelka.
</P>
<P>
"He is an exceptional young talent and it remains our primary
concern that the player respects his contract with the Club."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people were killed
and 12 others wounded as a gunman opened fire in an office
building in Atlanta City of Georgia State in the United States
Thursday, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a grim wave of mass shootings at schools
and workplaces and was among the worst office massacres ever in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said several witnesses recognized
the gunman, identified as Mark Barton, 44.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said four of the fatalities were in the office
building and five in another across the street.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three relatives of Barton were found dead at an
apartment in Stockbridge, a town 26 kilometers southeast of
Atlanta where Barton lived, police said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible tragedy for our city," Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
Barton, a chemist, walked into a brokerage office at Securities
Center in the upscale Buckhead section north of downtown Atlanta
about 3 p.m. summer time (2100 GMT), opened fire, then walked
across the street and began shooting at another brokerage firm
there, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the injured were in critical condition at the trauma
center of Grady Hospital in the city.
</P>
<P>
A widespread search was launched for Barton.

<HEADLINE> Oakland to Host Biomass Conference of Americas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Experts from around the world
will review issues surrounding the use of biomass for fuels, power
and products at a conference to be held in Oakland, California in
late August.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of participants from North America, South America and
Europe will hear scientists, business leaders and government
officials assess the role of biomass as a leading energy source in
the next century, said the U.S. Department of Energy's National
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In California, whose biomass energy is the largest in the
world, several major commercial biomass and bioenergy
demonstration projects are supported by the California Energy
Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to NREL, the U.S. vision is to spur the growth of a
domestic biomass industry to produce power, fuels and chemicals
from crops, trees and waste. One goal is to make a "ton of
biomass" compete with a barrel of imported oil.
</P>
<P>
NREL director Richard Truly said earlier this week that America
must invest in its energy future now. Otherwise, the nation could
face supply shortage and fall behind of foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
The United States now imports more than half of its oil at a
cost of 52 billion U.S. dollars annually. Truly said that U.S.
policy and research and development decisions should recognize
that worldwide energy demand will outstrip the supply of fossil
fuels in coming decades.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory scientists have made great strides in learning how
to produce environmentally friendly hydrogen from sunlight and
water and how to store it. Progress also has been made in
bioenergy, the use of plants to produce fuels, chemicals and other
products. But Truly said that this progress is at risk. Without a
commitment to to bring those technologies to market, he said, the
science will go wasted.

<HEADLINE> Fiat to Seek Allies From Position of Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian car-maker Fiat looks at any
future partnerships "from a position of strength," Fiat's Chairman
Paolo Fresco said to Italian media recently.
</P>
<P>
Fresco said to Italy's weekly "Panorama" in an interview to be
published Friday that the dominant Italian car-maker will in any
case "keep control of its own destiny."
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee that we are among the most active, perhaps the
most active at the moment in seeking opportunities for
acquisitions, alliances, mergers and other operations," the Fiat
boss said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that since the start of the year Fiat has spent
more than 10 trillion lire ( about 5.5 billion U.S. dollars ) on
acquisitions such as the U.S. tractor firm of Case and the U.S.
engineering firm Pico.
</P>
<P>
As for Fiat's failure to buy Volvo of Sweden late last year,
Fresco said "it went wrong because there was too much talk about
it, too early."
</P>
<P>
Fiat suffered a reverse when its bid for the whole of Volvo,
including its truck division, was beaten by Ford's bid for the
Volvo car division alone in December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in New York, Juergen Schremp, chairman of world No.1
car-maker DaimlerChrysler, denied rumors that the U.S.-German
giant was in talks with Fiat for potential merger.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions against Angola's UNITA May Be Tightened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. Security Council
committee on Thursday put forward proposals to tighten sanctions
against Angola's opposition UNITA in pressing the movement to
agree to a political solution to Angola's civil war.
</P>
<P>
The committee proposals by its chairman in his letter to the
council president dated July 28 and his previous proposals in June
advocated new measures for the implementation of sanctions on
UNITA's export of diamonds, among others.
</P>
<P>
Committee chairman, Canada's Robert Fowler said since 1992
UNITA received some 3 to 4 billion U.S. dollars through diamonds
exports. The money from the exports is believed to be mainly used
to buy weapons.
</P>
<P>
Fowler, who made two trips to Africa this year covering 12
countries where he had wide consultations, suggested that agencies
such as the World Customs Organization and the International
Criminal Police Organization be involved in ensuring the
effectiveness of sanctions imposed since 1993.
</P>
<P>
At the debate following Fowler's briefing to the council, many
council members supported the enforcement of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Other sanction measures include prohibitions on the sale/supply
of arms, travel by UNITA, sale/supply of oil to UNITA, and the
provision of funds or financial resources to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, deputy permanent representative of the Chinese
Mission to the U.N. told the council that while China supports the
chairman's proposals, it wants to note that the tightening of
sanctions is to create a necessary environment to finally find a
political settlement to the conflict in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The civil war of more than two decades has left over one
million killed, 1.7 million displaced out of a population of 11
million in the southwest African nation, according to Fowler.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States, showing off
its military threat, said on Thursday that it had bombed Iraq for
108 times since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Of that total, 43 strikes were conducted in the southern no-fly
zone and 65 in northern Iraq, aimed at destroying Iraqi
surface-to-air missile sites, communications sites, and other
military sites, Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral Craig Quigley told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
In the past couple of days U.S. and British warplanes struck
ytargets in both the southern and northern no-fly zones and eight
people were killed and 26 injured, according to Iraq's news media.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones in the southern and northern parts of Iraq
were imposed by the United States and Britain right after the
Gulf War in 1991. But Iraq never recognize the imposed no-fly
zones and has announced any Western warplanes invading its air
space would be deemed violation of its sovereignty.
