 &HT;    EDS: Corrects name of Timothy Halloway in 4th graf.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Pillow talk led to confession of fatal torture, wife says
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few nights after investigators say Timmy Cole and
two friends tortured and killed a 17-year-old girl and left her
body in a creek, Cole cuddled in bed with his wife about 40 miles
away. The lights were dim. A compact disc player filled the room
with romantic music. Cole and his teen-age bride, Tabitha, decided
to swap secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Tabitha, I've cheated on you,''' the bride said
Friday. ``I said, `With who?' He said, `You don't have to worry
about that. She's dead now.'''
</P>
<P>
   This bit of pillow talk began a sequence of events that led
investigators to a creek at the bottom of a ravine in Morgan County
days later. There they found the body of Krystal Gayle Archer, with
broken bones, bruises, stab wounds and burns. Her assailants
tortured her over several days before one of them slit her throat.
The authorities lodged murder charges against two Covington men,
21-year-old Cole and 19-year-old Michael Teal, and a woman,
Danielle Hubbard, 18, formerly of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral ceremonies were held for Archer on Friday night in
Danielsville, about 20 miles north of Athens. Among the mourners
was Timothy Halloway, 18, of Athens, a former Clarke Central High
School classmate. ``I found out she was gone and I worried she
might have been dead,'' he said. When Halloway learned Krystal had
been killed, he ``just got in my car and drove back to Clarke
Central and places we hung out.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have struggled to find a motive for the killing
since they discovered Archer's body on Tuesday. But Tabitha Cole,
who gave birth to her and her husband's first son eight months ago,
thinks her release from a youth detention center created an awkward
tension his friends set out to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Her view is the second time that jealousy has been raised as a
possible motive in Archer's slaying. Police say Archer's three
friends turned on her when they were in a Morgan County pasture
looking for hallucinogenic mushrooms. They say Danielle Hubbard was
jealous because she thought Archer had been ``eyeing'' her
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   But Tabitha Cole leans more on the timing than the jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Around the time of the killing, she said, her 126-day stay at a
youth detention center ended. She said a judge sent her there for
violating a condition of probation _ she was arrested for
shoplifting while on probation in juvenile court for running away
from home. She said she was released in the first week of August
from a center in Emanuel, Ga. It was about this time or shortly
afterward _ authorities have had difficulty firmly establishing
dates _ that Archer was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why I think all this happened is because I was
coming home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Pam Flaig, said Cole is upset at the notion that her
husband might have killed for the sake of their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just like, `Oh my God! Are they sick enough to do this
for me?''' Flaig said.
</P>
<P>
   Cole brushed aside talk that Hubbard's jealousy triggered the
attack. She said Hubbard ``is far from the jealous type.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Ken Pritchett of Morgan County said Friday that his
detectives have uncovered ``a lot of factors, not just one'' to
explain the vicious attack. He confirmed that Cole told his wife
that he had been having an affair, but that the affair was over and
the woman was dead. He also confirmed Cole's stay in the detention
center.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said his department has obtained hotel receipts that
showed Archer and the three suspects spent the night in a hotel
Aug. 7, leaving after a wake-up call at 10:45 a.m. the next day. He
would not identify the hotel. Investigators first believed the
attacks happened between July 31 and Aug. 4, but Pritchett said
Friday that the attacks probably began on Aug. 8 and ended on Aug.
11 when Archer's throat was slit.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said her husband later told an odd story about the death.
He told her that ``some dude named Lance'' called him to say that
he had ``raped and killed Krystal and left her in a cow pasture in
Madison.'' She said she asked her husband about Lance. He said he
didn't know anyone named Lance. She asked how ``some dude named
Lance'' would even know his telephone number. He said maybe the
killer found it in some of Archer's belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe it at first,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the young couple was visiting friends when
Cole encouraged her husband to tell his story. He did. This time,
however, he added a new detail: He had seen the body and was having
nightmares. How did he know where to find the body? Cole said his
explanation strained credulity: ``Lance'' told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I decided that we needed to tell the police _ when
things didn't add up,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, incredulous family friends who heard Timmy Cole's
story called Tabitha's mother, Flaig. You need to talk to your
son-in-law, they said. He was over here talking about a dead body.
</P>
<P>
   Flaig confronted Cole the next time she saw him: ``I said `So
why don't you tell me about the dead girl?' Timmy just looked like
the blood kind of went out of his body at that moment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   He sat on a couch in Flaig's living room and watched television,
his baby son crawling on the floor, as Flaig peppered him with
questions: Who is Lance? Where is the girl's body? Why haven't you
called the police?
</P>
<P>
   ``He just kept saying `I don't know,''' she said. ``He kept
looking at the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaig said she pressured her daughter to persuade Cole to go to
police, pressure that Cole said she applied with some success.
</P>
<P>
   Tabitha Cole said she and her husband went first to a police
station in DeKalb County. She said Timmy Cole told an officer in
very vague terms about a runaway who had left a suicide note
somewhere. She said the officer said he ``didn't have enough
information to make a missing-persons report'' and that he should
alert authorities in Madison, the Morgan County seat, because that
was where the runaway supposedly vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Cole said, her husband drove her to Madison County on the
pretext of talking with investigators. She said she did not realize
at the time that the town of Madison, where Archer was killed, was
miles away in Morgan County. She said she thinks her husband drove
her to Madison County even though he knew investigators there would
know nothing of the case.
</P>
<P>
   She said he stopped the car in Madison County in front of ``an
old schoolhouse'' that was ``something out of the `Little House on
the Prairie.''' She said he was inside for an hour-and-a-half and
emerged to announce that an officer told him to drop the matter
because ``Lance'' had turned himself in and the woman's body had
been found. She said it ``never crossed her mind'' that she was not
really at a police station even though she saw no sign or flag out
front and no police officers and sheriff's deputies going in and
out.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned to metro Atlanta, Cole said, her mother was
furious. She wondered whether they had gone to police at all. She
demanded proof _ a business card, a receipt, something. The young
couple set out again. Cole said her husband went to police in
Rockdale County and even swung by the traffic court in Conyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was taking me everywhere but where we needed to go,'' she
said. ``I told Timmy `We've got to go to Madison.'''
</P>
<P>
   They got off the interstate in the afternoon. He pointed to a
spot beyond a cow pasture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `That's where her body's at right there,'' Cole said.
``That's when something clicked in my mind: He's sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators arrested Cole and the two other suspects Tuesday.
Each is charged with felony murder and aggravated assault. Cole
said the crime's brutality shocked her. She said she does not want
to see her husband and the two other defendants executed if they
are convicted _ a veteran officer said ``if this is not a death
penalty case, I've never seen one.'' But Cole admits she might feel
differently if she were not married to one of the suspects and
friends with the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say I'd never met them before and was just watching the
news,'' she said. ``I'd say they need to fry.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel and the Palestinians, prodded by the presence
of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, agreed Friday night to a
sweeping peace deal which envisions finalizing the borders between
them and resolving the future of Jerusalem in one year.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Friday night by Albright, who spoke with the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, at her side at his offices in
Gaza City, also calls for the completion of a land-for-security
agreement signed last fall in Wye, Md., which had been stalled
until the coming to office of the new Israeli prime minister, Ehud
Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The central element of the new agreement is a plan to negotiate
a conceptual ``framework'' for a permanent settlement between
Israel and the Palestinians by February 15, 2000 and the conclusion
of detailed talks by next September.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement called on both sides to refrain from taking
unilateral action, which is understood to mean that the
Palestinians will not unilaterally declare statehood before a peace
accord is reached and that Israel will not build new Jewish
settlements in the West Bank or Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat had repeatedly declared over the past year that if no
agreement was reached , he would declare a Palestinian state by May
2000, the date on which the original Oslo agreements were to
conclude with a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's agreement did not explicitly describe what sort of
Palestinian entity would be established at the end of the process,
leaving that to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   On the land-for-security aspects of the Wye agreement, the
Israelis agreed to cede control over another 11 percent of the West
Bank in three stages _ in September, November and by January 20 _
said a senior American official. Israel has already withdrawn from
27 percent of the West Bank.
 &UR;  &LR; The last major hurdle in the negotiations leading up to Friday's
agreement was the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released
from Israeli jails. In the end, Arafat abandoned his demand for
400, and accepted Israel's offer to release 350, a senior Israeli
official said. Israel resisted releasing Palestinians ``with
Israeli blood on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   After an intensive display of Middle East brinkmanship in the
past several days, the agreement Friday night came after the
veteran American envoy for the Middle East, Dennis Ross, spent the
day with the Israelis working on on the language of the deal, and
after the document was taken to Arafat by Albright.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton hailed the agreement, saying,
``It shows that when both sides are willing to work together, their
fundamental requirements can be met, confidence can be built and
the process can move forward.''
 &UR;  &LR; A signing ceremony was scheduled for Saturday night, after the end
of the Jewish Sabbath, with Albright, the Egyptian president, Hosni
Mubarak, and the Palestinian and Israeli leaders at the Egyptian
resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on the Sinai seacoast.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a stifling hot reception room at Arafat's
headquarters in Gaza City, with her back to a huge painting of the
Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, Ms. Albright praised both sides for
working together to reach a forward looking agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have seized a historic opportunity to tackle the issues
that will define their peace together for generations to come,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the secretary of state, who spent 3 1/2 hours
with Barak in the small hours of Friday morning, gave the two sides
a deadline to work against, and prodded them by her presence to
overcome the last obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   In line with Barak's request that the Americans play a more
modest role in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations than in the
past three years, Albright's spokesman insisted before she left
Washington for this trip that it would be only to ``take stock.''
While the two sides had done the bulk of the work in more than 15
negotiating sessions before she came with the State Department's
top team of negotiators, her presence pushed the Israelis and
Palestinians over the finish line Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the usually forceful Albright remained anxious to
stress that she was not a mediator, perhaps not even a facilitator,
but something even more lowly. ``Perhaps I should not introduce a
new term into all this, but maybe I was just the handmaiden,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Friday night gives Albright a boost as she
travels to Syria on Saturday to meet with the Syrian leader,
Hafiz-al Assad, in an effort to persuade him to restart
negotiations with the Israelis that broke off three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has expressed eagerness to settle with Syria but Assad's
apparent initial enthusiasm when the Israeli prime minister first
assumed office appears to have waned in recent weeks. With a
successful Israeli-Palestinian negotiation in hand, Albright will
be hoping that Assad does not want to be left out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   The central conflict in negotiating the modifications to the Wye
accords of last fall has been the competing longer term aim of
Barak and the shorter term goal of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   For Arafat, getting the transfer of West Bank land from Israeli
to Palestinian control that was pledged in the Wye agreement but
was stalled by the former Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, has been an essential short term goal. By accomplishing
that he can get more West Bank land and win the release of more
prisoners, Arafat can show his people that some progress has been
made in negotiations with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak, the relinquishing of land _ 11 percent more of the
West Bank _ was not as enticing as getting the start of a process
that will determine the permanent relationship between Israel and
Palestinians and help shape an overall peace agreement that covers
Syria and Lebanon. The start of final status talks means dealing
with the biggest problems of all: the status of Jerusalem, the
return of refugees and the permanent boundaries of Israel in regard
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   A key element of the accord finalized Friday night is the
February 15 target for a framework _ something like a declaration
of principles _ for this final status agreement. The nitty gritty
details of the framework would be completed sometime by September.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat had been reluctant to set the February date, fearing that
if such a framework was agreed upon early in the new year Barak
would feel free to turn his attention away from the
Palestinian-Israeli relationship and look instead toward
negotiating with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point, apparently one of the last, was Arafat's
desire to be able to take such ``unilateral action'' as threatening
to declare a Palestinian state. He used this threat as leverage
earlier this year _ by pledging to delay the declaration of a
Palestinian state last May, Arafat won a promise from President
Clinton that he would call a summit of Middle East leaders within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Without being specific, a member of Arafat's cabinet, Nabil
Shaath, the Minister of Planning, said Friday night that the
Americans had been helpful to the Palestinians on this matter in
``letters of assurance.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials indicated Friday night that the redeployment
of Israeli troops would begin within 10 days. Two further
redeployments would take place on Nov. 15 and Jan. 20, they said.
</P>
<P>
   These moves would leave 40 percent of the West Bank under full
or partial Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   The release of 200 Palestinian prisoners would also take place
within the next 10 days with another 150 released in early October,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Israeli prime minister's office, Haim Ramon,
said Friday that the dispute on how many Palestinian prisoners
would be released was settled on Thursday when the Israelis told
Albright that they would not agree to the Palestinian demands for
400 released prisoners instead of the 350 offered by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we would release 200 in September and 150 in October
and in the future will consider more,'' Ramon said. If the
Palestinians did not accept the offer, the Israelis had threatened
to release only 102 prisoners, the number the Israelis said was
required under the original Wye accords.
</P>
<P>
   The question of the number of prisoners had become highly
charged because the Israelis said they would not release
Palestinians charged with killing Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   After the signing of the agreement on Saturday, work is set to
start on opening safe-passage routes across Israel that will allow
Palestinians to travel between the West Bank and Gaza, a move
intended to enhance economic development in both places. As well,
construction of a seaport in Gaza, which was called for in the Wye
agreement but never got off the ground, will also start.
</P>
<P>
   The talks for the framework agreement on the final-status issues
are set to begin at once, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The target date of Feb. 15 is ambitious, officials said. But by
focusing on an early date, an American official said it was hoped
to focus both sides on the final outcome of how Israel and the
Palestinian lands would be shaped. Israeli officials said the
framework would also serve to defuse the threat of a unilateral
Palestinian declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The framework agreement would deal with the biggest issues like
borders, Jerusalem, water rights and the return of refugees in a
broad sense, with the details to be completed by next September.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to work toward final status within a definitive
time frame changes the focus from incremental deals _ which is the
essential nature of the Wye accords _ to what is expected to be the
final round  &QC; of negotiations that will end the conflict between the
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began the incremental road in 1993, but everyone has been
positioning for the endgame,'' said David Makovsky, executive
editor of The Jerusalem Post. ``Six years later, it looks like
we're finally there.''

C.E. PERRY, 62, FIRST HEAD OF FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL U.

<P>
   Charles Perry, who turned an abandoned airfield on the fringes
of the Everglades into Florida International University, died on
Monday at his home in Rockwall, Texas. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, according to a statement released by the
university.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who was the first president of the university, from 1972
to 1975, was hired by the Florida Board of Regents in 1969 to turn
Tamiami Airport into the first public university in the Miami area.
His first office was in an empty control tower. Classes began in
September 1972.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Florida International, Perry was the chief
executive at two corporations, Golden Bear International, the
golfer Jack Nicklaus' sports marketing and merchandising company in
North Palm Beach, Fla., and Family Weekly Publications. In 1993, he
became the dean of the Graduate School of Management at the
University of Dallas in Irving, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Edward Perry was born in Logan, W.Va., and earned
bachelor's and master's degrees from Bowling Green State University
in Ohio. He was an administrator at Bowling Green in 1967 when Gov.
Claude Kirk of Florida hired him to become his special assistant
for education. Two years later, Perry, who was known as Chuck, was
assigned the task of building FIU.
</P>
<P>
   The university has grown from 5,600 students in 1972 to 31,500
students today.
</P>
<P>
   Perry is survived by his wife, Betty; a son, Tom, of Dallas; a
daughter, Lynette Perry McCollum of New York City; a brother, Jim
Perry of Miami; his mother, Ethel Perry of Tequesta, Fla., and a
granddaughter.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE MAN AT MICROSOFT; OR HOW HIGH THE MOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an Editorial Observer for Saturday,
Sept. 4:
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July, the value of Bill Gates' Microsoft holdings reached
roughly $100 billion. That is a very round number, so round, in
fact, that it would take an American earning the approximate median
income _ $50,000 a year _ 2 million years to equal it. Or, to put
it another way, it would take 2 million Americans earning the
median income to raise the same sum in a single year. It is hard to
see a man when he is surrounded by the corona of that much wealth.
It renders his personality, dark in the best of us, more than
usually opaque and hard to read. It makes Gates, the mere man, an
ironic figure who, no matter how modestly he carries himself, is
always being mocked behind his back by the golem of his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article, Newsweek portrayed Gates as a scarcely
credible figure plagued with his own brilliance. But the article
also suggests the infantilizing behavior Gates has had to put up
with as his fortune has grown, the sly attention with which people
watch him wherever he appears, waiting to see if he laughs or howls
or lights up with paternal joy when a baby is flung into his arms _
or a pie into his face. Whatever dignity he once may have had his
money has taken from him.
</P>
<P>
   The question $100 billion raises is not ``Does he deserve it?''
but ``Did he intend to earn it?'' Gates has been described as
fiercely competitive, a phrase that, in the '90s, has become the
blandest of compliments. Fiercely competitive does not quite cut it
as a modus operandi for becoming the richest person in the world.
Luck, the ungovernable role of circumstance, has had its way with
this man, and the disparity between intention and chance is one
source of the mystifying air that seems to surround him.
</P>
<P>
   To all appearances Gates is no swashbuckler, though the Justice
Department, in its suit against Microsoft, has argued strongly that
corporate swashbuckling, beyond the limits of the law, was a
frequent occurrence at the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Wash. The
Justice Department suit has done real damage to Gates' chosen
public role of techno-visionary, but it was damage of a kind that
tended merely to confirm what many in the computer industry had
long felt. Microsoft is now another word for ubiquity, and ubiquity
casts a wide shadow.
</P>
<P>
   It is still too soon to tell what effect Gates' philanthropy
will have on his public image. His recent gift of $6 billion, the
largest philanthropic gift ever, places the assets of the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation at $17.1 billion, second, temporarily,
only to The Wellcome Trust at $19.2 billion. The Gateses have given
$16 billion to their foundation since January. According to The
Chronicle of Philanthropy, the Gates Foundation will have to give
away $2.3 million a day next year just to meet the federal
requirements that govern private foundations. It will be tempting
to try to read the man in the causes he supports. But that will be
no easier than trying to read him against the domineering edifice
of Microsoft or against his 1 billion shares of Microsoft stock.
Some things are larger than character.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 4:

<P>
   The report that scientists have created a smarter strain of mice
by inserting extra copies of a particular gene into fertilized
mouse eggs is a neat technical advance with perplexing
implications. When put through a battery of tests, the mice with
the inserted genes turned out to have superior ability in learning
and memory compared with normal mice. They were better able to
remember the location of a submerged platform, recognize the shape
of objects they had seen before, and associate tones with electric
shocks administered at the same time. The differences were not huge
_ these are no Einstein mice _ but they were measurable.
</P>
<P>
   What the new findings will mean in the long run is uncertain.
Humanity surely has no need for smarter mice _ they are wily enough
already _ so the applications in mouse improvement are apt to be
limited. The next step may well be to experiment with other
mammals, a prospect that opens up some disturbing possibilities.
What if scientists succeed in making chimpanzees smarter than they
already are? Will our vaunted intellectual superiority over other
primates erode to the vanishing point? That could indeed pose a
quandary for the Kansas Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The real question, of course, is whether scientists will be able
to boost human intelligence or at least repair faulty memories
through genetic engineering or new drug therapies. The scientists
who did the mouse study say such gains should eventually be
feasible, but practical results could be years away. At this point,
no one knows whether humans will react the same way as mice, or
whether this particular genetic manipulation is the key to such a
multi-faceted trait as intelligence, or whether manipulating these
genes in humans might cause grave damage in the brain from
unexpected side effects. Such issues will need to be addressed
thoroughly before proceeding _ using, alas, the pokey old brains
that have been given to us.

DOUBLE-EDGE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MELISSA L. JONES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the rest of his family sleeps, 13-year-old Derek Daughetee
begins a 10-mile-long commute to the only school that would take
him.
</P>
<P>
   It took his mom months to find her son the new school after he
was expelled for taking a Franklin Mint collector's knife to Fees
Middle School in Tempe last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants a kid who's been kicked out of school for a weapons
offense.
</P>
<P>
   According to state law, no one has to take him in.
</P>
<P>
   It happens often under a variety of circumstances: A student
brings a weapon to school and the district swiftly disciplines him,
many times with an expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1997-98 school year, 451 seventh- and eighth-graders
were expelled from Arizona schools for different offenses, the most
recent figures available from the state Department of Education
show. More than 1,300 more were kicked out of high school that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Derek's home district, Tempe Elementary School District,
expelled 17 students last year _ five of them for knives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our board wants safe schools,'' said Tempe Elementary
spokeswoman Kathy Bareiss. ``That's our priority. We have to be
responsible for the safety of 12,000 students.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, the September sun is barely rounding the
horizon when Derek unchains his bike from his house, pumps up the
back tire and heads for the city bus stop on 48th Street &UR; in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   By 6:30 a.m., he has his bike on the bus and has begun his
10-mile commute to school _ a city away in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   His 10-hour days begin at dawn. He bikes to the city bus stop a
mile from his house, followed by an eight-mile bus ride to Country
Club Drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fall asleep most of the time,'' Derek said.
</P>
<P>
   He got lost the first day; fortunately he had his grandmother's
phone number, his mom said.
</P>
<P>
   Dismounting at Country Club, he gets back on his bike and rides
about two more miles to school.
</P>
<P>
   He reverses the routine on the way home; he's already had to
wait for the next bus because of the bus' bike rack being full with
two bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Nice drivers have allowed him to pull the bike into the back of
the bus; he usually pulls into his house just before 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the commute isn't as difficult as the search for a new
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one school believes that it was an egregious enough offense
to expel the child, then other schools don't have to take them,''
said Laura Penny, spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Bareiss said the Tempe School District offers parents a list of
charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately run, that
might accept expelled students.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, parents are left to fend for themselves
if a child is expelled, whether for a weapons offense or another
infraction worthy of such punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The state requires children to be in school between the ages of
6 and 16, mandating parents to find a way to get their kids an
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're limited,'' said Penny, who sees the contradiction in
what the state's education laws allow. ``We put ourselves up
against ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows that better than Terri Cobb, Derek's mom.
</P>
<P>
   She spent months explaining Derek's story about the knife to
different school officials. Derek meant to trade it with a friend
for a Gameboy, explained his mom, who said Derek has never had a
disciplinary problem at school.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the other student the knife, but two weeks later the
friend changed his mind on the trade.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the knife back to Derek.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the knife fell out of his backpack.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a suspension, meetings, hearings, letters from
the district office and fears that culminated with Derek's
expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobbs have been fighting the action ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were in trouble but it was too late. We didn't have
an attorney,'' Cobb said. ``We had no idea of what the full effect
of that expulsion meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek missed the last two months of the school year, and the
Maricopa County Attorney's Office filed charges that eventually
were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing months, Derek applied to and was turned away from
several school districts, including Kyrene and Roosevelt.
Interviews with dozens of charter school operators were fruitless
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that would accept him in Mesa were too far away or too
full.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I brought up the weapons thing it was a problem,''
Cobb said. ``That's all they heard when I said `weapon.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even though both of Derek's parents work, Cobb began ordering
information on home schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before school started this August, Life School College
Preparatory, a charter school in downtown Mesa, accepted Derek.
</P>
<P>
   Derek said he likes the school, has made new friends, and has
volunteered for student government.
</P>
<P>
   The school administrators speak kindly of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very confident Derek would be a very good student at
our school. I haven't been proved wrong,'' said David Mackey, site
director of the school. ``If he had pulled a knife on someone, that
would've been different'' said Mackey. ``We're willing to look
beyond rigid guidelines that hurt regular public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Parent and administrative assistant Linda Hill said the school
is lucky to have him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of little Boy Scouts out there are used to carrying
pocket knives. He probably didn't even think of it,'' said Hill.
</P>
<P>
   While Derek is in a classroom, his parents still fight to remove
the expulsion from his educational record in the Tempe district.
</P>
<P>
   The Tempe Elementary administration has asked for a state
Attorney General's opinion on whether the Cobbs can be present
during a closed hearing on their son.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Cobb plans to hand out fliers at an upcoming school board
meeting asking parents to closely examine the district's
disciplinary policy, which she said leaves little room for kids to
make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents have the right to know that their kid could lose the
right to their education. That's not right and it's not fair,''
Cobb said. ``I don't understand how people can be so flippant about
a child's life.'' &QL;

 EDITORIAL: INTRUSIONS ON ELECTRONIC PRIVACY  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 4:
</P>
<P>
   In trying to prevent criminals from using new electronic
technologies in illegal activities, the Clinton administration has
been deaf to the privacy concerns of law-abiding citizens. The
Justice Department argues that electronic surveillance by the
government would hurt only those involved in crime, not the
law-abiding citizen. But erosions of privacy affect all Americans.
As more people use computers and new technology to communicate and
conduct business, balancing the need to protect electronic privacy
against law enforcement requirements is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent examples show the administration's failure to achieve
a good balance. The Justice Department has drafted legislation that
would authorize federal law enforcement officers, with
court-approved warrants, to secretly enter a suspect's home or
office to disable encryption programs on their personal computers
or install devices that can allow investigators to read the
encrypted text. The intent is to thwart the ability of criminals to
conceal information. But the threat to civil liberties may become
substantial as encryption on personal computers becomes common.
</P>
<P>
   Under current wiretap law, law enforcement agencies can seek
court authorization to tap phone lines or to place hidden
microphones in private buildings. More than 1,000 wiretaps are
approved by courts annually, though requests for warrants to use
hidden microphones are rare. Civil liberties groups are worried
that surreptitious entry would become far more common if the
disabling of encryption were to become standard practice whenever a
suspect is thought to use a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Federal Communications Commission, at the urging
of the Justice Department, adopted new rules making it easier for
law enforcement agencies to monitor the movement of callers using
cellular phones. The regulations require that phone companies be
capable of providing general location information at the beginning
and end of any cellular call under surveillance with a court order.
Turning cell phones into tracking devices is an unwarranted
expansion of surveillance power.
</P>
<P>
   The new requirements would also give government agents the
ability, applying to both cell phones and ordinary phones, to
continue monitoring conference calls even after the surveillance
target drops off the call and allow them to determine whether a
suspect is using features like call forwarding and call waiting.
Each of these changes may appear limited in scope. But taken
together, these policies unduly erode privacy protections in the
electronic realm.

One giant leap for humankind
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Gender equality is still a joke. All you have to do is peruse
the Comets' parking lot. There's hardly a Benz or a Bimmer in the
bunch. Probably half the Rockets own cars that cost more than
Cynthia Cooper, the world's finest women's basketball player, pulls
down in a year.
</P>
<P>
   But progress is progress nonetheless. Women's sports _ make that
women's team sports _ have arrived this golden summer, more than a
generation after Title IX forced a measure of fairness upon us.
First, the U.S. soccer team filled Giants Stadium and the Rose Bowl
en route to its dramatic world championship, creating a genuine
hysteria in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Comets, on the brink of a three-peat in the WNBA, have
shown us exactly how tough, resilient and marketable lady jocks can
be.
</P>
<P>
   When little boys come to games wearing Kim Perrot's jersey, you
almost start believing humankind eventually will get it right.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, 40 minutes shy of being called a dynasty themselves,
aren't the old Chicago Bulls. Coop isn't Michael Jordan. They don't
play way above the rim _ but they don't have to, either, to have
proved, beyond any reasonable doubt, they are made of the same
right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Not better stuff, mind you. Just the same stuff. A professional
athlete is a professional athlete, regardless of the size or shape
of the package he or she comes in. A great middleweight boxer is no
less deserving of respect than a comparable heavyweight, is he?
Pound for pound, so to speak, the Comets are every bit as worthy of
adulation as the Bulls. And perhaps, under these saddest of
circumstances, even more so.
</P>
<P>
   For the Comets to be one victory from another title after what
they've been through the last few weeks makes a powerful statement.
We can't say how a men's team would have coped with the Perrot
tragedy because no men's team ever had to confront the death of a
beloved, highly valued teammate just as the playoffs were about to
get under way.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? Should the Liberty players, perish the
thought, roar back and steal two from the champs on their own
floor, that would make an equally powerful statement about the
strength of their character and will. No matter what happens over
the next 48 hours, it's going to be a win-win deal for the WNBA and
women athletes everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Image-wise anyway, if not financially. In time, though, the
money might come, too. Women CEOs are just now starting to pull
down the seven-figure salaries. And, probably not coincidentally,
it seems most women CEOs played some sort of a team sport when they
were young.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Billie Jean King, then the world's best female tennis
player and arguably sport's most ardent pioneering feminist, told
Sports Illustrated's Frank Deford: ``It really doesn't matter how
much I do, or what Chris Evert does, or Peggy Fleming. Until women
have a successful professional team game, we'll always be
second-class in sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean, Mother Freedom, has to be smiling today. There's
nothing second-class about the Comets, whose two-going-on-three
championship banners are tapestries made of discipline,
cooperation, camaraderie, sound basketball fundamentals and no
small amount of God-given ability.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they got game.
</P>
<P>
   Professional also implies adult. Most of the soccer players were
women, not girls. A couple had kids of their own as, of course,
does the Comets' Sheryl Swoopes. And Cooper is 36 years old. You
don't look at Coop and think how cute and huggable she is. Instead,
you see a crafty, battle-tested, take-charge, no-bull leader. You
see someone you want in the foxhole beside you.
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Thursday night, she did unto the Liberty what
Jordan always did unto his overmatched rivals. Coop grabbed the
game by the neck and made it hers. She would not let the Comets
even contemplate defeat as an option. We can count on more of the
same from her in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-pubescent gymnasts and ice skaters and teen-age tennis
queens have in some ways hindered our perception of female
athletes. When a sport is dominated by a child or a childlike
person, it's easy to dismiss it as child's play. But there's no
mistaking that the ``W'' in WNBA really does mean woman.
</P>
<P>
   And winner, too. The 3-year-old league offers superb value and
entertainment for male and female fans. The novelty aspect has
mostly worn off. For the regular customers, the real Comets
crazies, it's about the hoops now, nothing else, the same as
watching the Rockets. The Comets might be women, but they are
ballplayers first and foremost.
</P>
<P>
   We have at least come that far.

QUAYLE PINS HOPE ON N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES AND CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to salvage his foundering campaign, GOP presidential
hopeful Dan Quayle will pour much of his total effort into winning
the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, who recently took a licking in the Iowa Straw Poll and
has been stumbling in other statewide and national polls, said
recently he's reshuffling his effort to highlight the Granite
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next couple of months, I'm going to focus on New
Hampshire because I feel if I can win New Hampshire, then I've got
a decent chance of winning the nomination,'' Quayle told ``The
Arizona Republic.'' ``We're going to be spending a lot of time up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Quayle campaign in Iowa, where caucuses in late January or
early February will be the first solid test for the candidates,
will now be mostly a grass-roots effort, said Kyle McSlarrow,
Quayle's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Staff direction and appearances by Quayle and his wife, Marilyn,
will be concentrated in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   One campaign observer said Quayle's focus away from Iowa shows
Quayle is still having trouble gaining traction on the competitive
GOP campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaving Iowa smells like a measured retreat,'' said Sherry
Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at Claremont University in
California.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jeffe, Quayle has been haunted by the twin demons
of a front-loaded campaign schedule and a damaged personal image.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I think the front-loading (did) was leave
Dan Quayle not nearly enough time to turn his image around,'' Jeffe
said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire primary, which follows the Iowa contest by a
week, now appears to be Quayle's best chance of scoring well enough
to revive his faltering fund-raising effort, McSlarrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is making several moves to breathe life into the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He has moved his press secretary, Jonathan Baron, from Phoenix
to Washington, D.C., to be closer to the New England region.
</P>
<P>
   And he's preparing to rev up his rhetoric, spotlighting such
talking points as his experience in office and his support of big
tax cuts, McSlarrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle will show how he differs on the issues with other
candidates, such as Texas. Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner,
McSlarrow said, but he will not attack them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a slash-and-burn candidate,'' McSlarrow said. ``He's
not going to get personal on George W. Bush. But he is going to
tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll also try to ratchet up his fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 14, Quayle suffered a debilitating defeat in the Iowa
Straw Poll, where he came in eighth among the nine candidates who
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   And he's doing poorly in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll this week by Franklin Pierce College and WNDS-TV,
Quayle garnered 4 percent among New Hampshire Republicans. The poll
had a margin of error of 6 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the Iowa Straw Poll, Quayle had put much of his effort
into that state.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is not alone in his sharp focus on New Hampshire. Arizona
Sen. John McCain has also made a push there, recently barnstorming
through the state by bus.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is besting Quayle, however, running second to Bush in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also outdoing Quayle in South Carolina, where Quayle
has essentially folded up shop. &QL;

HEIRS SELL ARTWORK ONCE LOOTED BY NAZIS TO CASINO MOGUL STEVE
WYNN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the Seattle Art Museum returned Henri Matisse's
``Odalisque'' to the family who lost it to the Nazis, one heir of
collector Paul Rosenberg said she was happy ``his children are
finally coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months later, that particular child found itself up for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   The heirs of French gallery owner and collector Rosenberg have
sold Matisse's 1928 oil painting to casino mogul Steve Wynn, owner
of the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Feldman, spokesperson for the Bellagio, confirmed the
painting is on view in the hotel's gallery. Asked how much Wynn
paid for the painting, he said, ``We don't discuss from whom we buy
paintings, to whom we sell them or any of the prices paid in any
transaction.'' The painting is valued at more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Confiscated by the Nazis from Rosenberg in 1941, the painting
turned up at New York's Knoedler Gallery in 1954. The gallery sold
it to Seattle collectors Virginia and Prentice Bloedel without
telling them about the Rosenberg connection, says museum
spokesperson Linda Williams. The Bloedels hung it in their living
room until donating it to the Seattle Art Museum in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The location of the painting came to light after it was listed
as ``whereabouts unknown'' in Hector Feliciano's 1995 book, ``The
Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest
Works of Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg heirs sued the museum in 1998 to get the painting
back. The museum agreed to return the painting after receiving a
report on the painting's provenance by the Holocaust Art
Restitution Project of B'nai B'rith, which investigates Jewish
cultural losses during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was the first against an American museum concerning
ownership of art looted by Nazis during World War II. When the
museum agreed to return the painting, Elaine Rosenberg told The New
York Times she was happy for her deceased father-in-law. ``His
children are finally coming home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn's Bellagio is home to a notable collection of impressionist
and post-impressionist painting, from Monet to Matisse, as well as
contemporary work from Robert Rauschenberg, Dale Chihuly and Roy
Lichtenstein. The collection is valued at $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Gates, director of the Seattle Art Museum, said the
Rosenbergs weren't interested in working out a deal letting the
museum retain the painting. ``It belongs to them; they can do with
it as they choose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is suing the Knoedler Gallery, contending it sold the
painting to the Bloedels under false pretenses. Knoedler Gallery
attorneys deny the gallery is liable.
</P>
<P>
   Odalisque timeline
</P>
<P>
   1928: Matisse finished ``Odalisque'' and sent it to the
Bernheim-Jeune Gallery in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   1929: Purchased by a Mrs. Bevan (first name unknown) and brought
to New York.
</P>
<P>
   1937: Paul Rosenberg purchased it from her and brought it back
to Paris as part of his personal collection.
</P>
<P>
   1940: Rosenberg sent all his art holdings to storage in southern
France, hoping to protect them from the Nazis. He and his family
leave Paris for New York.
</P>
<P>
   1941. Nazis seize Rosenberg's collection.
</P>
<P>
   1942: Along with another Matisse and Gauguin's ``Yellow
Christ,'' Nazi leader Hermann Goering traded ``Odalisque'' to
dealer Gustave Rochlitz for a 16th century French painting.
</P>
<P>
   1948: Rochlitz testifies that ``Odalisque'' was lost on a train.
His statement is considered untrustworthy, as he was known to trade
with the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   1954: New York's Knoedler Gallery records its purchase of
``Odalisque'' from the Drouant David Gallery in Paris. How the

RANGERS DOUBTERS GET ONE MORE DAY TO TAKE A REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Here's exactly what you were thinking:
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it. The Rangers are going to blow it. Lose three out of
four to the stinkin' Tigers and now the White Sox, another lousy
team in town, and everyone knows the Rangers play like spit against
bad teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen's showing its true colors. All that success had to
be too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody hits in the clutch. Juan's chasin' those outside
breaking balls again. They can't catch a fly ball. And Oates
doesn't know whether he's comin' or goin.' Nothin' he does turns
out right.''
</P>
<P>
   That about sums it up, right? Did we miss anything?
</P>
<P>
   Relax, Doubting Thomas. Mix yourself a strong Alka-Seltzer on
the rocks and try to be cool. This is the way September is supposed
to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers dangled another potential disaster in their worried
fans' faces last night at The Ballpark in Arlington, then provided
a soothing tonic for the skeptical masses, roaring back from a 4-1
deficit to pound the White Sox, 10-4, in the opener of a six-game
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, we needed that.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, guys, but we need those continued assurances that this
isn't going to be a rerun of 1996 _ or worse _ when the Rangers saw
a nine-game mid-September lead sliced to a single game with a week
to play.
</P>
<P>
   With Oakland's hot breath still sizzling the backs of the
Rangers' necks, there's little room for a meltdown at this stage of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The A's are playing well,'' conceded pitcher John Burkett, who
got himself straightened out in time to win his sixth game. ``They
look like they're going to be on our backs the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't ease the minds of the frantic (un)faithful, who have
been known to panic at the drop of a package of sunflower seeds.
Prodded by the Rangers' loss of three of four in Detroit, they've
already began moving supplies into the storm cellar. By the sound
of the e-mails, the bunker mentality is already kicking in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about what the fans are thinking,'' manager
Johnny Oates said. ``Or the media, for that matter. The fans get a
lot of their thought patterns from talk shows and other media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the fifth-best record in baseball, we're within a
couple of games of New York and Cleveland for the best record in
the league and yet we have people who think, `That's it, they're
done now,' as soon as we lose two games in a row. Eventually we'll
convince them that you don't throw in the towel until it's soaking
wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I wouldn't count on that.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me, oh dubious one, that you didn't tighten up a bit in the
seventh, when the White Sox, trailing by just a run at 5-4,
threatened against left-hander Mike Venafro, who had just come on
for Burkett. Tell me you weren't wondering why Oates wasn't waving
in a right-hander when Venafro hit Liu Rodriguez with a pitch and
Magglio Ordonez came to the plate with runners at first and third.
</P>
<P>
   Any fingernails left?
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you didn't know: Oates had already told struggling
setup man Jeff Zimmerman that he was getting a couple of games off
``to regroup'' after back-to-back shellings in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he didn't touch a baseball tonight,'' Oates said.
``Besides, I liked the way Venafro was throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez, Chicago's best hitter this season, wasn't going to get
a chance to beat the Rangers in that situation. Oates ordered
Venafro to pitch around him, loading the bases for rookie
right-handed hitter Brian Simmons, who then struck out on a 2-2
fastball on the fists.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk one up for Oates.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Venafro's gutsy performance, the Rangers broke the
game open with five more runs in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team is a very comfortable team, a very confident
team,'' second baseman Mark McLemore said. ``We know we're going to
score runs more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everybody wants us to come out and score 15 runs in the
first inning but it's not that easy. There's a big-league club in
the other dugout, too.''
</P>
<P>
   If the first five months of the season have told us anything,
it's that the Rangers are a good team and probably the best in the
West. Is it still possible for them to blow it in September? You
better believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you've got to think,'' Burkett said. ``There's
still a long way to go, and we've got to win a lot more games.
We've had our rough times recently against teams we're supposed to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to remind us. Around here, long memories are the norm,
not the exception.

USC GETS A CHANCE TO PROVE ITSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ Finally, a game. No more stories about how much
quarterback Carson Palmer has improved. How the defense is better
than people think. How the freshman wide receivers will surprise
teams with their speed.
</P>
<P>
   When USC plays Hawaii tonight (9:30 p.m., PDT) at Aloha Stadium,
the Trojans will be able to release all the pent-up
enthusiasm/frustration that has been bottled up since last
December's loss to Texas Christian in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the key to this year,'' said Palmer,
already raising the stakes in a game most of the nation will sleep
through (Eastern poll voters, how 'bout that 12:30 a.m. kickoff?).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to come out and explode,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are brimming with confidence, thanks to their
experience and a year under the belt with coach Paul Hackett.
Outside of these Islands, it might be hard to find someone who
doesn't think they will roll over the hapless Rainbow Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the natives are worried. Just ask new Hawaii coach
June Jones, who is inheriting a program that has an 18-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be playing USC, they're certainly a better team
than we are,'' Jones said. ``There's no question (Hackett) will put
SC back where they want to be. We're overmatched for this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii fans don't feel that way. After selling just 158 student
tickets last season, tonight's game is a sellout of 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's the type of situation that makes a coach uneasy, if not
the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure they'll be excited, but we've been to Notre Dame, which
is a more hostile place,'' cornerback Antuan Simmons said. ``I
don't think it will be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett would never say that. He finds himself in the same
position as Purdue did last year when it played the Trojans in the
Pigskin Classic. A new coach with an NFL background has taken over
a program, and no one is quite sure what he will do in his first
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have (had) nothing to look at,'' Hackett said. ``They have
(had) a year to look at us.'
</P>
<P>
   What goes around comes around, but at least Hackett had talent
last season. Jones has barely scrimmaged because he is so worried
about injuries and his team's poor depth. And he has the mental
baggage of that losing streak. But even that scares Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, that streak is going to be over,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   USC's players aren't nearly as, um, paranoid. They can't wait to
take the field, because they feel this year's team is substantially
improved from last season's. They just want a forum to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about anything as long as we go out there and
play like we can,'' offensive tackle Travis Claridge said. ```We'll
be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a near-unanimous decision around USC. Palmer certainly
believes this could be an excellent venue to start the season. The
new artificial turf in Aloha Stadium had the players downright
giddy, thinking about how fast R. Jay Soward and Co. could be on a
friendly surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every advantage with turf because of our speed on
offense and defense,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   After tonight's game, USC hopes these opinions will be
validated.

TEAM'S OWL `SOLUTION' TO PESKY BIRDS TURNS OUT TO BE A HOOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE HADLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle Mariners broadcaster Dave Niehaus thought he
had it figured out.
</P>
<P>
   The reason you haven't seen sea gulls and pigeons loitering
around Safeco Field, Niehaus told baseball fans, is because
Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo handed over a barn owl to keep a
watchful eye over the Mariners' new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one small problem.
</P>
<P>
   It appears Niehaus knows more about the infield fly rule than he
does about birds.
</P>
<P>
   First, the zoo hasn't supplied the stadium with an owl, said
Ernie Rose, a raptor keeper at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the pest control business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, he said, a barn owl wouldn't do the job. That's
because the owls feed on rodents, not pigeons and gulls.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Mariners searching for answers in what's bound
to become a problem now that they're playing outside.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, pigeons and sea gulls will discover the hot
dogs, pizza, peanuts and other goodies left behind by fans and help
themselves to a feast before workers get a chance to clean it all
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you don't want them doing their business all over
the seats,'' said Rebecca Hale, a spokeswoman with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners worry that, though the birds haven't been a
problem, it's only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   It's a legitimate fear, says Chip Lydum, director of sports
facilities at the University of Washington in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Husky stadium has had problems with sea gulls
invading the stadium once the crowd leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have learned,'' Lydum said of the sea gulls. ``Toward the
end of the game, as the crowd is leaving, they circle the stadium
and swoop in en masse to dine on what's left.''
</P>
<P>
   Crews at Husky Stadium have placed pointed objects at some of
the pigeon's favored perching places, but that's just diverted the
pigeons to other places, Lydum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone had a better idea to deter, especially the pigeons,
we'd love to hear about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, work crews simply clean up after the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Lydum sympathizes with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have six home games,'' he said. ``At Safeco, that's
different. They have 81 home games.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will the Mariners do?
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners originally asked the zoo about a peregrine falcon.
But the Mariners quickly lost interest when they learned that the
falcon was on the endangered species list at the time.
</P>
<P>
   That raised the alarming possibility that the stadium might be
barred by law from opening or closing the stadium roof.
</P>
<P>
   The peregrines have since been removed from the endangered list.
</P>
<P>
   But they aren't likely to be the answer anyway, says Greg
Toffic, curator of birds at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peregrines can eat a pigeon a day _ how much of a dent is that
going to make?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   And peregrines, he said, don't eat sea gulls.
</P>
<P>
   As for Niehaus' confusion, it probably arose because of a
``sketchy'' report that a worker in recent weeks might have seen an
owl or owl's nest at the stadium, Hale said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Mariners did talk to Rose and another zoo raptor
keeper last year about trying to attract a predator to set up
housekeeping at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is at least a nugget of information there that is on the
right track,'' Hale said. ``It just kind of went off the track. I'm
not sure how that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Niehaus was not at work when the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
called Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said the Mariners have a meeting scheduled with the zoo
soon to talk about ways of getting raptors to take up residence at
Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose, the zoo's raptor keeper, said the zoo will be
explaining that it cannot solve the Mariners' potential problem
with sea gulls and pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   The same message was delivered last year, after Rose toured the
stadium and told the Mariners it was unlikely the stadium could
attract a predatory bird.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said he was mortified by Niehaus' mistaken suggestion that
barn owls hunt birds _ ``if it flies, it dies,'' he told fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, within the biology community, it looks like we don't know
what we're talking about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, business owners have been contacting the zoo asking for
the same service provided to the Mariners.

EAST TIMOR VOTES TO BREAK FROM INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update; rewritten throughout.)  (lh) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ After 24 years of brutal occupation by
Indonesia, the people of East Timor, defying a campaign of terror
instigated by the military, have voted overwhelmingly to become an
independent nation, the United Nations announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the Security Council that
voters in the referendum on Monday rejected by 78.5 percent a
proposal by the government of a new autonomous status within
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the totals in the voting were 344,580 against
autonomy, and thus in favor of independence, and 94,388 for
autonomy within Indonesia, which invaded East Timor in 1975 and
annexed it the next year as its 27th province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of East Timor have thus rejected the proposed
special autonomy and expressed their wish to begin a process of
transition toward independence,'' Annan said. In January, President
B.J. Habibie announced that if autonomy was rejected, Indonesia
would end its claims on the former Portuguese colony and simply let
it go free, after a generation of separatist guerrilla warfare in
which 200,000 people have died. The referendum results are not
binding, however. Technically, the referendum was a ``popular
consultation'' whose outcome would have to be endorsed by the
Indonesian Parliament at the end of the year. But most analysts
said political realities would circumscribe the Parliament's
ability to reject the outcome of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   But a surge of violence that has swept through the territory of
800,000 people since the vote could turn a new East Timorese state
into the scene of a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in New York, Annan said, ``What is
important is in the next couple of months that we need to ensure
security and law and order and make sure things do not get out of
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   He again called on Indonesia to ensure security in East Timor.
He said it was too early to say whether a U.N. peacekeeping force
might be needed, but he said ``contingency plans'' were under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the results are out, and the vote is clear as to what the
people of East Timor want,'' he said. ``They have spoken. I hope
that with this message the prointegrationists will realize that
they are at the end of the road and there is no need for any more
senseless violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violence and fear, the successful holding of the
referendum and its unequivocal result were a heady moment of
accomplishment for the East Timorese, an impoverished and poorly
educated people who have not had control of their territory for
hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   Under Portuguese rule, they formed the least valued and least
developed part of an empire, of interest mainly to Catholic
missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   When Portugal set East Timor free in 1975, along with the rest
of its colonies, there was only a brief interlude of local disarray
before Indonesia, a new foreign power bringing a new foreign
language, again took control of the tiny region.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast with Portugal, Indonesia poured resources into East
Timor, but the bulk of the resources went to support the huge
military presence that was needed to subdue a separatist rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   In Dili, East Timor's capital, the announcement of the result
Saturday morning was held in an atmosphere of intense threat as
truckloads of anti-independence militiamen, armed and organized by
the Indonesian military, set up roadblocks and took control of
access to the airport, according to residents.
</P>
<P>
   After months of promising and failing to ensure security, the
Indonesian government had made a new promise on Friday and sent
1,400 more troops from its Strategic Command.
</P>
<P>
   But the shooting, burning, killing and terror of the ragtag
militia gangs may be beyond the control even of the Indonesian
military that created them this year as surrogate spoilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are burning everything,'' said one of 54 U.N. officials
who reached Dili on Friday after having evacuated the southwestern
town of Maliana, which the militias have taken over.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and witnesses said more than 12 East
Timorese had been killed since the referendum. A spokesman for the
United Nations in Dili, David Wimhurst, said that at least four
local U. N. staff members had been killed since Monday and that six
were missing.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear to what extent the violence has been centrally
controlled and organized or what its purpose is. Assuming that the
militias were the creation of the military, which has been
reluctant to cede its hard-fought battleground, they may have
rampaged beyond the control of their masters, said Jusuf Wanandi,
director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
policy institute in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   But if the militias had really intended to derail the
referendum, it is notable that they did not take any of possible
high-profile actions that might have accomplished that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they would have had to do was kill a couple of foreigners
working for the United Nations to halt the referendum in its
tracks,'' said Donald K. Emmerson, an Indonesia specialist at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison. ``So why didn't they?''
</P>
<P>
   After months of intimidation and violence, the militias fell
suddenly silent on voting day, when they could have been severely
disruptive. Instead, nearly 99 percent of the registered voters
turned out in a largely peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Then the killings and intimidation were redoubled. Although the
atmosphere of threat was intense, important targets like the Dili
Museum, where the ballots were counted, were left untouched.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the United States was worried about the
possibility of an evacuation of foreigners from East Timor, the
Navy placed two ships in the South Pacific on alert, ordering them
to be prepared to move within 72 hours' notice, a military official
said. The ships, the cruiser Mobile Bay, which is off Australia,
and the cargo ship Kilauea, have helicopter landing pads and could
be used to ferry evacuees short distances.
</P>
<P>
   Although foreigners and journalists were targets of the
militias' anger and threats, most of the violence appears to
involve local hatreds over the divisive issue of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke rose on Friday once again in Dili from burning houses in
the largely pro-independence Becora neighborhood, which has been
the target of repeated militia attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are running for their lives,'' a resident told The
Associated Press by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse violence was reported from rural areas, including
reprisals against people who had helped the United Nations conduct
the referendum. In Maliana, which has been the scene of some of the
most brutal militia violence, the United Nations reported on Friday
that two of its drivers were killed overnight and that five other
staff members were missing. Thirty-three foreign and local U.N.
workers spent the night in a police station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that the militias are in control,'' said
Wimhurst of the United Nations. ``The militias are running rampant
in the town, and no effort is being made to stop them.''

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ There was a time when 800 runs scored was the
mark of a good offensive team. If a team crossed the plate 800
times over 162 games, it stood a good chance of leading the league
in runs scored and reaching the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more. Standards have been raised in this era of
mind-boggling numbers. So has the Rangers' offensive output.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers blew past the 800-run mark last night in their 136th
game, pounding the Chicago White Sox, 10-4, at The Ballpark in
Arlington. It was the 17th time this year the Rangers have scored
at least 10 runs in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're capable of scoring a lot of runs,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``When you put all those guys together, that's a
pretty good lineup. They put the pressure on the other team every
single inning. Every single inning you look up, there's a guy with
90 RBI staring you in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have scored 805 runs, second in the American League
behind Cleveland's 838. They're on pace to score 958 this season,
which would break the club record of 940 set last year.
</P>
<P>
   Another club record seemingly destined to fall is the one for
home runs. The Rangers hit four last night _ one each by Lee
Stevens, Todd Zeile, Juan Gonzalez and Ivan Rodriguez _ giving them
10 in their past three games.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves them with 195, the third-highest total in club
history. They're on pace to finish with 232, which would smash the
club record of 221, set in 1996. The Rangers' current slugging
percentage of .477 would also be a club record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously that's not our goal, to set a club record for runs
scored or home runs,'' Stevens said. ``You still have to go out and
win games. It doesn't do any good to hit two or three homers and
lose the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But offense gives them a chance, even when the starting pitcher
is getting battered early. Last night, John Burkett allowed eight
hits to the White Sox's first 17 hitters and trailed 4-1 in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez's 32nd home run sparked a three-run fourth off
White Sox starter James Baldwin, Stevens broke a 4-4 tie with his
career-high 22nd home run in the sixth and Rodriguez's 31st home
run got a five-run rally going in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team does a lot of things well,'' said Zeile, who homered
in the second. ``But the thing that's impressive about the offense
is how quickly we change the scope of the game, and it can happen
at any point in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, having watched this offense for four years, knows that
as well as anybody. That's why he knew he still had a chance
despite trailing 4-1 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but feel confident with the bats in those guys
hands,'' Burkett said. ``That's what I was thinking, give those
guys a chance. Get a little rhythm and get on a roll and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox found out what can happen, as if they didn't
already know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left a lot of pitches up, and they punched them,'' Baldwin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Added White Sox manager Jerry Manuel, ``Against a team like
this, when you make mistakes they do damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates' mentor, the late Cal Ripken Sr., was the one who told him
800 runs should be the goal of a good offensive team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a couple of years ago we visited again,'' Oates said.
``He said, `Oatesy, it's time to turn it up to 900.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They did, and, by the latest measure, the Rangers remain an
impressive offensive team.

METS LOSE A TOUGH ONE TO ROCKIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chuck McElroy was trying to tidy up Turk Wendell's
mess Friday night, trying to keep the Mets breathing in extra
innings and trying to do it against his former team.
</P>
<P>
   It was the type of tense spot that gave the Mets their daily
dose of pennant fever. Bases loaded, two out, tie score, 10th
inning, McElroy facing the Colorado team that traded him to New
York five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   McElroy looked as if he might navigate through the minefield,
but one high fastball to Jeff Barry wound up destroying him and the
Mets. Barry belted McElroy's fat pitch over right fielder Roger
Cedeno for a three-run double that lifted the Rockies to a 5-2
victory over the Mets at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to nitpick with the bases loaded,'' McElroy
said. ``I just got beat with my best pitch. It was hit the opposite
way. There is nothing you can do about that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a distressing loss for the Mets, who wasted a decent
start by Orel Hershiser, who used six pitchers and who went 4 for
20 with men on base. So the Mets succumbed to an underachieving
team whose most important news has been that Jim Leyland, the
manager, probably does not want to manage the club next season.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Bobby Valentine scribbled ``darn'' across his desk
calendar after the Mets slipped to 4 1/2 games behind first-place
Atlanta in the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was darn,'' Valentine said. ``We couldn't put an
offensive stroke together. We left guys at third. Orel did fine and
the bullpen did fine up until the end. Two runs just wasn't
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who lead Cincinnati by four games for the wild-card
playoff spot, rely so heavily on their bullpen that they look
stunned whenever the relievers struggle. Wendell pitched for just
the second time in 10 days Friday night, allowed two of three
batters to reach base against him and then complained about being
rested. The reliever said he had lost the touch on his slider and
did not feel smooth in his mechanics without consistent work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the week off killed me,'' Wendell said. ``I'm not
saying Bobby did the wrong thing. I know that there was concern
about us being tired. I was never asked if I was tired. It's
obvious I have to pitch to stay strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendell delighted the fans by slamming the resin bag behind the
mound at the start of the 10th _ his signature move _ but it was
one of the few things he gave them to cheer. The quirky reliever
did not want to challenge Larry Walker, who leads the league in
hitting, and wound up walking him. Walker's athleticism also
crushed Wendell because he was savvy enough and quick enough to
scoot from first to third on Dante Bichette's looping single to
left. Wendell trudged back to the dugout and was fuming after the
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing for me,'' he said. ``It's embarrassing for
the team. It's frustrating. I pitched like garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   McElroy replaced Wendell and struck out Todd Helton for the
second out. Since Vinny Castilla was 0 for 7 off McElroy, Valentine
left the reliever in the game. Castilla walked on a 3-2 pitch to
fill the bases. While the Mets' fans were excited during the tense
at-bat, that turned to exasperation when Barry, a switch-hitter who
had a higher average from the right side, batted from the right
side and slapped McElroy's first pitch to right field.
</P>
<P>
   When McElroy was asked if he knew a lot about his former
teammate, he said: ``Who? Not really. I played against him. He's up
there to swing. He did what he's supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser pitched six innings that were emblematic of one of his
starts. He permitted two earned runs on five hits while striking
out three and walking one. It never looked as if Hershiser was
stifling batters because his fastball did not exceed 85 mph, but he
stopped Colorado on one hit in six at-bats with men on base to
limit the damage.
</P>
<P>
   But, as efficient as Hershiser was, 24-year-old Jamey Wright was
much more durable over eight innings. The Mets scored in the fourth
and the fifth on run-scoring hits from Edgardo Alfonzo and Robin
Ventura, but they had runners on in six other innings against
Wright and did not score. No wonder Valentine wrote ``darn'' next
to September on his desk calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to stay there all month,'' Valentine said, which
is how long the Mets might think about this lost opportunity. &QL;

UCLA ENTERS GREAT UNKNOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ It's a team without tendencies, a team without
history, a team without fingerprints. Not even UCLA coach Bob
Toledo knows how his No. 17 Bruins will react tonight in their Rose
Bowl season opener against Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious to see what happens,'' Toledo said. ``I don't know
this team. I don't know how we'll respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, after winter conditioning, spring practice, summer
workouts and training camp, Toledo knows his team's character well
enough to sense what's coming. He knew, for instance, the Bruins
were ready to pounce on Texas in the 1998 opener.
</P>
<P>
   But the disabled-parking suspensions and several August injuries
have disrupted Toledo's feel for the collective psyche. How will
the Bruins respond to game pressure? How will they react to the
heat and the crowd and the lights?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, spirits were high in training camp, but that doesn't
guarantee harmony if something goes wrong when it counts.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Toledo sure how the Bruins will execute. What happened
last year does not translate. Not without quarterback Cade McNown.
Not without the 11 players (seven starters) who were suspended for
the disabled-parking scam. Not without All-American receiver Danny
Farmer, who probably won't play because of a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will have 14 new starters _ eight on offense, six on
defense _ plus first-timers kicking and punting.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 44 players on the depth chart, 25 are freshmen and
sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   The starting quarterback has minimal experience, his backup even
less. There are two freshmen and a sophomore on the offensive line.
The fullbacks are walk-ons. Farmer's replacement, Freddie Mitchell,
spent most of last season in a cast. The four tight ends combined
for one reception last year.
</P>
<P>
   There are just as many questions on defense. Two of the six
linebackers have game experience. Three of the four cornerbacks are
freshmen. Four of the five safeties are new.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Toledo laughed when informed the Bruins are
four-touchdown favorites. There's no way to predict how they'll
react because so few have played before. There's nothing to
compare, nothing to evaluate. Their history begins tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Are the known quantities, tailback and receiver, enough to
escort the rookies through game pressure and game speed? They can
only guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale is really high right now,'' defensive captain Pete
Holland said. ``The parking issue is closed within the team. We've
worked hard to delete all the things that went wrong (in the
offseason).
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't really a sense of, `Let's make it through the
first two games and then have a big party when the (suspended) guys
get back.' We're ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be true of the defensive line, which is two-deep at
each position and UCLA's most-improved unit. But what of the
quarterbacks, junior Drew Bennett and freshman Cory Paus? Bennett
is more experienced and a great athlete, but his arm is
inconsistent. Paus throws a nice ball, but he makes rookie
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett will start, but Paus will play early _ perhaps the
second or third series. Toledo and offensive coordinator Al Borges
have scripted the quarterback rotation for the entire first half
and three series of the second. At that point, they'll go with the
hot hand.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever it is.

MEMBERS OF UNITEDHEALTHCARE CAN'T GET COVERAGE AT HEALTH MIDWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Members of UnitedHealthcare of the Midwest
health plans can no longer receive full coverage for services at
Health Midwest hospitals and surgery centers in the Kansas City
area.
</P>
<P>
   The change in coverage, which took effect Wednesday, affects
about 184,000 health plan participants in UnitedHealthcare's
19-county Kansas City region, company spokeswoman Mary Nowotny
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowotny and Health Midwest spokesman Dennis McClatchey said
contract negotiations between the two organizations had reached a
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a series of good faith negotiations, the parties have
been unable to reach a mutually acceptable agreement, but the door
remains open,'' McClatchey said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowotny said UnitedHealthcare ``continues to seek contracts with
Health Midwest hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   The change affects six Health Midwest facilities: Overland Park
(Kan.) Regional Medical Center, Independence (Mo.) Regional Health
Center, Medical Center of Independence, Lafayette Regional Health
Center in Missouri, Surgicenter of Kansas City, Mo., and
Surgicenter of Johnson County in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   The change also may affect patients' access to doctors who have
admitting privileges at those Health Midwest facilities, unless the
doctors also affiliate with hospitals that remain in
UnitedHealthcare's network.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealthcare members have never had full access to Health
Midwest's entire network of 16 hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The change affects members of all UnitedHealthcare plans,
including health maintenance organizations, point-of-service plans
and preferred provider organizations. The impact of the change
depends on which type of plan you are in. For more details, call
the company's toll-free member services number at (800) 627-0607.
</P>
<P>
   Nowotny said UnitedHealthcare members retain full access to 25
hospitals and 2,600 physicians in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   Health Midwest is the Kansas City area's biggest health system.
UnitedHealthcare of the Midwest is based in St. Louis and is part
of the Minneapolis-based UnitedHealth Group.

CHREBET TO MISS 6 WEEKS WITH BROKEN FOOT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It was supposed to be a critical look at
a backup quarterback, but Friday night's final preseason game
turned out to be costly for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Chrebet, one of the top receivers in the National Football
League, was lost for six weeks when he broke his left foot during
the Jets' 38-17 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. Chrebet was
injured when he tried to cut on the artificial turf. Chrebet, who
has never missed a regular season game in four years, limped to the
sidelines and was take to the locker room, where his parents met
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the preseason is over, glad to end on a good note, a
victory,'' coach Bill Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Parcells would not speculate on who would replace
Chrebet, it will probably be the Quinn Early, who caught 3 passes
for 124 yards, including a 79-yard touchdown and who will share
time with Dedric Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde said Chrebet was ``a little bummed out, a
little upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rick Mirer, getting a big chance to back up
Testaverde, engineered the Jets to four straight touchdown drives _
three by passes _ after entering the game in the third quarter. It
was Mirer's first Jets appearance in more than a mop-up role and,
because of his greater experience, probably solidified his position
as the club's No. 2 quarterback if Testaverde were sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, who had never enjoyed consecutive winning exhibition
seasons until last year, finished the preseason with three
victories in a row, and they now have a preseason record of 10-2
under Parcells. His overall exhibition record is 45-16.
</P>
<P>
   During most of the first half Friday night the Jets' offense and
defense found themselves in rare circumstances: they were being
outplayed. The swift Vikings' defense pressured Testaverde from the
opening drive. Often, Pro Bowl defensive lineman John Randle was in
the backfield after having outmaneuvered rookie guard Randy Thomas.
Randle was incessant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Vikings' offense made its patented big play, the
type that helped set a league scoring record last season. In taking
a 10-9 halftime lead, the Vikings made the most of the Randy
Moss-Aaron Glenn mismatch. Moss is a 6-foot 4-inch, 202-pound
receiver, and a Pro Bowl player. Glenn is the 5-9, 185-pound Pro
Bowl cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Moss took full advantage of his 7-inch, 17-pound differential in
the opening quarter. As the pair entered the end zone, Moss nudged
Glenn enough to throw him off balance. Moss got in front of Glenn
and reached for, and snared, Randall Cunningham's 28-yard pass.
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson showed his mettle Friday night. On one play he
grabbed a Testaverde pass, was hit hard by linebacker Orlando
Thomas, lost his helmet and came up smiling. It was Thomas who had
to be helped off the field in a daze.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson also missed Testaverde end-zone passes on alley-oop
plays on two separate drives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Jets did get three field goals in the half from John
Hall and outstanding receptions in crowds from backup receivers
Early and Dwight Stone. The Vikings' other score of the half was
positioned after Chad Cascadden was flagged for running into the
punter. The infraction kept alive a drive that led to a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer reacted quickly to his final chance as the Jets' backup
when he started the second half. He benefited from having the
first-team offensive line at his disposal. He was 2-4 on his
opening drive, but one of those was a 15-yard touchdown pass to
F-back Keith Byars that lifted the Jets to their first lead. On the
march, Leon Johnson produced a 23-yard run, but the Jets failed to
convert the 2-point attempt and led by 15-10.
</P>
<P>
   After Leon Johnson had returned a punt 42 yards, Mirer needed
only one pass to generate still another touchdown. He connected on
a 28-yarder with Stone. Then Early made a nice grab in the end zone
for a 2-point conversion and a 23-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mirer closed out the quarter by directing still another
touchdown drive that ended with a 2-yard Johnson run to put the
game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Year 3 of the Parcells era officially begins next weekend here
against the Patriots. By then, the T-shirts reading ``Start Over''
will have become collectors' items. The T-shirts were for training
camp. The starting over will have started.
</P>
<P>
   In Parcells' first year running the Jets he inherited a team in
such dire straits that he decided to come up with a motto to erase
the 1-15 record of 1996 _ along with various ghosts, myths and
negative realities about the Jets. He came up with a T-shirt that
read ``Who says we can't?''
</P>
<P>
   And they could, going 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells did not let up on the Jets in last year's preseason,
though. Following the stunning record of 1997, Parcells brought
everyone to camp and showed them the new theme: ``Take the next
step.'' All his coaches and scouts and ball boys and equipment
people wore those T-shirts. It said to the players, last year was
nice, but not far enough.
</P>
<P>
   They went 3-1, the first time in club history the Jets had put
together winning exhibition seasons. And, of course, they produced
a 12-4 regular season that brought them to the American Conference
championship.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT NO. 9999

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There's going to be a lot of hype next week
about the ``string of nines'' factor. Ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   Some wonk who must have looked at computer code for too long
decided a while back that the world was going to have a bad day
Thursday because the date will be 9-9-99. After all, the reasoning
goes, a string of four or six or more 9s was used by some computer
programmers to signal computers to purge a program or to shut a
program down.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning is based on flawed thinking, not flawed computer
code.
</P>
<P>
   Because computers look for six numbers in the date field,
they'll read the date as 09-09-99, not as a string of nines.
</P>
<P>
   We're betting the day goes by with nary a glitch.
</P>
<P>
   However, at least three Year 2000 monitors are using Thursday as
a dry-run test of their abilities to track the bug:
</P>
<P>
   - The United Nations-backed International Y2K Cooperation
Center, a global clearinghouse for computer bug data, will rehearse
a plan aimed at keeping up-to-the-minute tabs on how the world is
faring as it enters 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Reports will be updated in real time on the center's Web site _
www.iy2kcc.org _ and ultimately will reflect information from 170
or more national Y2K coordinators. During the test, 15 countries
will take part.
</P>
<P>
   - U.S. officials will get a first look at a $40 million Y2K
Information Coordinating Center designed to give federal agencies a
round-the-clock view of potential problems. The center also will
share Y2K information with the public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
   - The North American Electric Reliability Council, a trade
organization, will rehearse an emergency drill to test operating,
communications and contingency plans.
Bomb plot
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest threats looming at the end of the year comes
from those who want something bad to happen, experts say. Case in
point: Alfred Reumayr of New Westminster, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old Canadian is suspected of a Y2K bomb plot. He is
charged with attempting to hire a U.S. citizen to blow up energy
supply systems in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in both countries said the man planned to have
explosives detonate at the end of the year to cover his tracks and
throw suspicion on the Y2K bug.
Tidbit
</P>
<P>
   One reader called to ask where she could find the full Y2K
sermon being distributed by the American Bankers Association that
we wrote about last week. Here's a Web site:
www.charlotte.com//banking//docs//0816sermon.htm.
Thanks for the memos
</P>
<P>
   Here's what one major Kansas City law firm is telling its
employees to do to ``minimize possible business interruptions
caused by the Year 2000 computer bug.''
</P>
<P>
   1. Schedule no depositions, conferences, conference calls or
meetings for the first week of January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   2. File any legal documents that must be filed in January before
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   3. Print and copy critical documents to a floppy disk for use
outside the firm.
</P>
<P>

away from the firm. The firm's computer network will be shut down
from Dec. 31 to Jan. 2.

<P>
   Thanks for the memo. We are always looking for local stories
about what people and businesses are _ or aren't _ doing to battle
the bug. Keep those cards and letters coming.
Weapons plan scrapped
</P>
<P>
   In Orange City, Iowa, some people think the sheriff would have
done better to call upon church elders rather than people holding
permits for concealed weapons as a way to mobilize a special Y2K
reserve force.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Jim Schwiesow recently sent letters to the county's 396
registered concealed-weapon permit holders, asking them to help his
department in case of Y2K emergencies. ``This would be strictly a
volunteer pool of trustworthy people that I could summon in dire
times,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Sioux County Board of Supervisors nixed the idea, saying the
county would be liable for the actions of any reserve force.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jeff Sajdak, pastor of Immanuel Christian Reformed
Church, said the sheriff would have been better off calling on a
coalition of people in education, law enforcement and social
services to battle the bug ``than to find everybody with a weapons
permit.''

OF TAX CUTS, A BOY'S BOOK AND SLEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ What better way to say adieu to the
traditional summer season than by allowing the readers to write
today's column and thus give Uncle Fearless the full benefit of a
long holiday weekend?
</P>
<P>
   First up is a reader with a tax-relief proposal that makes a lot
more sense than most anything else you've heard:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the (budget) surplus results from overpayment of Social
Security taxes, why not just cut the Social Security tax? That
would give all the people, poor and rich, an equal tax cut. Of
course the politicians would have to finally tell the truth about
the bogus Social Security Trust Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sensible: This would indeed be the best possible tax cut.
It won't happen, though, because Congress likes the extra money. By
the way, while you're right about such a cut being equal for all,
it would help lower-income workers more than the rich. Most
low-income workers don't benefit from income-tax relief because
they don't pay much in income taxes. They would, however, get
significant relief from Social Security cuts because this tax hits
the first dollar of income.
</P>
<P>
   The following inquiry about money management may be of interest
to others similarly situated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several months ago you wrote an article in which you
referenced a book that you had read when you were a young boy
(about) the power of savings and investments. I am about to start
working with my kids on financial management (and) would like to
know the title and author.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Wondering: It has been nearly a year since I wrote about
the book to which you refer and its profound influence, not on me
but on a valued contributor. The book is The Richest Man in
Babylon, by George S. Clason.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of such matters, another reader isn't sure he's done
the smart thing by avoiding the febrile world of Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say fools rush in while greater fools watch from the
(sidelines)...When asked by friends if I've made money in the
Internet stocks, I simply respond that I'm unfortunately not smart
enough to understand their concept of value.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Cautious: Smart people know that one of the most valuable
things in the world is adequate rest, and thus manage their money
so as to ensure a good night's sleep. Meanwhile, if you're kicking
yourself for not getting rich from the dotcom craze, read some
histories of the 1929-30 market crash. These chronicles are
chockablock with stories of hotshots who got rich quick and then
got poor even quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Space is running out, so we'll wind things up with this
interesting perspective:
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, property taxes need to be abolished. ... In an
agricultural society, where the majority of the people own
property, this is a viable tax. But in the post-industrial,
information society, this tax is an anachronism.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Outspoken: My view has always been that a community's
property owners have the biggest stake in creating a local society
able to provide basic needs such as schools, public safety,
common-area upkeep, and the like. Therefore, the landed gentry
ought to shoulder the biggest responsibility.

SQUABBLE CON TINUES OVER WILDERNESS ACRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Friday, the 35th anniversary of the federal Wilderness ct,
Arizona environmentalists questioned if that is enough.
</P>
<P>
   As Arizona's population doubles over the next few decades, they
say, so should the land placed off limits to roads, vehicles,
buildings and commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience of wilderness epitomizes what environmental
protection is all about,'' said Martos Hoffman, executive director
of the Flagstaff-based Southwest Forest Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   For Darlene Slusher, there is no justification for preserving
more land in Arizona as wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Why, she asks, when the potentially developable private property
in Arizona makes up less than 18 percent of the state, would anyone
want to lock up more of the federal lands, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's God's plan,'' said Slusher, Arizona
spokeswoman for People for the USA, a national group that advocates
ranching, mining and timber cutting on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work with the land. We have to make it produce
something. Otherwise, why is it there?'' Slusher said.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are less cattle grazing and timber cutting than a
decade ago, she said, and it is becoming more difficult for
developers, in both rural and urban areas, to plan and build
without being challenged by their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use it, don't abuse it,'' Slusher said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's wilderness areas include the Superstition Mountains,
east of Mesa; Pusch Ridge, north of Tucson and Red Rock-Secret
Mountain, northwest of Sedona. But environmentalists find it
inconceivable that places like northern Arizona's Grand Canyon and
eastern Arizona's Blue Range Primitive Area are not part of the
wilderness system.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's coalition of 70,000 environmentalists will do an
inventory of the state in the coming months, presenting to Congress
what they hope is a scientifically defensible plan to increase the
amount of wilderness in the state by as much as 6 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean nearly 14 percent of the state would exclude any
motorized vehicles or permanent structures.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Congress is in Slusher's camp.
</P>
<P>
   No new wilderness has been added to Arizona since 1990.
Nationwide, only one wilderness area, Oregon's 20,000-acre Opal
Creek Wilderness, has been added to the National Wilderness
Preservation System since Republicans took control of Congress in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., announced the formation
of a new bipartisan ``wilderness caucus'' in the U.S. Senate.
Feingold was joined by former Sen. Gaylord Nelson, the founder of
Earth Day, in pursuing a new generation of nature-savvy lawmakers _
akin to Arizona's late Barry Goldwater and Mo Udall _ who will
consider more lands for permanent protection.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the wilderness system consists of nearly 105 million
acres, or less than 5 percent of the nation. More than half of the
nation's wilderness is in isolated parts of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Wilderness Act was passed in 1964, much of the land in
Arizona was protected as wilderness for its scenic value: the tops
of mountains and the bottoms of canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, whose Forest Alliance includes more than 50 groups from
Arizona and New Mexico, said more lands should be considered for
wilderness designation because of their value as habitat for
threatened and endangered wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The fragmented parcels of wilderness do not reflect the larger
areas most wildlife species need to survive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now beginning to be concerned about preserving
wilderness . . . for its ecosystem and biodiversity potential,''
Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   It's time, he said, to connect the dots. &QL;

COMPLAINT CHALLENGES USE OF WOMEN'S REST ROOM BY MAN UNDERGOING
HORMONE THERAPY FOR SEX CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN HORSLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A group of women in a city engineering office
has filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission over whether an employee who was once a man _ but now
identifies herself as a female _ may use the women's rest room.
</P>
<P>
   The eight women in the Kansas City (Mo.) Public Works
Engineering Field Office mailed their complaint Friday to the
federal EEOC office in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether an engineering technician, who according to
the complaint has started hormonal sex reassignment therapy but has
not yet had a sex-change operation, may use the one women's rest
room in the field office.
</P>
<P>
   The women, who say the city's handling of the rest room
situation is creating an ``intimidating, hostile or offensive work
environment,'' declined to comment further Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleges that the technician worked for the
engineering division as a contract employee for five or more years
before being hired full-time this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point in late 1998 or early 1999, he made it known to
several people that he was going to have a sex change operation,''
the complaint stated. ``By his own admission, he has not done so
yet and it may be quite awhile before he does.''
</P>
<P>
   The technician requested Friday not to be identified. The
technician also declined to comment, except to say: ``As far as I
can tell, everything has been adequately resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary O'Bannon, deputy director of the city's Human Resources
Department, said Friday he had not seen the EEOC complaint and
could not comment. Law Department officials could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A similar case surfaced recently in Minneapolis over whether a
school librarian, who was once named David but is now called Debra,
can use the women's rest room. Another teacher filed a complaint
with the state about having to share the rest room.
</P>
<P>
   The American Center for Law and Justice, founded by religious
broadcaster Pat Robertson, is asking the Minnesota Human Rights
Department to ban the librarian from the rest room.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Frevert, deputy director of Kansas City's Public Works
Department, said officials had met with all the employees involved
in the dispute. He said the city had tried to accommodate both
sides and was spending $30,000 to remodel the rest room.
</P>
<P>
   Frevert said the stalls were to have been made completely
private, with doors from ceiling to floor. But when he visited the
facility recently he said the doors did not reach the floor.
Frevert ordered new doors that will provide ventilation but still
make the stalls private.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our staff will meet with the employees as early as Tuesday
morning and let them know the doors will be replaced at full height
to provide more privacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Documents show the employee's name and gender were legally
changed on the birth certificate in May 1998, saying the employee
was transsexual and had begun living and working as a woman since
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC complaint stated that the technician began using the
women's rest room in the building, to the consternation of the
other women employees. They reported their concerns, and those of
their husbands, to their supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   After meetings with the city's law and human resources
departments, the city began the rest room remodeling. The
technician has temporarily stopped using it, but the women say that
isn't sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the females employed at that time reported that we did
indeed have a problem sharing the female facilities with an
anatomically correct male regardless of what name they went
by....If we were forced to share the rest room we would leave the
building and seek a rest room somewhere else,'' the complaint
stated. ``We requested a separate or unisex rest room be
constructed.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts in the field say that a transsexual's transition to
becoming a woman occurs before surgery. Many doctors require that
the patient first undergo two years of dressing the part and taking
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Most employment complaints, however, are filed by transsexuals
when they feel discriminated against, such as being told they can't
use the rest room that matches their sexual identity, said Sam
Marcosson, a law professor at the University of Louisville.

EAST TIMOR VOTES TO BREAK FROM INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS reaction in grafs 5-8)  (lh) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ After 24 years of brutal occupation by
Indonesia, the people of East Timor, defying a campaign of terror
instigated by the military, have voted overwhelmingly to become an
independent nation, the United Nations announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the Security Council that
voters in the referendum on Monday rejected by 78.5 percent a
proposal by the government of a new autonomous status within
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the totals in the voting were 344,580 against
autonomy, and thus in favor of independence, and 94,388 for
autonomy within Indonesia, which invaded East Timor in 1975 and
annexed it the next year as its 27th province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of East Timor have thus rejected the proposed
special autonomy and expressed their wish to begin a process of
transition toward independence,'' Annan said. In January, President
B.J. Habibie announced that if autonomy was rejected, Indonesia
would end its claims on the former Portuguese colony and simply let
it go free, after a generation of separatist guerrilla warfare in
which 200,000 people have died. The referendum results are not
binding, however. Technically, the referendum was a ``popular
consultation'' whose outcome would have to be endorsed by the
Indonesian Parliament at the end of the year. But most analysts
said political realities would circumscribe the Parliament's
ability to reject the outcome of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   On television Saturday morning, Habibie said he accepted the
results of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie called on his forces in East Timor ``to uphold law,
security, safety and public order,'' and said: ``I also instruct
the entire ranks of the Indonesian armed forces to take firm action
against all sides who attempt to sully the pride of the nation,
undermine the authority of the government and security and public
order.''
</P>
<P>
   Violence has swept through the territory of 800,000 people since
the vote. Its continuation could turn a new East Timorese state
into the scene of a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   A militia leader, Eurico Guterres, told reporters in Dili, ``We
are de- feated diplomatically, but we are not giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in New York, Annan said, ``What is
important is in the next couple of months that we need to ensure
security and law and order and make sure things do not get out of
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   He again called on Indonesia to ensure security in East Timor.
He said it was too early to say whether a U.N. peacekeeping force
might be needed, but he said ``contingency plans'' were under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the results are out, and the vote is clear as to what the
people of East Timor want,'' he said. ``They have spoken. I hope
that with this message the prointegrationists will realize that
they are at the end of the road and there is no need for any more
senseless violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violence and fear, the successful holding of the
referendum and its unequivocal result were a heady moment of
accomplishment for the East Timorese, an impoverished and poorly
educated people who have not had control of their territory for
hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   Under Portuguese rule, they formed the least valued and least
developed part of an empire, of interest mainly to Catholic
missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   When Portugal set East Timor free in 1975, along with the rest
of its colonies, there was only a brief interlude of local disarray
before Indonesia, a new foreign power bringing a new foreign
language, again took control of the tiny region.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast with Portugal, Indonesia poured resources into East
Timor, but the bulk of the resources went to support the huge
military presence that was needed to subdue a separatist rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   In Dili, East Timor's capital, the announcement of the result
Saturday morning was held in an atmosphere of intense threat as
truckloads of anti-independence militiamen, armed and organized by
the Indonesian military, set up roadblocks and took control of
access to the airport, according to residents.
</P>
<P>
   After months of promising and failing to ensure security, the
Indonesian government had made a new promise on Friday and sent
1,400 more troops from its Strategic Command.
</P>
<P>
   But the shooting, burning, killing and terror of the ragtag
militia gangs may be beyond the control even of the Indonesian
military that created them this year as surrogate spoilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are burning everything,'' said one of 54 U.N. officials
who reached Dili on Friday after having evacuated the southwestern
town of Maliana, which the militias have taken over.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and witnesses said more than 12 East
Timorese had been killed since the referendum. A spokesman for the
United Nations in Dili, David Wimhurst, said that at least four
local U.N. staff members had been killed since Monday and that six
were missing.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear to what extent the violence has been centrally
controlled and organized or what its purpose is. Assuming that the
militias were the creation of the military, which has been
reluctant to cede its hard-fought battleground, they may have
rampaged beyond the control of their masters, said Jusuf Wanandi,
director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
policy institute in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   But if the militias had really intended to derail the
referendum, it is notable that they did not take any of possible
high-profile actions that might have accomplished that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they would have had to do was kill a couple of foreigners
working for the United Nations to halt the referendum in its
tracks,'' said Donald K. Emmerson, an Indonesia specialist at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison. ``So why didn't they?''
</P>
<P>
   After months of intimidation and violence, the militias fell
suddenly silent on voting day, when they could have been severely
disruptive. Instead, nearly 99 percent of the registered voters
turned out in a largely peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Then the killings and intimidation were redoubled. Although the
atmosphere of threat was intense, important targets like the Dili
Museum, where the ballots were counted, were left untouched.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the United States was worried about the
possibility of an evacuation of foreigners from East Timor, the
Navy placed two ships in the South Pacific on alert, ordering them
to be prepared to move within 72 hours' notice, a military official
said. The ships, the cruiser Mobile Bay, which is off Australia,
and the cargo ship Kilauea, have helicopter landing pads and could
be used to ferry evacuees short distances.
</P>
<P>
   Although foreigners and journalists were targets of the
militias' anger and threats, most of the violence appears to
involve local hatreds over the divisive issue of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke rose on Friday once again in Dili from burning houses in
the largely pro-independence Becora neighborhood, which has been
the target of repeated militia attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are running for their lives,'' a resident told The
Associated Press by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse violence was reported from rural areas, including
reprisals against people who had helped the United Nations conduct
the referendum. In Maliana, which has been the scene of some of the
most brutal militia violence, the United Nations reported on Friday
that two of its drivers were killed overnight and that five other
staff members were missing. Thirty-three foreign and local U.N.
workers spent the night in a police station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that the militias are in control,'' said
Wimhurst of the United Nations. ``The militias are running rampant
in the town, and no effort is being made to stop them.''

SLAYING IN EAST KANSAS CITY STARTS GORE-SPATTERED CHASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN HOFFMANN AND GLENN E. RICE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 76-year-old woman was slain Friday in her
home, touching off a wild foot chase through eastern Kansas City
that ended with the arrest of the alleged attacker.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly half an hour and more than a mile, a man suffering
multiple stab wounds chased his assailant through afternoon
congestion down quiet residential streets. The commotion unfolded
before astonished residents, and drew in other motorists who joined
the pursuit and helped lead police to the assailant.
</P>
<P>
   The chase ended about three houses from where an 83-year-old man
was found slain Thursday. Investigators are trying to find a link
between that death and the woman killed Friday. Police are
investigating both as homicides, but have not released a cause of
death in either case, pending autopsy results.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed in either case, and police have
established no motives. Police withheld the name of the woman
killed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to police statements and witness accounts, this is
what unfolded Friday:
</P>
<P>
   Officers were summoned at 12:47 p.m. to a house on a report of a
prowler.
</P>
<P>
   As police were responding, a man who lived at the house
returned. He later told police that he found the woman dead inside,
along with an intruder, who was standing near her. The two men
struggled and continued to fight outside, where witnesses said they
saw the suspect stab the other man in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   The fracas spilled onto a road. The suspect broke free and ran
north, armed with a screwdriver for at least a portion of the
chase. The other man, who was bleeding from wounds on his chest and
head, continued the chase.
</P>
<P>
   A woman driving through the area saw the commotion and dialed
911 on her cellular phone. She drove along behind and relayed
information to police dispatchers.
</P>
<P>
   David Krantz, who was returning to his home, spotted the men
running near 11th Street and Belmont Avenue. Krantz jumped out of
his minivan to assist, leaving his frightened wife in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   After the suspect unsuccessfully banged on front doors trying to
get into houses, Krantz and the man with the stab wounds chased him
down an alley and through back yards to the 900 block of Fuller
Avenue. There, the suspect jumped into a truck traveling south on
Fuller. The suspect pleaded for a ride, but Krantz and the wounded
man yelled warnings to the driver, who stopped his truck and jumped
out.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrived moments later and were directed to the suspect by
the woman with the cell phone. An officer captured the suspect as
he tried to flee over a fence in a nearby back yard.
</P>
<P>
   The stabbing victim collapsed, and at 1:10 p.m. an ambulance was
called. Police didn't think his injuries were life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Krantz, 30, said he was going to follow the suspect, despite the
bloody wounds he saw on the stabbing victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to get too close,'' he said. ``I had a cell
phone and was just planning on calling the police.''
</P>
<P>
   At the scene of the initial call, police knocked on the door,
but there was no response. Officers broke through the chain-locked
door and found the body of the woman who lived there, sprawled
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Officers found traces of blood and other evidence that they
believed linked the suspect to the woman's death.
</P>
<P>
   Residents described the woman as a quiet and friendly neighbor
who often spoke to them as they walked past her white, two-story
bungalow. She was often seen gardening, watering her plants or
picking up litter near her front yard.
</P>
<P>
   The chased ended near the scene of another slaying just a day
earlier. On Thursday, police found the body of Frank Holcer, who
was discovered by a friend. Holcer was killed in the home where he
was born in 1915 and had lived ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Police were trying to determine whether the cases were
connected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we are looking at but it's too early for us
to speculate,'' said Officer Russ Dykstra, a police spokesman.
``There may be some parallels with that case and this one.''
</P>
<P>
   One resident said she was troubled by the killings that have
occurred near her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand this,'' said Esther Southern, who lives
across the street from the woman who was killed. ``It's been too
close to home; there's no reason for murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors living near Ninth and Fuller echoed the same concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is too much for me,'' said Merlene Shaw, who watched
police gather on her corner for the second straight day. ``I think
it's time to move.''

KANSAS CITY AREA OFFERS VARIETY OF LABOR DAY WEEKEND EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Renaissance atmosphere, oldies music and
seniors playing golf _ could Kansas City ask more of a Labor Day
weekend?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. Perfect weather in which to enjoy it all might seem
in order, as would cheap gas to get to your destination. One out of
two isn't bad.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday travelers can expect to pay much higher gas prices this
Labor Day weekend than last year, with average Missouri self-serve
prices up 20 cents a gallon to $1.14, and average Kansas prices up
18 cents to $1.18.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Right, spokesman for AAA in Missouri, said a 61 percent
increase in the price of crude oil from a year ago is resulting in
higher prices at the pump. Higher crude oil prices are a result of
the decision earlier this year by the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries to reduce production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems they are sticking to their resolve,'' Right said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the weather is mostly good news. With the
exception of some heavy storms Sunday morning, the long weekend's
weather should be suitable for taking in the host of area festivals
and activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Saturday to early Sunday a storm front will move in,''
said David Beusterien, a National Weather Service meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   But after that, he said, ``it looks to be dry again, with high
temperatures around 80 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, not bad.
</P>
<P>
   Those leaving the metropolitan area will see extra officers
patrolling highways in Kansas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Doug Alexander, public information officer with Troop A
in Lee's Summit, said Missouri troopers would be concentrating on
highways between Kansas City and the lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to have enough of a presence on the roads that
people will see us and slow down, drive more safely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Highway Patrol will be stepping up enforcement, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some additional administrative staff, who are
typically behind a desk, out handling regular patrol duties,'' said
Sgt. Mark Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Patrol will be on the lookout for people who are
drinking and driving and those who are not using their seat belts
or proper child seats.
</P>
<P>
   Highway officials in both states said motorists should not
encounter road construction problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Interstate 70 west of Columbia, a site of recent construction
work, all lanes of traffic will be open for fans going to the
University of Missouri for its football opener this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And in Kansas, construction ``will have a very minimal impact on
holiday traffic,'' said Mick Halter, metro engineer for the Kansas
Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Holst of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources said
state campgrounds, at least in the Kansas City area, are expected
to be full. For more information on camping call (800) 334-6946.
</P>
<P>
   She added that even with full campgrounds, there is a lot
available at the parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hiking trails and beaches and beautiful picnic
areas,'' she said. ``And Watkins Mill has a fabulous museum.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are the festivals and other events,
including the PGA Senior Tour's stop in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   - The second and third rounds of the TD Waterhouse Championship
golf tournament will be today and Sunday at Tiffany Greens Golf
Club. Play will begin at 8 a.m. both days. ESPN will begin its
television coverage of the event at 2 p.m. today and 4:30 p.m.
Sunday. Among the 84 senior golfers _ age 50 or older _ who have
committed to play are Hale Irwin, Gay Brewer, Bob Charles, Jim
Colbert, Don January, Jim Thorpe and Kermit Zarley.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the event are $20 per day. They may be bought at Hen
House supermarkets or at the Tiffany Greens gate.
</P>
<P>
   - The annual Renaissance Festival of Kansas City begins its 23rd
year today in Bonner Springs. The festival will run from 10 a.m. to
6:30 p.m. on weekends (including Labor Day and Columbus Day)
through Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to old favorites, such as turkey legs and wandering
minstrels, the festival this year will offer a vegetable toss and
human chess match. Admission is $12.95 for adults and $5.95 for
children ages 5-12. Children younger than 5 are admitted free.
Parking is also free. The festival is just off Interstate 70 and
Kansas 7.
</P>
<P>
   - In the heart of the city, the 1999 Spirit Festival continues
today and Sunday evening. The festival, which opened Friday, runs
from 4 p.m. until midnight both nights. It features a collection of
bands, ranging in styles from country western to Christian to
disco. A few of the names include KC &AMP; the Sunshine Band, Rick
Springfield and the Violent Femmes.
</P>
<P>
   The festival takes place around the Liberty Memorial in Penn
Valley Park. Admission is $10, although children younger than 12
and adults older than 62 get in free.
</P>
<P>
   - In Independence, Mo., Santa-Cali-Gon Days continue through
Monday on the Independence Square.
</P>
<P>
   The festival gets its name from the fact that Independence was
once the trail head for the Santa Fe, California and Oregon trails.
It's open between 10 a.m. and 11 p.m. today and Sunday, and until 6
p.m. Monday. Admission is free, although there are charges for
carnival rides.
</P>
<P>
   The festival offers music shows, arts and crafts booths,
historic re-enactments and dance demonstrations. In addition, the
festival offers contests in ice-cream eating, watermelon-seed
spitting and root beer chugging.

EVIAN TO FLOW INTO BEACHES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A little bit of the French Alps may be coming
soon to a beach near you.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors is set to vote to approve a
two-year contract with Evian Natural Spring Water, making it the
``Official Bottled Water Sponsor of the Los Angeles County
Beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract includes an optional three-year extension and board
approval is expected, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For Evian, it's less about tapping into the allure of Southern
California's sun-drenched, bikini-flecked beaches, and more about
profiting from the dry climate and Californians'
health-consciousness, said Evian spokesman Michael Neuwirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no `Baywatch' fantasy going on here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   California is the largest bottled water market in the United
States, consuming one-quarter of all bottled water sold in the
country, Neuwirth said. Evian is the largest supplier of imported
bottled water in the United States and the largest bottled water
company in the world, selling 1.4 billion liters a year in 120
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' beaches, with 60 million thirsty visitors a year,
are logical places to sell bottled water, Neuwirth said. The liter
bottles of Evian, which is bottled unfiltered at the source in the
French Alps, probably will sell for around $1.
</P>
<P>
   This deal is far from a first for the county, which has long
traded off the marketing value of its beaches. Other bottled water
companies that have paid for the official title in recent years
include Canadian-based NAYA and Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking advantage of the popularity of our beaches,''
said John Wallace, spokesman for Supervisor Don Knabe. ``If we can
generate revenues for recreational opportunities for the public, we
need to go after those.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong approach, said Martin Schlageter of the Sierra Club.
``It's only destroying our open space and our public resources,''
he said of the proliferation of advertising on public property.
</P>
<P>
   Local governments should be pushing for revisions in tax laws
that now force them to scramble for alternative sources of
revenues, Schlageter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles County is strong and powerful and should be at the
forefront of reforming state tax laws that have starved so many
municipalities of revenues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Evian deal, the Department of Beaches and Harbors sent
out letters to 61 companies that sell bottled water and/or fruit
drinks and advertised in six local newspapers. Evian and Coca Cola
submitted similar bids but Evian offered a greater annual cash
sponsorship fee, department director Stan Wisniewski said in a
report to the Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the official designation and the right to plunk
down 30 bottled water vending machines along the beach boardwalk,
Evian will pour $75,000 a year into the county's coffers. The
company also will:
</P>
<P>
   Donate 200 boards showing the time and temperature, valued at
$15,000, for the county's 155 lifeguard stations (the number
includes spares).
</P>
<P>
   Donate 50 volleyball nets, valued at $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Pay 35 percent of its gross sales revenues to the county
Department of Beaches and Harbors, a sum estimated to be at least
$10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   If the contract runs the full five years, it will be worth about
$587,000 to the county in goods and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations and business entities since the mid-1980s have vied
for the right to link their product officially to the county's
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce-based Authentic Fitness Co. signed a three-year
contract with the county in February 1998 to provide $358,000 worth
of Speedo swimsuits and volleyball nets in exchange for rights to
refer to itself as the ``official swimwear sponsor of the Los
Angeles County beach lifeguards.''
</P>
<P>
   Local Ford dealers for years have donated as many as 60 trucks
for lifeguard and youth programs. The dealers in return can
advertise the Ford trucks as the ``official vehicle of Los Angeles
County Beaches.'' This contract is still in place, Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of selling a city's or a county's name is not
unique to Los Angeles, of course. The city of San Diego has put
together a deal, which its City Council is scheduled to vote on
shortly, that would make Pepsi the city's official soft drink.
Pepsi would pay millions of dollars over the 12-year contract for
the right to install its vending machines on city property. The
value to the city will depend on the number of machines installed
but could be as high as $23.6 million.

HEIRS SELL ARTWORK ONCE LOOTED BY NAZIS TO CASINO MOGUL STEVE
WYNN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the Seattle Art Museum returned Henri Matisse's
``Odalisque'' to the family who lost it to the Nazis, one heir of
collector Paul Rosenberg said she was happy ``his children are
finally coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months later, that particular child found itself up for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   The heirs of French gallery owner and collector Rosenberg have
sold Matisse's 1928 oil painting to casino mogul Steve Wynn, owner
of the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Feldman, spokesperson for the Bellagio, confirmed the
painting is on view in the hotel's gallery. Asked how much Wynn
paid for the painting, he said, ``We don't discuss from whom we buy
paintings, to whom we sell them or any of the prices paid in any
transaction.'' The painting is valued at more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Confiscated by the Nazis from Rosenberg in 1941, the painting
turned up at New York's Knoedler Gallery in 1954. The gallery sold
it to Seattle collectors Virginia and Prentice Bloedel without
telling them about the Rosenberg connection, says museum
spokesperson Linda Williams. The Bloedels hung it in their living
room until donating it to the Seattle Art Museum in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The location of the painting came to light after it was listed
as ``whereabouts unknown'' in Hector Feliciano's 1995 book, ``The
Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest
Works of Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg heirs sued the museum in 1998 to get the painting
back. The museum agreed to return the painting after receiving a
report on the painting's provenance by the Holocaust Art
Restitution Project of B'nai B'rith, which investigates Jewish
cultural losses during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was the first against an American museum concerning
ownership of art looted by Nazis during World War II. When the
museum agreed to return the painting, Elaine Rosenberg told The New
York Times she was happy for her deceased father-in-law. ``His
children are finally coming home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn's Bellagio is home to a notable collection of impressionist
and post-impressionist painting, from Monet to Matisse, as well as
contemporary work from Robert Rauschenberg, Dale Chihuly and Roy
Lichtenstein. The collection is valued at $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Gates, director of the Seattle Art Museum, said the
Rosenbergs weren't interested in working out a deal letting the
museum retain the painting. ``It belongs to them; they can do with
it as they choose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is suing the Knoedler Gallery, contending it sold the
painting to the Bloedels under false pretenses. Knoedler Gallery
attorneys deny the gallery is liable.
</P>
<P>
   Odalisque timeline
</P>
<P>
   1928: Matisse finished ``Odalisque'' and sent it to the
Bernheim-Jeune Gallery in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   1929: Purchased by a Mrs. Bevan (first name unknown) and brought
to New York.
</P>
<P>
   1937: Paul Rosenberg purchased it from her and brought it back
to Paris as part of his personal collection.
</P>
<P>
   1940: Rosenberg sent all his art holdings to storage in southern
France, hoping to protect them from the Nazis. He and his family
leave Paris for New York.
</P>
<P>
   1941. Nazis seize Rosenberg's collection.
</P>
<P>
   1942: Along with another Matisse and Gauguin's ``Yellow
Christ,'' Nazi leader Hermann Goering traded ``Odalisque'' to
dealer Gustave Rochlitz for a 16th century French painting.
</P>
<P>
   1948: Rochlitz testifies that ``Odalisque'' was lost on a train.
His statement is considered untrustworthy, as he was known to trade
with the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   1954: New York's Knoedler Gallery records its purchase of
``Odalisque'' from the Drouant David Gallery in Paris. How the
painting got to the Drouant David Gallery is unclear. Seattle
collectors Prentice and Virginia Bloedel purchase the painting from
Knoedler.
</P>
<P>
   1991: The Bloedels leave ``Odalisque'' to the Seattle Art
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   1999: The Seattle Art Museum returns the painting to Paul
Rosenberg's heirs. Two months later, Steve Wynn buys it for his
Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas.

sons as Goethe, Schiller and Bach, but also in the avant garde of
``the golden 20's'': Walter Gropius's Bauhaus; the paintings of
Oskar Kokoschka and Max Beckmann and the drawings of George Grosz;
the collaborations of Kurt Weill and Bertold Brecht and the
theatrical excitement generated by Erwin Piscator and Max
Reinhardt. But if Weimar wants to live up to the artistic
reputation of that decade's cultural elite, it may also have to
live down their politics: While the young and frail German Republic
struggled to find a road between the former autocracy and a looming
fascism, many of Germany's foremost artists and intellectuals
displayed indifference or outright antipathy to the embattled
democrats. A critic's notebook by Walter Goodman.

NEWEST MARINER GOES SHOPPING

   SEATTLE _ It was a bush league move _ literally _ and Denny
Stark knew it. On a hook in his locker at Safeco Field Friday was a
black and teal New Haven Ravens cap. When a visitor pointed it out
to him, Stark quickly disposed of the evidence, dropping the hat
behind a small locker cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old right-hander has put Class AA behind him for
now, but he's still learning big-league fashion.
</P>
<P>
   When Stark got the call to the majors on Wednesday, he was in
Binghamton, N.Y., at the end of a six-game road trip. It was a
joyous moment, but it also put Stark on the clock: The Mariners
told him he had 90 minutes to gather his things and get on a plane
for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   There was one problem. Stark had been wearing jeans the whole
trip, and his first day as a big-leaguer would be a travel day,
when jeans are forbidden and jackets required.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to pick up some khakis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stark called his parents and his girlfriend, then made a quick
stop at the Gap in a mall in Binghamton. He couldn't find a jacket,
but he got the khakis, got on the plane, and arrived at Comiskey
Park _ in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, who had a 2{-hour drive from their Ohio home near
the Indiana border, beat him to the ballpark. The day ended in
Seattle at 2:30 a.m., when Stark and the M's landed back home.
</P>
<P>
   It was a whirlwind day for a pitcher who didn't think he'd make
it to Seattle this year. But after throwing complete games in two
of his last three starts to finish 9-11, Stark was invited for a
late-season look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't worry too much about it,'' said Stark, whom
the M's named as one of their top six pitching prospects this
spring. ``I started out a little slow this season, but the main
thing was looking forward to the end, to start improving what I'd
done. I made great steps toward pitching better, but I wasn't
looking at a shot at the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   When he got to Seattle, though, Stark knew what he had to do
first:
</P>
<P>
   He went to Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to pick up some clothes, because most of the things I
had were dirty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   HENRY HEALTHY: As expected, the Mariners activated left-hander
Butch Henry from the disabled list before Friday night's game.
After going 2-0 in four April starts, Henry had surgery to repair a
torn labrum and missed four months.
</P>
<P>
   Henry is one of two left-handers in the Mariners' bullpen;
rookie Robert Ramsay is the other. Manager Lou Piniella is waiting
to see Henry before he makes him his No. 1 left-handed option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how he pitches and how he bounces back,'' Piniella
said, ``but he's ready to contribute right now.''
</P>
<P>
   BAD BREAK: To Charles Gipson, who rejoined the Mariners this
week, there was irony in the separated shoulder he suffered during
the Mariners' brawl at Los Angeles that caused him to miss almost
two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird, because I was in a lot of fights throughout my
life as a kid,'' said the reserve outfielder/infielder. ``Finally,
the one I'm not starting and I'm just trying to be a mediator in is
the one where I get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gipson has an option remaining for next year _ meaning the
Mariners can send him up and down as often as they like _ but
Piniella is hoping Gipson can stick as a utility player in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to look at Gipson a little bit and see how he fits
in for next year,'' Piniella said. ``I'd like to see Charlie
establish himself as a good role-type player who plays some
outfield and some infield.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA BASES: The newest feature at Safeco Field is a two-tiered
billboard on the facing of a stairwell high above right-center,
marking the countdown to Ken Griffey Jr.'s 400th home run. The top
board reads, ``Chasing 400'' and includes Griffey's picture, and
the bottom board is a running countdown of his lifetime home runs.
Griffey had 391 entering Friday night's game. ... First baseman
Mike Blowers dropped jersey No. 4 after one game, getting his old
No. 16 from first-base coach Sam Mejias. Mejias switched to No. 57.
... Second baseman David Bell had grounded into only two double
plays through Aug. 28, but hit into his second in six games Friday
night.

BROSIUS RETURNS AS YANKEES FALL TO ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The phone call will come and Scott Brosius
believes it will be soon. Cancer is ravaging Maury Brosius, the
father of the Yankees' third baseman, and over the last five days
Scott Brosius left the team to be at the bedside of his parent in
Oregon, to talk, to trade thoughts and memories, to say goodbye.
The son felt blessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dad and I had the chance to say the things we wanted to say
and have the conversations we wanted to have,'' said Brosius, after
rejoining the Yankees before Friday night's game with Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius found comfort in being among friends, among his
teammates, who have prayed for his family, he said, before the
Yankees lost to the Angels, 8-2, Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Angels manager Terry Collins resigned, feeling
he could no longer compel his players to perform, with a month
remaining in what has been a disastrous season for Anaheim. But the
Angels _ who have played well against the Yankees _ assumed a lead
quickly, under the direction of the interim manager, Joe Maddon.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte likes to pitch without distraction. But Joe
Girardi, the catcher who usually works with Pettitte, was in New
York for the birth of his first child Friday morning, and Jorge
Posada started behind the plate and spent the early innings trying
to align thoughts and signals with his pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored a run in the second, two in the third. Posada
hammered a 440-foot home run in the fifth inning, cutting Anaheim's
advantage to a run. But Mark Petkovsek pitched out of a
seventh-inning jam, striking out Derek Jeter with the bases loaded
and two out, and Mo Vaughn's two-run homer highlighted the Angels'
five-run seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte allowed six runs in six-plus innings, with two walks
and five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius was 1 for 3 with a double; he was caught off second base
in the fourth inning, after he either lost track of a fly ball or
forgot how many outs there were.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius is soft-spoken with a Mayberry geniality, and deeply
religious. He loves baseball, but he is more suited to small towns
than to big lights; he does not enjoy the celebrity his job affords
him. After he was named the most valuable player of World Series
last fall, baseball officials shuttled Brosius from one television
interview to the next, much to his dismay. An impatient Brosius
wanted to celebrate with teammates or family, and at the first
possible moment, he broke away from the news media and met his
father in a side room at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius was offered the usual array of off-season endorsements
and rejected them all in order to go back to Oregon. Once Brosius
retires _ he is a millionaire many times over _ he intends to stay
home to watch his children grow, and look into the possibility of
coaching baseball at a local college.
</P>
<P>
   His voice and manner were steady Friday , as Brosius sat in
front of his locker and spoke serenely with reporters about his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Brosius' colon cancer was thought to be in remission last
year, but it returned. By this spring, Scott Brosius' hope for his
father was that his pain would be diminished. They have talked
almost every night after games, conversations facilitated by the
time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Brosius watched on television as the Yankees played on the
East Coast, and before it was too late on the West Coast, Scott
would call and monitor his father's voice. Sometimes he sounded
good, his voice strong. When Scott Brosius decided to wear his
uniform pant legs high, to just below the knee, Maury Brosius told
him it was a good look. You're wearing them just the way I taught
you, the father told the son.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Brosius received a phone call from home, word
that his father had taken a turn for the worse, and General Manager
Brian Cashman and manager Joe Torre told him to take as much time
as he needed. Girardi ferried the Brosius family to the airport
and, later that day, the Yankees who meet to share in religion
prayed Scott would have time with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Brosius has found a way to be comfortable while lying in
bed, and he is coping with the pain. ``He's shown me some
unbelievable strength, battling this thing,'' said Scott Brosius.
``He refuses to take the Valium, because he wants to be alert and
be able to talk to everybody. He wants to be aware of what's going
on. He's battled to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius was at his father's home and bedside for five days
and they spoke about all the joy they had been able to share in the
last year. Maury Brosius taught his son baseball and, last summer,
he had watched Scott play an integral role for a team with the most
victories in the history of the big leagues. He was in San Diego
last October to see him round the bases jubilantly, arms and fists
outstretched after Brosius slugged the home run that all but
clinched the Yankees' championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has done some great things for us,'' Scott Brosius said,
reflecting on their time together in the last year, in the last
week. ``I'm pretty sure that going home when I did was the right
time to go, and today was the right time to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Before flying here Thursday, Brosius saw his father for the last
time, he believes. ``Yesterday was the hardest day, by far,'' said
Brosius, ``having to say our goodbyes.''
</P>
<P>
   He was glad to be around his teammates again. Brosius walked
into Edison Field Friday afternoon with Pettitte, among his closest
friends on the team, and Brosius smiled when he heard the good news
about how Girardi and his wife, Kim, had their first child, a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius and Maury Brosius spoke by phone Friday afternoon.
They will talk as often as they can, in the days to come.

COYOTE TRAPS SENT IN L.A.'S SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Succumbing to pressure from residents who signed
petitions and mailed fliers, animal control officials said that
they have taken the extraordinary step of setting traps for coyotes
in the Northridge and Woodland Hills communities of Los Angeles'
San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The trapping this summer is the first since the L.A. City
Council voted in 1993 to sharply curtail the conditions under which
the animals could be seized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valley is our most troubled spot,'' said Dan Knapp,
general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services.
</P>
<P>
   When a coyote is captured, city policy requires that it be put
to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Animal activists are upset with the city's decision to make
exceptions to its ban, claiming that trapping will not solve the
coyote problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a bear or a coyote shows up in someone's
neighborhood, people want cowboys to go out there and shoot them,''
said Madeline Bernstein, president of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, people should keep pets and pet food indoors, secure
trash cans and make their homes uninviting by picking fruit on
trees before it drops to the ground, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But residents said the trapping is justified because coyotes are
eating their pets and threatening their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fear is that there are young children around here
who could be injured by coyotes,'' said Woodland Hills resident
Lucy Fourtney, whose neighborhood has reported coyotes killing cats
and walking brazenly down their street with pups in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with enormous community pressure, Los Angeles City
Councilman Hal Bernson asked for the traps to be installed after
the office got petitions and numerous phone calls from residents
frustrated by the bold predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, we encouraged animal regulation to take a look
to see if it warranted trapping,'' said Bernson spokesman Ali Sar.
``The suspicion was that the animal might be sick or ill, so we
encouraged animal regulation to handle this special case.''
</P>
<P>
   Knapp said there are four cases in which coyotes can be trapped.
Those are if the animal is sick or injured, if the county issues a
mandate, if the health services department suspects the coyote has
rabies and if the animal poses a public safety threat.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northridge and Woodland Hills cases, animal officials
said they approved the trap because the coyotes' behavior raised
concerns that they were sick or injured and posed a safety hazard.
Specifically, the coyote was going after household cats, raising
the question that it could be ill because it wasn't going after
larger game, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Northridge and Woodland Hills, the city provided residents
with traps. The resident is responsible for monitoring it and calls
the city when a coyote is caught. The city picks it up and
euthanizes it.
</P>
<P>
   Every night for nearly a week, Northridge resident Don Gorden
has gone outside with a coffee can full of dog food and dripped the
smelly gook in a beeline for a coyote trap on his front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night I caught an opossum,'' Gorden said. ``The
second night I got a raccoon. I had a cat in there last night.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gorden, who lives several miles inside the urbanized Valley,
isn't discouraged. He's going to try rotten chicken meat to attract
the shy, wily animals.
</P>
<P>
   Gorden is among those residents who favor trapping the coyotes
but don't want them killed. He favors releasing them in another
location.
</P>
<P>
   But it's against the law to relocate wild animals, because the
coyotes carry various diseases and would just transfer the problem
to another area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very capable of carrying rabies,'' Felosky said. ``Do
you want one dropped off by your house? They are not endangered by
any imagination. There are a lot of reasons not to relocate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Felosky said trapping is the only way to address the crush of
coyote reports. They include:
</P>
<P>
   A Woodland Hills man who noticed a coyote in his back yard
Thursday night and approached it to scare it away. But the coyote
came at the man in an ``aggressive manner'' and he retreated to his
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only great cause for concern, but proof in the
pudding that coyotes are becoming accustomed to people to the point
where they are no longer afraid,'' said West Valley Animal Care and
Control Center Lt. Richard Felosky.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he was a child? Have people been bitten in situations
like that? Sure,'' Felosky said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the 1993 policy on coyotes, trappers caught 50 to 150 a
year in the city, Felosky said. Since the La Nina-fueled drought in
Los Angeles has driven coyotes out of the hills and into people's
back yards, wildlife authorities believe coyotes are more plentiful
in the San Fernando Valley than ever before. The California Fish
and Game Department estimates the coyote population in the state
between 250,000 and 750,000.

ANGELS COME ALIVE IN WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Terry Collins was asked during a news conference
announcing his resignation Friday why he decided to leave now.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled and said: ``The Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   The team had lost nine in a row, and with the defending World
Series champs in town, it was safe to assume things would only get
worse.
</P>
<P>
   But with Collins watching from his home in Seal Beach, the
Angels did everything he wanted them to do all season. For new
manager Joe Maddon, the Angels got two-out hits, solid pitching and
defense and took an 8-2 victory before 35,782 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Collins said all he wanted to read
in the newspapers today was how the Angels won. He got his wish,
even if it was too late to help his cause.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, the Angels were on course to continue a
strange trend that started last season beating the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   In '98, the Angels were the only team in baseball with a winning
record against the eventual World Series champs, winning six of 11.
With a victory Friday, the Angels improved to 5-2 against New York
this season, including a three-game sweep at Yankee Stadium May
11-13.
</P>
<P>
   At certain points during Friday's game, many Angels players were
off the bench and leaning over the dugout railing encouraging
teammates, a rare sight during this horrible season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels pounded out 12 of their 15 hits against Yankees
starter Andy Pettitte (12-10). Mo Vaughn hit his 23rd home run of
the season. Garret Anderson, Gary DiSarcina and Todd Greene each
had three hits. Tim Salmon and Troy Glaus had two hits apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starting pitcher Tim Belcher (6-8) gave up two runs in
51/3 innings, striking out six, and got considerable help from the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees closed to 3-2 in the fifth on Jorge Posada's solo
homer with one out, his 12th. But New York, which lost for the
third time in four games, left the bases loaded in the seventh when
reliever Mark Petkovsek struck out Derek Jeter, who had hit safely
his first three times up.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ben Molina threw out Jeter in the first inning and Ricky
Ledee in the second trying to steal. Salmon doubled up Scott
Brosius at second base after catching a fly ball in right field in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher survived solo homers by Posada and Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Darryl Strawberry, who went 0-for-2 against Oakland
on Thursday in his first game back from colon cancer and a drug
suspension, pinch-hit in the ninth and walked.
</P>
<P>
   The loss snapped a streak of 14 series in which the Yankees won
the opening game, a franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Angels gave reliever Mike James, who had elbow and
shoulder surgery and has not pitched this year, his unconditional
release. Anaheim also activated outfielder Matt Luke from the
disabled list. Luke tore a muscle below his right rib cage making a
throw in a game against Oakland on June 25.

   LOS ANGELES: between 250,000 and 750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports include:
</P>
<P>
   A den of seven to 10 coyotes in Encino.
</P>
<P>
   Between 15 to 20 complaints about coyotes eating cats in
Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes eating apricots, grapes and tomatoes in people's back
yards in Canoga Park.
</P>
<P>
   Sighting of 10 coyotes in Tarzana.
</P>
<P>
   A coyote attacked a dog in West Hills.
</P>
<P>
   A limping coyote reported in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   A coyote killed a cat and then sat on a front porch in Woodland
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coyote complaints are constant,'' Felosky said. ``They've
been breeding since 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   In Northridge, residents took action to get the city to do
something about their problematic coyote.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Gorden and Northridge resident Marilyn Barton got 20
neighbors to sign a petition asking for a trap. They sent it to
Bernson's office. In June, they gathered 36 signatures and the city
responded by putting in a trap. It never caught the coyote.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, with the help of a couple of Realtors, they sent
out 200 fliers to neighbors asking them to watch out for the
coyote, saying: ``As you are probably aware, we have had a problem
with a coyote roaming our neighborhood and killing small animals
for food. . . . Please do not leave small children, small dogs or
pet cats unattended.''
</P>
<P>
   Also over the weekend, real estate agent Randy DiSimone used an
automatic computer dialer to leave about 1,000 messages on people's
answering machines warning them about the coyote.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a Northridge resident called DiSimone earlier this
week to say the coyote was in his back yard Monday for about 20
minutes, but when he called the authorities, they told him the
animal care center was closed Monday and they didn't have anyone to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   In Woodland Hills, resident Joyce Hart said the city brought her
a trap Sunday. She and other neighbors held a meeting last month
called, ``Do the coyotes pay your taxes?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The squeaky wheel gets the oil,'' she said.

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ I'm so angry I could quit. My editor admonishes me
when I miss deadline, he holds me accountable for my factual
errors, he stays on me like a tailgating driver.
</P>
<P>
   I can't take it anymore. He's a cloud in my cafe latte.

I'm just going to mail it in. Some days I may not even send a
column at all.
</P>
<P>
   The more I mess up, the worse it'll reflect on my editor. He'll
take so much heat he'll have no recourse but to resign. Either that
or he'll get fired. Either way, I win.
</P>
<P>
   You see, all I know about professionalism I learned from our
L.A. sports teams. Let's face it, for our professional athletes it
truly is a dog's life. They can make a mess all over Southern
California and nobody expects them to clean up after themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I want I want to come back in my next career as a
Laker or an Angel. That way I can stubbornly refuse to heel and the
person on the other end of the leash will wind up in the doghouse,
not me.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Lakers fired Del Harris because head coaches are
easier to find than seven-foot centers. And Friday, Angels manager
Terry Collins quit _ mind you, a good two months after his
sniveling players did.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, to be a professional athlete here and now means never
having to say you're culpable.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, 50, was kind enough to show up for his funeral,
fielding questions through a veil of tears four hours before the
Angels' game against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Who said there's no crying in baseball? On Wednesday, 22 umpires
weeped and 48 hours later Collins' eyes grew all watery. What's
next, ``Crying Towel Night''?
</P>
<P>
   Like Harris before him, Collins departed with class. He offered
no excuses and steadfastly refused to rat out the Judases, wherever
they were hiding.
</P>
<P>
   If only his players could have worn their dirty laundry the same
as Collins _ as undergarments instead of outerwear _ this sorry
season might never have come to this.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, from avowed team leader Mo Vaughn on down, the Angels were
finger-pointing poseurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in clubhouses where the players didn't necessarily
care for each other,'' said Collins, who was in his third season as
the Angel manager. ``The bottom line is, they went out and played
together. That's what you've got to do. I had reached the last
thing I could think of to get (the players) going.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it was the best sacrifice play executed by any Angel
in quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real hard to walk away,'' Collins said, his voice
cracking. ``These jobs are hard to get. I had a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he awoke Friday _ in his own home after eight days
(and seven losses) on the road _ with his immediate future
amorphous as a dream. His course of action was crystallized later
in the morning when he met with vice president and general manager
Bill Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi, Collins' staunchest ally in the organization, sized up
the situation and invoked the mercy rule.
</P>
<P>
   It was the best call, Bavasi said, ``a little bit for the club
but mostly for Terry. If he's your friend, I'm not sure you want to
ram (staying on) down the guy's throat.''
</P>
<P>
   If Collins was resigned to his fate, Bavasi was repulsed. Asked
how he imagined the players were taking the news, Bavasi retorted,
``I'd be less than honest with you if I told you I cared.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he said, ``Terry said he's not bitter. He's a bigger man
than I. It's a bitter pill for me. I put together a team that had
every reason to respond well and didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   I would have liked to have been able to gauge the players'
reactions to Collins' resignation for myself. But by Bavasi's
decree the Angels' clubhouse was closed to reporters before and
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   When all else fails, control the press, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably just as well the clubhouse doors stayed shut. It
would have sickened me to see a bunch of players who have exhibited
so little heart all summer try to manufacture an ounce of
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he treated his players like grown men. Well, no
wonder things ended badly. It's pretty obvious the 1999 Angels are
a Disney remake of Peter Pan. &QL;

KINGS SET FOR CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beginning at 7 this morning, Kings players are scheduled to
report for medical examinations, the first step in the process that
will lead to Sunday's start of training camp, next Saturday's
exhibition opener and the beginning of the regular season in
Nashville in 28 days.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 55 players are scheduled to compete for jobs at training
camp, but several of those expected on hand may not be around at
the start, and several others definitely won't be.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Dave Taylor announced Friday that problems with
visa paperwork are delaying the arrival of Finnish defenseman Jere
Karalahti.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor said that even though Karalahti's past includes an
addiction to heroin, he does not foresee the rookie's arrival being
significantly delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it's a major issue,'' Taylor said. ``We think
it's a formality. We're not exactly sure of the time frame, but we
hope to have him here sometime next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, forwards Glen Murray and Jason Podollan, and
defenseman Mattias Norstrom remain unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the players probably won't be permitted to skate
with the team unless they are close to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally - and what would a Kings season be without
injuries? the casualty list already is at three.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Philippe Boucher, who had foot surgery at the end of
last season, still isn't 100 percent, though the Kings are hoping
he will be by the end of camp. Rookie center Scott Barney will miss
all of training camp and won't be ready for the start of the season
because of a back injury. Another rookie center, Eric Belanger, is
sidelined indefinitely after surgery this week to remove a rib that
was causing a circulatory disorder.

COLLINS, OUT OF OPTIONS, RESIGNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Terry Collins said he tried everything to halt the
Angels' freefall to the worst record in the majors. When he
exhausted every idea, he found himself with no other recourse but
to look in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Collins called general manager Bill Bavasi on Friday morning and
after a heart-to-heart conversation, they came to a mutual decision
that he would resign as manager.
</P>
<P>
   During an emotional news conference, during which he broke down
in tears several times, Collins said he did all he could and it
simply wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reached the last thing I could think of to get 'em going,''
Collins said of the players. ``I figured, if I'm the reason, I'm
going....
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried patting them on the back, I tried kicking them in the
butt. Nothing worked, no matter what I said or what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels went into Friday's game against the Yankees at Edison
Field mired in a nine-game losing streak. Their record since the
All-Star break was 10-37, and at 51-82, the team is on a pace to
finish the season with a franchise-record 100 losses.
</P>
<P>
   Bench coach Joe Maddon will take over as interim manager for the
rest of the season. Bavasi said he has not yet started creating a
list of potential replacements.
</P>
<P>
   The early favorites to take over next season are ex-Angel Don
Baylor, currently the hitting coach for the Atlanta Braves; Kevin
Kennedy, now an analyst for Fox Sports, and Chris Chambliss, whom
Bavasi interviewed before giving the job to Collins in 1997.
Chambliss is now the Yankees' hitting coach.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought the players quit on him, Collins said:
``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi and team president Tony Tavares were more direct. Both
pointed fingers directly at the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually contemplated making a sign that said `The problem
starts right here' and stamping it on the mirrors in the
clubhouse,'' Tavares said. ``Frankly, that's where it is. If the
players had one-fourth of the integrity Terry has, we wouldn't be
in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe a major-league player, a minor-league player,
a college player or a high school player quits on anybody but
themselves,'' Bavasi said. ``I know Terry, and if I played for him
or worked for him, I couldn't imagine quitting on him. But they
quit on somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them playing hard every night, diving for ground balls,
playing hard, but how they reacted in the clubhouse, there was a
lot of energy not being spent on preparation for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential problems involving Collins first surfaced in June when
word got out that the Angels were discussing a contract extension
for him. A number of players voiced their concerns, but on June 22,
the Angels announced they extended Collins' contract for two years
worth about $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   (With the resignation, Collins and the Angels worked out a
financial settlement that was not disclosed.)
</P>
<P>
   The contract extension, though, didn't end the problem. Even
when the team was playing well going into the All-Star break,
Collins confided that he avoided going into the clubhouse as much
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   And when the team started losing, beginning with an 11-game
losing streak one game after the All-Star break, frustrations
mounted and players aired their beefs to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Problems came to a head Tuesday in Cleveland when the Angels
blew a 12-4 lead to the Indians and closer Troy Percival hit David
Justice with a pitch, sparking a fight. After the game, Percival
said he noticed which players didn't come to his defense during the
fight. One who took exception was Mo Vaughn, who explained he was
in the clubhouse when it started and couldn't get onto the field in
time. Approached by reporters the following day in Cleveland,
Vaughn responded angrily and loudly to Percival's implications.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries also played a major role in the team's downfall. Gary
DiSarcina, Jim Edmonds and Tim Salmon missed a significant portion
of the season, and Vaughn has not been healthy since suffering a
severely sprained left ankle on opening night.
</P>
<P>
   With all that happened this season, Collins found himself
wandering the streets of Cleveland early Thursday morning trying to
sort things out.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi talked to the team before Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is the group as a whole,'' he said. ``Individually
they may be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he would have stayed as manager for the rest of the
season if Bavasi had insisted. Bavasi said he didn't have the heart
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After discussing it with him and hearing how frustrated he
was, as a friend I couldn't do it,'' Bavasi said.

SELICHOT SERVICES PREPARE JEWS FOR HIGH HOLY DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY HOLLY J. ANDRES  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Imagine sitting with a roomful of people praying
at midnight when suddenly the heavens shake and open, revealing a
forgiving God who is listening to the words of repentance.
</P>
<P>
   That's the image Rabbi Richard Camras of Shomrei Torah Synagogue
believes Jews might benefit from visualizing during Selichot
services.
</P>
<P>
   Selichot means ``forgiveness,'' and the penitential prayers said
first at this service will be recited every day through Yom Kippur,
except on Shabbat, said Camras, who leads the Conservative
congregation in the West Hills community of Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Repentance, renewal, starting over and God's forgiveness are
major themes of this somber service in which the synagogue's Torah
mantles will be white to symbolize purity, and the shofar, a ram's
horn, will be blown near the end of the service to awaken Jews to
the spiritual work they need to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service is based around the Bible passage Exodus 33. This
passage is where Moses asks God for forgiveness after the
worshiping of the golden calf,'' Camras said.
</P>
<P>
   The Selichot service dates from the second century, but
typically, it draws smaller crowds than Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur
and other holy days because of the late hour.
</P>
<P>
   Micah Caplan, a 10-year member of Shomrei Torah, said, ``It's a
powerful service. It's a time for me to prepare for the High Holy
Days. It's a time to better myself. It's a time to start asking God
for forgiveness and asking others to forgive us. I really dig deep
into myself to plan for the coming year.''

<P>
   For Sharlene Blau, the Selichot service means keeping a
tradition she grew up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from a traditional background. I was exposed to it. It
sets the tone for the High Holy Days for me. I start thinking about
the meaning behind those days. The service starts giving you the
taste and gives you the mood for the holidays. There's a week to
prepare yourself. It's a time of reflection, and it does something
for me spiritually,'' said Blau, an 11-year member of the
synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   The service will start at 11:30 p.m. and will include prayers,
readings and choral singing. Although most of the prayers will be
in Hebrew, many of the readings will be in English.
</P>
<P>
   A Selichot program at 8:30 p.m. will include a panel of speakers
sharing what the service means to them. Following refreshments,
Camras will lead a workshop on personal repentance and suggest
steps to personal change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an important service to go to if we are serious about
self-examination and changing the way we live, how we treat family
and friends and to work on our relationship with God,'' Camras
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take appropriate steps, and Selichot is the
beginning of our commitment to make these changes. No more
procrastination. We have to start today.

SELICHOT SERVICES PREPARE JEWS FOR HIGH HOLY DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY HOLLY J. ANDRES  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Imagine sitting with a roomful of people praying
at midnight when suddenly the heavens shake and open, revealing a
forgiving God who is listening to the words of repentance.
</P>
<P>
   That's the image Rabbi Richard Camras of Shomrei Torah Synagogue
believes Jews might benefit from visualizing during Selichot
services.
</P>
<P>
   Selichot means ``forgiveness,'' and the penitential prayers said
first at this service will be recited every day through Yom Kippur,
except on Shabbat, said Camras, who leads the Conservative
congregation in the West Hills community of Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Repentance, renewal, starting over and God's forgiveness are
major themes of this somber service in which the synagogue's Torah
mantles will be white to symbolize purity, and the shofar, a ram's
horn, will be blown near the end of the service to awaken Jews to
the spiritual work they need to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service is based around the Bible passage Exodus 33. This
passage is where Moses asks God for forgiveness after the
worshiping of the golden calf,'' Camras said.
</P>
<P>
   The Selichot service dates from the second century, but
typically, it draws smaller crowds than Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur
and other holy days because of the late hour.
</P>
<P>
   Micah Caplan, a 10-year member of Shomrei Torah, said, ``It's a
powerful service. It's a time for me to prepare for the High Holy
Days. It's a time to better myself. It's a time to start asking God
for forgiveness and asking others to forgive us. I really dig deep
into myself to plan for the coming year.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sharlene Blau, the Selichot service means keeping a
tradition she grew up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from a traditional background. I was exposed to it. It
sets the tone for the High Holy Days for me. I start thinking about
the meaning behind those days. The service starts giving you the
taste and gives you the mood for the holidays. There's a week to
prepare yourself. It's a time of reflection, and it does something

synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   The service will start at 11:30 p.m. and will include prayers,

in Hebrew, many of the readings will be in English.
</P>
<P>
   A Selichot program at 8:30 p.m. will include a panel of speakers
sharing what the service means to them. Following refreshments,
Camras will lead a workshop on personal repentance and suggest
steps to personal change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an important service to go to if we are serious about
self-examination and changing the way we live, how we treat family
and friends and to work on our relationship with God,'' Camras
said.

INCOMNET ANNOUNCES FILING OF CHAPTER 11
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After years of fighting creditors, lawsuits and a
declining bottom line, long-distance retailer Incomnet Inc.
announced it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   The company _ formerly of Woodland Hills in Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley but now based in Irvine _ blamed intense
competition and ongoing litigation for the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer George Blanco said the company explored
other options before filing Thursday, including an asset sale,
merger or restructuring of debt. But he said the company's
problems, including lawsuits by former executives, precluded that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been so much hanging on this company, it's made it
harder to raise new equity capital or partner up with other
companies,'' Blanco said.
</P>
<P>
   The company will be in a stronger position in four or six
months, when the reorganization is over, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Incomnet and its subsidiary, Incomnet Communications Corp.,
specialize in the sale of long distance to residential and
small-business customers. Company spokeswoman Jennifer Mercer said
there would be no disruptions for Incomnet's roughly 92,000
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely business as usual,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Incomnet is no stranger to financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
   While the company was based in Woodland Hills, it was hounded by
creditors, including WorldCom Network Services and First Bank &AMP;
Trust of Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
   It staved off bankruptcy in 1998 by borrowing $20 million from
an unnamed venture capital firm. The loan had a 12 percent annual
interest rate and was secured by ``substantially all'' of
Incomnet's assets.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a stock trading
suit against the Incomnet last year. And in 1997 the company paid
$8.65 million to settle a securities fraud suit brought by
disgruntled shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Incomnet stock stood at 12.5 cents Friday on no trading. On
Thursday, about 1.3 million shares were traded as the stock fell
from 18.75 cents to $12.50 cents.

WILSON DINGS RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ David Bell had one goal as he ran from first to second
in the seventh inning Friday night against the Boston Red Sox:
distract Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lampkin, who hit the ground ball to second that would force
out Bell, had one thought: I'm going to be out by 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin was wrong, because Bell made good on his effort.
</P>
<P>
   If Garciaparra had sent his relay throw swiftly to first, Boston
would have had a double play and escaped the inning with a 1-0
lead. Instead, Bell slid in high, Garciaparra's throw sailed,
Lampkin was safe at first and the tying run had scored.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, Dan Wilson's single drove in pinch-runner
Charles Gipson for a stirring 2-1 Mariners win that moved the M's
to 6{ games behind the Red Sox in the wild-card standings.
Left-hander Jamie Moyer pitched his second complete game in five
starts and improved to 13-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to distract him any way I could,'' Bell said
of his slide. ``I wanted it to be a legal slide. After I slid I
could still touch the base, and that's what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin said he was surprised Bell got to Garciaparra as quickly
as he did, because his grounder was hit hard, and right at second
baseman Jose Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing you know, David's right on him,'' Lampkin said
of Garciaparra. ``He made him jump to get the throw over him, so he
must have gotten down there quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed also showed up from an unlikely source Friday night. Edgar
Martinez, who beat out an infield single in the sixth inning,
started the ninth with another one, on a ball that trickled down
the third base line. Third baseman Wilton Veras waited for it to
roll foul, but it bumped the bag _ fair ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was kind of strange,'' Martinez said of his
two-infield-hit night. ``I don't think I ever had two in a row,
even in Little League.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gipson pinch-ran for Martinez, and after Jay Buhner
popped up on a bunt attempt, Gipson stole second as Russ Davis
swung through a hit-and-run. Then Wilson singled off former Mariner
Derek Lowe (5-3) to give the M's their fifth consecutive win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected him to come at me with a sinker,'' Wilson said.
``He came hard, but he was up in the zone and it ran in a little on
me. I knew I just needed to get it in the outfield with Gipson on
second.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Mariners were energized by the series-opening victory
_ ``The first game is the most important. We'd like to win this
series, at least take three,'' Martinez said _ the Red Sox were
irritated.
</P>
<P>
   First base umpire Brian O'Nora ejected three Red Sox on one play
in the eighth inning after Damon Buford was called out at first
after trying to bunt for a hit. Buford, manager Jimy Williams and
first base coach Dave Jauss all were tossed, but the more pivotal
play was the one an inning earlier involving Lampkin.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's throw pulled first baseman Mike Stanley off the
bag, but Stanley leaped and caught the ball, then swiped to tag
Lampkin. Lampkin said he felt some contact, though he wasn't sure
whether he had reached first base by then. Stanley made a factual
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was up the line, I tagged to my left,'' Stanley said.
``It's got to be before he hits the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no such intrigue when the Red Sox batted, because
Moyer put so few runners on base. He yielded two singles in the
first inning, a walk in the fifth and a leadoff homer by
Garciaparra in the seventh. That was it.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer has thrived since starting the Safeco Field opener on July
15. He has lasted at least six innings while allowing no more than
three earned runs in eight of his last nine starts, and has a 2.28
earned-run average since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can keep your pitch count down, good things can
happen,'' Moyer said. ``But if you're at 100 pitches in the fifth
and sixth inning, you're not going to last too much longer. Tonight
I was able to do it _ they were swinging the bats and aggressive,
and that allowed me to keep my pitch count down. I had no idea what
it was (during the game), but I know I threw 101 pitches, which is
kind of nice.''
</P>
<P>
   For 44,471 fans at Safeco Field, it was a nice way to open a
homestand that should determine if the Mariners put on a true
pennant drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are making (this) out to be a big series, but every
series is big as far as I'm concerned,'' Moyer said. ``Looking at
the next 30 days, you say, we've got to do something here.''

lend the stranger $2,000 until later. Capone gave the man the
money, but later never arrived. The stranger was named Harry
Morgan, called Swifty, but better known as the original Lemon Drop

billion tunnel and bridge connection called the Oresund Fixed Link

Hamburg, Zurich and Amsterdam. By Warren Hoge. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-TV-POLITICS (Moscow) _ If television is, as it
increasingly seems to be, the weapon of choice in Russia's intense

</P>
<P>

July 25, a Constitutional Assembly loyal to President Hugo Chavez
has not only stripped the opposition-controlled Congress of all its

Though those actions have generated much criticism abroad that
democracy is being endangered here, Venezuela's 23 million people

   GERMANY-ELECTIONS (Nauen, Germany) _ The extreme-right Deutsche
Volksunion party, backed by a millionaire Bavarian publisher named

on Sunday. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-FOR-RENT (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ All over Pristina,
there is building and the noise of electric drills and cement

Gall.

<P>
   CZECH-SLOVAK-BARRIERS (Prague, Czech Republic) _ It has been
less than seven years since the Czech and Slovak republics
peacefully split up after some 70 years together as Czechoslovakia.
But recent surveys indicate that, although Czech and Slovak are

the two peoples can communicate without difficulty, the youngest of
Czech schoolchildren now have difficulty understanding their Slovak
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-ELECTIONS (New Delhi, India) _ Indian national elections
begin Sunday, and, as always, they are likely to be a great, if
unwieldy, display of democracy for the 605 million people eligible
to cast a ballot. But as impressive as Indian elections may be,
they are becoming too much of a good thing. By Barry Bearak.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA-POLITICS (Buenos Aires, Argentina) _ It is not the

<P>
   U.N.-ISLAND-NATIONS (United Nations) _ For more than a decade,
several dozen small island nations threatened by rising seas and
increasingly violent weather have been awaiting the world's
attention as they face forces well beyond their control. On Sept.

<P>
   ELDERLY-DEPRESSION (Boston) _ The 92-year-old woman was sitting
in her wheelchair, talking with her psychiatrist at the Hebrew
Rehabilitation Center for Aged, when the phone she carries in a
black canvas bag rang. She unzipped the bag and greeted her niece
on the line: ``Hello, Myrna. I'm in a meeting now. Can I call you
back?'' The psychiatrist, Dr. Eran Metzger, smiled. A year ago, the
woman was so depressed that she had not only lost interest in
talking to anyone, she had stopped eating. By Sara Rimer.
</P>

   CLINTON-AGENDA (Washington) _ Fighting any suggestions of a
lame-duck presidency, President Clinton on Saturday challenged
Republicans to approve an ambitious fall agenda that includes
gun-control proposals, a patient's bill of rights and various
education proposals like measures to fix up old schools, hire more
teachers and end social promotions. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SCHOOLS-THREATS (Denver) _ Grappling with the aftermath of

 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the eight years he held the post of U.S. surgeon general,
Dr. C. Everett Koop became one of the country's most authoritative
and recognizable public figures on the subject of health.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a decade after leaving office, Koop, now 82, is
facing criticism, from medical ethicists, including two
representatives of the American Medical Association, consumer
advocates and others.
</P>
<P>
   Among the complaints are that his hugely popular health
information Web site, DrKoop.com, has frequently blurred the line
between its objective information and its advertising or
promotional content, and that his ties to business have not been
properly disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent days, for example, the Web site did not give notice
of an arrangement that entitled the company and Koop himself to a
commission on products and services sold because of the Web site.
Koop gave up those commissions on Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites devoted to health and medicine _ some providing
information and advice, others selling medications _ have been
among the hottest Internet properties this year, and DrKoop.com is
one of the most heavily trafficked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the explosion of e-commerce, the distinction
between objective information and advertising has blurred across
much of the Web, as newspapers and newer types of information
providers struggle to capitalize on the information they gather,
and as other businesses try to use the new technology to connect
with new customers. Many sites, for example, receive a commission
for referring their users to online merchants, and what would be
called advertisers in other media are often labeled ``partners.''
</P>
<P>
   But Koop's site and his role in it have come under particular
scrutiny not only because of his stature but because what is
involved is the public's health. Complicating the matter is the
traditionally strict regulation of medical practices and
advertising _ an issue that the profession and the federal
government have yet to fully address in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The critics of the former surgeon general say that he has done
nothing illegal but that he has _ knowingly or not _ engaged in
activities that amount to a conflict of interest, or the appearance
of one. Some say Koop, who became a role model to young physicians
with his campaigns to deter cigarette smoking and to raise AIDS
awareness, has in effect traded on his respected name for financial
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly a very honorable man,'' said Dr. Robert M.
Tenery Jr., a former chairman of the AMA's council on ethics and
judicial affairs, when asked to comment on the criticisms. ``But to
claim that you're the nation's family doctor, well, perhaps he's
not tainted, but the picture is colored somewhat by his relations
to vested interests.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over the last few weeks, Koop said he would be
making changes in his financial arrangements and on the Web site;
some of those changes have already taken effect. In response to his
critics, Koop said that he had done nothing wrong and that he
remained devoted to educating the public about health issues. He
cannot help it, he said, that some people are bothered by the idea
of a former public servant's making money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been bought,'' he said. ``I cannot be bought. I
am an icon, and I have a reputation for honesty and integrity, and
let the chips fall where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web Site: Building on Power Of a Trusted Name
</P>
<P>
   Koop and other investors started the Web site in 1998 and took
it public with an initial offering of stock in June, quickly
joining the ranks of Internet multimillionaires. Koop is chairman
of DrKoop.com and a major shareholder in the company. On paper, the
stock he held at the time of the initial offering is worth more
than $47 million, as of the close of the market Friday. As
chairman, he draws an annual salary of $135,000 plus other payments
like speaking fees.
</P>
<P>
   On its 80,000 electronic pages, DrKoop.com offers information on
medical conditions like heart disease and anorexia, features an Ask
the Expert column and includes advice on topics like purchasing
health insurance and participating in clinical trials of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman, Koop says he takes overall responsibility for
DrKoop.com. But the day-to-day operations are managed by executives
and staff members at the company's headquarters in Austin, Texas.
Koop lives in Hanover, N.H., where he runs the Koop Institute, a
research center connected with Dartmouth Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Koop's name and his ranking in opinion polls as the
nation's most trusted health authority appears to have been very
much on the minds of the former surgeon general and his business
advisers in founding DrKoop.com. In a prospectus filed June 8 with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said its goal
was to ``establish the DrKoop.com brand so that consumers associate
the trustworthiness and credibility of Dr. C. Everett Koop with our
company.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospectus states that the Web site is permitted to use
Koop's ``image, name and likeness in connection with health-related
services and products,'' subject to his prior approval of the
products. In return, Koop was entitled to receive 2 percent of
DrKoop.com revenues ``derived from sales of our current products
and up to 4 percent of our revenues derived from sales of new
products.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospectus says the site deals in a wide variety of such
health products and services, including prescription drugs,
nonprescription drugs, vitamins, nutritional supplements and health
insurance offered by outside parties.
</P>
<P>
   Like other commercial Web sites, DrKoop.com may accept
advertising. But because Koop's name carries so much weight with
the public, his critics argue, he has a special responsibility to
keep the distinction between advertising and education clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on his reputation,'' said Dr. Herbert Rakatansky,
chairman of the AMA's ethics council, ``he should disclose any
financial interest or tie to those providing a medical service or
treatment he or his Web site is recommending or it is a betrayal of
trust. He has to remain independent.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, an official at the Web site said Koop's contract had
been changed to eliminate the provision under which he received a
percentage of sales of health services or products generated by the
site.

   Financial Ties: Health Information Or Advertising?
</P>
<P>
   The issue of compensation aside, critics say it has not always
been clear whether information about health products or services on
the DrKoop.com site are company promotions or advertising, or
balanced medical and health information.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, Dr. Joshua Hauser, a medical ethicist at the
University of Chicago, said that when he visited the site two
months ago he discovered a DrKoop.com Community Partners Program.
It contained a list of hospitals and health centers described as
``the most innovative and advanced health care institutions across
the country.'' In fact, the list was an advertisement for 14
hospitals, each of which had paid a fee of about $40,000 to be
included.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by the list, Hauser said he made repeated telephone
calls and sent numerous e-mails to the DrKoop.com headquarters in
Austin, asking whether what he read was advertising or editorial
content. Finally, he said, he received an e-mail from a company
official, who told him that the Community Partners were advertisers
and assured him that this fact would be made clear on the site. But
when he checked later, no such steps had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a site whose slogan was `Your Trusted Health Network,'''
Hauser said, he found ``this blurring of the line between editorial
content and advertising to be a problematic conflict of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Web sites like DrKoop.com have the potential to lead to better
and faster information,'' he said. ``But not if companies can buy
their way onto sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel W. Hackett, chief executive of DrKoop.com, said in an
interview that he did not know why the changes had not been made.
About 10 days ago, after the interview, the site was changed to say
that the hospitals ``represent prominent health care institutions
across the country.'' A newly worded flag inviting visitors to
``Find a health care provider near you'' was labeled as an
advertisement. And a notation was posted on the hospital listings
saying that the institutions had paid a fee to be included.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, critics say, the Web site was slow to disclose
financial ties with Quintiles Transnational Corp., a Durham, N.C.,
company that manages clinical trials of new drugs for
pharmaceutical companies and is using the Web site to recruit
volunteers for the trials.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site originally gave Quintiles space to declare itself
``the world's leading clinical organization,'' but contained no
mention of a financial agreement. But in separate interviews last
Sunday and Monday, officials of DrKoop.com and Quintiles
acknowledged that the Web site was entitled to receive a payment
from Quintiles for each person enrolled in a trial through the
site.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, DrKoop.com added to the Quintiles description a
sentence saying Quintiles ``has entered into a relationship with
DrKoop.com in which DrKoop.com is compensated for successfully
recruiting qualified participants into clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Food and Drug Administration regards postings of
future clinical trials to be advertising, the notices of trials are
not labeled as such on DrKoop.com.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the disclosure about the Quintiles arrangement,
visitors to the Web site are not informed that the inspector
general of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is
conducting an inquiry into whether the newly evolving business of
commercially run clinical trials of drugs properly protect the
interests of patients and other potential test subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said that in his view the Web site already carried a
more than adequate description of risks associated with clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement with Quintiles was one of the issues that has
exposed Koop to criticism from AMA officials. Under the Web site's
original operating plan, Koop would have been entitled to 2 percent
of payments from Quintiles, Hackett said. Under AMA rules,
``payment by or to a physician solely for the referral of a patient
is fee splitting and is unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about a possible ethics violation, Koop said that he
had received not ``one dollar'' from Quintiles because no referrals
had yet resulted from the site, and that Web site visitors were not
his ``patients.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rakatansky said the ethics principle would apply if people
visited the site and signed up because of their trust in Koop, and
his connection with the company running the trials was not
disclosed.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Industry Ties: Drawing Criticism In Political Arena
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Koop's financial arrangements that have come
under fire. He has also drawn criticism for forming a partnership
with the American Council on Science and Health in May.
</P>
<P>
   A press release said the partnership was intended to provide
consumers with ``an unbiased, scientific analysis of the latest
trends in health and medicine, as well as clarifications of health
misinformation found in the mainstream press.'' Information from
the council, which identifies itself as a nonprofit consumer
advocacy organization and receives financing both from industry and
from private foundations, is published on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But other consumer advocates say the council is hardly unbiased.
Rather, they say, the group consistently takes industry's side in
disputes over product safety. The council, said Philip E. Clapp,
president of the National Environmental Trust, ``has never met a
pesticide it didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   An official of the council said those accusations were false,
adding that the group's mission is to offer balanced,
scientifically-based analysis of health news. He said the council
provided the information to the Web site free to help carry out
that mission.
</P>
<P>
   Koop dismissed criticism of the council, saying it ``takes
positions based on science, not political correctness.'' He said it
``often undertakes research on issues that the media have already
decided are resolved,'' adding: ``When they go against the popular
story narrative, the media and activists get upset. Curiously, the
media and activist groups don't bat an eye when a lurid allegation
is made about a product's hazards by an unqualified source.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Koop's activities in the political arena have also come
under scrutiny. In April, the former surgeon general circulated a
letter in Congress on behalf of legislation that could enable the
Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison, N.J., the company that
manufacturers the allergy drug Claritin, to extend its patent on
the medicine by five years, an extension that could generate an
estimated $6 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The following month, Koop also met with members of the House
Commerce Committee to defend the company's position on legislation
involving another drug, used to treat hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   The Star-Ledger of Newark reported in June, however, that Koop
did not disclose that his nonprofit organization, the Koop
Foundation, had earlier in the year received a $1 million grant
from Schering-Plough. A spokesman for the drug company said there
was no connection between the grant and Koop's efforts on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Koop acknowledged that his foundation had received the grant
from Schering-Plough, but he said the company's money did not
influence his public positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never disclosed the grant because I did not think it was an
issue,'' he said. ``I'm not a lobbyist, de facto or otherwise. I
did not receive any payment for my work. Most foundations accept
grants from private sources. There was no quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true,'' he went on, ``there are people in my situation
who could not receive a million-dollar grant and stay objective.
But I do. I was approached by people who asked me if I would
represent the side of tobacco in the tobacco settlement and I
refused. I can tell you it would have been very worth my while.''
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Koop testified at a congressional hearing
about the contention that some latex gloves are causing
life-threatening allergies. He said the claims were highly
exaggerated and called them ``borderline hysteria.'' Koop based his
conclusions, he said, on a study by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Michele Pearson, the chief investigator of the CDC's
latex-allergy inquiry, said that while the agency had collected raw
data from blood samples, Koop's statement went beyond what the
centers' data could show. However, research paid for by the
Allegiance Healthcare Corp., a leading manufacturer of the latex
gloves in question, reached identical conclusions to those cited by
Koop.
</P>
<P>
   Koop said that he was misled about the nature of the latex
gloves study and was not aware of a connection between his comments
and the analysis paid for by Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he did not believe he had been involved in any
conflicts of interest. ``I didn't go into DrKoop.com to make
money,'' he said. ``I did it to change the way that medicine is
practiced, to bring important information to patients faster and
get them more involved in decisions about their health.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop said, too, that as chairman of DrKoop.com he was deeply
committed to making it clear that he was not practicing medicine on
the Web site and to keeping the lines between advertising and
balanced content clear. ``But I guess we have to redouble our
efforts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such statements, though, do not erase the sense many of his
critics have that America's family doctor, as Koop referred to
himself in a 1991 memoir, has put his credibility at risk. Some of
those most critical were once Koop's most ardent admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Koop was much revered by the people he trained,'' said a
Public Health Service doctor who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``He inspired me to became a doctor in the first place.
But many of these people believe now that the way he is acting is a
big departure from what we saw in him as a public health leader _
and he was one of the great ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop, told of the physician's comment, offered a suggestion to
his detractor. ``He or she ought to come and talk to me about it,''
he said.

HAILED AS A SURGEON GENERAL, KOOP NOW ATTACKED OVER HIS WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.H., Ill., N.C., N.J.)   (Eds: A longer version, KOOP-ETHICS-FLAP-L, has also moved.)

 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the eight years he held the post of U.S. surgeon general,
Dr. C. Everett Koop became one of the country's most authoritative
and recognizable public figures on the subject of health.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a decade after leaving office, Koop, now 82, is
facing criticism, from medical ethicists, including two
representatives of the American Medical Association, consumer
advocates and others.
</P>
<P>
   Among the complaints are that his hugely popular health
information Web site, DrKoop.com, has frequently blurred the line
between its objective information and its advertising or
promotional content, and that his ties to business have not been
properly disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent days, for example, the Web site did not give notice
of an arrangement that entitled the company and Koop himself to a
commission on products and services sold because of the Web site.
Koop gave up those commissions on Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   With the explosion of e-commerce, the distinction between
objective information and advertising has blurred across much of
the Web, as newspapers and newer types of information providers
struggle to capitalize on the information they gather, and as other
businesses try to use the new technology to connect with new
customers. Many sites, for example, receive a commission for
referring their users to online merchants, and what would be called
advertisers in other media are often labeled ``partners.''
</P>
<P>
   But Koop's site and his role in it have come under particular
scrutiny not only because of his stature but because what is
involved is the public's health. Complicating the matter is the
traditionally strict regulation of medical practices and
advertising _ an issue that the profession and the federal
government have yet to fully address in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The critics of the former surgeon general say that he has done
nothing illegal but that he has _ knowingly or not _ engaged in
activities that amount to a conflict of interest, or the appearance
of one. Some say Koop, who became a role model to young physicians
with his campaigns to deter cigarette smoking and to raise AIDS
awareness, has in effect traded on his respected name for financial
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly a very honorable man,'' said Dr. Robert M.
Tenery Jr., a former chairman of the AMA's council on ethics and
judicial affairs, when asked to comment on the criticisms. ``But to
claim that you're the nation's family doctor, well, perhaps he's
not tainted, but the picture is colored somewhat by his relations
to vested interests.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over the last few weeks, Koop said he would be
making changes in his financial arrangements and on the Web site;
some of those changes have already taken effect. In response to his
critics, Koop said that he had done nothing wrong and that he
remained devoted to educating the public about health issues. He
cannot help it, he said, that some people are bothered by the idea
of a former public servant's making money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been bought,'' he said. ``I cannot be bought. I
am an icon, and I have a reputation for honesty and integrity, and
let the chips fall where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop and other investors started the Web site in 1998 and took
it public with an initial offering of stock in June, quickly
joining the ranks of Internet multimillionaires. Koop is chairman
of DrKoop.com and a major shareholder in the company. On paper, the
stock he held at the time of the initial offering is worth more
than $47 million, as of the close of the market Friday. As
chairman, he draws an annual salary of $135,000 plus other payments
like speaking fees.
</P>
<P>
   On its 80,000 electronic pages, DrKoop.com offers information on
medical conditions like heart disease and anorexia, features an Ask
the Expert column and includes advice on topics like purchasing
health insurance and participating in clinical trials of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman, Koop says he takes overall responsibility for
DrKoop.com. But the day-to-day operations are managed by executives
and staff members at the company's headquarters in Austin, Texas.
Koop lives in Hanover, N.H., where he runs the Koop Institute, a
research center connected with Dartmouth Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Koop's name and his ranking in opinion polls as the
nation's most trusted health authority appears to have been very
much on the minds of the former surgeon general and his business
advisers in founding DrKoop.com. In a prospectus filed June 8 with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said its goal
was to ``establish the DrKoop.com brand so that consumers associate
the trustworthiness and credibility of Dr. C. Everett Koop with our
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other commercial Web sites, DrKoop.com may accept
advertising. But because Koop's name carries so much weight with
the public, his critics argue, he has a special responsibility to
keep the distinction between advertising and education clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on his reputation,'' said Dr. Herbert Rakatansky,
chairman of the AMA's ethics council, ``he should disclose any
financial interest or tie to those providing a medical service or
treatment he or his Web site is recommending or it is a betrayal of
trust. He has to remain independent.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of compensation aside, critics say it has not always
been clear whether information about health products or services on
the DrKoop.com site are company promotions or advertising, or
balanced medical and health information.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, Dr. Joshua Hauser, a medical ethicist at the
University of Chicago, said that when he visited the site two
months ago he discovered a list of hospitals and health centers
described as ``the most innovative and advanced health care
institutions across the country.'' In fact, the list was an
advertisement for 14 hospitals, each of which had paid a fee of
about $40,000 to be included.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a site whose slogan was `Your Trusted Health Network,'''
Hauser said, he found ``this blurring of the line between editorial
content and advertising to be a problematic conflict of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop has also drawn criticism for forming a partnership with the
American Council on Science and Health, which identifies itself as
a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization and receives financing
both from industry and from private foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Other consumer advocates say the council is hardly unbiased.
Rather, they say, the group consistently takes industry's side in
disputes over product safety. The council, said Philip E. Clapp,
president of the National Environmental Trust, ``has never met a
pesticide it didn't like.''
</P>

   An official of the council said those accusations were false,
adding that the group's mission is to offer balanced,
scientifically-based analysis of health news.
</P>

   COPENHAGEN, Denmark _ Swedes may share history, culture and some
language with the Danes, but they haven't always been welcome when
they have crossed the Baltic channel that separates the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the nations have fought a series of bloody wars over
the centuries, usually with the Danes on the losing side.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in a move symbolic of how the new Europe is breaking
down its age-old divisions, the Danes are about to make it easier
than ever for Swedes to come calling, and far from fearing the
consequences, they view the occasion as a chance to bury hatchets,
raise future prospects and smooth over clashing national
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   A new 9.5-mile, $2 billion tunnel and bridge connection called
the Oresund Fixed Link is being completed that will tie Sweden to
the continent of Europe for the first time and create a new
European trade and marketing center that will surpass Stockholm and
equal those of cities like Berlin; Hamburg, Germany; Zurich,
Switzerland, and Amsterdam, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   When the four-lane highway and dual-track railroad is opened to
traffic next July 1, Copenhagen, Denmark's capital, will be only an
11-minute ride from Malmo, Sweden's third-largest city, and a
single metropolitan region with a population of 3.2 million people
will be born.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Swedes won a series of wars
with the Danes and kept walking off with territories that had been
Danish.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Danes were more prosperous and powerful than
the Swedes but a lot less lucky. When Swedish royalty cast covetous
eyes this way in 1658, the harshest winter in history promptly
arrived, allowing a march across the frozen sea. The Swedes caught
the enemy by surprise and diminished Denmark a little more. By the
19th century, the two nations were still fighting, and the
conquering Swedes made the Danes cede to them all of what is now
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the moment of bonding provided by the new link has
become a chance for Denmark and Sweden to put to rest their
belligerent old relationship, and this time the Danes finally seem
to be on the winning side. ``We love the Danes more than the Danes
love us,'' conceded Per Olov Enquist, 65, the Swedish novelist and
playwright who lived here during the 15 years he was married to a
Danish woman.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while he never encountered ``aggressive
anti-Swedish feelings,'' he felt that Danes are generally
appreciated more than Swedes. ``For example, when a Swede speaks
Danish, it sounds stupid, but when a Dane speaks Swedish, it's
considered cute,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the judgment is a stereotype popular in Copenhagen and
largely undisputed in Malmo of Swedes as stiff, formal, reserved,
humorless, collective-minded and ever obedient to intrusive state
rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danes will say, `Oh you Swedes, you have laws against
everything,''' Enquist said. ``They make it sound as if we have
barbed wire around the whole country.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Danes, by contrast, are thought of as the Southerners of
Northern Europe, cosmopolitan, individualistic, extroverted, high
spirited and fun-loving, and they are quite content to feed the
image. ``When I go to the Nordic Council,'' said Magrethe Auken,
54, a member of Parliament, ``you can be sure that where there is
laughing, celebrating and drinking, that's where the Danes are.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbro Reinestrand and her husband, Hans, both 56-year-old
Swedes from the southwestern town of Kungalv, stood on the Malmo
shore one recent afternoon and looked admiringly out at the bridge
melting into the mists above the Oresund on its curving trajectory
to Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to go over there,'' Mrs. Reinestrand said. She raised
her arms in a folk dancer's pose and tapped her feet. ``Danes are
so happy, and Swedes are so moody,'' she said.

   Swedes in Scania, the southern province of the country, are
willing to accept this unflattering picture of their national
character because they're really talking about Swedes in the North,
particularly in the area of Stockholm, the national capital 400
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who live in Scania think of themselves as more Danish
than Swedish, and they think of Stockholmers as gray and dull, more
like Russians,'' said Fredrik Nilsson, a Swedish anthropologist
from the University of Lund who conducted a study of attitudes on
either side of the Oresund and published his conclusions in a book
called ``When One Hour Became 10 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that, as in other parts of Europe where centuries-old
conflicts affect present day senses of identity, many Scanians
still think of themselves as former Danes. The province was annexed
by Sweden 341 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Scanians, who often fly their own distinctive red and yellow
flag in place of the blue and yellow national standard, refer to
residents of the capital scornfully as ``Zero-Eights,'' a reference
to the city's telephone area code.
</P>
<P>
   Scanians resent being caricatured by other Swedes as provincial
lowlanders, and they feel neglected by the national government.
``For a lot of people in Scania, the bridge is their exit from the
Swedish nation state'' Nilsson said. ``They feel that they're going
home to Denmark.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reinestrand gently patted her own backside and confirmed
the sentiment. ``We call ourselves the rump of Sweden,'' she said
brightly, ``and we feel much closer to Copenhagen than to
Stockholm.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson added: ``The people behind the bridge like to say we are
uniting Sweden and Denmark, but to ordinary people here it is a
question of uniting Scania and Denmark. People don't think about
two countries, they think about one region.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what the state-backed investment promotion and tourism
development agencies have been focusing on in the run-up to the
bridge's opening. It is their hope that Denmark will not become
simply a ``footprint'' for Swedish transports on their way to
Germany and the European heartland but that the 8,000-square-mile
Oresund area will become a place unto itself as regionality and
nation-to-nation cooperation become more important, and national
identity less.

<P>
   While the European Union, of which both Denmark and Sweden are
members, has broken down trade and currency barriers, it has lagged
in building transportation connections like the Oresund link to
make come true its hopes of a continental community that is
geographically rational and accessible.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lars Kolind, 52, a manufacturing executive who is one of
Denmark's most innovative business leaders, believes that there are
complementary resources on either side of the Oresund that are
particularly well suited for the region's specialities like
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical research, environmental
science and information technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of business depend on networking, close
communication and exchange of knowledge, and though I'm fully aware
of the advantages of the Internet, there is no substitute for
physical contact,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   A country with real industrial might, Sweden has businesses that
are large and muscular where Danish businesses rely on their
centuries-old skills in international commerce. ``Swedish business
is more powerful than ours, but we are the traders, the
manipulators, the ultimate pragmatists,'' said Michael
Christiansen, 54, the director general of the Royal Danish Theater
who is chairman of the consortium that built the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The collaborative possibilities are inviting, but the divisions
between the two like-minded countries could still stall progress.
Christiansen said he believed that Denmark and Sweden had drawn
farther apart in the last 20 years, and he recalled that at the
time the decision was taken to construct the Oresund link in 1991,
majorities of both populations were against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two areas are like bears just sitting sleeping,'' he said.
``The question is, are they ready to move. We're not quite sure.''

   WASHINGTON _ Barely weeks after the independent counsel law died
and was bid good riddance by everyone from President Clinton to
Kenneth Starr, Washington is astir with calls for a new round of
independent investigations.
</P>
<P>
   On controversial matters like the 1993 government raid on the
compound of the Branch Davidian sect in Waco, Democratic
fund-raising, and the possible diversion and laundering of
international relief money by the Russians, the administration's
critics have renewed demands for special counsels.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute: Aggressive outside investigations were
supposed to be out of favor after the nation's experience with
Starr's prolonged Whitewater inquiry, which encompassed the
president's sex life and led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   What gives?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that things are back to normal in Washington now,
even if the legal mechanics have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law was supposed to take politics out of
investigations of the government, but didn't. It gave power to a
three-judge panel to appoint and oversee independent counsels,
taking from the Executive Branch the power of investigating itself.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Whitewater inquiry and other investigations of the
Clinton administration, the law became a popular target of
criticism. Democrats claimed it was being used for partisan ends,
while Republicans said the White House and its allies had resorted
to political attacks to taint legitimate inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   So the law was scrapped, and now the American tradition of
outside inquiries continues, with the risk of political taint at
least as strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure over disclosures that the FBI had withheld
evidence of the use of incendiary grenades in the Waco siege,
Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday announced her intention to
appoint an independent lawyer to re-examine the government's
handling of the Branch Davidians. The inquiry would not directly
involve the same kind of independent counsel that has been used to
investigate Clinton and members of his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of the type of investigation, calls for
independent inquiries even after the expiration of the law were
entirely predictable, say former prosecutors and officials. The
Justice Department's credibility is at a new low after the Waco
disclosures, on the heels of its failure to get to the bottom of
the campaign finance questions. ``There is a lack of confidence
over the ability of the Justice Department to do its job,'' said
Paul Curran, a special counsel during the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno made greater use of the independent counsel law than
any other attorney general since its enactment after the Watergate
scandal, she was besieged by critics urging its wider use, and
seemed relieved by its lapse this year. In its place, she issued
new rules giving her broad discretion over the appointment of
outside counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The rules do nothing to resolve the problem of an outside
counsel's autonomy. To be credible, an outside prosecutor should
generally not be accountable to another member of the Executive
Branch, like the president or one of his appointees. But in being
unaccountable, a prosecutor may abuse his power and become
partisan, as Democrats have charged lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is always going to be there,'' said Terry
Eastland, who was a Justice Department official in the Reagan
administration and who has long been critical of the law. ``It
always has been there from the beginning and it is embedded in the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ulysses S. Grant had the dubious distinction of
appointing and then dismissing the nation's first outside
prosecutor. The lawyer, John B. Henderson, was named to examine the
relationship between the administration and what became known as
the St. Louis Whiskey Ring, a group of Midwestern liquor distillers
and federal revenue agents who cheated the government out of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let no guilty man escape!'' Grant exclaimed as he opened the
investigation in 1875. But Henderson was dismissed after his
inquiry focused on Orville E. Babcock, the president's private
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Harry Truman were among those
who later appointed outside counsels. And one of Truman's attorneys
general also fired an outside prosecutor, after that prosecutor
decided to investigate the Justice Department. Truman, shaken by
that decision, promptly replaced his attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   But the most infamous incident was the Saturday Night Massacre
in 1973, when President Richard M. Nixon dismissed the special
Watergate prosecutor, Archibald Cox, named by his Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   That action ultimately led to the adoption of the independent
counsel law. But, as is obvious today, it did little to quell the
political controversies surrounding sensitive government
investigations.

<P>
   Boom times have a trademarked feel. Literally. It is harder and
harder to get through the day without tripping over the little
``TM'' sign that is the equivalent of a ``No Trespassing _
Violators Will Be Prosecuted'' sign in an empty swath of New
England woods. It is not always clear who owns the property in
question, but it is abundantly clear that you don't. Tread on it at
your risk.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest signs of TM-ing, as noted by The New York
Observer, popped up at the end of Cindy Adams' gossip column in The
New York Post. After years of signing off with the phrase ``Only in
New York, kids, only in New York,'' Ms. Adams has applied for a
trademark. She has also fenced off the word gossip, at least for
use in perfumes and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Trademarks flourish in a strong economy, and the boom of the
late 1990s has seen an increase in the trademarking of words,
images and sounds by at least 10 percent annually in three of the
last four years, according to figures from the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the rate of increase (Increase(TM) was registered by
Enrich Corp. for shampoos and nutritional supplements) is
turbocharged (Turbocharge(TM) is used by U S West Communications
Inc. for its credit-card validation services). If applications
continue at the current pace (Pace(TM) applied for or registered to
more than 250 entities), there will be 25 percent more in 1999 than
1998. One clue to the spike: The words ``dot com'' figure in 222
pending or registered trademarks on the government's trademark data
base.
</P>
<P>
   Trademarks differ from copyrights, which protect works of
creative expression _ books, artwork, music, commuter software and
the like. Businesses or individuals register trademarks to
establish the source of a product or service. It costs $245 to
register a trademark for a single class of goods.
</P>
<P>
   Even trademark is trademarked. Resistance is futile (Paramount
Pictures trademarked that Star Trekism for everything from pinball
machines to wrapping paper). As soon as some phrases catch on, they
get taken. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld may have put Yadda Yadda Yadda
into the vernacular, but Custom Tees Inc., a Connecticut sportswear
company, registered it for clothing and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that Seinfeld objects. Comedian Johnny
Carson, however, fought back. It took him 10 years, but a federal
appeals court ruled in 1987 that Here's Johnny Portable Toilets
Inc. had violated the star's ``right of publicity'' and owed him
$31,661.96. During the legal proceedings, Carson trademarked
``Heeere's Johnny.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record (16 trademarks), newspapers, magazines and news
shows have long since protected their features. The ``60 Minutes''
ticking stopwatch is a trademark, as is the slogan of The New York
Times, ``All the News That's Fit to Print,'' and the names of some
of its sections like ``Circuits'' and ``House and Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities like Oprah and Madonna have also registered their
names. Elvis Presley Enterprises, Inc. holds dozens of trademarks.
Still, Diagnostic Hybrids Inc. of Ohio somehow slipped through and
got Elvis for use on, of all things, ``diagnostic preparations for
clinical and medical use.''
</P>
<P>
   The roar of the MGM lion has been trademarked. Even skylines. In
New York, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and
Rockefeller Center have all staked claims to their images.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing seems to be sacred. Nearly 500 trademarks on Christmas
(from Papa Noel's Cajun Christmas Cap to Special Christmas Brew
Beer) have been issued or are pending. Nothing seems to be profane.
Six trademark applications have recently been filed for barnyard
words that are unprintable in this newspaper. In the world of
trademarks, there is little shame (only seven trademarks contain
the word shame) and much integrity (the word is part of 279
trademarks).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Donovan, a partner in the law firm of Donovan &AMP; Yee, said,
``Everybody has realized that there is money to be made. While I am
all for protection of one's intellectual proprietary rights, I
think there needs to be some balance so that freedom of expression
isn't squashed.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the balance that U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard
Gesell tried to strike in 1985, when he rejected Lucasfilm Ltd.'s
claim that political commercials sparring over President Ronald
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative would dilute the company's
trademark if allowed to call SDI ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These laws do not reach into the realm of public discourse to
regulate the use of terms used outside the context of trade,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At least, not most places. Maybe only in New York.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Mayor Rudolph Giuliani swore to serve as jury
foreman in a Manhattan personal injury case last week, he set off
down a path many citizens but few famous folk have trod.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a settlement, Giuliani will spend Tuesday listening to a
final day of tedious, at times tortuous testimony in an intensely
personal personal injury case _ a man's claim that water in a
shower scalded his genitals so badly he has been unable to have sex
with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The six-person jury will then, under the guidance of their
hard-charging foreman, decide whether Oliver Johnson's request for
$7 million in punitive damages from his landlord is justified. If
the jurors rule that it is, they must put a dollar figure on the
pain (and deprivation) Johnson and his wife, Larene, have suffered.
</P>
<P>
   That Giuliani was called is far from noteworthy. Since loopholes
allowing doctors, lawyers and a dozen other professions to avoid
jury duty were eliminated in New York in 1996, an increasing number
of politicians, judges and celebrities have been called. The trend
is occurring elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Harvey Keitel, Robert DeNiro, Marisa
Tomei and Bernadette Peters, among others, were all called. Gov.
George Pataki was also called, and the state's chief judge, Judith
Kaye, has been called twice.
</P>
<P>
   But of that group, only Keitel and Giuliani were actually
chosen. (The mayor is not alone; other lawyers are empaneled with
him.) Though no definitive studies have been done, legal experts
say the mayor's pioneering service will provide anecdotal evidence
to a continuing debate about the wisdom of choosing politicians,
celebrities and particularly lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers have long shied away from choosing celebrities,
politicians, judges or lawyers as jurors lest they unduly influence
the others. A study conducted for the state court system last year
found that 61 percent of lawyers believed their colleagues would
have an undue influence. But in other studies non-lawyers said they
give lawyers no more credence during deliberations than other
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Sonya Hamlin, a Manhattan jury consultant, predicted that
Giuliani will have tremendous authority as foreman. ``They could
turn to the mayor,'' she said, ``and ask, `What would be the impact
on the city?'''
</P>
<P>
   But others downplayed the mayor's impact. Vincent Homenick,
chief clerk of the Manhattan Jury Division, said anecdotally that
the judges and lawyers who served have not have enormous sway over
their peers. ``They're New Yorkers,'' he said, referring to other
jurors. ``It takes a lot for them to be overwhelmed by anything.''
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer, though, did go too far. A Manhattan judge ruled in
June 1998 that Ralph Gant, a lawyer serving as a juror in a civil
trial regarding control of a rent-controlled apartment, gave his
fellow jurors an incorrect legal definition during deliberations.
State Supreme Court Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich threw out the
verdict and ordered a new trial. A special committee has since
recommended that judges instruct jurors not to ask for or accept
legal definitions from lawyers serving on the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry, too, that Giuliani, a likely U.S. Senate candidate,
who relishes the opportunity to express his views on civic duty and
the law among other topics, might use the case to make a political
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamlin believes politics played a role in both sides'
decision to pick the mayor as foreman. ``The plaintiff's lawyers
imagine that he feels he needs to make friends in Harlem,'' said
Ms. Hamlin. ``The people who work for the landlord think he is a
conservative and he would want to prevent lots of suits like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ms. Hamlin is right and whether Giuliani adds to or
detracts from the process _ all will be revealed this week.

   LOS ANGELES: according to Guldbech.
</P>
<P>
   Animal activists attribute the change in Los Angeles policy to
the hiring of Knapp a year ago, saying he has brought a more
cooperative and animal-friendly attitude to the department,
stemming from his background as former director of the Humane
Society of Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go to the shelters with more positive attitudes and
work with them,'' saidNew Leash on Life founder Bobby Dorafshar,
who worked with Knapp to create the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the most important thing out of this is that they want to
work with us as well,'' Dorafshar said.
</P>
<P>
   The department's budget was boosted this year to $10.3 million,
a $2.3 million increase, Knapp said, allowing it to hire additional
medical and animal care staff. The city has also authorized a
facility study to evaluate the need for additional shelters.
</P>
<P>
   While the details of the program are not expected to be made
final for several weeks, Dorafshar said he has a number of ideas
for his group to pursue. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   Weekly seminars to teach people how to take care of their
animals. This, he hopes, would make them less likely to give up
their animals for adoption because of behavioral problems, as well
as prompt more owners to spay or neuter their pets.
</P>
<P>
   Expanded efforts to match animals with people looking for
certain breeds, as well as link lost pets with their owners.
</P>
<P>
   Inviting schools to shelters to teach children about animal
care.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to curtail backyard breeding and encouraging people to
adopt instead.
</P>
<P>
   Making the shelters seem a more welcoming, people-friendly place
by staffing them with more volunteers.

   LOS ANGELES: 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some students are achieving success despite systemic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Suranyi, 17, who was interviewed by the Daily News in
1988, said she believes she'll be well prepared for college despite
having had to fight some teachers who discouraged her from taking
tougher academic courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my teachers have said you're not smart enough. It does
put your self-esteem down,'' said Suranyi, a senior at Chatsworth
High School who hopes to study premedicine at the University of
California, Santa Barbara, or at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Diana's mother, Susan, said her daughter's success is her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her education was average. I don't think that she got anything
special,'' said Suranyi, a school nurse. ``If you're going to
succeed in public school, it has to come from the child. It's her
own desires and ambitions that she is were she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Curreri, 17, said he has enjoyed a different academic
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our teachers push you,'' said Curreri, a senior at
Crescenta Valley High School in the Glendale Unified School
District where the school's most recent combined SAT score topped
1,128 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very well prepared. I feel I'm going to do very well in
college,'' said Curreri, who plans to study sports medicine and
continue playing water polo, an extracurricular activity he
discovered six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To be certain, education has improved during the past decade. A
statewide class-size reduction program cut the number of children
to 20 per teacher in kindergarten through third grade. Similar
efforts have begun in eighth- and ninth-grade English classes and
some ninth-grade math classes.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Slosberg, a kindergarten and reading teacher at Welby Way
Elementary in Canoga Park, said the smaller classes have benefited
students and teachers alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kindergartners need to get up and move around, and with fewer
students in the classroom, they can do that,'' she said. ``We also
know the children better, we get to learn where they're at
(academically), and we can offer more individualized attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Academic reform programs such as Los Angeles Educational
Alliance for Restructuring Now, or LEARN, has shifted
decision-making from the district's central offices to school
campuses. And a new California law has banned social promotion, the
practice of advancing ill-prepared students to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen how we've improved,'' Slosberg said. ``We're taking
care of the problems before they become worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those dramatic changes, today's students are no better
prepared academically than they were 25 years ago, said Warren
Furumoto, director of the Center for Academic Preparedness at
California State University, Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   He said too many teachers still ask students to memorize
disparate pieces of information rather than analyze and evaluate
facts in meaningful ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we ask students to process information hasn't
changed,'' Furumoto said. ``They're pretty much doing the same
thing they were doing 20 to 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, Furumoto said, is the amount of work students
have to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has increased tremendously,'' he said. ``The pressure on
students is fantastically overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a University of Michigan study, average homework
for 9- to 11-year-olds increased from 169 minutes per week to 210
minutes between 1981 and 1997.

OFFICIALS WILL TRY TO FIND HOMES FOR ADOPTABLE STRAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY HARRISON SHEPPARD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In an ambitious move to save the lives of
thousands of stray dogs and cats, city officials said they will
work with animal activists to find homes for every adoptable pet
brought to the pound.
</P>
<P>
   Across Los Angeles, more than 45,000 dogs and cats were put to
death last year, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that may change: The Department of Animal Services's new
program relies heavily on the public and animal rescue groups,
which hope to recruit at least 100 volunteers to hold open houses
and educational seminars to encourage adoption and proper care of
animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to life,'' said Dan Knapp, general manager of
the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shelters have been perceived as places of death, and the
Department of Animal Services is committed to life,'' Knapp said.
``We're going to be doing all that we can to place 100 percent of
adoptable animals.''
</P>
<P>
   The city will launch its novel program on a trial basis at the
East Valley Animal Shelter in North Hollywood in Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley, the second busiest shelter in Los Angeles.
Officials hope to expand the program to the city's five other
shelters and to all types of animals including horses and birds. No
date has been set for its start.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a severe overpopulation of dogs and cats, the city's
six shelters kill animals sometimes after only a week or two to
make room for the new strays. At East Valley, for example, only 48
percent of the adoptable animals _ those that are not sick or
vicious _ are adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The rest are euthanized.
</P>
<P>
   Working with volunteer animal rescue groups, the department
plans to make East Valley a ``life-oriented'' shelter that finds
homes for all adoptable dogs and cats.
</P>
<P>
   Knapp said the program will include making monthly reports to
the community on how many animals are killed and problems the
department is facing.
</P>
<P>
   The department also is evaluating whether to expand the hours of
the shelters, which are now open 8 a.m to 5 p.m. Tuesday through
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Knapp said he knows the program has ambitious goals, but he said
it has been achieved in other cities, including San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't make a commitment, you'll never get there,''
Knapp said. ``We're calling it the beginning of our journey.''
</P>
<P>
   New Leash On Life is one of the first animal rescue groups
working with the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're going to try to do is bring a lot of awareness to
the shelter system, that the shelter is not a bad place,'' said
Kelly Dwyer, operations director for New Leash. ``If you're looking
for a pet or a companion, that's the place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's six shelters received more than 46,000 dogs and
19,000 cats during the last fiscal year, Knapp said. About 70
percent of those were euthanized, although he said that figure may
be misleading because only a third of the animals that come in are
considered adoptable. Another 44,000 stray dogs are believed to be
wandering the streets.
</P>
<P>
   A new state law which took effect July 1 seeks to improve the
care of animals in shelters and increase the amount of time they
are held before being euthanized. Shelters now must hold animals
for four days if the facility has night or weekend hours and six
days if it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   However, animal activists say the law has had the unintended
consequence of causing the earlier death of healthy animals, to
make room for sick ones that must receive care. That makes the need
for the life-oriented program that much greater, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The law, sponsored by Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, also
encourages partnerships with private animal rescue groups. A
spokesman for Hayden was glad to hear of the city's new efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a start. It should be encouraged,'' said Hayden
spokesman Rocky Rushing. Previously, ``In Los Angeles, I think the
term `animal shelter' was being misused because they were more like
death centers.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco embarked on a ``low-kill'' policy several years
ago that has the city Department of Animal Care and Control working
with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to find
homes for the animals.
</P>
<P>
   The SPCA has greater resources and funding, and is therefore
more capable to find homes for the animals, said Vicky Guldbech,
the department's captain of field services.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal year 1998, San Francisco's shelters took in 14,590
animals and euthanized about a third of those, but only 392 of
those euthanized were considered adoptable, according to Guldbech.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)Animal activists attribute the change in
Los Angeles policy to the hiring of Knapp a year ago, saying he has
brought a more cooperative and animal-friendly attitude to the
department, stemming from his background as former director of the
Humane Society of Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go to the shelters with more positive attitudes and
work with them,'' saidNew Leash on Life founder Bobby Dorafshar,
who worked with Knapp to create the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the most important thing out of this is that they want to
work with us as well,'' Dorafshar said.

   Just about anyone who has flown in the coach section of a
commercial airplane in recent years comes away convinced that space
is getting more cramped. No one appears to doubt that airlines have
installed narrower seats and added more rows so they can wring a
few more dollars of profit out of each flight.
</P>
<P>
   But while the experience of flying, especially in economy class,
may indeed be worse than ever, the industry insists it is not
because the plane is smaller. The fact is, airplane interiors have
actually gotten slightly larger in recent years, seats in coach in
most cases are a little wider, and there may even be more leg room
than there was 10 or 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Impossible? Yet true, say the airlines, seat makers and airplane
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, what constitutes a bad flight is of intense
interest to airlines and airplane makers. Boeing Co., which
produces most of the world's passengers jets, has done extensive
research, interviewing 10,000 people about what they hate most
about flying. What Boeing found is that passengers tend to blame
leg room and seat width when they are really angry about other
things.
</P>
<P>
   According to Boeing's research, two factors above all others
determine whether a flight is enjoyable, especially when traveling
relatively short distances: One is whether the plane arrives on
time, and the other is whether or not there is a person in the
adjacent seat. If your flight is late and there's somebody in the
seat next to you impinging on your sense of personal space, you're
more likely to also complain about other things, real or imagined.
(On long-range flights, more than 5,000 miles, comfort becomes a
much greater priority.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When a short-range flight is late, people said the coffee was
cold, the meal was cold, the seats were lumpy,'' said Klaus Brauer,
the Boeing executive leading the research about passenger comfort.
``Every phenomenon you can think of gets influenced by the halo
effect of the reliability of the flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may help explain why there have been so many complaints of
late about the airlines. This year through August, delays were up
nearly 20 percent compared with the same period in 1998, according
to the Federal Aviation Administration. During the summer, when
thunderstorms and the introduction of new radar screens at some
air-traffic control centers caused further slowdowns, they rose 36
percent compared with last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives have been complaining that the long-outmoded
and mismanaged air traffic control system is seizing up under the
strain of greater traffic. Improvements are still years away.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, thanks to a strong economy and powerful
computers that allow airlines to precisely gauge ticket demand,
more seats than ever are being filled on any given flight. In 1988,
the average jet took off with 62.5 percent of its seats occupied.
By the end of last year, the average had jumped to 71 percent,
according to the Air Transport Association in Washington. In
practice, that means most flights during peak hours are more than
90 percent full.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the traffic on the way to the airport, the long walk
to the gate, the fight to board the plane, the dearth of palatable
food during the flight, and you get some pretty unhappy
associations with flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplane used to be the respite from a lot of these
things,'' said David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers
Association, an advocacy group. ``There were plenty of flights
where you could find extra room to spread out. Now, that extra room
isn't there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, improvements in technology have increased the range
of smaller planes. The Boeing 737 used to be able to fly only as
far as Denver from New York. But the newly redesigned models can
now make it from New York to Seattle, a six-hour trip during which
comfort, rather than on-time performance, becomes a greater
priority as the minutes tick by.
</P>
<P>
   But the dimensions of the seats themselves have not shrunk. The
width of a coach seat on Boeing's single-aisle 737 and 757, which
have the same fuselage, was about 17 inches until about 10 years
ago, when it was expanded to 17.2 inches, Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie of Europe, now Boeing's only rival, likes to
brag that the fuselage of its single-aisle A-320 jets is 7 inches
wider than the 737. But most airlines still use seats of the same
dimensions, using the extra space for a wider aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Because comfort is more important on long flights, economy seats
on wide-body airplanes are slightly larger: 18 inches on a 767 and
18.5 inches on a 777. And of course, the more you pay for a seat
the more space you get. Business-class seats are now usually 20 or
21 inches wide; first-class seats in large planes are 22 or 23
inches across.
</P>
<P>
   And while it is true that in the last 15 years many airlines
have reduced the so-called seat pitch, or the distance between your
seat and the seat in front of you, the actual amount of leg room
has not diminished, said Brauer, the creature comfort expert at
Boeing. He said the older seat backs were about 4.5 half inches
thicker than today's, so even though seat pitch has declined by
about 3 inches, there's a little more leg room.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it is true that the airplanes have not shrunk, are
not passengers getting larger? Most studies do show that Americans
in all age categories have gotten heavier. But Brauer said the
scientific literature suggests that people have not grown as much
as the media suggest. In any case, he added, the expansion in the
width of seats on narrow-body planes by 0.2 of an inch and by 1.5
inches on the newest wide-bodies ``is far in excess of the
percentage growth of the species over the period.''
</P>
<P>
   Brauer also said people tend to judge the size of an interior
space at eye level. As a result, about 12 years ago, Boeing widened
the 737 cabin by 1 inch on each side. On its newer planes it molds
ceiling panels and positions lights to make it appear that the
cabin is larger than it really is.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are also doing their part to try to make their
airplanes more comfortable. Together the nation's two largest
carriers _ United Airlines and American Airlines _ plan to spend
$900 million to outfit their fleets with new interiors over the
next few years. Many of the new coach seats will be equipped with
the amenities now found in business class, like foot rests,
adjustable lumbar supports and adjustable head rests.
</P>
<P>
   But they won't be any wider. Brauer, who likes to carry around a
tape measure, pointed out that even though most office chairs and
train and theater seats are no wider than 17 inches, they do not
seem to inspire the same amount of collective resentment as
airplane seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seattle Opera House has 17.2-inch seats,'' he said, ``and
we sit there for years and years.''

DISTRICT LETS DOWN CLASS OF 2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES --The future never looked brighter than in 1988 when
the Class of 2000 entered kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Superintendent Leonard Britton threw a districtwide party
for 60,000 kindergartners as a kickoff for a long-term study of the
class.
</P>
<P>
   Dignitaries visited campuses and made speeches, parents beamed
and children stuffed time capsules with drawings and essays
describing a Jetsons-like future of flying cars and rocket ships.
</P>
<P>
   Now the future is here _ and it bears scant resemblance to what
district officials, parents and even students envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   An academic profile of this year's high school seniors shows
that the Los Angeles Unified School District has failed the Class
of 2000 in significant ways:
</P>
<P>
   Graduation rates have stagnated;
</P>
<P>
   SAT scores are down slightly;
</P>
<P>
   While dropout rates appear to have improved, the district hasn't
activated a sophisticated computer system to accurately track
missing students.
</P>
<P>
   Now the district is embarking on a host of reforms aimed at
benefiting the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise is not there for the bulk of kids,'' said Day
Higuchi, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles. ``For kids who
don't see their future in college, they don't see anything. There's
no pot of gold at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly many members of the Class of 2000 who have made it to
their senior year are doing well and have bright futures.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands did not make it, others are failing, face an
uncertain future and are unable to take advantage of academic
reforms just starting to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   After the Class of 2000 started kindergarten in 1987, Britton's
ambitious plan never got off the ground and was quickly abandoned
amid the district's financial turmoil of the early 1990s that left
teachers with a 12percent pay cut.
</P>
<P>
   Britton had hoped to create a computer database that would track
each child's test scores, grades, attendance and other details from
kindergarten through 12th grade. Armed with that information,
Britton envisioned teachers retooling their approach, reaching out
to failing students and preventing them from dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see what was happening to them gradewise because
you can sometimes pick up trends,'' Britton said. ``You can get
early warning signs that something is not going right with a
particular child.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dream never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of died a natural death,'' Britton said. ``I was only
there three years, and the last year was a crazy year. Things were
happening between the superintendent and board. We had budget
problems. We had a teachers' strike. Everything was rechanneled in
efforts and funds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Class of 2000 hasn't fared so well either.
</P>
<P>
   Since they started school in 1987, statewide graduation rates
have remained flat.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state Department of Education, only 68.5
percent of ninth-graders who started high school in 1983-84 stayed
in school long enough to graduate in 1987-88. A decade later, 67.2
percent of the 1994-95 entering freshman class graduated in
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   The graduation rate for students in Los Angeles schools is even
worse _ 53 percent in the most recent year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lousy percentage,'' said Donna Rothenbaum, an
evaluation and research assistant for the state Department of
Education. ``We haven't shown any improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, dropout rates have declined from 6.2percent of ninth-
through 12th-graders in 1990-91 to 2.9 percent in 1997-98.
Districtwide, dropout rates have plummeted from 16.75 percent in
1987-88 to 5 percent in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   But district officials question the accuracy of the numbers.
Pending a change in the way data is collected by the state
Department of Education, the district has been reluctant to
implement a sophisticated computer tracking system that would
provide more accurate dropout statistics.
</P>
<P>
   SAT scores also have remained flat. In the Los Angeles school
district, scores have actually dipped slightly.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Los Angeles high school seniors scored a combined
total of 880 points out of a possible 1,600 points on the college
entrance exam. In 1987-88, they scored a combined total of 926
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave that class special media hype, but other than that I
don't think they were treated better or differently than any other
class,'' said Stanley Malin, a former teacher at Telfair Avenue
School in Pacoima, where kindergartners placed mementos in a time
capsule 11 years ago.

HE SPENDS TIME WITH A HERO - HIS GRANDPA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DENNIS MCCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- His grandfather's 90th birthday was coming up and
the whole family would be gathering to celebrate. It was the
perfect time to let Grandpa know exactly how he felt about him.
</P>
<P>
   So, 25-year-old Jon Banks sits at his home computer and lets the
memories flow _ tries to put into words all the warm feelings and
life lessons he's learned from his grandfather, Morrie Carr.
</P>
<P>
   Author Mitch Albom had his ``Tuesdays with Morrie'' _ a best
selling, poignant book about the writer's experiences with his aged
former professor.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Banks has his Saturday's and Sunday's with Morrie, which are
much the same.
</P>
<P>
   A student or a grandson, it doesn't make any difference because
the underlying theme of their days together with a grandfather or
elderly teacher are the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your heroes inspire you and lead you to live a better life,''
Jon Banks begins. ``My hero is Grandpa.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrie Carr sat surrounded by family on his 90th birthday,
feeling proud and honored as his grandson read his tribute to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit home, all of it,'' Morrie would say later. ``All the
stories and lessons you try to teach your grandkids about right and
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   All that advice he handed out to his grandkids with sticks of
Wrigley's spearmint gum as they took long rides in his Oldsmobile
on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked plain, from the heart,'' Morrie says, like it was
only yesterday. ``And we had a good time.''Jon smiles as he looks
over at his mother, Penny Marson, and continues reading his tribute
to Morrie.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Grandpa lost his vision, he couldn't drive anymore, which
made it pretty difficult for him to be a good traveling salesman,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While most of us would have packed it in, he soldiered on, and
Jenni, Brian, and I were recruited to help him with his business.
We would take turns helping him out with his furniture catalogs,
and we got bribed with some cash and a free lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got my driver's license, one responsibility that went
hand in hand with my Buick station wagon was taking Grandpa out to
run errands.
</P>
<P>
   ``A funny thing happened on the way to being a good grandson,''
Jon said. ``While I loved him with all my heart, I discovered that
I had never really known who Grandpa was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or more likely, by that time, I had grown old enough to
appreciate him as a person rather than as a grandpa. He became a
flesh and blood man to me, a hero with an unending amount of quirky
and endearing personality traits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had great times together. Our list of errands that we'd run
together would grow and grow. During those trips, I heard story
after story about his life and why he made the choices he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``These anecdotes became guideposts to my own self-discovery as
I learned how I became the person I am,'' Jon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did I learn right from wrong? Where did I learn what a
man should do and how a man should act? Where did I learn that
family is truly all that's important?
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer became clear _ from my grandparents and through my
mom,'' Jon said.

   ``Grandpa is legally blind. He can only see shapes and sometimes
he's not particularly adept at that. However, I dare you to back up
50 yards from him and do something that he wouldn't approve of.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll see, oh yeah, he'll see, and he'll let you know that he
doesn't approve,'' Jon said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time has slowed him down some. Grandpa no longer bounds to my
car like he did a few years ago. If the seat is too far back, he
might have trouble getting in and out. It's always too cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``And unfortunately, the passage of time has meant that we don't
go out as much as we used to. Work isn't like college.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highlight of our week now is getting together on Saturday
or Sunday, and going back on the road _ picking up the dry
cleaning, looking for batteries at Radio Shack and going to a
restaurant with good lighting and a strong cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandpa is not a great man. He's not famous and his
accomplishments won't be debated by historians. He is merely a good
and decent man who loves his family above all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the kind of man I try to be,'' Jon Banks says, walking
over to hug his grandfather on his 90th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturdays and Sundays with Morrie _ a nice story to remind us
that Grandparent's Day is coming up this month on Sunday, Sept. 12.

<P>
   The much-acclaimed economic expansion, now in its ninth year,
has blessed Americans with a cornucopia of good things _ rising
incomes, the lowest jobless rate in three decades and stock prices
going through the roof. Many Americans have used the good times to
renovate their kitchens or take that trip to Tuscany, but others
are still finding the boom a lot less satisfying than might be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans this Labor Day, the sentiment seems to be,
we're earning more, but enjoying it less.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: too much work. With the economy going like
gangbusters and with a labor shortage in much of the country, many
Americans are reluctantly clocking 60-hour weeks to do the
mountains of work that need to be done _ designing that Web page,
getting out that legal brief, finishing those architectural
renderings. For many Americans, the 40-hour week has become a fond
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Juliet Schor, the Harvard professor who wrote the 1992 book
``The Overworked American'' (Basic Books), said in an interview
that if she were to write a sequel it might be called ``The Even
More Overworked American.'' Indeed, a new study by the
International Labor Organization found that the number of hours
Americans work each year has climbed skyward while working hours in
most other industrial countries are falling.
</P>
<P>
   This trend has given Americans the dubious distinction of moving
into first place in the number of hours worked each year (1,966),
surpassing even the Japanese by about 70 hours. On average,
Americans work 350 hours more per year (that's almost nine full
work weeks) than Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things going on,'' said Schor. ``Americans
are working harder, which is common when the economy is doing well.
And a lot of today's jobs require longer hours: management jobs,
professionals working long hours at firms because that's what it
takes to succeed in these firms. Some people are working harder
because there's a lot of money to be made at the moment. But for a
lot of people, excessive working time is a major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   This explosion in hours worked has some little-understood pros
and some well-known cons. On the positive side, it has helped keep
the United States at the head of the pack in productivity.
America's economy produces more value per worker per year than any
other nation's, enabling the United States to enjoy living
standards that make most of the world envious.
</P>
<P>
   In a subtle way, the boom in working hours has also helped keep
inflation down. Millions of salaried Americans _ software
designers, lawyers, factory managers _ are clocking 50- , 60- and
70-hour work weeks even though on paper they officially work just
40 hours. These workers often do not put in for overtime pay, and
the result is that they are making a quiet, below-the-radar
contribution to the economy. If a Web site designer puts in a
70-hour week, but is officially working only 40 hours, that helps
raise the important gauge of productivity per hour. This,
economists say, has contributed to the recent rise in the nation's
productivity rate, up 2 percent last year from a sluggish 1 percent
per year over the previous two decades. This boost, also fueled by
heavy corporate investment in computers, has enabled American
industry to keep profits high without having to resort to raising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But talk to a few workers who just punched out after a 12-hour
day, and they'll tell you that 60-hour weeks have their downside as
well. Auto workers, telephone workers and others are howling about
too much overtime, with many workers being forced to put in 15 or
20 extra hours a week. In recent months, many labor negotiations
have grown heated over union demands to eliminate mandatory
overtime _ something many corporations are loath to do when the 4.2
percent jobless rate makes it hard to find new workers.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that recent surveys show many Americans
complaining that they do not have enough time to spend with their
families. Schor expressed surprise that in a recent poll more than
20 percent of Americans said they would happily accept lower
incomes in exchange for working fewer hours. Even as many
stressed-out workers are deliberately reducing their hours, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics has found that 19 percent of Americans
report working more than 49 hours a week, up from 16 percent in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very significant group, roughly a third of the labor force,
is working more hours than they want,'' said Schor. ``They are
feeling high levels of time pressure and stress. They feel their
job interferes with their family life.'' She said stress is being
experienced in particular by baby boom workers.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest reason for workers feeling overextended,
economists say, is that in many families the parents, taken
together, are working longer hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, has
found that together, parents in middle-class families work 3,335
hours per year on average, up from 3,200 a decade ago and just over
3,000 hours two decades ago. That's an increase of eight weeks of
work per year since 1979. The main reason for the surge, economists
say, is not so much that men are working longer hours, but that
women are _ in large part to keep family incomes climbing while
hourly wages, after accounting for inflation, have largely
stagnated for the past 25 years. Millions of women who used to work
part time have moved into full-time jobs.

   The overtime boom has created another source of tensions. Many
corporate executives are unhappy about dishing out millions of
dollars each week in time-and-a-half pay for overtime. As a result

<P>
   Sociologists and economists see several factors behind the
longer work week. The economy is shifting from manufacturing to
services, and service workers do not watch the clock the way that
manufacturing workers do. Many companies, notably software makers,
now emphasize ``project'' work. Corporate culture demands
completing projects by a deadline, often requiring workers to put
in 90-hour weeks to finish, say, the latest CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists question whether Americans are working more
hours per week, saying the statistics rely too much on workers' own
accounts. Many economists also say it has grown harder to measure
how many hours people work because of the explosion of beepers and
cell phones as well as computers and faxes at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, you go to a social gathering and you see a lot of
people wearing beepers, and at a baseball game you see all these
people with their cell phones, in many cases still connected to
work,'' said Alan Krueger, a Princeton University labor economist.
``It's gotten far more difficult to measure where work ends and
leisure begins.''

ON RUSSIAN TV, 2 NEWSMEN DUEL IN POLITICAL POWER PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If television is, as it increasingly seems to be, the
weapon of choice in Russia's intense and ugly political battles,
then Sunday night will offer Russian viewers, on two of the
country's major channels, a journalistic rendition of ``Gunfight at
the OK Corral.''
</P>
<P>
   ORT, Russia's largest TV channel, is controlled by Boris A.
Berezovsky, a financier, media baron and close ally of President
Boris Yeltsin. It will start a weekly news program whose host,
Sergei Dorenko, is an anchorman with the reputation of an attack
dog. He has in the past used his air time to tear political
opponents to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   Dorenko goes head-to-head with Yevgeny Kiselyov, a journalist
with a studied, more ponderous style, who is host of ``Itogi,'' or
``News,'' a long-running weekly program broadcast by NTV. An
independent channel, it is controlled by the media magnate Vladimir
Gusinsky, who in recent months has openly broken ranks with
Yeltsin's dwindling team.
</P>
<P>
   In another nation, competition on a Sunday at 9 p.m. might be
seen as the start of a ratings tussle. In Russia, with legislative
and then presidential elections over the next nine months, the
``mano a mano'' between Dorenko and Kiselyov is the latest skirmish
in a media war that has at least as much to do with power as it
does with viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty fierce because the competition exists on several
levels,'' said Sergei Markov, director of the Institute of
Political Studies. ``It is a competition between two journalists,
between two TV channels, between media magnates, all this against
the background of a battle between the existing party of power and
the future party of power.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 both television channels and their owners were solidly
behind Yeltsin's re-election campaign. In those days, as Dorenko
recalled in an interview, the stations scheduled their news
programs to avoid competition. The result, he noted, was all
Yeltsin, all the time, ``until the viewer was ready to hang
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the competition between Russia's two main media
groups has turned into a blood sport, not unlike the political
battle now shaping up between the Kremlin and its newly emerged
rival, a coalition headed by Yuri M. Luzhkov, Moscow's mayor, and
former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. In both media and politics,
the stakes are very high.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Luzhkov wins, then ORT will exist but without Berezovsky,''
Markov said. ``If the Kremlin is able to undermine the
Primakov-Luzhkov march to power, then NTV will exist, but under
different control.''
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's election year gets off to a running start, efforts
to police _ some say harass _ the media have become more blatant.
Last month officials from the Moscow fire department issued an
order to shut down the offices of Kommersant, a daily paper
recently bought by Berezovsky, in a move that the paper's new
editor said was driven by Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the Press Ministry pulled the plug on a TV station in
St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, after it failed to
respond to a warning about a program that savagely mocked a rally
organized by liberal politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is a powerful weapon,'' Kiselyov said in an
interview last week. ``And it can produce unexpected results.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kiselyov was talking about the ``Itogi'' program broadcast in
May, when he shocked the Russian political elite with a full-scale
assault on the Yeltsin administration.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking an unspoken taboo in the liberal media, he described it
as the Family, until then an insiders' code word. It refers to a
small group that includes most notably Yeltsin's daughter and
political adviser, Tatyana Dyachenko, Berezovsky and Berezovsky's
business associate, Roman Abramovich, who is described as the
Family's cashier.
</P>
<P>
   On that program Kiselyov described how the Family, in a
bald-faced power play, had handpicked appointees to Russia's latest
Cabinet. ``It was so open, so cynical, so outrageous that it was a
slap in the face of public opinion,'' Kiselyov said. ``It was like
Caligula when he went to the Roman Senate and presented a horse as
his successor.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after this, the war between NTV, controlled by
Gusinsky, and ORT, backed by Berezovsky and the Kremlin, moved out
into the open. All of a sudden, a government-controlled bank
recalled a $60 million outstanding loan to Media Most, the
Gusinsky-controlled media group. In newspaper interviews, a top
Yeltsin aide vowed to teach Gusinsky a lesson; Kiselyov, at a
conference, urged the aide, Alexander Voloshin, to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the heat has since gone out of the Kremlin's attacks on
Media Most, and according to news reports the disputed $60 million
loan was successfully renegotiated. But the television war is still
on.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin s again on the defensive, fending off corruption
charges now under investigation in Switzerland. And it is now that
Berezovsky has chosen to bring out his heavy artillery _ Dorenko, a
39-year-old Zen and motorcycle enthusiast who clearly relishes his
role as the enfant terrible of Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers remember him for his investigation of Anatoly Chubais,
the former privatization chief (and Berezovsky foe), and for his
attempt, on air, to examine the size of the skulls of top Communist
Party leaders, as alleged proof of their supposedly subhuman
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Dorenko has many enemies _ some of them, he
asserts, inside the Kremlin, where he says he is remembered for
repeated references to the president as a baboon. But his loyalty
to Berezovsky is unquestioned. He says that he speaks with
Berezovsky almost daily, and that he has twice been a guest at
Berezovsky's villa in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   Dorenko's stunts and aggressive style have also won him a
popular following, particularly in Russia's distant regions, where
he says some polls have shown that he is more trusted than the
Russian Orthodox Church. However, he admits that in Moscow,
Kiselyov's ratings are higher than his.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is more popular with the elite, I agree,'' Dorenko said.
``The elite thinks Kiselyov is one of them, a member of the
corporation. But the electorate believes me, not him, which is why
the elite fears me.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kiselyov and Dorenko insist that they themselves have no
stake in Russia's political fight, and that their programs will
provide neutral coverage of events in Russia, a full menu including
everything from an open-ended war in the Caucasus to the unfolding
scandals linking the Kremlin and the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   For Russia's political junkies, the question will be which of
the two programs to watch live. ``Mostly I will probably watch
Dorenko,'' Markov said. ``I think I know what Kiselyov will say.
But Dorenko is a killer, and harder to predict.''

   Now that researchers have shown that mice can be made smarter, a
whole world of opportunities opens up. Those long-neglected
inventors of smarter mousetraps will at last get their calls
returned. Smarter cats will be needed. And everyone will have a
list of humans who might benefit, starting perhaps with the
baseball umpires or, in the case of most evolutionists, with the
Kansas Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant as it may be to contemplate a smarter world, there are
serious quandaries in enhancing human abilities, as well as in
trying to raise the intelligence of animals, possibilities raised
last week by Princeton biologist Joe Tsien and his colleagues when
they announced they had developed a genetically smarter strain of
mice.
</P>
<P>
   In mice, monkeys and probably humans, nature has engineered a
deliberate fading of memory with age. The brain cell receptor that
helps associate two events _ the basic mechanism of memory _ is
made of components that change over a life span, making the
receptor less efficient in older animals. It is this process that
was counteracted in Tsien's mice. He genetically engineered the
mice so that their brain cells produced more copies of the youthful
component of the memory receptor, thus enhancing its performance.
</P>
<P>
   The receptor was souped up in brain cells throughout the mice's
forebrain and hippocampus, a brain module that helps mice remember
places (and humans to recall places and faces). The altered mice
did better than normal mice on six standard tests of rodent
intellectual performance, like remembering where to find a hidden
platform when dropped into a bucket of murky water, or recognizing
new objects. Because the improvement was consistent in all the
tests, for which the mice had to use many different areas of the
brain, Tsien concluded that in improving the basic mechanism of
memory he had also enhanced the mice's learning ability and general
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien and other scientists are far from sure that tweaking the
memory receptor would be similarly helpful in the more complicated
human brain. After all, with too retentive a memory you might
clutter up your mind with all kinds of things you'd be better off
forgetting. Still, scientists agree that the receptor is a
promising place for intelligence enhancement to start.
</P>
<P>
   But would the improvement of human acumen dangerously flout
nature's wisdom? After all, intelligence is so precious for
survival that surely nature makes every animal as smart as possible
without transgressing some pivotal balance.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't seem to be the case, however, at least with
laboratory mice. Tsien's strains are smarter than their normal
cousins, without any visible drawback. And behaviorally, modern man
is so new a species _ 50,000 years is the blink of an eye in
evolutionary time _ that perhaps the forces of natural selection
have scarcely had the chance to make the most of the human brain's
capacities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, genetic engineers must surely pause at the fact that
nature has designed memory to become less retentive with age. The
danger of tampering with this system is that the brain's memory
storage room could quickly be overwhelmed if learning were to
continue at the same rate in adult life as in youth, suggests Dr.
Charles Stevens, a neurobiologist at the Salk Institute in La
Jolla, Calif. He believes the brain's capacity, vast as it is, must
have limits. The human brain has 100 billion neurons, and each
neuron makes about 1,000 connections with other neurons, giving a
potential 100 trillion units of memory. ``So there is enormous
storage capacity, but we don't know how much we need,'' Stevens
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the limit of that storage capacity is never reached in a
human lifetime, the increasing access time needed to scan a growing
store of knowledge may be one reason why nature arranges for
information to be acquired more slowly once the youthful thirst for
knowledge has passed. What a powerful threat to deploy against
one's children _ learn it or lose it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risk of running out of space on one's mental hard
drive, the temptation to try to enhance intelligence by promoting
the youthful form of the memory receptor will doubtless prove
irresistible. Drugs might be developed to target the nerve cell
system that Tsien altered by genetic means. Gene therapy could one
day supply smart genes to an embryo _ or even to adults, since the
hippocampus is one of the few areas of the brain that generates new
cells throughout adult life.
</P>
<P>
   Three categories of people might benefit: the medically ill, the
elderly and everybody else. Ethicists see no problem in trying to
treat memory deficits in patients with brain diseases, which would
be no different from any other medical intervention. Helping older
people remember better is also likely to be uncontroversial,
``because in our culture we see old age as something like a disease
rather than as natural life process,'' said Dr. Victoria Sharpe, a
bioethicist at the Hastings Center in Garrison, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A drug to enhance the intelligence of healthy individuals sounds
great for job interviews or quiz programs. But if the smart pill
were costly, it could worsen social inequities. And such a drug
could easily be abused by parents. ``I think we will have to think
through our social policies very carefully so we don't get into an
enhancement race among parents and don't in effect develop a new
kind of child abuse,'' said Dr. Leroy Walters, director of the
Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University.

themselves indefinitely. Since nature lets us die, Tsien believes,
it may also have neglected to make humans as smart as they can be .

   He finds it hard to understand the recent flurry of apprehension
about human cloning, because a clone, being an exact genetic copy,
adds nothing new to the world. But making an individual more
intelligent would be novel and interesting. ``Everyone wants to be

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By many measures, international arms control seems
to be on the verge of unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   A global treaty banning all nuclear testing is bottled up in the
U.S. Senate. Another pact to reduce the atomic arsenals of Russia
and the United States is stalled in the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, Iran and North Korea are racing to build new biological,
chemical, nuclear weapons or long-range missiles, U.S. intelligence
analysts say. Finally worn down by Iraqi noncooperation, the United
Nations has dismantled its efforts even to monitor Iraq's
terror-weapons programs. And India and Pakistan are menacing each
other with nuclear-tipped missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're heading downhill,'' said Michael Krepon, president of
the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, a group that researches
arms control and international security. ``All of the major fault
lines of nuclear danger are growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Why then are many arms control advocates echoing the bullish
declaration of Adm. Stansfield Turner, a past director of Central
Intelligence: ``This is the most opportune moment in the past 40
years for nuclear arms control''?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is simple: Russia, which is still the only country
that can claim parity with America's own nuclear arsenal, has
serious reasons for wanting to cut back its stock of warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's strategic forces are declining fast and Moscow lacks
the money to pay for new systems. It badly wants a new strategic
arms reduction agreement, Start 3, that could take both countries
down to 1,500 long-range nuclear warheads from more than 6,000
currently; from the Russian point of view, that would at least
allow Russia to keep even with the United States despite all its
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of such a deal argue that it would have advantages
for the United States as well: It would shrink the nuclear
stockpile of the country that still harbors the single biggest
threat to U.S. security, and from which U.S. security officials
fear that terrorists may even now be shopping for nuclear material.
</P>
<P>
   And with instability engulfing Russia, including growing public
cynicism toward the government, rising corruption with allegations
of Russian laundering of billions of dollars through the Bank of
New York and the economy shakier than ever, time may be running
short to strike a bold new arms deal before both countries hold
presidential elections next year, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a way to secure extremely deep cuts, and make them
verifiable and irreversible,'' said Krepon. ``In return for doing
Russia that favor, which is a favor to ourselves, we can get a
number of things we want.''
</P>
<P>
   But the administration is proceeding gingerly, still insisting
that Russia's communist-dominated parliament first ratify the Start
2 treaty, which brings both nations' strategic forces to 3,000 to
3,500 warheads, before seriously negotiating any follow-up pact to
further reduce the weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the Cold War is over, the logic of nuclear arms
control has detractors. The Pentagon and many conservatives fear
that dipping much lower than 3,000 warheads would jeopardize the
U.S. nuclear advantage over the rest of the world, and encourage
other countries to seek the status of first-tier atomic powers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Washington's insistence that the Russian parliament
act on Start 2 may have backfired, angering many Russian lawmakers
who complain of U.S. coercion. ``They are trying to portray us as a
country unwilling to divest itself of nuclear arms, a kind of
nuclear monster that does not want to disarm,'' Roman Popkovich,
chairman of the defense committee of Russia's lower house of
parliament, said in August.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another hurdle is the strained relationship between Moscow
and Washington, frayed most recently by the air war in Kosovo.
``Things are at such a low level of credibility with Russia right
now,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``A lot of work has to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the
administration's top Russia expert, plans to fly to Moscow this
week to try to smooth out differences in advance of a more
important meeting in Washington on Sept. 17 with Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Georgi Mamedev.
</P>
<P>
   Against long odds, Talbott is trying to broker a deal to modify
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow the United States
to build a limited national defense against long-range missile
attacks _ in exchange, perhaps, for a Start 3 agreement. Russia has
long opposed such a shield, fearing it could lead to a broader
``Star Wars'' space-based defensive system.
</P>
<P>
   But missile defenses are a top foreign-policy priority of Senate
Republicans like Jesse Helms of North Carolina, whose Foreign
Relations Committee is likely to hold the nuclear-test ban treaty
hostage until President Clinton submits two other treaties that
Helms wants to kill, including amendments to the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's deliberate approach illustrates a shift in
the politics of arms control, which became the lifeblood of U.S.
foreign policy during the last half of the Cold War, arms control
advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a few years ago that Clinton presided over the
extension of a treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and
signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Those accomplishments
capped an astonishing 10-year period for U.S. arms control policy
that included landmark strategic arms reductions treaties
negotiated by President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, arms control advocates say, has lost the momentum
created in during his first term. Gone is the initiative of
president's first four years, they say, replaced by drift and a
reluctance to challenge Senate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very timid approach and time is running out,'' said
Spurgeon Keeny, president of the Arms Control Association, a
research and advocacy group. ``They've had a failed policy in
dealing effectively with the Senate, because of a feeling that a
confrontation on this would hurt the rest of their domestic
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   If the administration is to pull off one more arms control
victory in its waning months, it can expect little or no help from
Senate Republicans, who are moving away from the arms control
legacy of the Bush and Reagan administrations, to push for national
missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to unnecessarily antagonize the Russians, but
they are not the Soviet Union,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., a
member of the Foreign Relations Committee. ``They're not the threat
they once were. The threat is more dispersed now.''

``Things are at such a low level of credibility with Russia right
now,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``A lot of work has to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the
administration's top Russia expert, plans to fly to Moscow this
week to try to smooth out differences in advance of a more
important meeting in Washington on Sept. 17 with Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Georgi Mamedev.
</P>
<P>
   Against long odds, Talbott is trying to broker a deal to modify
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow the United States
to build a limited national defense against long-range missile
attacks _ in exchange, perhaps, for a Start 3 agreement. Russia has
long opposed such a shield, fearing it could lead to a broader
``Star Wars'' space-based defensive system.
</P>
<P>
   But missile defenses are a top foreign-policy priority of Senate
Republicans like Jesse Helms of North Carolina, whose Foreign
Relations Committee is likely to hold the nuclear-test ban treaty
hostage until President Clinton submits two other treaties that
Helms wants to kill, including amendments to the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's deliberate approach illustrates a shift in
the politics of arms control, which became the lifeblood of U.S.
foreign policy during the last half of the Cold War, arms control
advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a few years ago that Clinton presided over the
extension of a treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and
signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Those accomplishments
capped an astonishing 10-year period for U.S. arms control policy
that included landmark strategic arms reductions treaties
negotiated by President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, arms control advocates say, has lost the momentum
created in during his first term. Gone is the initiative of
president's first four years, they say, replaced by drift and a
reluctance to challenge Senate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very timid approach and time is running out,'' said
Spurgeon Keeny, president of the Arms Control Association, a
research and advocacy group. ``They've had a failed policy in
dealing effectively with the Senate, because of a feeling that a
confrontation on this would hurt the rest of their domestic
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   If the administration is to pull off one more arms control
victory in its waning months, it can expect little or no help from
Senate Republicans, who are moving away from the arms control
legacy of the Bush and Reagan administrations, to push for national
missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to unnecessarily antagonize the Russians, but
they are not the Soviet Union,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., a
member of the Foreign Relations Committee. ``They're not the threat
they once were. The threat is more dispersed now.''

VIOLENCE RISES AS EAST TIMOR FACES FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ East Timor entered a dangerous period
Saturday as swaggering thugs intensified their violence and menace
following an early morning announcement that the tiny territory had
voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   With Indonesian policemen standing back, organized
anti-independence militias threatened and shot at U.N. officials
and foreign journalists who were taking refuge in a seafront hotel
in the capital, Dili.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Dili, the United Nations reported stepped-up attacks
that forced the closing of four of its offices and the evacuation
to Dili of 96 foreign U.N. workers, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   One American working as a police adviser for the United Nations
in the small town of Liquica was shot and evacuated by a U.N.
helicopter that itself came under threat from armed men. His
condition was described as not serious.
</P>
<P>
   In the vote, taken on Monday and announced Saturday, residents
rejected an offer of a new autonomous status within Indonesia,
which invaded East Timor in 1975 and has fought a separatist
insurgency ever since, with the loss of some 200,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   With this rejection by 78.5 percent of registered voters, East
Timor will be allowed to go free, President B.J. Habibie has said.
Their vote must be ratified by the Indonesian Parliament in a
session that begins in October.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie said Saturday that Indonesia would honor the vote and
most analysts believe that the lopsided outcome would be very
difficult for Parliament to overturn. But it is this period of
limbo, between the vote and its ratification, that many analysts
say poses the greatest danger of disruption.
</P>
<P>
   The violence brought condemnation from around the world Saturday
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned of an
international backlash if Indonesia continues to break its promises
to provide security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia has continuing obligations and must live up to
them,'' she said in a statement issued in Damascus. ``To do
otherwise risks disaster and will have lasting effects on
Indonesia's status in the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of violence and intimidation, nearly 99 percent
of East Timor's 450,000 registered voters cast their ballots on
Monday in what U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called an act of
courage.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, East Timor becomes a strange and dangerous
no-man's-land, still technically a part of Indonesia but
potentially without effective administration or security during its
period of danger.
</P>
<P>
   This has given rise to intensified calls for the United Nations
to send armed peacekeepers to the former Portuguese colony of
800,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian police have been responsible for security during
the referendum but _ as happened Saturday _ they have stood aside
as the military-backed thugs stage their attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Television cameramen taking refuge in the seaside Mahkota Hotel
on Saturday filmed armed thugs approaching the foyer as a dozen
police officers stood back. The thugs smashed a glass door with a
sword and fired shots toward the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the streets of Dili were nearly deserted as open
garbage trucks drove along the seafront carrying armed men waving
guns and machetes.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, residents said that gunshots could be heard in
the empty streets and that there were no policemen to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-independence leaders have said they would not accept
the vote, asserting that the United Nations was biased against
them. But an independent three-member commission set up to oversee
the referendum certified its conduct Saturday as acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most anti-independence leaders have boycotted the
formation of a 25-member reconciliation commission that is part of
the agreed plan for a transition of power.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of reconciliation seemed to be a difficult one for
Eurico Guterres, one of the most flamboyant and feared of the
militia leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are winners and losers now,'' he said. ``But how can we
reconCile the two sides? It is very difficult. Even the U.N. will
not be able to settle this. I am a citizen of Indonesia and it is
impossible for me to betray my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Guterres, whose armed men have been preventing some East
Timorese from boarding planes to leave the territory, spoke at the
airport as he prepared to depart for the island of Bali. ``I need
to take care of my family,'' he explained to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Among those appealing for armed help from the United Nations was
Jose Alexandre Gusmao, the man most likely to become the leader of
a new East Timor, who has been in prison since 1992. The government
said Saturday that it intended to release him within about a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We foresee chaos,'' Gusmao said. ``We foresee a new genocide
in East Timor. We foresee total destruction in a desperate and last
attempt by the Indonesian generals, and politicians maybe as well,
to deny the people of East Timor their freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the result Saturday morning, Annan said that
contingency plans were in place but that there was no immediate
plan to seek approval from the Security Council for a deployment of
a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Indonesian government completes its formalities and
East Timor becomes free, he said, armed peacekeepers would be part
of a promised U.N. administering authority. That authority would
attempt to provide a buffer of time for East Timor as it seeks to
set up a new government.
</P>
<P>
   During its years of occupation, Indonesia provided the
territory's administration, schools, utilities and police force.
East Timor has few people with the education or training to perform
these tasks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Annan also warned of the instability in the months to come.
``After 24 years of conflict, East Timor now stands on the
threshold of what we all hope will be a process of the orderly and
peaceful transition of power,'' he said. ``The coming days will
require patience and calm from the people of East Timor.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the surge in violence was simply an
angry backlash by military-backed militias that have tried to
derail the vote or whether it was intended somehow to block
implementation of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Some militia leaders have spoken of trying to create their own
Indonesian enclave in the western part of the territory. Neither
the United Nations nor Indonesia has taken that idea seriously,
although the Indonesian military, which has been virtually
autonomous in its years of occupation, might support it.
</P>
<P>
   With representatives of some 70 nations participating in the
U.N. vote process, condemnation of the violence was widespread and
harsh.
</P>
<P>
   European Union foreign ministers, meeting in Finland, issued a
statement saying they were ``deeply concerned about the
deteriorating security situation in East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's representative for East Timor, Foreign Minister
David Andrews of Ireland, used even stronger language that
reflected growing international frustration over Indonesia's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am appalled by the failure of the Indonesian authorities,
despite repeated representations to them, to fulfill their
obligation to provide adequate security,'' he said. ``The people of
East Timor are now entering a period of great uncertainty and great
danger. It would be tragic if they were left unprotected against
murderous thugs now out of control in many areas.''

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ ``One country. One people. One language.''
</P>
<P>
   As a national credo, displayed on banners and placards, it
sounds simple enough.
</P>
<P>
   But in this scattered archipelago of 13,000 islands, roiling
with an untamed mix of cultures, ethnic groups, histories,
rivalries, gods and spoken tongues, it begins to seem almost
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   These days, some people say it is.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation with well
over 200 million people, is deep in a crisis of economics, politics
and national identity. Its leaders and institutions have lost much
of their popular standing and legitimacy. The forces that most
overtly held Indonesia together _ the grip of a dictator and the
harshness of his military _ have retreated since the forced
resignation 15 months ago of Suharto as president.
</P>
<P>
   A country so unsure of its unity that it has made oneness an
obsession is being forced to rediscover the logic of its
nationhood. The challenge as it steps gingerly into an era of
democracy is to want to be a nation.
</P>
<P>
   The violence that ravaged the former Portuguese colony of East
Timor last week as it was voting for independence from Indonesia
came as a reminder to the outside world of the diversity and
tenuousness of this scattered nation. Perhaps the fears it has
aroused _ of centrifugal forces that could pull Indonesia apart _
are exaggerated. Still, it points up the counterproductiveness of
enforced union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to have an Indonesia in which the constituent
parts sit happily together as a republic and not because they are
held together by bayonets, you are going to have to have a system
where the constituent parts come together because they want to be
together,'' said James Dunn, a former Australian diplomat who is an
expert on Indonesia. ``Since the founding of Indonesia, the
military has seen itself as the guardian of national integrity. In
a democracy national integrity has to be held together by the
national will.''
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of this, the post-Suharto government _ which is
still taking shape _ is exploring ways to devolve some economic and
political control to the provinces. An extreme possibility, one
that would demand a constitutional amendment, would be to shift
power into a federal structure.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian rule has sometimes been likened to a colonial
structure, with the dominant Javanese on their relatively small
island asserting their rule over the larger and more resource-rich
outer islands. A fairer distribution of the national wealth along
with greater political empowerment could go a long way toward
mollifying Indonesia's restive provinces.
</P>
<P>
   But the loosening of a grip always carries the risk of loss of
control. After 32 years of Suharto's policy of enforced national
harmony, the vacuum created by his departure and the humbling of
the military has been quickly filled by all the repressed passions
of political, religious and ethnic differences that strain
Indonesia's fabric.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, separatist movements have been energized in
several areas, highlighted by East Timor, which Indonesia invaded
in 1975 but which never accepted integration as the country's 27th
province.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta _ and particularly in
the military _ fear that freedom for East Timor could be the start
of a process of national disintegration. Other analysts point to
that territory's unique place as a national afterthought and argue
that a line can be drawn between East Timor and the rest of
Indonesia. It is the only part of the country to have been
colonized by the Portuguese rather than by the Dutch and it is the
only part to have been been dragged into union by invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The most potentially destabilizing separatist movement is in the
strongly Islamic, natural gas-rich province of Aceh, where the loss
of life this year has been far greater than in East Timor. A former
Islamic kingdom with its own proud past, Aceh is an integral part
of Indonesia's history and self-definition and its loss could deal
a severe blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very worried,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ``If
Aceh begins to take off, they will really have problems with the
integrity of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   A smaller, less unified separatist movement has flared in the
remote mountains of Irian Jaya, whose primitive people are as
strange and exotic to residents of modern Jakarta as they are to
New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Vicious bloodletting has also continued in the Moluccas (the
former Spice Islands that first attracted traders to the
archipelago) and in West Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. But
these eruptions, for the moment at least, have more to do with
local feuds, and with Jakarta's inability to impose order, than
with serious separatist threats.
</P>
<P>
   Though they may not pull the nation apart, the declarations of
individuality by the separatists offer a reminder that Indonesia is
an artificial geographical conglomeration inherited from its Dutch
colonizers.
</P>
<P>
   The elegant, taciturn princes of Java seem to have little in
common with the otherworldly dancers of Hindu Bali, the long-eared
Dayak tribesmen of Borneo, the seagoing pirates of the Spice
Islands or the Chinese traders who control the country's ports and
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   What brings them all together as Indonesians?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is an idea, as in other big, diverse countries like
India and the United States,'' said James Clad, a professor of
Southeast Asian studies at Georgetown University. ``It is an idea
of an archipelagic country, a concept that goes back to pre-Islamic
times.''

   The idea of Indonesia as a union of islands took firm root
during the struggle for independence _ which was proclaimed in 1945
_ and flourished under the founding president, Sukarno. His
successor, Suharto, also made national unity the core of his tenure
with a philosophy called Pancasila, in which Indonesia's Babel of
differences were crushed whenever they asserted themselves too
strongly.
</P>
<P>
   This fear of the power of diversity may have been one of
Suharto's most destructive legacies. Its melange of identities
denied, its passions forcefully repressed, Indonesia seethed. The
hard work of celebrating the country's differences while finding a
common ground in which all could thrive together was made all the
more difficult for Suharto's successors.
</P>
<P>
   The last and most unwilling participant in this nationwide
humiliation was East Timor, where Javanese teachers were imported
to teach Indonesian history to schoolchildren in the Indonesian
language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Indonesian unity is so elemental that it is defined
as much as anything simply by the superimposition of a common
tongue, the Malay language of the ancient seagoing traders who
first brought Indonesia's islands together.
</P>
<P>
   But among older or more assertively separatist East Timorese,
the Portuguese language has persisted.
</P>
<P>
   In the small East Timorese town of Baucau, Indonesia's
government has built a monument, literally, on the three pillars of
the revolutionary 1928 student oath, a sort of Pledge of Allegiance
for Indonesians: ``One country. One people. One language.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it a misguided supporter of unity with Indonesia or a sly
opponent who painted on its base the graffito ``Unidades''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unity,'' indeed _ but in Portuguese, the language of East
Timorese separatism.

humiliation was East Timor, where Javanese teachers were imported
to teach Indonesian history to schoolchildren in the Indonesian
language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Indonesian unity is so elemental that it is defined
as much as anything simply by the superimposition of a common
tongue, the Malay language of the ancient seagoing traders who
first brought Indonesia's islands together.
</P>
<P>
   But among older or more assertively separatist East Timorese,
the Portuguese language has persisted.
</P>
<P>
   In the small East Timorese town of Baucau, Indonesia's
government has built a monument, literally, on the three pillars of
the revolutionary 1928 student oath, a sort of Pledge of Allegiance
for Indonesians: ``One country. One people. One language.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it a misguided supporter of unity with Indonesia or a sly
opponent who painted on its base the graffito ``Unidades''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unity,'' indeed _ but in Portuguese, the language of East
Timorese separatism.

MOVING ON TO SYRIA, ALBRIGHT WIDENS HER EFFORT FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ In an effort to move another part of the
Middle East peace puzzle into place, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright arrived here Saturday for the first visit by a senior
Clinton administration official in two years.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Israel and the Palestinians _ prodded by Albright _
reached a crucial agreement, the secretary met with the President
Hafez al-Assad of Syria, who has expressed interest in resuming
talks with Israel that broke off more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How to restart the negotiations has been a source of bickering
between the Israelis and the Syrians and was at the top of
Albright's agenda with the Syrian leader. She hoped to be a
catalyst in unlocking the stalemate, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, has made a point of
reaching out to Syria as part of his ambitious goal to complete a
comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East. But he has been
frustrated in recent weeks by specific Syrian demands based on
Syria's interpretation of the last round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before sitting down with Assad at his palace here, Albright said
at a news conference that she had brought ``some assessments'' made
by the United States on the particulars of the Israel-Syria
negotiations before they stopped in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that Washington was the depository of record for
the past talks, which involved Warren M. Christopher, the former
secretary of state, and that finding a formula for restarting the
negotiations on the basis of that record was the key to unlocking
the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the Syrian leader has insisted on what Damascus has
called an agreement by Yitzhak Rabin, made when he was Israeli
prime minister, to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which
Israel captured during the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has specifically said that he will agree to restart
negotiations only if the Israelis take as a baseline the return of
the Golan Heights to the boundary of June 4, 1967, meaning that
Syria's border with Israel would go to the shore of the Sea of
Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has also said that Rabin promised this in the last round
of negotiations if security measures for Israel, including the end
of hostilities in Southern Lebanon, were met. But the Israelis have
said that Rabin never made such a definitive pledge and that as a
new boundary, they want a border agreed to internationally in 1923,
which does not reach to the Galilee shore.
</P>
<P>
   By demanding that Barak accept the 1967 line as a starting point
for the talks, Assad is leaving the Israeli prime minister with
little leverage, Israeli officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Saturday that the United States was willing to
help Israel and Syria again. President Clinton and Assad exchanged
letters in July on the prospect of resumed talks between the
Israelis and the Syrians, and they have spoken once on the
telephone since Barak's visit to Washington in July, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Albright stressed that the announcement of an
agreement on Friday night between the Israelis and the Palestinians
should spur on the Syrians. ``We have a window of opportunity, and
the light that came from yesterday's agreement should illuminate
the whole region,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, repeated Saturday
after a joint news conference with Albright that Syria would like
to ``resume the talks at the point where they left off,''
indicating that the June 1967 line remains the Syrian starting
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all hope that will bring some good news from Israel,'' the
foreign minister added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Complicating the picture for the United States, according to
U.S. officials, was the effort over the last several years by
Ronald S. Lauder, a former U.S. ambassador to Austria, to negotiate
with the Syrians on behalf of the previous Israeli prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu. Clinton administration officials said that they
had not been briefed on what Lauder had done but were concerned
about the message that his talks had left with the Syrian leader.
Lauder has not commented on his talks with Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Itamar Rabinovitch, who conducted the Israeli side of the talks
with the Syrians from 1993 to 1996, said that Albright's trip was
vital for Barak's goal of completing a peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The new Israeli prime minister has said he wants to pursue two
tracks of the peace process _ with the Palestinians and the Syrians
_ at the same time, an ambitious plan that has not been
successfully pursued by former Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak needs to know whether the Syrian track is feasible,''
Rabinovitch said. ``Her trip could be an opportunity to see if it
is feasible.'' Rabinovitch said that Assad's ``cordial music''
toward Barak immediately after Israeli elections had been replaced
by ``critical tones, but not inimical tones.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rabinovitch said that Assad's failing health and his
desire to have a peace deal with Israel in hand before his son,
Bashar, succeeds him was a driving force for the Syrian leader.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Syria, Albright made a quick and unscheduled stop
in Beirut, the first secretary of state to fly in to the Lebanese
capital on an official plane since George Schultz in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Her visit was intended to demonstrate two important points,
administration officials said: that the Lebanese government was
making strides in normalizing life in the country and that the time
was right to widen the Middle East peace process to include
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met with the Lebanese prime minister, Selim Hoss, and
expressed the desire of the United States to see talks resumed
between Israel and Lebanon, her aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government is crucial to a successful negotiating
track between the Syrians and the Israelis because terrorist
groups, chiefly Hezbollah, operate in Southern Lebanon under the
control of the Syrians and with Lebanese acquiescence.
</P>
<P>
   One of Syria's conditions for negotiating with Israel is that a
negotiating track also begin with the Lebanese, an administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   While security conditions have improved substantially at the
Beirut airport, they have not improved sufficiently for U.S.
commercial aircraft to land there. A U.S. travel ban on American
citizens' visiting Beirut was lifted two years ago.

   When Snoopy isn't out stalking the Red Baron, he can usually be
found atop his doghouse tapping out a novel that invariably begins,
``It was a dark and stormy night.'' What most people don't realize
is that those words are actually the first sentence of the 1830
novel ``Paul Clifford'' by the eminent Victorian Sir Edward
Bulwer-Lytton. Since 1982, Sir Edward has achieved eponymous infamy
as the patron saint of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, an annual
competition held by the English department of San Jose State
University. The challenge is simple: ``to compose the opening
sentence to the worst of all possible novels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulwer-Lytton contest, open to anyone, now attracts
thousands of entries from around the world, competing not only for
the top prize _ $250, a ``pittance,'' the sponsors acknowledge _
but for dubious honors in such genres as romance and fantasy. Here
is a selection from this year's winners and also-rans, announced
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   _ By THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Overall
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the gathering gloom of a late-October afternoon, along
the greasy, cracked paving-stones slick from the sputum of the sky,
Stanley Ruddlethorp wearily trudged up the hill from the cemetery
where his wife, sister, brother, and three children were all
buried, and forced open the door of his decaying house, blissfully
unaware of the catastrophe that was soon to devastate his life.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dr. David Chuter, Kingston, Surrey, England
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Romance
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil made their skin glisten as their bodies moved in slow
synchronous rhythm on the beach, the water gently flowing up around
their legs, birds floating in the surf accompanying their moans
with songs of pain and despair, otter and seal carcasses washing
ashore around them, and it frightened her and exhilarated her at
the same time that their love under the open sky might be
discovered by a Sierra Club cleanup volunteer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Chappell, Blanchardville, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Science Fiction
</P>
<P>
   ``The remaining astronauts strung out on the long tether could
only wonder at a universe full of eerie contrasts _ brilliant stars
against the velvety blackness of space, the hot flare of their
comrade's meteoric plunge into the atmosphere against the cool-blue
ocean below, the man's frenzied screams on the radio as he was
roasted by the heat of re-entry against the icy calm voice of
mission control as they grilled the astronaut on the far end of the
tether, and how hilarious it had all seemed when he first yelled
``Crack the whip!'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Roger Strong, Winnipeg, Manitoba
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Purple Prose
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain _ violent torrents of it, rain like fetid water from a
God-sized pot of pasta strained through a sky-wide colander, rain
as Noah knew it, flaying the shuddering trees, whipping the
whitecapped waters, violating the sodden firmament, purging purity
and filth alike from the land, rain without mercy, without
surcease, incontinent rain, turning to intermittent showers
overnight with partial clearing Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   _ David Hirsch, Seattle
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Adventure
</P>
<P>
   ``The woods held danger at every dark, haunting corner, and
Indiana Jones decided it was too risky to continue; he had already
been attacked by a mound of fire ants, had a brush with poison ivy,
and faced a terrifying encounter with the Forest Ranger's vicious
beagle, Muffin.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Christine Sullivan, Melbourne, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Vile Puns
</P>
<P>
   ``Forced by rising costs and lagging demand to make their
leading product out of a cheaper metal, Hoosier Love, Inc. found
that a special treatment process was needed to clean and coat their
Indy 500 memento, a tiny fake-jewel-studded replica of an
Offenhauser engine on a jeweler's chain, to protect it from the
corrosive effect of chlorine, a process that appeared in the ISO
9000 Manufacturer's Manual under the title, ``The Dechloration of
Indy Pendants.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Rohde, Minneapolis
</P>
<P>
   Winner: `Dark and Stormy' Division
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Independent Counsel emerged each night from the
adjourned closed-door proceedings, reporters assessed how zealously
he was currently prosecuting from his facial expression, which on
one night might be that familiar affably light smile, while on
another night it could be a menacingly dark scowl; and so, as our
story begins, they surmised he was playing hardball, for it was a
dark-Ken Starr-mien night.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ronald Snow, Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The Also-Rans
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up in the overall category:
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the regal bearing of a TV weatherman, his hair
twinkling like the crystals in Ivana Trump's chandelier, his teeth
white and snappy like high-starch boxers, his jaw strong and sharp
as a Canadian high-pressure system, and an El Nino just itching to
wreak havoc in her trailer park.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Elayne Roman, West Caldwell, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dishonorable mention'' (third place) in the romance category:
</P>
<P>
   ``Maggie had become so very attached to Butch these last few
years, not so much like a remora on the side of a shark, nor even
handcuffs in the night, but almost, but not quite, like an
inoperable, yet benign, tumor, crenulating and bifurcating in the
love-struck center of his brain.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Vance Atkins, Seattle
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up in the ``dark and stormy night'' category:
</P>
<P>
   ```Just look, ya bloomin' idiot,'' Eleanor
Rugglesby-Bobsyeruncle, the world-famous cockney art collector,
screamed at her assistant, Ivan Ivanovich, illegitimate son of the
Secret Czar, Ivanovichi, ``ya packed me priceless Don Quixote
paintin' in with a sack of bloody Spam, it was the darn cans tore
me knight!'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Allan D. Burrows, Mississauga, Ontario
</P>
<P>
   A miscellaneous dishonorable mention:
</P>
<P>
   ``Night was a mere threat on the quivering lip of the sky and
the golden tongue of the sun still licked the recesses of the
bridle path, when suddenly, an unnatural shriek emanated from the
dark throat of the forest, causing stiff fingers of fear to march
firmly down the spine of the motionless maiden.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Annette O'Neill, Pacifica, Calif. &QR;
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the first line from a putative novel, ``A Tale of
Two Statisticians'':
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the best of times; it wasn't the worst of times; it
was the times you'd get if you arranged all possible times
(including even fictional times in which the nights were usually
dark and stormy) in order from worst to best on the real number
line from 0.0 inclusive to 1.0 exclusive and then used a really
good uniform random number generator to pick a value in that range
thus choosing the corresponding times _ that's the times it was.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dale Dellutri, Libertyville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Postscript: A ``lyttony'' with more tortured constructs is
available at the Bulwer-Lytton Web site, www.bulwer-lytton.com.
Penguin has also published five collections of dross from the
competition, including ``Bride of It Was a Dark and Stormy Night.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been two years since the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales, gave a last, emotional boost to an international
treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines, then being feverishly
negotiated in Oslo. Many say her efforts to draw attention to the
fiendish effects of mines before her death may be one of her
greatest legacies.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of legacy is it?
</P>
<P>
   Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use,
production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be
as popular as ever in fighting wars these days.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav troops planted thousands of them during 18 months of
civil war in Kosovo. So did the ethnic Albanian rebels they were
fighting. Russia has acknowledged using them in recent weeks
against Islamic insurgents in the southern province of Dagestan
(and apologized to neighboring Georgia for accidentally dropping
some of them from aircraft into Georgian territory).
</P>
<P>
   Their use has been reported in the recent flareups between India
and Pakistan and between Eritrea and Ethiopia, as well as in civil
wars in Turkey, Colombia, Congo, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to
Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that
governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines
in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it
officially went into force. Among those were three that signed the
treaty banning them: Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Angola, the country
Diana made the focus of her own anti-mine crusade.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, despite the campaign's publicity, several major
countries still refuse to adopt the treaty, including the United
States, Russia and China, mostof the nations in the Middle East and
many in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little disheartening,'' said Marissa Vitagliano, the
coordinator of the U.S. Campaign to Ban Land Mines.
</P>
<P>
   She and other supporters of a ban say it is far too soon to
write off the treaty as a failure. On the contrary, they point to
progress that has been made, especially in reducing the worldwide
production of mines and their availability in the international
arms market, according to arms control monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Fowler, the deputy chief of the U.N.'s Mine Action Service
in New York, noted that the countries that have signed on to a ban
have destroyed 14 million mines that had been stockpiled when the
treaty was written two years ago. Even countries that have so far
refused to sign the treaty _ including the United States and Russia
_ have pledged to stop exporting mines and to stop making certain
kinds altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the treaty's greatest impact has been on public
perception. Reports of mines now evoke images of legless veterans,
of maimed children, of Diana in protective gear walking near a
minefield in Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many mines were used in the Persian Gulf war, but no one
thought about it,'' Ms. Fowler said. ``Everybody is aware that
mines were used in Kosovo. The treaty is setting a new
international standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as events have shown, a standard is one thing, the
eradication of mines another.
</P>
<P>
   Mines are cheap and durable and deadly. In Yugoslavia, which has
not signed the treaty, Serbian troops heavily mined the routes
along the mountainous borders with Albania and Macedonia that the
Kosovo Liberation Army used to get in and out of the province; that
forced the guerrillas into areas that exposed them to Yugoslav
fire. Serbian police also used mines to booby-trap ransacked
Albanian homes to keeP refugees from returning home. (Many returned
anyway, and died as a result.)
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for discouragement is the weakness of the treaty
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty _ the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,
Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on
Their Destruction _ went into effect March 1, 1999, six months
after the 40th nation ratified it, but it has little force.
</P>
<P>
   There is no governing organization to oversee it and no
mechanism to punish those who violate it. It essentially relies on
member states to monitor themselves and honestly report on what
stockpiles they have and the efforts they are making to destroy
them.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hope that global peer pressure will gradually force
nations to comply. ``You don't expect everybody to stop using mines
overnight,'' said Caleb Rossiter, an analyst now conducting a study
on mine strategy in Korea for the Vietnam Veterans of America.
``Treaties like this take a long time to sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   There is universal agreement among the treaty's supporters that
the biggest obstacle to that is the fact that the United States
won't sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite once advocating a ban, President Clinton bowed to
pressure from Pentagon commanders opposed to the treaty's
restrictions. They insist they need the most common type of land
mines _ those left buried in the ground _ to protect South Korea
from North Korea. They also want to keep using ``smart''
anti-personnel mines, sophisticated devices that self-destruct
after a time, to shield larger anti-tank mines, which are not
prohibited by the treaty since the weight of a human is not enough
to trigger them.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has pledged to sign the treaty in the future
_ but only after the Pentagon develops alternatives to mines, a
process critics say has moved slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody questions the fact that we would be much
further along if the United States was not only a participant in
the treaty, but an active one,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
one of the most ardent advocates of a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Without U.S. support, Leahy added, ``a lot of countries will
say, `Why should we sign when the United States, the most powerful
country on earth, says it's not strong enough to give up land
mines?'''

DIANA'S DUBIOUS LEGACY: LAND MINE BAN HAS TROUBLE GETTING OFF THE

   WASHINGTON _ It has been two years since the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales, gave a last, emotional boost to an international
treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines, then being feverishly
negotiated in Oslo. Many say her efforts to draw attention to the
fiendish effects of mines before her death may be one of her
greatest legacies.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of legacy is it?
</P>
<P>
   Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use,

   And the Hippo Begat the Whale
</P>
<P>
   How did nature ever get the idea of making a whale? Biologists
have found the answer by analyzing the DNA of whales and their
nearest terrestrial relatives, the artiodactyls, or even-toed
ungulates.
</P>
<P>
   Once there was an ancestral artiodactyl, this Just So story
goes, but its descendants did not get along with the bad-tempered
camel, which split off from the rest to become a separate species.
</P>
<P>
   The pig and peccary family was the next to depart, according to
the evidence of their genes, followed by giraffes and the deer
family.
</P>
<P>
   That left the hippo, a creature so aquatic that it gives birth
underwater. Sooner or later some hippos ventured down their river
estuary to the open sea, shed their hind limbs and shaped their
forelimbs into flippers.
</P>
<P>
   That, my children, is how nature fashioned the whale, and if you
don't believe it, you may consult the learned article by Dr.
Norihiko Okada and colleagues in this month's Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.

   Cars for the Credit-Challenged
</P>
<P>
   Detroit car dealer Mel Farr doesn't mind leasing used cars to
people with bad credit, as long as they don't mind driving around
with a gizmo on the dashboard that keeps their cars from starting
if they miss a payment.
</P>
<P>
   Those who lease from Farr must pay up weekly in order to get a
code to punch into the device on the dashboard. Anyone who is late
paying can still drive around, but once they turn the car off,
they'll find it won't start again.
</P>
<P>
   With lobbying help from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and financial
help from Wall Street, Farr, a former Detroit Lions football
player, said he was helping those who otherwise couldn't afford a
car. Critics, including Ralph Nader, worry that the devices could
prove unsafe, and said the interest rates of up to 25 percent take
advantage of the desperate. Farr counters that the high prices
reflect his risk.

   Israelis and Palestinians Agree to Agree
</P>
<P>
   After shuttling between both sides, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright announced that Israel and the Palestinians had concluded
an agreement to implement the land-for-peace accord they reached
nearly a year ago at the Wye River resort in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which provides for more Israeli redeployments
from the West Bank, set a deadline of early next year for the
parties to create a framework for final negotiations and of next
September for a final settlement. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has expressed hope that negotiations will also resume with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Among the final sticking points was the question of how many
Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails. Also,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had wanted the right to declare a
Palestinian state, but the Israelis were opposed to any
``unilateral action.''
</P>
<P>
   Deaths on a Roller Coaster
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey state investigators removed four cars from a roller
coaster in Ocean City to determine why a woman and her daughter
died on the ride. The woman, Kimberly Baily, 39, of Pomona, N.Y.,
and her daughter Jessica, 8, were at Gillian's Wonderland Pier when
the car they were riding slipped backward down a steep incline,
made a 90-degree turn and ejected them. There have been six deaths
on rides at American amusement parks so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   A Beef Over Burger King
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to relish the idea of the humble Whopper
innocently entangled in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no laughing matter to the parties involved, and
least of all to Burger King International, which somehow did not
realize that, through an Israeli franchise holder, it had opened a
restaurant in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King officials said the Israeli franchise holder misled
them into thinking the settlement, Maale Adumim, was located in
Israel, and company officials apparently never consulted a map.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Arab-American protests, the company ordered the
Burger King name removed. The franchise holder refused. And now the
Burger King of Maale Adumim has become another contested fact on
the ground in the disputed territories.

   A Teachers' Strike in Detroit
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in Detroit's public schools went on strike, refusing to
work without a contract. That left 178,000 students on an extended
summer vacation, and many of their parents scrambling to find child
care.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement may prove slow in coming. Rank-and-file teachers
took a harder line than their Detroit Federation of Teachers,
rejecting the union leadership's recommendation to go back to work
with a 10-day bargaining extension.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are concerned that a new school board is not taking
their views into account as it struggles to improve student
performance in a district where half the students don't graduate
from high school.
</P>
<P>
   They also object to being paid less than their suburban
counterparts. So far, many parents in this union town are

drop since 1996 in applications to the 125 schools accredited by

candidates. The 41,004 applicants last year vied for 16,000 spots.

   The substantial decline in AIDS deaths that began after newer
combinations of drugs were introduced nearly four years ago has
slowed _ to 20 percent from 1997 to 1998 compared to 42 percent
from 1996 to 1997, federal health officials reported. The newer
therapies are benefiting many people infected with the AIDS virus,
but have led many others to think that drugs alone will wipe out
AIDS, experts said. They urged renewed efforts at prevention to
overcome the complacency.

   Chardonnay's Shameful Past
</P>
<P>
   The long arm of DNA that reached back into Thomas Jefferson's
family history has drawn attention to another scandalous liaison,
but this time in the family history of the chardonnay, one of the
world's best-known grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Using a DNA fingerprinting technique, geneticists at the
University of California, Davis, have shown that chardonnay is not
a kind of pinot, as believed by some experts, but rather is a cross
between pinot and gouais blanc.
</P>
<P>
   The pairing is surprising because pinot is a highly regarded
grape but gouais, common in the Middle Ages, became so despised
that it is no longer cultivated in France. The geneticists
discovered that 15 other French wines are also the progeny of the
pinot-gouais liaison, including gamay, the grape from which
beaujolais is made, and melon, the source of muscadet.

   Bush Outlines Plan To Fine Failing School
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush has worked hard in his presidential
campaign to sound conservative but pragmatic, a line he tried to
toe again in his first major address on education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush excoriated most federal education programs as ineffective,
but he also called for a big expansion of the Education Department.
He said schools should be controlled by local boards, but insisted
on federally mandated testing of children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused to use the word ``voucher,'' but said federal money
should be taken from public schools where children perform poorly
and given to parents to use at private or other schools. ``Public
funds must be spent on things that work,'' he said.

   Big Drop in AIDS Deaths Begins to Slow
</P>
<P>
   The substantial decline in AIDS deaths that began after newer
combinations of drugs were introduced nearly four years ago has
slowed _ to 20 percent from 1997 to 1998 compared to 42 percent
from 1996 to 1997, federal health officials reported. The newer
therapies are benefiting many people infected with the AIDS virus,
but have led many others to think that drugs alone will wipe out
AIDS, experts said. They urged renewed efforts at prevention to
overcome the complacency.

   Retiring the Beanie Babies
</P>
<P>
   In what toy industry experts say may be a publicity stunt, Ty
Inc., the maker of Beanie Babies, announced on its World Wide Web
site that ``all Beanies will be retired'' as of Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   No one really believes that Beanies Babies will go the way of
the pet rock.
</P>
<P>
   The company may have made the announcement to drum up sales for
a product that has lost some of its appeal as youngsters have moved
on to other toys, such as Pokemon. The announcement created a
frenzy on Web site chat rooms and left customers confused. The
company, which has been known to ignore customers and retailers (Ty

of their popular standing and even their legitimacy. The forces
that most overtly held Indonesia together _ the unquestioned grip

   LANDMINES-REVIEW (Washington) _ It has been two years since the
death of Princess Diana gave a last, emotional boost to an
international treaty to ban anti-personnel landmines, then being
feverishly negotiated in Oslo. Some say her efforts to draw
attention to mines may be one of her greatest legacies. But what

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just about anyone who has flown in the coach section of a
commercial airplane in recent years comes away convinced that space
is getting more cramped. No one appears to doubt that airlines have
installed narrower seats and added more rows so they can wring a
few more dollars of profit out of each flight.
</P>
<P>
   But while the experience of flying, especially in economy class,
may indeed be worse than ever, the industry insists it is not
because the plane is smaller. The fact is, airplane interiors have
actually gotten slightly larger in recent years, seats in coach in
most cases are a little wider, and there may even be more leg room
than there was 10 or 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Impossible? Yet true, say the airlines, seat makers and airplane
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, what constitutes a bad flight is of intense
interest to airlines and airplane makers. Boeing Co., which
produces most of the world's passengers jets, has done extensive
research, interviewing 10,000 people about what they hate most
about flying. What Boeing found is that passengers tend to blame
leg room and seat width when they are really angry about other
things.
</P>
<P>
   According to Boeing's research, two factors above all others
determine whether a flight is enjoyable, especially when traveling
relatively short distances: One is whether the plane arrives on
time, and the other is whether or not there is a person in the
adjacent seat. If your flight is late and there's somebody in the
seat next to you impinging on your sense of personal space, you're
more likely to also complain about other things, real or imagined.
(On long-range flights, more than 5,000 miles, comfort becomes a
much greater priority.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When a short-range flight is late, people said the coffee was
cold, the meal was cold, the seats were lumpy,'' said Klaus Brauer,
the Boeing executive leading the research about passenger comfort.
``Every phenomenon you can think of gets influenced by the halo
effect of the reliability of the flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may help explain why there have been so many complaints of
late about the airlines. This year through August, delays were up
nearly 20 percent compared with the same period in 1998, according
to the Federal Aviation Administration. During the summer, when
thunderstorms and the introduction of new radar screens at some
air-traffic control centers caused further slowdowns, they rose 36
percent compared with last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives have been complaining that the long-outmoded
and mismanaged air traffic control system is seizing up under the
strain of greater traffic. Improvements are still years away.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, thanks to a strong economy and powerful
computers that allow airlines to precisely gauge ticket demand,
more seats than ever are being filled on any given flight. In 1988,
the average jet took off with 62.5 percent of its seats occupied.
By the end of last year, the average had jumped to 71 percent,
according to the Air Transport Association in Washington. In
practice, that means most flights during peak hours are more than
90 percent full.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the traffic on the way to the airport, the long walk
to the gate, the fight to board the plane, the dearth of palatable
food during the flight, and you get some pretty unhappy
associations with flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplane used to be phe respite from a lot of these
things,'' said David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers
Association, an advocacy group. ``There were plenty of flights
where you could find extra room to spread out. Now, that extra room
isn't there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, improvements in technology have increased the range
of smaller planes. The Boeing 737 used to be able to fly only as
far as Denver from New York. But the newly redesigned models can
now make it from New York to Seattle, a six-hour trip during which
comfort, rather than on-time performance, becomes a greater
priority as the minutes tick by.
</P>
<P>
   But the dimensions of the seats themselves have not shrunk. The
width of a coach seat on Boeing's single-aisle 737 and 757, which
have the same fuselage, was about 17 inches until about 10 years
ago, when it was expanded to 17.2 inches, Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie of Europe, now Boeing's only rival, likes to
brag that the fuselage of its single-aisle A-320 jets is 7 inches
wider than the 737. But most airlines still use seats of the same
dimensions, using the extra space for a wider aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Because comfort is more important on long flights, economy seats
on wide-body airplanes are slightly larger: 18 inches on a 767 and
18.5 inches on a 777. And of course, the more you pay for a seat
the more space you get. Business-class seats are now usually 20 or
21 inches wide; first-class seats in large planes are 22 or 23
inches across.
</P>
<P>
   And while it is true that in the last 15 years many airlines
have reduced the so-called seat pitch, or the distance between your
seat and the seat in front of you, the actual amount of leg room
has not diminished, said Brauer, the creature comfort expert at
Boeing. He said the older seat backs were about 4.5 half inches
thicker than today's, so even though seat pitch has declined by
about 3 inches, there's a little more leg room.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it is true that the airplanes have not shrunk, are
not passengers getting larger? Most studies do show that Americans
in all age categories have gotten heavier. But Brauer said the
scientific literature suggests that people have not grown as much
as the media suggest. In any case, he added, the expansion in the
width of seats on narrow-body planes by 0.2 of an inch and by 1.5
inches on the newest wide-bodies ``is far in excess of the
percentage growth of the species over the period.''
</P>
<P>
   Brauer also said people tend to judge the size of an interior
space at eye level. As a result, about 12 years ago, Boeing widened
the 737 cabin by 1 inch on each side. On its newer planes it molds
ceiling panels and positions lights to make it appear that the
cabin is larger than it really is.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are also doing their part to try to make their
airplanes more comfortable. Together the nation's two largest
carriers _ United Airlines and American Airlines _ plan to spend
$900 million to outfit their fleets with new interiors over the
next few years. Many of the new coach seats will be equipped with
the amenities now found in business class, like foot rests,
adjustable lumbar supports and adjustable head rests.
</P>
<P>
   But they won't be any wider. Brauer, who likes to carry around a
tape measure, pointed out that even though most office chairs and
train and theater seats are no wider than 17 inches, they do not
seem to inspire the same amount of collective resentment as
airplane seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seattle Opera House has 17.2-inch seats,'' he said, ``and
we sit there for years and years.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just about anyone who has flown in the coach section of a
commercial airplane in recent years comes away convinced that space
is getting more cramped. No one appears to doubt that airlines have
installed narrower seats and added more rows so they can wring a
few more dollars of profit out of each flight.
</P>
<P>
   But while the experience of flying, especially in economy class,
may indeed be worse than ever, the industry insists it is not
because the plane is smaller. The fact is, airplane interiors have
actually gotten slightly larger in recent years, seats in coach in
most cases are a little wider, and there may even be more leg room
than there was 10 or 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Impossible? Yet true, say the airlines, seat makers and airplane
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, what constitutes a bad flight is of intense
interest to airlines and airplane makers. Boeing Co., which
produces most of the world's passengers jets, has done extensive
research, interviewing 10,000 people about what they hate most
about flying. What Boeing found is that passengers tend to blame
leg room and seat width when they are really angry about other
things.
</P>
<P>
   According to Boeing's research, two factors above all others
determine whether a flight is enjoyable, especially when traveling
relatively short distances: One is whether the plane arrives on
time, and the other is whether or not there is a person in the
adjacent seat. If your flight is late and there's somebody in the
seat next to you impinging on your sense of personal space, you're
more likely to also complain about other things, real or imagined.
(On long-range flights, more than 5,000 miles, comfort becomes a
much greater priority.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When a short-range flight is late, people said the coffee was
cold, the meal was cold, the seats were lumpy,'' said Klaus Brauer,
the Boeing executive leading the research about passenger comfort.
``Every phenomenon you can think of gets influenced by the halo
effect of the reliability of the flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may help explain why there have been so many complaints of
late about the airlines. This year through August, delays were up
nearly 20 percent compared with the same period in 1998, according
to the Federal Aviation Administration. During the summer, when
thunderstorms and the introduction of new radar screens at some
air-traffic control centers caused further slowdowns, they rose 36
percent compared with last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives have been complaining that the long-outmoded
and mismanaged air traffic control system is seizing up under the
strain of greater traffic. Improvements are still years away.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, thanks to a strong economy and powerful
computers that allow airlines to precisely gauge ticket demand,
more seats than ever are being filled on any given flight. In 1988,
the average jet took off with 62.5 percent of its seats occupied.
By the end of last year, the average had jumped to 71 percent,
according to the Air Transport Association in Washington. In
practice, that means most flights during peak hours are more than
90 percent full.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the traffic on the way to the airport, the long walk
to the gate, the fight to board the plane, the dearth of palatable
food during the flight, and you get some pretty unhappy
associations with flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplane used to be phe respite from a lot of these
things,'' said David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers
Association, an advocacy group. ``There were plenty of flights
where you could find extra room to spread out. Now, that extra room
isn't there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, improvements in technology have increased the range
of smaller planes. The Boeing 737 used to be able to fly only as
far as Denver from New York. But the newly redesigned models can
now make it from New York to Seattle, a six-hour trip during which
comfort, rather than on-time performance, becomes a greater
priority as the minutes tick by.
</P>
<P>
   But the dimensions of the seats themselves have not shrunk. The
width of a coach seat on Boeing's single-aisle 737 and 757, which
have the same fuselage, was about 17 inches until about 10 years
ago, when it was expanded to 17.2 inches, Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie of Europe, now Boeing's only rival, likes to
brag that the fuselage of its single-aisle A-320 jets is 7 inches
wider than the 737. But most airlines still use seats of the same
dimensions, using the extra space for a wider aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Because comfort is more important on long flights, economy seats
on wide-body airplanes are slightly larger: 18 inches on a 767 and
18.5 inches on a 777. And of course, the more you pay for a seat
the more space you get. Business-class seats are now usually 20 or
21 inches wide; first-class seats in large planes are 22 or 23
inches across.
</P>
<P>
   And while it is true that in the last 15 years many airlines
have reduced the so-called seat pitch, or the distance between your
seat and the seat in front of you, the actual amount of leg room
has not diminished, said Brauer, the creature comfort expert at
Boeing. He said the older seat backs were about 4.5 half inches
thicker than today's, so even though seat pitch has declined by
about 3 inches, there's a little more leg room.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it is true that the airplanes have not shrunk, are
not passengers getting larger? Most studies do show that Americans
in all age categories have gotten heavier. But Brauer said the
scientific literature suggests that people have not grown as much
as the media suggest. In any case, he added, the expansion in the
width of seats on narrow-body planes by 0.2 of an inch and by 1.5
inches on the newest wide-bodies ``is far in excess of the
percentage growth of the species over the period.''
</P>
<P>
   Brauer also said people tend to judge the size of an interior
space at eye level. As a result, about 12 years ago, Boeing widened
the 737 cabin by 1 inch on each side. On its newer planes it molds
ceiling panels and positions lights to make it appear that the

<TEXT>
<P>
   If all goes as agreed, the Rev. Mel White, an outspoken
supporter of gay rights, will take 200 people to Lynchburg, Va.,
next month, to meet with the Rev. Jerry Falwell, an outspoken
critic of homosexual activity, and 200 people he has invited, to
talk about the issue dividing them.
</P>
<P>
   Such an encounter will certainly be unusual, perhaps even a
first in the long, contentious debate over gay rights. ``I believe
we're going,'' White said, ``and we're going in love and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the gathering, he said in a telephone interview, is
to try to take the harshness out of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for Falwell, said the conservative
Baptist minister was ``committed'' to the gathering, having agreed
to it in August when he met with White at the latter's request. The
event is set for Oct. 23, at Liberty University, where Falwell is
chancellor, and ``could be anything from a forum to a meal of some
kind,'' DeMoss said.
</P>
<P>
   DeMoss added, however, that Falwell would not compromise on his
conviction that the Bible condemns homosexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the themes is going to be, while we're going to
disagree about homosexuality and what the Bible says about
homosexuality, violence going in either direction is wrong and we
ought to condemn it,'' DeMoss said.
</P>
<P>
   That this event is even planned owes something to White's
unusual resume, which includes a professional acquaintance with
Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, White, as a seminary professor, television and
film producer and book author, worked closely with leading
religious conservatives, ghost-writing several books, including
Falwell's autobiography, ``Strength for the Journey'' (Simon and
Schuster, 1987).
</P>
<P>
   But six years ago, White, who had been married, announced that
he was gay, and that he had come to terms with it after years of
inner struggle, including efforts to change through counseling,
prayer and electric shock. He described the process in his
autobiography, ``Stranger at the Gate: To Be Gay and Christian in
America'' (Simon and Schuster, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   More recently he has been a chairman of Soulforce Inc., an
ecumenical group that tries to apply Gandhi's and the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s principles of nonviolence to advance gay
rights. ``We believe that the gay community hasn't discovered
nonviolence in its powerful, historic sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White and Falwell met on Aug. 17, two months after White began
writing open letters to Falwell, posted on Soulforce's Internet
site, www.Soulforce.org, complaining about language in fund-raising
letters by Falwell's organizations. White cited several lines,
among them one from a 1996 fund-raising letter that said
homosexuals ``want total political approval and taxpayer money for
their perverted political and social programs.''
</P>
<P>
   In his open letters, White said he would take gay-rights
supporters to Lynchburg on the weekend of Oct. 23-24, to talk to
local residents and attend Falwell's Thomas Road Baptist Church.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the August meeting, according to DeMoss, who was present,
Falwell told White that he ``was willing to take a more careful
look'' at what went out under his name, but ``without compromising
what he believes biblically.''
</P>
<P>
   Falwell also told White that he had received threats from some
gay-rights supporters in the past, causing Falwell concern for his
safety, DeMoss said. At that point, he added, both men agreed that
any kind of violence on this issue was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Since agreeing to the gathering, Falwell has come under
criticism, particularly from fellow religious conservatives. ``He's
taking heat from both sides,'' DeMoss said.
</P>
<P>
   White said he already had a list of 200 people to take to
Lynchburg: gay men, lesbians, and their friends and relatives. He
said he is distributing a written pledge to participants, in the
style of similar pledges used during the civil-rights movement,
asking those going with him to promise to refrain from violent
thoughts, words and actions.
</P>
<P>
   Churches in Lynchburg have called to offer hospitality, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a historic event if it comes off, even if Jerry
lectures us,'' White said. ``If Jerry invites us to dinner just to
preach to us, he's invited us to dinner. And he and his 200 people
will see we do not have horns.''

   There's more than one approach to Washington. There is the high
road. There is the low road. And there is what's stuck in the road.
Washington's hot asphalt streets happen to be just the right stuff
for turning the gleaming treasures that drop on them into instant
fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, it isn't exactly the Great Rift Valley. The treasures
mashed into the streets tend to be the homely remnants of advanced
capitalist society: watch-strap buckles, combs and runaway baby
socks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when it comes to modern fossilization, the conditions
don't get much better than this. The asphalt in Washington is hot
and impressionable. The traffic is relentless. And the roads are
seldom repaved, which means an urban fossil has a good chance of
lasting a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Crowley, a staff photographer for The New York Times who
has made a hobby of documenting the city's flattened refuse, says
he regularly passes fossils he photographed years ago, including a
coffee stirrer from McDonald's pressed into I Street and an old
spoon planted on 16th Street that still clearly says ``Stainless
Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the laws of fossilization is that the things that get
mired in the streets tend to be common objects. In other words, the
plastic comb and the family of pull-tabs from a six-pack represent
thousands more like them.
</P>
<P>
   So surely there must be signs of government crushed somewhere in
the streets. Alas, a tiny charm of the Capitol is the sole
governmental fossil, unless you count that plastic stirrer from
McDonald's, which could have been dropped by the president.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: overinterpretation is a hazard of archaeology. If
you think that little piece of plastic left after a car accident
looks like the Washington Monument, or you're imagining that the
hood ornament resembles something in the Air and Space Museum,
maybe you've been in Washington a little too long.

 By SARA RIMER

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The 92-year-old woman was sitting in her wheelchair,
talking with her psychiatrist at the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center
for Aged, when the phone she carries in a black canvas bag rang.
She unzipped the bag and greeted her niece on the line: ``Hello,
Myrna. I'm in a meeting now. Can I call you back?''
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatrist, Dr. Eran Metzger, smiled. A year ago, the
woman was so depressed that she had not only lost interest in
talking to anyone, she had stopped eating. But not long after he
started her on an anti-depressant, her mood began to improve. The
ringing telephone, he said, was as good an indication as any that
she was again engaged in life.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, a 92-year-old former business executive, had suffered
a series of griefs that might seem to define old age: the deaths of
her husband and her five sisters; the loss of her vision and her
ability to walk; then, crushingly, the death of her only child, a
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I didn't want to live,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But this woman was one of the luckier older Americans who suffer
from what doctors call major depression, a condition in which the
brain chemistry is altered: Her home for the aged had a geriatric
specialist on staff, Metzger, who could recognize her symptoms and
not confuse them with old age itself. Most nursing homes and
residences for the aged do not.
</P>
<P>
   Just as medicine is more able than ever to treat depression,
experts worry that the nation's health care system is not prepared
to deal with a surge in cases as baby boomers approach old age _
eventually doubling the population 65 and older _ and encounter the
chronic diseases and losses that can make a person vulnerable to
depression.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the growing treatment of depression among the old also
raises questions about the quality of the last stage of life and
its emotional complexities _ the mingling of grief at the loss of a
spouse, for example, with the anticipation of seeing a grandchild _
that younger people, who mostly fear old age and disability, find
difficult to understand.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors say there is no question that depression can be
safely treated, they also debate where sadness ends and depression
begins _ and what realistic expectations for the final years are.
</P>
<P>
   Poets and philosophers have always spoken of the despair _ ``the
tragic sense of life,'' the Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno
called it _ that the very old experience as they confront the
dwindling of their days. Some experts on aging worry that modern
medicine may end up trivializing that despair, trying to medicate
away the deep sadness that comes with losses.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some despair is inevitable as you recognize that time is
short, that you don't have the opportunity to work out a different
life,'' said Rose Dobrof, 74, the Brookdale Center on Aging's
professor of gerontology at Hunter College.
</P>
<P>
   ``What too often happens is that because the family doctor
doesn't have time to talk, he prescribes medication,'' Ms. Dobrof
said. ``It's the easiest thing to do. What people need are human
connections.'' People, she said, need to talk, to doctors, clergy
and social workers, and to family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ms. Dobrof said, medication _ particularly
newer anti-depressants like Zoloft, Paxil and Prozac that have
fewer side effects than older ones _ is needed to ease depression
in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Medication undoubtedly played a major role in the recovery of
the 92-year-old woman (many old people talk freely, even eagerly,
about their ailments, but depression is not considered a subject
for open discussion; the woman, like other patients interviewed for
this article, did not want to be named). She had attended weekly
group therapy sessions, Metzger said, but until she began taking
anti-depressants she could only sit by helplessly and cry. Now she
joins in.
</P>
<P>
   But Metzger said her recovery was also helped by a psychiatric
nurse, Phyllis Cronin, who recognized the woman's isolation and
made an effort to form a close relationship with her.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of treatment, Metzger said, was not to erase her
sadness, nor to transform her into a different person. ``We're not
trying to make everyone conform to our stereotypes of aging,'' he
said. Most of the cases he treats, he said, are people with major
depression, a condition that can inhibit recovery from disease and
strokes and increase pain.
</P>
<P>
   Though the woman no longer talks of wanting to die, Metzger
said, she still cries over her son, and she still gets angry about
living in an institution. He is mindful of how she put it the other
day: ``The doctor and the medicine help you, but the pain in your
heart will live forever.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of this century, to the extent that doctors thought
about depression and the elderly at all, it was to say that
depression among the elderly was understandable, even to be
expected. But geriatric psychiatrists and other experts see no
reason that the old and infirm should not find some fulfillment in
life.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, ``Another Country _ Navigating the Emotional
Terrain of Our Elders'' (Riverhead, 1999), Mary Pipher explored the
psychological growth that many old people experience as they
decline. ``There is an amazing calculus,'' she wrote. ``Anyone who
isn't an idiot becomes a philosopher.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   It is important, experts say, that younger people not impose
their fears and stereotypes about old age on the old.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people find new relationships and new interests,'' said
Dr. Ira Katz, director of geriatric psychiatry at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine. ``I truly believe that even in a
nursing home, even in someone with heart failure, even with
disabling arthritis, with Parkinsonism, with any number of
disabling conditions, it really is possible to have pleasure in
life and to have a meaningful life if only one isn't depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Katz and other geriatric psychiatrists report that
increasing numbers of people are recovering from depression with
the help of new medications, experts say the great majority of
depressed older Americans are not getting adequate treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The health care system, they say, has not trained physicians to
look for depression in older people; managed care gives doctors
little time to explore what can be a difficult diagnosis (geriatric
psychiatrists often talk with a patient for an hour before
prescribing anything), and the newer anti-depressant medications
are expensive and require follow-up.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``More than one in six older patients who go to a primary-care
doctor's office have a clinically significant degree of
depression,'' Katz said. ``But only one in six of those get
adequate treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the National Institute of Mental Health,
depression among the elderly drives up health care costs, because
depression aggravates other conditions and depressed people visit
doctors more often. And, the institute said, there is the human
cost of going without treatment:
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our senior citizens will live their final years in
despair and suffering without any appreciation of their affliction
or the understanding and comfort of those most dear to them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the institute, major depression is found among 3
percent of the population over 65 living in their own homes, but it
is estimated that 5 percent to 10 percent of those who visit
primary care doctors have major depression. In nursing homes, an
even-larger proportion of the residents have major depression.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts fear that rates will skyrocket as baby boomers
encounter major medical conditions. As a generation, they already
have higher rates of depression than those ahead of them. In
response, several national projects to improve treatment are under
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even have to invent anything new,'' said Dr. Jurgen
Unutzer, a geriatric psychiatrist at the University of California,
Los Angeles, who is coordinating a project, financed by the John A.
Hartford Foundation in New York, to help doctors treat the elderly
who suffer from depression. ``We just have to use what we already
know.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not age itself that can make a person vulnerable to
depression, but age-related diseases and disabilities that can
alter brain chemistry, along with blows like the loss of a spouse.
The point of treatment, experts say, is to make it possible to move
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want people to be numb to their sadness _ that's not
what depression treatment is about,'' Katz said. ``It's about
helping people enjoy what is there to be enjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   One barrier to treatment is the persistent myth that depression
in old age is natural. But experts say another is a health care
system in which doctors rush through, on average, 15-minute visits
with elderly patients who may be suffering from a number of chronic
health problems, many of which have symptoms that mimic depression.
</P>
<P>
   Then, even when a doctor is alert for depression and diagnoses
it, medication dosages must be closely monitored and must be
continued for at least eight or nine months to be effective. In
most cases, neither happens, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most managed-care systems restrict access to mental
health care and do not provide geriatric mental health specialists.
About 15 percent of older people with Medicare are enrolled in
managed-care plans, and about 80 percent of all mental health care
in managed care is provided by three or four extremely large
for-profit organizations, according to Dr. Gary Gottlieb, a
professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and chairman of
psychiatry and mental health for the Partners Health Care System, a
health care provider group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb, who led a panel that analyzed data from a study of
mental health care for older people provided by managed care, said,
``In evaluating the manuals, credentialing materials and
requirements of those organizations, virtually none of them have
mention of requiring special expertise in handling older adults.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There have been few studies on treatment of depression among the
elderly, but there is evidence that the use of anti-depressants
among older people has increased considerably in the last 10 years
or so. One study of people living in their own homes in North
Carolina, conducted by Dr. Dan Blazer, a professor of psychiatry at
Duke University, showed that the use had nearly doubled, to 8
percent, between 1986 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But still many more people who might benefit from it are not
getting treatment, and the barriers include the high cost of
psychotherapy, and of the newer anti-depressants, which can easily
cost $60 to $100 a month _ on top of the other medications many
older people take regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare offers no outpatient medication benefit, though
President Clinton has proposed creating one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are older people who go to the pharmacy,''
Unutzer said, ``and the pharmacist says `That will be $80 for the
first month,' and they say, `I'm sorry, I don't need it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The rate of major depression among the elderly in the community
is slightly lower than among younger people, and geriatric
psychiatrists say they are struck by the resiliency and stoicism of
their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Blazer began seeing a 78-year-old man who had
been depressed for four or five years. ``He lost his wife about
eight years ago, and he thought all his problems were related to
the fact that he couldn't adapt to his wife being dead,'' Blazer
said. ``I told him I thought he was depressed, this wasn't just
grief.''
</P>
<P>
   The man's primary care physician had apparently made the
judgment that it was ``just grief,'' Blazer said. Blazer prescribed
Paxil and a brief course of psychotherapy. The depression has
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `Doctor, I can't remember when I felt this
good,''' Blazer said. While his intense grief has abated, his wife
is hardly forgotten. ``He said, `When I think of my wife, I still
have pain.'''

PRIEST REBUKED BY VATICAN RESUMES PUBLIC SPEAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Roman Catholic priest, ordered by the Vatican to end his
ministry to gay and lesbian Catholics, has resumed public speaking,
saying he could do so, within limits, and still respect the
church's directive.
</P>
<P>
   The priest, the Rev. Robert Nugent of Maryland, had worked for
nearly three decades with Sister Jeannine Gramick, also of
Maryland, in reaching out to gay Catholics. But the church's
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith told them on July 13
that they were permanently prohibited from further pastoral work
with gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation, in charge of safeguarding doctrine, said
Nugent and Sister Gramick had not sufficiently emphasized church
teaching that homosexual acts are ``intrinsically disordered'' and
evil.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before he was to participate in a public forum
on homosexuals and religion at Northeastern University in Boston
last week, Nugent said he and leaders of his religious order
concluded that the Vatican directive did not bar him from public
speaking, such as giving lectures in an academic setting, even if
he could no longer hold workshops, retreats and discussions for gay
Catholics or their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned,'' Nugent said, ``I'm not prohibited
from speaking, as long as it's not associated with a pastoral
setting'' and is open to a general audience.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent added that he had not been silenced, a punishment the
Vatican has applied against certain theologians that it considered
to have strayed from church doctrine. He can continue to write, he
said, although the directive states that he must seek approval from
his religious superiors before publication.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent described his participation in the Boston event as his
first speaking engagement since receiving the Vatican directive. He
said he had thought and prayed about it before accepting the
invitation, because of the attention it might focus on him, not
because he thought it would violate the directive.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the effects of these things is self-censorship,''
Nugent said. ``Canon lawyers tell me these things must be
interpreted very narrowly.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I don't want to spend the rest of my life watching
everything I say and every step I take.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks in Boston, at a forum sponsored by the National
Conference for Community and Justice, an interfaith organization,
Nugent described the history of his and Sister Gramick's work, the
investigation by Catholic authorities and the Vatican's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gramick has not spoken publicly about her response to the
directive. She said she had sent her thoughts about it to officials
of her order, the Baltimore Province of the School Sisters of Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now they're reflecting on my reflections,'' she said.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ All over Pristina, there is building and
the noise of electric drills and cement mixers from every
direction. Pedestrians walk an obstacle course over and around
piles of sand, boards and scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   No one is rebuilding the handful of burned and bombed buildings
that stand as silent witnesses to the Serbian purges of the city's
Albanian stores and homes a few months ago, and to NATO's bombs.
Instead, people are repairing and extending the houses and shops
that survived more or less intact. The main aim seems to be to redo
a house and rent it to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of foreigners here, not just the
peacekeeping troops but armies of aid workers, advisers and
diplomats. The journalists are gradually disappearing _ CNN has
packed up and left _ but the long-term development people are only
just arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Already the international organizations are changing the look
and the feel of the city, most evidently in a suburb called
Dragodan, on a hill overlooking downtown Pristina. Dragodan's
spacious houses are favored by the international agencies and
diplomats. Going further than the rest, U.S. government officials
are taking over the entire top street.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the U.S. Agency for International Development and
the U.S. mission here have leased 11 houses and plan to seal off
both ends of the street to create a secure compound with guards at
either end. To achieve this, the Americans have pushed several aid
agencies from their offices, including Mercy Corps International
and Save the Children.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kenney, spokesman for the U.S. mission, admitted that the
aid agencies had not had much choice. ``We asked people politely to
move,'' he said with a slightly embarrassed smile. ``It was all
done in diplomatic language. It's like when the president comes, he
takes over the whole hotel and the management has to ask the guests
to leave. There's sometimes one guest who refuses to leave, and
then he has a barricade built round his room and he cannot leave or
enter his room.''
</P>
<P>
   The local director for Save the Children, Steven Rifkin, bowed
to the inevitable and says he will now simply have a longer walk to
work. ``We are all here for the same thing,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 200 private organizations in Kosovo, as well as
the big U.N. agencies, all employing dozens of foreigners and local
residents. The U.S. mission will eventually be the equivalent of a
medium-size embassy, employing some 50 Americans and about 150
local workers. The U.N. mission already employs nearly 150 people
and will grow over the months. The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe is up to 250 now and will reach 500. The
international police force will number 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The foreigners' presence is being felt most immediately on the
streets, because many of them drive big four-wheel-drive vans,
outdone in size only by the NATO force's armored vehicles. The U.N.
police are the only foreigners who seem to travel on foot.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Albanians do not seem to mind the foreign presence.
For Pristina residents, the much more startling change is the
influx from the villages. This city originally had 200,000 people
but may now hold almost double that, local journalists say.
</P>
<P>
   They came when NATO troops arrived in June, and the Serbian
community left en masse, following their own army and police forces
to Serbia. Albanians, back from the refugee camps and down from the
mountains where they hid from the Serbian forces during NATO's
bombing campaign, flooded into the city to take the houses and
apartments abandoned by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a swift smash and grab. ``The law of the strong arm,''
one man said, as he barricaded himself and his family into the
house he had taken. By now, virtually every apartment is full to
the brim. In one apartment block by the main police station, only
two occupants are the original owners. Albanian names are scrawled
on the doors of what had been an exclusively Serbian building. Some
of the new occupants have rented from the departing Serbs; others
have just moved in.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't touch'' is written in Serbian and in Albanian on various
doors, presumably first directed against Serbian paramilitaries and
then against Albanians. Ardita Uka, 17, says she can tell the
youths from the countryside by their accents and their clothes but
laughs at the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny when I go to my friend's apartment,'' she said.
``It was always very quiet there. It was all Serbs and they had no
children. Now it's really noisy with lots of children and lots of
shoes outside each door,'' she added, referring to the Albanian
custom of removing shoes before entering a house.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like many residents of the other cities altered by the wars of
the past decade _ Sarajevo, Belgrade and Zagreb have all had to
accommodate refugees despised by city natives as country bumpkins _
Avdije Gashi, a Pristina lawyer and mother of three grown sons, is
critical of the new arrivals. ``They are people who do not know the
unwritten norms of city life,'' she said, ``and that's why we come
into confrontation.'' She has found herself shouting at the
newcomers who throw garbage down the stairwell and damage the
building. The elevators still worked when the Serbs left her block,
but now they are broken and vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   The new government is much the same, she said. It is led by
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who are mostly from the
villages, and city people have not found it easy to accept the
leaders, she said. ``They need to grow up politically,'' she said
of the new Albanian officials.

COMMENTARY: THE FUTURE IS MADE IN ... 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Double parentheses should be set as brackets.) 
(lb) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ So I was having lunch the other day with a
group of Taiwanese news editors, and I asked them if I could take
notes on my computer. As I opened up my laptop, I joked that I
hoped they didn't mind that I was using an American Dell Inspiron
and not a Taiwanese-made Acer computer. Without missing a beat, the
Taiwanese editor on my left said, ``Oh, don't worry, your Dell was
made here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The others laughed. I couldn't resist turning my Dell over and
looking at the bottom. It said: ``Made in Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think China would pay a huge price for war with Taiwan
today, you can't imagine the price that Taiwan, and the rest of the
world, would pay.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of those little-known facts that PCs and laptops are
made in a global supply chain, and Taiwan, and Taiwanese-owned
firms in China and Asia, are the key link in that chain. They make
the most important parts that go into Dell, Compaq, Acer,
Hewlett-Packard and IBM PCs, as well as into Cisco systems that
keep the Internet flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Most U.S. computer firms have moved out of manufacturing. While
they assemble computers in the United States from parts made in
Taiwan, they are increasingly focused on software and Internet
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   This has left Taiwanese firms as the world's largest supplier of
13 critical computer components. We're talking about cases,
screens, microprocessors, hubs, modems, LAN cards, keyboards,
monitors, scanners, motherboards, power supplies, CD-ROMs and
graphics cards. Many are sole-sourced in Taiwan. Compaq alone will
reportedly source $7 billion in PC components out of Taiwan this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A war across the Taiwan Straits, coinciding with the Y2K problem
_ when demand for replacement computers will be soaring _ would be
a human and economic disaster. (Although it would make a great
movie plot.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate impact would be a shortage of computer products,
and prices would go up instead of down,'' said Stanley Shih, the
Bill Gates of Taiwan and the chairman of Acer Group. Taiwanese know
that this limits how much they can unilaterally pull away from
China. Electronic Business News quoted a Compaq spokesman in Taipei
as saying, if China really does start to threaten Taiwan, ``We will
consider a plan to shift our orders from Taiwan to Korea or
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the only reason Taiwan has to consider China's
wishes. Taiwan is great at taking other people's innovations,
improving them and then manufacturing them cheaper. The problem is,
cheaper labor markets around Asia are catching up to Taiwan in this
game. Therefore, to keep its standard of living rising, Taiwan has
to move up the computer food chain and start doing its own software
and Internet innovation.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Taiwan can't compete with U.S. firms in this area,
because they have access to a huge, English-speaking market in
North America, full of designers. Designing Internet and software
products for that market has great risks but offers great rewards,
so thousands of U.S. firms are involved. Taiwan needs its own huge
Chinese-speaking market that would offer the same rewards and
talent pool for the next generation of software and Internet
technologies. It needs China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our democratic system gives us the ability to do anything we
want ((by way of innovation)) _ the problem is that our market is
too small,'' says Shih. ``So it doesn't encourage people to take
innovative risks, because the rewards are too small. We have to
find a way to have a big market, so China is our hope. Many
Taiwanese companies have software centers in China. We have
hundreds now, but our plan is to have thousands. Our future
technology development depends on leveraging the human resources in
China. We need China for brains and we need it for the market _ to
be able to justify the risks in developing Internet-enabling
technologies and services.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's role in the world computer market helps to explain both
its self-confidence and its vulnerability. Because it is a
democracy, it can attract the best Taiwanese to come home and give
them a real culture of innovation. But because it is a democracy
next to China, dependent on China and coveted by China, it has to
restrain its independence drive.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has the winds of history at its back. The Chinese
communist regime has the winds of history in its face. If Taiwan
fails to understand that, and rushes toward formal independence,
its future will be ``Made in China.'' But if it can be patient and
play to its strength, China's future will be ``Made in Taiwan.''

VENEZUELANS APPLAUD LEADER'S ASSAULT ON SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ On the television screen in Jorge Navarro
Diaz's small restaurant here, a member of Venezuela's shuttered
Congress was complaining that President Hugo Chavez had breached
the rule of law and was leading the country into a dictatorship.
But Navarro wasn't buying that argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``What those politicians need to do is shut their mouths, get
the hell out of the way and let the constitutional assembly do its
work,'' he snapped. ``For 40 years, all they have done is rip off
this country, and now that we finally have somebody trying to put
things right, they are trying to block what needs to be done just
to save their own skins.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its election on July 25, a constitutional assembly loyal
to Chavez has not only stripped the opposition-controlled Congress
of all its powers, but also taken control of Venezuela's judicial
system. Though those actions have generated much criticism abroad
that democracy is being endangered here, Venezuela's 23 million
people have largely hailed the moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was long overdue,'' said Freddy Velazquez, a regular
customer who was enjoying a lunch of chicken and fried yucca. ``I
hope the assembly gets rid of all the corrupt bureaucrats, too, so
that when the new constitution is finally ready, this country can
start with a clean slate.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the popularity of Chavez, a 45-year-old former
colonel who led a coup attempt in 1992, has risen as a result of
his campaign to eradicate the established order. He was elected
last December with 57 percent of the vote, but the most recent
public opinion survey taken by Datanalisis, a leading polling and
market research company here, gave him a national approval rating
of nearly 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody doubts the legitimacy of Chavez or the constitutional
assembly,'' Luis Vicente Leon, the company's director, said in an
interview. ``He enjoys the highest level of support of any
president at this point in his term, and I have no doubt that if he
called an election today to dissolve the Congress, he would win
that vote hands down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment has been building for at least a decade against
Congress and other state institutions seen as remote and
unresponsive. In 1989 there was a violent popular uprising against
a government economic austerity plan, and Chavez's elderly
predecessor, Rafael Caldera, seized on that discontent to run
against the traditional two-party system he had helped create.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties, Accion Democratica, which has a center-left
Social Democratic ideology, and Copei, a Social Christian group,
had alternated in power since a military dictatorship was
overthrown in 1958. They set up a spoils system that has led, as
most Venezuelans see it, to the squandering of the country's vast
oil wealth and a gradual estrangement from the populace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted many times for Accion Democratica and almost
considered myself to be a member of the party,'' said Felix Emilio
Contreras, 52, a truck driver for a supermarket chain. ``But they
turned out to be a mafia that ruled the country for their own
benefit and cared more about themselves than about us, the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The judicial system has fallen into similar disrepute, and has
little popular support. Cecilia Sosa Gomez, who was chief justice
until her resignation last month, has framed the issue as one of
principle, saying that the assembly's takeover of the courts was
illegal and that her fellow judges were cowards not to stand up
against political pressure and in defense of the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court simply committed suicide to avoid being
assassinated,'' she said after her fellow justices narrowly voted
to approve the constitutional assembly's seizure of judicial
functions. The tribunal, she said, was ``the last control on
constitutionality and legality that existed in Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Venezuelans have a more cynical interpretation of her
actions. They recall the central role she played in recent years in
quashing two highly politicized corruption cases, and wonder about
the reasons for what they regard as a belated display of
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she resigned because there is a lot of dirt on her,
and this judicial investigative commission the assembly has set up
is going to make it all public,'' said Araceli Cruz Vivas, a nurse.
``This way she gets to play the martyr and say they are out to get
her.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's own appeal clearly goes beyond the program of radical
change that he is offering. Compared with predecessors like Caldera
and Carlos Andres Perez, the president he sought to overthrow in
1992, he is more like the average Venezuelan: darker skinned and
plain-spoken in a folksy way.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, I feel that we have a president who says
things that I have always thought but have been unable to put into
words,'' said William Mendoza Davila, a street vendor. ``I trust
him, and I will support him to the hilt, no matter what the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   An important part of what Chavez is articulating is class
hostility and revenge, political analysts said. Despite the fact
that Venezuela has the largest oil reserves outside the Middle
East, nearly 80 percent of the population lives under the poverty
line, defined as an income of $400 a month for a family of five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resentments have accumulated over many decades, and that
deep-seated anger is finally being expressed,'' Michael Shifter,
program director for the Washington-based research group
Inter-American Dialogue, said in an interview here. ``There's a
widespread feeling that `now it's our turn' and that all remnants
of the old regime should be swept away.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon recalls that while polling in a poor neighborhood in
Maracaibo, the heart of Venezuela's oil belt, during last year's
presidential campaign he interviewed a woman who proudly announced
that she was going to vote for Chavez in order to get ``them.'' But
just who were they, Leon inquired. ``All of those who are on top
and are to blame for the fact that I live here,'' he said the woman
replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have given him a blank check,'' Leon said this
week. ``But how long it is good for, that is what we cannot tell.''

 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the eight years he held the post of U.S. surgeon general,
Dr. C. Everett Koop became one of the country's most authoritative
and recognizable public figures on the subject of health.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a decade after leaving office, Koop, now 82, is
facing criticism, from medical ethicists, including two
representatives of the American Medical Association, consumer
advocates and others.
</P>
<P>
   Among the complaints are that his hugely popular health
information Web site, DrKoop.com, has frequently blurred the line
between its objective information and its advertising or
promotional content, and that his ties to business have not been
properly disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent days, for example, the Web site did not give notice
of an arrangement that entitled the company and Koop himself to a
commission on products and services sold because of the Web site.
Koop gave up those commissions on Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites devoted to health and medicine _ some providing
information and advice, others selling medications _ have been
among the hottest Internet properties this year, and DrKoop.com is
one of the most heavily trafficked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the explosion of e-commerce, the distinction
between objective information and advertising has blurred across
much of the Web, as newspapers and newer types of information
providers struggle to capitalize on the information they gather,
and as other businesses try to use the new technology to connect
with new customers. Many sites, for example, receive a commission
for referring their users to online merchants, and what would be
called advertisers in other media are often labeled ``partners.''
</P>
<P>
   But Koop's site and his role in it have come under particular
scrutiny not only because of his stature but because what is
involved is the public's health. Complicating the matter is the
traditionally strict regulation of medical practices and
advertising _ an issue that the profession and the federal
government have yet to fully address in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The critics of the former surgeon general say that he has done
nothing illegal but that he has _ knowingly or not _ engaged in
activities that amount to a conflict of interest, or the appearance
of one. Some say Koop, who became a role model to young physicians
with his campaigns to deter cigarette smoking and to raise AIDS
awareness, has in effect traded on his respected name for financial
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly a very honorable man,'' said Dr. Robert M.
Tenery Jr., a former chairman of the AMA's council on ethics and
judicial affairs, when asked to comment on the criticisms. ``But to
claim that you're the nation's family doctor, well, perhaps he's
not tainted, but the picture is colored somewhat by his relations
to vested interests.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over the last few weeks, Koop said he would be
making changes in his financial arrangements and on the Web site;
some of those changes have already taken effect. In response to his
critics, Koop said that he had done nothing wrong and that he
remained devoted to educating the public about health issues. He
cannot help it, he said, that some people are bothered by the idea
of a former public servant's making money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been bought,'' he said. ``I cannot be bought. I
am an icon, and I have a reputation for honesty and integrity, and
let the chips fall where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web Site: Building on Power Of a Trusted Name
</P>
<P>
   Koop and other investors started the Web site in 1998 and took
it public with an initial offering of stock in June, quickly
joining the ranks of Internet multimillionaires. Koop is chairman
of DrKoop.com and a major shareholder in the company. On paper, the
stock he held at the time of the initial offering is worth more
than $47 million, as of the close of the market Friday. As
chairman, he draws an annual salary of $135,000 plus other payments
like speaking fees.
</P>
<P>
   On its 80,000 electronic pages, DrKoop.com offers information on
medical conditions like heart disease and anorexia, features an Ask
the Expert column and includes advice on topics like purchasing
health insurance and participating in clinical trials of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman, Koop says he takes overall responsibility for
DrKoop.com. But the day-to-day operations are managed by executives
and staff members at the company's headquarters in Austin, Texas.
Koop lives in Hanover, N.H., where he runs the Koop Institute, a
research center connected with Dartmouth Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Koop's name and his ranking in opinion polls as the
nation's most trusted health authority appears to have been very
much on the minds of the former surgeon general and his business
advisers in founding DrKoop.com. In a prospectus filed June 8 with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said its goal
was to ``establish the DrKoop.com brand so that consumers associate
the trustworthiness and credibility of Dr. C. Everett Koop with our
company.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospectus states that the Web site is permitted to use
Koop's ``image, name and likeness in connection with health-related
services and products,'' subject to his prior approval of the
products. In return, Koop was entitled to receive 2 percent of
DrKoop.com revenues ``derived from sales of our current products
and up to 4 percent of our revenues derived from sales of new
products.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospectus says the site deals in a wide variety of such
health products and services, including prescription drugs,
nonprescription drugs, vitamins, nutritional supplements and health
insurance offered by outside parties.
</P>
<P>
   Like other commercial Web sites, DrKoop.com may accept
advertising. But because Koop's name carries so much weight with
the public, his critics argue, he has a special responsibility to
keep the distinction between advertising and education clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on his reputation,'' said Dr. Herbert Rakatansky,
chairman of the AMA's ethics council, ``he should disclose any
financial interest or tie to those providing a medical service or
treatment he or his Web site is recommending or it is a betrayal of
trust. He has to remain independent.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, an official at the Web site said Koop's contract had
been changed to eliminate the provision under which he received a
percentage of sales of health services or products generated by the
site.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Financial Ties: Health Information Or Advertising?
</P>
<P>
   The issue of compensation aside, critics say it has not always
been clear whether information about health products or services on
the DrKoop.com site are company promotions or advertising, or
balanced medical and health information.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, Dr. Joshua Hauser, a medical ethicist at the
University of Chicago, said that when he visited the site two
months ago he discovered a DrKoop.com Community Partners Program.
It contained a list of hospitals and health centers described as
``the most innovative and advanced health care institutions across
the country.'' In fact, the list was an advertisement for 14
hospitals, each of which had paid a fee of about $40,000 to be
included.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by the list, Hauser said he made repeated telephone
calls and sent numerous e-mails to the DrKoop.com headquarters in
Austin, asking whether what he read was advertising or editorial
content. Finally, he said, he received an e-mail from a company
official, who told him that the Community Partners were advertisers
and assured him that this fact would be made clear on the site. But
when he checked later, no such steps had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a site whose slogan was `Your Trusted Health Network,'''
Hauser said, he found ``this blurring of the line between editorial
content and advertising to be a problematic conflict of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Web sites like DrKoop.com have the potential to lead to better
and faster information,'' he said. ``But not if companies can buy
their way onto sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel W. Hackett, chief executive of DrKoop.com, said in an
interview that he did not know why the changes had not been made.
About 10 days ago, after the interview, the site was changed to say
that the hospitals ``represent prominent health care institutions
across the country.'' A newly worded flag inviting visitors to
``Find a health care provider near you'' was labeled as an
advertisement. And a notation was posted on the hospital listings
saying that the institutions had paid a fee to be included.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, critics say, the Web site was slow to disclose
financial ties with Quintiles Transnational Corp., a Durham, N.C.,
company that manages clinical trials of new drugs for
pharmaceutical companies and is using the Web site to recruit
volunteers for the trials.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site originally gave Quintiles space to declare itself
``the world's leading clinical organization,'' but contained no
mention of a financial agreement. But in separate interviews last
Sunday and Monday, officials of DrKoop.com and Quintiles
acknowledged that the Web site was entitled to receive a payment
from Quintiles for each person enrolled in a trial through the
site.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, DrKoop.com added to the Quintiles description a
sentence saying Quintiles ``has entered into a relationship with
DrKoop.com in which DrKoop.com is compensated for successfully
recruiting qualified participants into clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Food and Drug Administration regards postings of
future clinical trials to be advertising, the notices of trials are
not labeled as such on DrKoop.com.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the disclosure about the Quintiles arrangement,
visitors to the Web site are not informed that the inspector
general of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is
conducting an inquiry into whether the newly evolving business of
commercially run clinical trials of drugs properly protect the
interests of patients and other potential test subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said that in his view the Web site already carried a
more than adequate description of risks associated with clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement with Quintiles was one of the issues that has
exposed Koop to criticism from AMA officials. Under the Web site's
original operating plan, Koop would have been entitled to 2 percent
of payments from Quintiles, Hackett said. Under AMA rules,
``payment by or to a physician solely for the referral of a patient
is fee splitting and is unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about a possible ethics violation, Koop said that he
had received not ``one dollar'' from Quintiles because no referrals
had yet resulted from the site, and that Web site visitors were not
his ``patients.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rakatansky said the ethics principle would apply if people
visited the site and signed up because of their trust in Koop, and
his connection with the company running the trials was not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Industry Ties: Drawing Criticism In Political Arena
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Koop's financial arrangements that have come
under fire. He has also drawn criticism for forming a partnership
with the American Council on Science and Health in May.
</P>
<P>
   A press release said the partnership was intended to provide
consumers with ``an unbiased, scientific analysis of the latest
trends in health and medicine, as well as clarifications of health
misinformation found in the mainstream press.'' Information from
the council, which identifies itself as a nonprofit consumer
advocacy organization and receives financing both from industry and
from private foundations, is published on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But other consumer advocates say the council is hardly unbiased.
Rather, they say, the group consistently takes industry's side in
disputes over product safety. The council, said Philip E. Clapp,
president of the National Environmental Trust, ``has never met a
pesticide it didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   An official of the council said those accusations were false,
adding that the group's mission is to offer balanced,
scientifically-based analysis of health news. He said the council
provided the information to the Web site free to help carry out
that mission.
</P>
<P>
   Koop dismissed criticism of the council, saying it ``takes
positions based on science, not political correctness.'' He said it
``often undertakes research on issues that the media have already
decided are resolved,'' adding: ``When they go against the popular
story narrative, the media and activists get upset. Curiously, the
media and activist groups don't bat an eye when a lurid allegation
is made about a product's hazards by an unqualified source.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Koop's activities in the political arena have also come
under scrutiny. In April, the former surgeon general circulated a
letter in Congress on behalf of legislation that could enable the
Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison, N.J., the company that
manufacturers the allergy drug Claritin, to extend its patent on
the medicine by five years, an extension that could generate an
estimated $6 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The following month, Koop also met with members of the House
Commerce Committee to defend the company's position on legislation
involving another drug, used to treat hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   The Star-Ledger of Newark reported in June, however, that Koop
did not disclose that his nonprofit organization, the Koop
Foundation, had earlier in the year received a $1 million grant
from Schering-Plough. A spokesman for the drug company said there
was no connection between the grant and Koop's efforts on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Koop acknowledged that his foundation had received the grant
from Schering-Plough, but he said the company's money did not
influence his public positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never disclosed the grant because I did not think it was an
issue,'' he said. ``I'm not a lobbyist, de facto or otherwise. I
did not receive any payment for my work. Most foundations accept
grants from private sources. There was no quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true,'' he went on, ``there are people in my situation
who could not receive a million-dollar grant and stay objective.
But I do. I was approached by people who asked me if I would
represent the side of tobacco in the tobacco settlement and I
refused. I can tell you it would have been very worth my while.''
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Koop testified at a congressional hearing
about the contention that some latex gloves are causing
life-threatening allergies. He said the claims were highly
exaggerated and called them ``borderline hysteria.'' Koop based his
conclusions, he said, on a study by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Michele Pearson, the chief investigator of the CDC's
latex-allergy inquiry, said that while the agency had collected raw
data from blood samples, Koop's statement went beyond what the
centers' data could show. However, research paid for by the
Allegiance Healthcare Corp., a leading manufacturer of the latex
gloves in question, reached identical conclusions to those cited by
Koop.
</P>
<P>
   Koop said that he was misled about the nature of the latex
gloves study and was not aware of a connection between his comments
and the analysis paid for by Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he did not believe he had been involved in any
conflicts of interest. ``I didn't go into DrKoop.com to make
money,'' he said. ``I did it to change the way that medicine is
practiced, to bring important information to patients faster and
get them more involved in decisions about their health.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop said, too, that as chairman of DrKoop.com he was deeply
committed to making it clear that he was not practicing medicine on
the Web site and to keeping the lines between advertising and
balanced content clear. ``But I guess we have to redouble our
efforts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such statements, though, do not erase the sense many of his
critics have that America's family doctor, as Koop referred to
himself in a 1991 memoir, has put his credibility at risk. Some of
those most critical were once Koop's most ardent admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Koop was much revered by the people he trained,'' said a
Public Health Service doctor who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``He inspired me to became a doctor in the first place.
But many of these people believe now that the way he is acting is a
big departure from what we saw in him as a public health leader _
and he was one of the great ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop, told of the physician's comment, offered a suggestion to
his detractor. ``He or she ought to come and talk to me about it,''
he said.

<P>
   During the eight years he held the post of U.S. surgeon general,
Dr. C. Everett Koop became one of the country's most authoritative
and recognizable public figures on the subject of health.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a decade after leaving office, Koop, now 82, is
facing criticism, from medical ethicists, including two
representatives of the American Medical Association, consumer
advocates and others.
</P>
<P>
   Among the complaints are that his hugely popular health
information Web site, DrKoop.com, has frequently blurred the line
between its objective information and its advertising or
promotional content, and that his ties to business have not been
properly disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent days, for example, the Web site did not give notice
of an arrangement that entitled the company and Koop himself to a
commission on products and services sold because of the Web site.
Koop gave up those commissions on Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   With the explosion of e-commerce, the distinction between
objective information and advertising has blurred across much of
the Web, as newspapers and newer types of information providers
struggle to capitalize on the information they gather, and as other
businesses try to use the new technology to connect with new
customers. Many sites, for example, receive a commission for
referring their users to online merchants, and what would be called
advertisers in other media are often labeled ``partners.''
</P>
<P>
   But Koop's site and his role in it have come under particular
scrutiny not only because of his stature but because what is
involved is the public's health. Complicating the matter is the
traditionally strict regulation of medical practices and
advertising _ an issue that the profession and the federal
government have yet to fully address in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The critics of the former surgeon general say that he has done
nothing illegal but that he has _ knowingly or not _ engaged in
activities that amount to a conflict of interest, or the appearance
of one. Some say Koop, who became a role model to young physicians
with his campaigns to deter cigarette smoking and to raise AIDS
awareness, has in effect traded on his respected name for financial
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly a very honorable man,'' said Dr. Robert M.
Tenery Jr., a former chairman of the AMA's council on ethics and
judicial affairs, when asked to comment on the criticisms. ``But to
claim that you're the nation's family doctor, well, perhaps he's
not tainted, but the picture is colored somewhat by his relations
to vested interests.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over the last few weeks, Koop said he would be
making changes in his financial arrangements and on the Web site;
some of those changes have already taken effect. In response to his
critics, Koop said that he had done nothing wrong and that he
remained devoted to educating the public about health issues. He
cannot help it, he said, that some people are bothered by the idea
of a former public servant's making money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been bought,'' he said. ``I cannot be bought. I
am an icon, and I have a reputation for honesty and integrity, and
let the chips fall where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop and other investors started the Web site in 1998 and took
it public with an initial offering of stock in June, quickly
joining the ranks of Internet multimillionaires. Koop is chairman
of DrKoop.com and a major shareholder in the company. On paper, the
stock he held at the time of the initial offering is worth more
than $47 million, as of the close of the market Friday. As
chairman, he draws an annual salary of $135,000 plus other payments
like speaking fees.
</P>
<P>
   On its 80,000 electronic pages, DrKoop.com offers information on
medical conditions like heart disease and anorexia, features an Ask
the Expert column and includes advice on topics like purchasing
health insurance and participating in clinical trials of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman, Koop says he takes overall responsibility for
DrKoop.com. But the day-to-day operations are managed by executives
and staff members at the company's headquarters in Austin, Texas.
Koop lives in Hanover, N.H., where he runs the Koop Institute, a
research center connected with Dartmouth Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Koop's name and his ranking in opinion polls as the
nation's most trusted health authority appears to have been very
much on the minds of the former surgeon general and his business
advisers in founding DrKoop.com. In a prospectus filed June 8 with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said its goal
was to ``establish the DrKoop.com brand so that consumers associate
the trustworthiness and credibility of Dr. C. Everett Koop with our
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other commercial Web sites, DrKoop.com may accept
advertising. But because Koop's name carries so much weight with
the public, his critics argue, he has a special responsibility to
keep the distinction between advertising and education clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on his reputation,'' said Dr. Herbert Rakatansky,
chairman of the AMA's ethics council, ``he should disclose any
financial interest or tie to those providing a medical service or
treatment he or his Web site is recommending or it is a betrayal of
trust. He has to remain independent.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of compensation aside, critics say it has not always
been clear whether information about health products or services on
the DrKoop.com site are company promotions or advertising, or
balanced medical and health information.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, Dr. Joshua Hauser, a medical ethicist at the
University of Chicago, said that when he visited the site two
months ago he discovered a list of hospitals and health centers
described as ``the most innovative and advanced health care
institutions across the country.'' In fact, the list was an
advertisement for 14 hospitals, each of which had paid a fee of
about $40,000 to be included.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a site whose slogan was `Your Trusted Health Network,'''
Hauser said, he found ``this blurring of the line between editorial
content and advertising to be a problematic conflict of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop has also drawn criticism for forming a partnership with the
American Council on Science and Health, which identifies itself as
a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization and receives financing
both from industry and from private foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Other consumer advocates say the council is hardly unbiased.
Rather, they say, the group consistently takes industry's side in
disputes over product safety. The council, said Philip E. Clapp,
president of the National Environmental Trust, ``has never met a
pesticide it didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   An official of the council said those accusations were false,
adding that the group's mission is to offer balanced,
scientifically-based analysis of health news.
</P>
<P>
   Koop dismissed criticism of the council, saying it ``takes
positions based on science, not political correctness.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop said that as chairman of DrKoop.com he was deeply committed
to making it clear that he was not practicing medicine on the Web
site and to keeping the lines between advertising and balanced
content clear. ``But I guess we have to redouble our efforts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such statements, though, do not erase the sense many of his
critics have that America's family doctor, as Koop referred to
himself in a 1991 memoir, has put his credibility at risk. Some of
those most critical were once Koop's most ardent admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Koop was much revered by the people he trained,'' said a
Public Health Service doctor who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``He inspired me to became a doctor in the first place.
But many of these people believe now that the way he is acting is a
big departure from what we saw in him as a public health leader _
and he was one of the great ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop, told of the physician's comment, offered a suggestion to
his detractor. ``He or she ought to come and talk to me about it,''
he said.

COMMENTARY: VIVA LAS VEGAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS, Vegas _ I'm strolling down a cobblestone street, beneath
a cloud-speckled Paris sky. Past Le Village Buffet, past Napoleon's
cigar and cognac lounge, past Parcage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such word as `Parcage.' In France, we call it
`Parking,''' sniffs Francois, a French journalist covering the
opening of Paris, the $785 million hotel-casino that clones the
classy city of lights in the no-class city of neon.
</P>
<P>
   It boasts a Mini-Moi Eiffel Tower, half the size of the
original.
</P>
<P>
   Francois grimaces as a ``citizen,'' as the 4,000 Paris employees
are known, bicycles past with a basket of baguettes. He's wearing a
beret, a striped T-shirt and a red kerchief, and singing
``Alouette.''
</P>
<P>
   The French journalist continues le rant: ``It doesn't look like
a French building. The color of the roof is blue. In Paris, the
roofs are slate gray. And the gendarmes here are not in police
uniforms _ they're in Foreign Legion uniforms. And we don't put an
article in front of everything _ Le Journal, Le Cafe. It's not La
Boutique, it's Boutique. Everything is too shiny, too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Too shiny? Too much? Hey, Frenchie, it's Vegas!
</P>
<P>
   I came not to bury Caesars Palace, but to praise it. I loved the
old Vegas, the louche Vegas, the un-Disneyfied Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Casino chiefs began feminizing their hotels after focus groups
showed that men might decide to come to Vegas, but women choose
where to stay. More romance and shopping, less ring-a-ding-ding and
ka-ching, ka-ching.
</P>
<P>
   I was skeptical about the new fake European hotels: the
Venetian, with gondoliers crooning ``That's Amore!'' in a grand
canal in a mall; the Bellagio, with an eight-acre Lake Como adorned
with transplanted Italian trees, and fountains syncopated to Gene
Kelly songs; and now Paris, with the Arc de Triomphe and the
Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the old raffish Elvis/Rat Pack Vegas, more Scotch than
espresso, more steak than foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellagio has pink, flowered, fringed awnings over the gaming
tables. The Paris has Faberge-egg slot machines with Jacquepots and
gardenia-covered Eiffel Towers by the baccarat tables.
</P>
<P>
   What would Bugsy Siegel think of the Busch Gardenization of his
macho playground?
</P>
<P>
   But after two days in this world capital of unreality, I melted.
Its vices may be less straight-up, but it remains the most
deliciously deranged place on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of the cool city on the Seine with the brash city in
the desert is hilarious. Camus meets Andrew Dice Clay.
</P>
<P>
   It's the American way, really. If you don't have it, buy it.
Think of William Randolph Hearst, shipping boatloads of Renaissance
and Baroque artifacts to San Simeon. London Bridge, falling down,
was crated and sent to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Paris, Vegas, flies over its croissants from Paris, France,
daily.
</P>
<P>
   We can recreate France along our own fantasy lines, without its
bad plumbing and snooty airs. The hotel has Jilbere hair dryers,
and they're on the right electrical current.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone _ from the beefy trainer in the gym to the guy in a
black beret vacuuming the halls _ has been trained to speak a
soupcon of French. But they do it badly, nicely. So the tourist
feels superior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bone jer, come on tally view?'' sing-songs the maid, with a
big grin. ``That means `How are you?'''
</P>
<P>
   You never have to worry, as you do in the real Paris, about
feeling guilty that you are not cultivated enough. Paris, Vegas, is
the Inspector Clouseau of hotels. (``Have you seen my moonkey???'')
</P>
<P>
   It is one humongous Gallic cliche. Juggling mimes, accordion
players, street artists in red berets. Edith Piaf and Maurice
Chevalier on the sound system. Everything but a Vichy pavilion,
with tiny fake collaborators in Claude Rains trench coats.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that you can buy culture, the hotel paid French stars to
say nice things. At the opening party, Charles Aznavour and Michel
Legrand sang and Catherine Deneuve sparkled. (In a treasonous
moment, Ms. Deneuve snuck off to check out the Bellagio's more
upscale shops.)
</P>
<P>
   Let the real Parisians treat the casino with amused disdain. I
think it's positively magnifique to stand on the Lido and see the
Eiffel Tower rising along the banks of Lake Como.
</P>
<P>
   Call it globalization.
</P>

GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR FOUND SUBSTANTIALLY WIDER 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gap between rich and poor has grown into an economic chasm
so wide that this year the richest 2.7 million Americans, the top 1
percent, will have as many after-tax dollars to spend as the bottom
100 million.
</P>
<P>
   That ratio has more than doubled since 1977, when the top 1
percent had as much as the bottom 49 million, according to new data
from the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   In dollars, the richest 2.7 million people and the 100 million
at the other end of the scale will each have about $620 billion to
spend, according to an analysis of the budget office figures. The
analysis was done by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
nonprofit organization in Washington that advocates federal tax and
spending policies that it says would benefit the poor. The
analysis, released Saturday night, seems certain to stoke the
debate that is about to resume in Washington over projected federal
budget surpluses and possible tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The data from the budget office show that income disparity has
grown so much that four out of five households, or about 217
million people, are taking home a thinner slice of the economic pie
today than in 1977. When adjusted for inflation, as all of the
income figures have been, these households' share of national
income has fallen to just under 50 percent from 56 percent in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   But among the most prosperous one-fifth of Americans households,
or about 54 million people, whose share of the national income
grew, that fatter slice of the pie was not sliced evenly. More than
90 percent of the increase is going to the richest 1 percent of
households, which this year will average $515,600 in after-tax
income, up from $234,700 in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the economy has lifted the incomes of all of the
income groups tracked by the budget office, but the incomes of the
richest Americans are rising twice as fast as those of the middle
class. In addition, the budget office figures understate the
economic power of the richest 1 percent because they exclude
deferred forms of income like restricted stock, which have grown
rapidly in recent years as companies have expanded their pay plans
from senior executives down to store and plant manager levels.
</P>
<P>
   Though the economic pie has grown over the past 22 years, the
Congressional Budget Office data show that the poorest one-fifth of
households have not shared in this bounty. The average after-tax
household income of the poor, adjusted for inflation, has fallen 12
percent since 1977. So the poor not only have a small slice of a
big economic pie, but the pie is bigger and their piece is even
smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The poorest one-fifth of households will average $8,800 of
income this year, down from $10,000 in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have passed legislation to cut taxes
by $792 billion over the next 10 years, legislation that President
Clinton has promised to veto, saying it is imprudent and favors the
rich.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans say that a tax cut is justified because federal
tax revenue rose last year to 21.7 percent of the economy, the
highest since World War II, and because the Congressional Budget
Office anticipates surpluses as far into the future as its
projections go.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans acknowledge that most of their proposed tax cuts
will go to taxpayers making $100,000 or more a year, but they say
that since these high-income Americans pay 62 percent of federal
income taxes they should get most of the benefits of a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax bill's benefits are roughly proportional to the taxes
that each taxpayer pays,'' Bruce Bartlett, a Treasury official in
the Reagan and Bush administrations, has written.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who says that budget surpluses may never materialize,
wants to pay down the national debt before cutting taxes. He also
says that a tax cut should not bestow the bulk of its benefits on
the rich, and he wants part of any surplus to finance new programs.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The budget and policy center's report says that one reason the
rich are doing so well is the cumulative effect of tax cuts since
1977, when the top federal income tax bracket was 50 percent,
compared with the current 39.6 percent. These tax cuts are worth an
average of $40,000 this year to each of the slightly more than 1
million households that make up the top 1 percent, said Robert
Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Internal Revenue Service tax return data, not cited in the
center's report, show that two-thirds of Americans earned less than
$40,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans who make $80,000 a year, $100,000 or $120,000,
think of themselves as middle class,'' Greenstein said, ``but the
fact is that while these people are not rich, they are also not in
or even near the middle, which is only about $32,000 in after-tax
income.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Greenstein said that under the Republican tax cut plan the
richest 1 percent of households would save an average of $32,000
more annually, once all of the proposed cuts were phased in.
</P>
<P>
   The budget and policy center has been sharply critical of the
Republican tax cut plan and the idea that those who pay the most in
taxes should get the biggest cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Shapiro, who wrote the report with Greenstein, called the
proposed tax cut plan ``wrongheaded'' and unfair to both the poor
and the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Greenstein said he was pleased with one proposal in the
Republican plan, a small expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit,
which allows low-income workers to collect up to $3,816 this year
in refunds of their Social Security tax and a cash payment that is
a form of negative income tax.
</P>
<P>
   A couple with two children does not pay any income tax until
their income exceeds $28,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   That expansion was proposed despite intense criticism of the
credit by leading Republicans, notably Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other data, not cited in the budget and policy center report,
also show that the growth in incomes is mostly at the top of the
income ladder.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 142,566 Americans reported $1 million or more of
adjusted gross income for 1997, nearly two-thirds more than the
86,998 such taxpayers in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Levy, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology whose review of two books taking different tacks on the
income gap appears in the current issue of the Harvard Business
Review, said that the concentration of income growth at the top
resulted largely from rules set by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets are obviously very important in the economy,'' Levy
said, ``but they are surrounded by a lot of rules _ rules about how
easy it is organize unions and how free trade is _ and those rules
are determined by the political process, and those rules right now
are shaped by money'' donated to political candidates.

GERMAN STATE VOTES SUNDAY, AND RIGHTISTS HOPE TO GAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAUEN, Germany _ ``And then,'' said Rene Farbig, 21, ``there is
the question of foreigners. It's not that we are against them, but
they don't adapt to German habits, they don't behave as they
should.''
</P>
<P>
   Farbig is an apprentice carpenter in this small town in the
eastern state of Brandenburg, where voting takes place Sunday in an
election heavily marked by the presence of the free-spending,
extreme-right Deutsche Volksunion.
</P>
<P>
   The party, backed by a millionaire Bavarian publisher, Gerhard
Frey, is hoping to benefit from disillusionment with the
center-left government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, which has
proved unable to dent an unemployment rate still running close to
20 percent in the former East German states, about double the
national level.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the eastern state of Saxony Anhalt last year, the
Volks-union showed its potential appeal, taking 13 percent of the
vote. In Brandenburg, the largest of the states of former East
Germany, it is unlikely to fare that well, but may qualify for the
state legislature for the first time by gaining over 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Farbig would not say if he intended to vote for the party, but
said he was disturbed by the number of foreigners in Brandenburg,
particularly Turks. ``The number is excessive, especially with our
unemployment,'' he remarked.
</P>
<P>
   As he talked, a small plane passed overhead trailing a banner
advertising the Volksunion, which has plastered towns throughout
Brandenburg with slogans like ``Criminal Foreigners Out,'' ``German
Money for German Jobs,'' ``Defend Yourself on Election Day'' and
``Less Money Abroad, More for Brandenburg.''
</P>
<P>
   Neo-Nazi violence has surged in Brandenburg recently. The
state's interior minister, Alwin Ziel, said last week that there
were 33 serious far-right attacks in the first half of this year, a
rise of 50 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the year, an Algerian youth died in Guben while fleeing
a rightist mob, and in June, 11 African refugees were beaten by
thugs in the town of Cottbus. An African soccer player was forced
to leave the Cottbus club after being relentlessly taunted.
</P>
<P>
   Brandenburg has been a Social Democratic stronghold since East
Germany collapsed, and Schroeder's party won an absolute majority
of 54.1 percent in the last state elections in 1994. But that was
when the conservative Chancellor Helmut Kohl was still in power
nationally, and the Social Democrats could blame him for
Brandenburg's woes. Now the Social Democrats control the federal
government. Schroeder's popularity is at an ebb _ recent polls have
shown that less than 30 percent of the country approves of his
performance _ and the party's support is expected to fall by at
least 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Christian Democrats are widely expected to
gain ground. Polls give Kohl's party about 25 percent of the vote,
compared with 18.7 percent in 1994. The Party of Democratic
Socialism _ the former East German Communists _ is also expected to
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll still vote Social Democrat because I'm a worker and I
believe it to be the workers' party,'' said Wilhelm Lussel, who
works in a machinery factory in Nauen. ``But Mr. Schroeder is
promoting this aggressive `elbow society' where money alone counts,
and we are not happy with him.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Social Democrats are punished in Brandenburg, and fail to
hang on to power in the western state of Saarbruecken, where voting
also takes place Sunday, Schroeder will look severely weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Few believe that his hold on power is threatened, because his
coalition with the Greens appears firm for the moment. But with
elections in Saxony, Thuringia and Berlin looming in the next
several weeks, and an ambitious program of budget cuts and economic
reform awaiting application, Schroeder is by no means the ebullient
politician who swept to power a year ago under the slogan ``I am
ready.''

IN A RAMBLING SHOW OF INDIAN DEMOCRACY, NATIONAL ELECTIONS BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARRY BEARAK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Indian national elections begin on Sunday,
and, as always, they are likely to be a great, if unwieldy, display
of democracy, this time requiring a month of voting and 800,000
polling locations for the 605 million people eligible to cast a
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But as impressive as Indian elections may be, they are becoming
too much of a good thing, with this being the third vote in 40
months, a result of fragmented and sometimes treacherous politics
that produce easy-to-disassemble coalition governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without one-party rule, I don't think any government will last
for long,'' said Mohammad Idris, a taxi driver interviewed in the
city of Hyderabad, expressing a common view among Indian voters.
</P>
<P>
   The current round of parliamentary elections became necessary
last April when an alliance headed by the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party lost its majority by a single vote. At the
time, it seemed that the Congress Party, the BJP's strongest
opponent, would be able to cobble together a majority of its own,
but that notion proved chimerical.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of the BJP has
been running an interim government, awaiting the elections, which
will require five stages. Voting will also take place on Sept. 11,
18 and 25 and on Oct. 3. Counting will begin only after the final
round.
</P>
<P>
   If pre-election polls are correct, the Hindu nationalists will
again end up leading a patchwork coalition, though one with more
seats in Parliament than before. Vajpayee will remain in charge. He
has succeeded in providing a kinder, gentler face for the BJP,
which has a longtime association with militant Hindu chauvinists.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the campaign has been without much Hindu-Muslim
friction, an ugly staple of Indian society. As in the last
election, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has set
aside the more controversial parts of its agenda _ for example
their call for the construction of a Hindu temple on the site of a
demolished mosque _ with an eye toward mustering a majority
coalition.
</P>

   The electioneering has not been short on the incendiary,
however. Personal insults, impugned patriotism and general bombast
are in overabundant supply, so much so that on Thursday the chief

asked politicians ``to turn their attention to issues that matter

   Recent counterattacks by the Congress Party have focused on

unneeded sugar.

   Some of the maligning of personalities, commentators frequently
and sarcastically point out, actually comes from a dearth of
disagreement on more substantial matters. The two major parties hum
very similar tunes when it comes to economics and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is hard for politicians to find a message
with equally strong resonance across so varied a nation _ a country
of 1 billion people and a society made all the more complex by the
distinctions of caste and ethnicity and mother tongue. Seventeen
major languages are spoken in India in addition to an estimated
22,000 dialects. Four major religions began here.

   Some 70 percent of the population lives in villages. News often
travels in stutter steps because of illiteracy and inaccessibility.
Parochial needs frequently predominate. Votes in a national

   This year, only one issue seems to cut across all of India's
dividing lines. That is Kargil, the shorthand name for a 10-week
military operation in the frigid peaks of Kashmir that ended in
late July. The Indian army and air force overcame hundreds of
Pakistani-backed soldiers who had crossed into India and taken
mountaintop positions. The rugged terrain had to be recaptured foot
by foot.
</P>
<P>
   Heroic deeds fed national pride, and the BJP commends itself for
the victory. Vajpayee has tried to use Kargil to rally the diverse
electorate under the Hindu nationalist banner. ``The soldiers were
from all religions and regions, fought together and shed blood
together and everybody's blood was red,'' he said in a speech last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Congress Party candidates, for their part, praise the soldiers
while reproving the government, charging that there would have been
no need for heroism had there been proper surveillance of enemy
infiltration. Vajpayee is flayed for having made a bus trip last
February to Pakistan, once viewed here as a master stroke of
statesmanship but now widely seen as a sucker's bet that played
into the hands of Pakistani betrayers.
</P>
<P>
   The BJP is trying to fight the criticism head on. Its ads show
the 73-year-old prime minister at his grandfatherly best, staring
calmly, if resolutely, into the heavens. The wording says that
while he ``can travel far to shake a hand,'' he can also ``crush it
with a Kargil.'' He has ``the swiftness to nip mischief,'' it says,
and he has readied India with nuclear weapons and the missiles to
deliver them.  &QL;

FIVE SCHOOLS NEAR LITTLETON GET LETTERS WITH THREATS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DENVER _ Grappling with the aftermath of the April 20 massacre
at Columbine High School in Littleton, education officials say five
other high schools in the same district have received letters
threatening violence in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   And with the largest charitable fund for victims of the
shootings closing this week, the families of some victims say they
are dissatisfied with their shares.
</P>
<P>
   The new problems are only the latest to confront officials since
an attack by two teen-age gunmen left 15 people dead and dozens
injured in Littleton, a suburb of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   When classes at Columbine began on Aug. 16, swastikas were found
scratched into brick and paint at the school. Later in the week
officials found 4/20 scrawled on a bathroom wall. It was on that
date, Hitler's birthday, that two students, Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold, went on their fatal shooting rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pranks are not just pranks,'' said Marilyn Saltzman, a
spokeswoman for Jefferson County school district. ``They're
serious. We are being very cautious this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, school officials sent a letter home with the 90,000
students in the school district alerting parents that five of the
17 high schools had received anonymous threats. Ms. Saltzman said
she could not discuss the contents of the threatening letters, but
one local newspaper reported that the letters warned, ``Columbine
was just the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Ms. Saltzman said, security guards were added at
the five schools, the sheriff's department was asked to step up
patrols around all schools and parents and staff members were asked
to talk to students about the seriousness of threats.
</P>
<P>
   But as life at Columbine settles into a semblance of normality,
the threats at the other high schools were no cause for concern for
some who survived the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like that everywhere, isn't it?'' said Richard Castaldo,
17. ``It doesn't really bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Castaldo, who uses a wheelchair after suffering a spinal cord
injury in the shooting, is returning to school on Tuesday for the
first time since the April 20 attack.
</P>
<P>
   Castaldo and his family will be among the final recipients of
money from the Healing Fund, the largest of about 30 charities
created to help victims after the shootings. It collected $4.4
million of the estimated $6 million that was donated to all the
funds. The bulk of the money collected by the Healing Fund has
already been distributed, and it will distribute the remaining $1.4
million this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never intended to be a perennial fund,'' said Kelley
Cahill, spokeswoman for Mile High United Way, which ran the Healing
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the families of the 12 students and one teacher slain
in the school received $50,000 each from the Healing Fund, and
relatives of four students left paralyzed or with brain injuries
received $150,000 each. Twenty-five other injured students received
$10,000 each. Community and service organizations received $1.6
million to assist with services like counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Any future donations to the Healing Fund will be forwarded to
the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance, and a Jefferson
County school district Web site (www.spiritofcolumbine.org) is
providing a list of specific funds where donations can be sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that particular needs are understood, we know which
victims need certain kinds of care,'' Ms. Cahill said. ``The four
students with brain or spinal cord injuries will have lifelong
needs in terms of medical care. Money will go into trusts to meet
their future needs. In addition to those folks, some students face
more surgeries, such as one young man who has a bullet lodged near
his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some parents, it was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Kirklin, whose 16-year-old son Lance was shot in the face,
said he did not have the money to pay the $229,000 medical bills
for the 28 days his son spent in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing has been a real joke so far,'' he said of the
Healing Fund. ``The first payment of $5,000 was split between me
and my ex-wife, and the second went directly into a trust for
him.'' Kirklin is self-employed and did not have health insurance
at the time of the shootings. Lance has to undergo at least five
more surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Some criticism of the school district has come from within. Last
week, school board members complained when they learned that the
district was not participating in a study by the National Centers
for Disease Control of school-related homicides and suicides.
``We've had so many requests for documentaries, plays, studies, but
we believe this one has merit and we will review it again,'' Ms.
Saltzman said. ``Our goal has been to get back to normal operating
mode.''

LANGUAGE LINK SHARED BY SLOVAKS AND CZECHS IS WEAKENING

<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ It has been less than seven years since
the Czech and Slovak republics peacefully split up after some 70
years together as Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   But recent surveys indicate that, although Czech and Slovak are
among the closest of languages in the family of Slavic tongues, and
the two peoples can communicate without difficulty, the youngest of
Czech schoolchildren now have difficulty understanding their Slovak
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 10-year-old granddaughter visited Slovakia this summer, and
I swear she didn't understand a single word,'' said Bozena
Ivankova, 62, a former director of the only Slovak elementary
school in the Czech Republic. Mrs. Ivankova, a Slovak who has lived
in the Czech lands for 20 years, was shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me realize how little time you need to lose touch,''
she said. ``I try to teach her Slovak words, but it might as well
be Russian. For Czech children, Slovak is just another foreign
language. There is no hope of restoring what we had before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very sad,'' she said with a sigh, considering that
Czechs and Slovaks, who had shared a state since 1918 with a
five-year interruption during World War II, used to read one
another's poetry, watch one another's TV programs and attend one
another's universities without any language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The barriers began to grow after Dec. 31, 1992, when
Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved into the Czech Republic and
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs, anxious to catch up on the years lost under
Communist rule, turned their attention to the West, losing interest
in all of their Eastern neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In Slovakia, on the other hand, the rule of Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar was deemed sufficiently undemocratic by mainstream
Europe to block his country's progress into the European Union and
NATO, and to damage the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite six years of relative isolation that ended with the
election a year ago of a more democratic government, surveys
suggest that Slovak children have remained far more proficient in
both languages than their Czech counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is much better in Slovakia,'' said Nadia
Vokusova, chairwoman of the Czechoslovak Club, a Prague-based group
that promotes Czech and Slovak cultural cooperation. Unlike Czech
children, who see and hear virtually no Slovak language in their
media, schools or entertainment, young Slovaks ``can watch undubbed
Czech films on TV and they can buy Czech books and newspapers,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Slovak intellectuals and teachers are real Czechophiles.
</P>
<P>
   While the Slovak commercial TV channel Markiza takes 7 percent
of its foreign acquisitions from the Czech Republic, Czech channels
do not even bother to keep statistics on the volume of their Slovak
programming, since it is virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Mrs. Vokusova tried to bring together Czechs
and Slovaks to overcome the growing cultural and language barriers.
She said the response from Czech teachers was not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me: `Why should we care? It's a foreign country
now,' '' she said. ``The Czech curriculum doesn't deal with Slovak
history anymore. But we have shared so much of it, it seems to me
the Czechs are mutilating their own history by excluding ours.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the language, Mrs. Vokusova thinks part of the problem is
sheer indifference: the Czechs simply do not believe that their
children cannot understand Slovak.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't take it seriously,'' she said. ``But soon it will
be too late.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She described how a Slovak colleague of hers asked a 5-year-old
Czech girl what her name was. The child frowned and put her thumb
in her mouth, then answered in English, the only foreign language
she knew.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Skalsky, the vice editor of Dotyky, or Contacts, a
Slovak-language magazine published in Prague, said he did not see
much hope for restoring the lively cultural exchange of the
Czechoslovak era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gift, a great bonus, that whole generations of Czechs
and Slovaks were basically bilingual,'' he said. ``But the young
generation of Czechs is losing that gift now. For them, Slovak is
no longer free.''  &QL;

<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Battles over growth bedevil communities throughout
the country, but rarely have they generated such fury as they have
here in one of Colorado's premier ski resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Objections over plans to build affordable housing for people who
work in local hotels, shops and restaurants grew so heated this
summer that Mayor Rob Ford quit, two years before his term expires.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some of the meetings we had, things got so bad that I was
uncomfortable without an undercover police officer there to protect
me,'' Ford said. ``At times I thought guys were going to pop me
right there in Town Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is familiar in upscale resort towns. With Vail's
winter popularity sagging in recent years because of aging hotels
and intense competition from other ski resorts in Colorado and
beyond, officials outlined an economic plan to revitalize the town
center. The centerpiece is a new Marriott hotel, scheduled for
groundbreaking next summer. Other projects are under way.
</P>
<P>
   But new amenities mean more employees. And having more employees
means creating living space for them, a daunting challenge in a
town that is already 98 percent developed and where homes typically
cost $500,000 and more. When workers in resorts like Vail are
forced to find cheaper housing many miles away, the long commutes
persuade many of them to seek jobs closer to home, causing huge
employment needs at the resort during peak season.
</P>
<P>
   To reverse trends that allowed Breckenridge to overtake Vail
last year as Colorado's leading ski resort, Ford and the City
Council sought suggestions from the Vail community and later
identified about seven sites around town for new housing that would
cost under $200,000 per dwelling.
</P>
<P>
   That is when the trouble began, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   People living in the area of the planned construction began
objecting, he said, fearing that their property values would
plummet. Three groups have sued the city, all contending that town
officials are violating local tax laws by buying open land for the
new housing. One plaintiff, Charles Bernhardt, a carpenter, lives
adjacent to a prospective housing site but insisted, in an
interview, that his proximity to the site had nothing to do with
his decision to sue.
</P>
<P>
   At least lawsuits confront problems in a civil manner, contrary
to the demeanor of some other town residents, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one Christmas party, one of the Grand Dames of Vail came up
and lit into me,'' he said, without identifying her. ``She screamed
so loud that spit was going out of her mouth. I couldn't even
understand what she was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Other town residents have also made their feelings known, Ford
said. Recounting a conversation with Jack F. Kemp, the former
housing secretary who owns a home in Vail and was the 1996
Republican vice-presidential nominee, the mayor said Kemp
``expressed displeasure'' that any new housing might be located
near his home.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Kemp said in an interview. Describing himself as a
strong supporter of affordable housing in Vail, he insisted that he
had never spoken with Ford about the housing issue and called the
mayor ``rather disingenuous'' for saying that they had talked.
``I've never said anything publicly or privately about this,'' Kemp
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also said John Glenn , the former Democratic senator from
Ohio and a Vail homeowner since 1980, complained to officials that
some of the housing might be located near him. ``It was
disgusting,'' Ford said of his letter.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn conceded that his letter was ``reasonably tough.'' But he
said his objections were solely based on assurances given when he
bought his mountainside condominium that the open area beside it
would not be developed. And even now, he added, he did not oppose a
housing project on the land so long as it did not block his view of
the valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought I was being snookered,'' Glenn said. ``I
thought they were changing the ground rules on me, and I wanted
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 48, said he came to Vail 25 years ago from Michigan for
the skiing and never left. He worked as a bartender and hotel clerk
and now sells real estate. He was elected to the seven-member City
Council in 1995, and in 1997 the Council voted him to be the mayor
for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Before the turmoil over affordable housing, he estimated that he
skied 75 to 80 days a year. For the last two years, skiing days are
down to 30. He plans to step down in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a politician,'' he insisted. ``I said I would be mayor
because I thought I could address Vail's problems, and I feel I
have met the objectives we set out to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the level of incivility is more than I'm willing to put up
with,'' he said. ``I like to ski, then sit down at the bar to drink
a beer and not have someone come up to me and complain. I want to
go back to skiing and being a nice guy again.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Locally heavy rain will fall near the center of the remnants of
Tropical Storm Dennis as it moves north into central Virginia.
Moisture-laden air from over the Atlantic will be drawn into the
storm's circulation Sunday resulting in widespread rain amounts of
1 to 3 inches from northeastern North Carolina to eastern Virginia
and Maryland. Imbedded thunderstorms will result in flooding
downpours in some areas. Winds will be strong at times, especially
near exposed coastal locations where gusts over 35 miles an hour
will be common. High surf will exacerbate beach erosion near the
Middle Atlantic Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, periods of rain will spread across Pennsylvania
to near the southern New England coast during the day. Clouds will
thicken elsewhere in New England and upstate New York. By Sunday
night and early Monday, locally heavy rain will reach central and
eastern Pennsylvania while lighter showers expand northward.
</P>
<P>
   Dry and unseasonably warm conditions will persist from Michigan
through most of the Ohio Valley and Southeastern states. Farther
west, a slow-moving cold front will be accompanied by a 100-mile
wide band of clouds and thundershowers from the western Great Lakes
to the southern Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southern
Plains. Behind the front, breezy and cool conditions will cover the
northern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Tranquil weather and near seasonal afternoon temperatures will
cover most of the Western states. An approaching cold front will
bring clouds and few showers to the Washington Coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THE END OF SUMMER
</P>
<P>
   Tradition designates the Labor Day weekend as the end of the
summer season. Because of the building reservoir of ocean warmth,
summer heat lingers long after June 22, the day when the sun is
highest in the northern hemisphere's sky. Astronomers will not
declare an end to summer until 7:31 a.m. EDT on Sept. 23 when the
direct rays of the noontime sun shift into the southern hemisphere.
Among the official keepers of climatological records, summer in the
northern hemisphere ended on Aug. 31, the last day of the three
warmest months of the year.

BECKER AND GRAF LEAVE BIG SHOES TO FILL
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALAN MAIMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ More than just dominant tennis players, Boris Becker
and Steffi Graf were global phenomena, the rarest of athletes who
symbolized nationality and transcended it at the same time. Before
Becker and Graf came on the scene, Germans admired their
celebrities from a polite distance. As Becker and Graf rose to the
top of their professions, however, they became Boris and Steffi,
German cultural exports and symbols of national pride.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent editorial, a Berlin newspaper credited Becker and
Graf with nothing less than altering the self-image of Germans.
``Their success on the tennis court made Germans feel more like
individuals,'' Tagesspiegel wrote. ``Can tennis ever be the same
without them?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the unpleasant question that many Germans are asking.
Thanks to Boris and Steffi, Germany is now a tennis-loving country.
</P>
<P>
   Since Becker's first victory at Wimbledon in 1985, membership in
the German Tennis Federation has risen by almost 25 percent to 2.2
million in a country with a population of 80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the pro circuits, the ATP and the WTA, are also eager to
see Germany maintain its tennis tradition. Both invested a lot in
Germany during the Becker and Graf era.
</P>
<P>
   The ATP brought its World Championships, a tournament featuring
the best eight players of the year, to Germany 10 years ago at the
peak of Beckermania. Next year, the ATP moves the tournament from
Hanover to Portugal, and subsequently to rotating locations around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to move the tournament out of Hanover has nothing
to do with a lack of fan interest in Germany,'' said Nicola Arzani
of the ATP. ``We just felt that a world championship needed to play
in different places in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the other 12 ATP and WTA tournaments that take place in
Germany, six came into existence after Becker and Graf became
stars. Neither association is worried about the financial health of
these tournaments now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these tournaments are sold out,'' Arzani said.
``Germans loved Becker, but knew that his career was winding down.
The bigger test will be for the WTA tournaments, because Steffi was
still at the top of her game when she left.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, German stations broadcast an astounding 2,700 hours of
tennis. This year, that amount will sink to about 1,000 hours.
Germans no longer require an oversaturation of tennis. They are
already hooked. But they do require a winner.
</P>
<P>
   This year's U.S. Open, the first Grand Slam in the post-Becker
and Graf era, is a test of whether German tennis can maintain
momentum now that its two legends are gone.
</P>
<P>
   The men's game would not appear to be in crisis. Germany has a
pair of 21-year-olds ranked in the top 20, Tommy Haas at 14th and
Nicolas Kiefer at 15th. Both are on pace to qualify for the ATP
World Championships in November, a tournament featuring the best 14
players of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haas has what it takes to be a household name,'' said Joe
Favorito of the United States Tennis Association. ``His good looks
and tremendous game could take him as far as Becker.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrappy Kiefer is also on the ascent. But strong showings in
Toronto and Washington last month have been overshadowed at home by
his role in a verbal free-for-all that threatens to tear apart the
powerful German federation. The dispute involves the ever-present
Becker, who is manager of the German Davis Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the team captain, Carl-Uwe Steeb, Becker has been
entrusted with maintaining the status of German tennis after his
retirement. A loss in the relegation series against Romania at the
end of September would thwart that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer sparked controversy when he announced last month that he
would not participate in the Romania series. Becker was furious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiefer's worldview begins and ends with himself,'' Becker
said. ``Everybody needs to pull themselves together and forget
their ego.''
</P>
<P>
   The animosity Becker and Kiefer feel toward each other dates
back several years to when the teen-age Kiefer quit Becker's junior
team. Since that time, the legend and his would-be successor have
not been on speaking terms. Those who know both men well say that
the problem stems from the fact that they are too similar, that
Kiefer shares the same stubborn individualism that Becker
practically invented 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tension was palpable when Becker thrashed Kiefer in straight
sets on center court at Wimbledon this year in what would prove to
be his penultimate victory before retirement. But since Wimbledon,
it is Kiefer who has given Becker fits.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the professional rivalry between Becker and Michael
Stich, which developed after Stich's Wimbledon victory over Becker
in 1991, the feud between Kiefer and Becker has exposed deeper
cracks within the infrastructure of German tennis. Even Haas and
Kiefer have stopped talking to each other. Wary of associating
himself with his controversial peer, Haas has chosen to speak out
for the honor of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why Kiefer backed out of the Romania
series,'' Haas said. ``I am always proud to play for Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Haas then uttered the words that show he understands the real
backdrop to the story: ``I guess Kiefer just can't come to terms
with the Becker clan.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer is not the only one. Dirk Horndorff, former vice
president of the German federation, also felt that Becker had
disproportionate control over German tennis. Horndorff wondered out
loud about Becker's duties as Davis Cup team manager. Irate that
his role was being questioned, Becker thrust a copy of his contract
into Horndorff's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see your contract,'' Horndorff shot back. ``I
want to know what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker gave the federation president, Karl Weber, an ultimatum:
discharge Horndorff or he will go. Although Weber acknowledged that
he and Becker have had problems recently, he dismissed Horndorff.
More awkwardness ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Rainer Schuettler, the player expected to replace Kiefer on the
Davis Cup team, is coached by Horndorff.
</P>
<P>
   A veil of silence has fallen over the federation as adversaries
and allies by convenience struggle for the soul of German tennis.
Two weeks ago, mass resignations among the group's executive
council over the Horndorff affair were narrowly averted when the
council decided to delay acting until after the Davis Cup matches
in September. Things remain Orwellian behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internal problems need to be settled internally,'' Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The German women's game has been spared the ego clashes, but
harmony does not make up for the fact that Germany is plagued by a
serious talent gap now that Graf is gone.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of injuries, Anke Huber, 24, has climbed back to
27th in the WTA ranking, after peaking at fourth in the world in
1996. It is highly improbable, however, that Huber will be able to
fill the void left by Graf. As the only German woman ranked in the
top 50, Huber has not fared well at Flushing Meadows, losing in the
first round of the U.S. Open in two of the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can replace Graf and Anke knows that,'' Weber said.
``She just has to play her game and not worry about being in
anyone's shadow anymore.'`
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of talent must rebuild Germany's reputation
on the women's circuit. Although she plans to work with several
talented juniors, Graf is not expected to take as much of a
leadership role at the professional level as Becker.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing junior is 13th-ranked Scarlett Werner, 15.
Weber said she has the talent _ not to mention the catchy first
name _ to bring her international attention in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it is Kiefer and Haas who will chase hopes of filling
the vacated throne in German men's tennis. Haas is the darling of
the moment in Germany and Kiefer the villain. But a glimpse into
Becker's past should give Kiefer hope that lost image points can be
regained.
</P>
<P>
   Becker also feuded early in his career with his Davis Cup
captain, Jiri Bilic. His history teaches that winning can do
wonders for public relations. Still, it is hard to imagine that
either Haas or Kiefer will ever be treated like a hometown hero at
Wimbledon. They are not Boris.

ARGENTINE CHIEF'S TEPID STAND HOBBLES HIS PARTY'S CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ It is not the best year to be the
presidential candidate of the governing Justicialist Party, with
Argentina sinking into recession, crime soaring and polls showing
that voters believe government corruption is rife.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the problems facing the candidate, Eduardo Duhalde,
who is now governor of Buenos Aires Province, is the ambiguous
support, if it can be called that, he is receiving from President
Carlos Saul Menem, the party's head.
</P>
<P>
   Lagging far behind his competitor, Mayor Fernando de la Rua of
Buenos Aires, in the polls, Duhalde said last week that the
opposition Alianza coalition had a secret plan to devalue the
Argentine peso that would destroy the economy. De la Rua denied
that he had devaluation in mind, saying he was committed to
Argentina's eight-year-old policy of pegging the peso one-to-one to
the American dollar.
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical heated campaign exchange with little import
until Menem said publicly that he believed de la Rua, putting an
end to the rumor and embarrassing Duhalde.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to recover, Duhalde assembled all the Justicialist
governors and party chiefs at a Buenos Aires convention hall last
week to propose an economic plan that would cut the value-added tax
from 21 percent to 15 percent, reduce taxes for businesses that
suspend planned layoffs, and give subsidies to small- and
medium-sized businesses. He challenged the opposition to join with
the Justicialists to approve the plan before the Oct. 24 election
because the country's economy was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Menem's initial reaction was decidedly tepid. ``It deserves
consideration, but that's all,'' he said. ``We'll see whether it
should be implemented.'' After party leaders complained that Menem
appeared to be sabotaging the ticket, he grudgingly endorsed the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Even more embarrassing to Justicialist leaders have been press
reports that Menem's senior aides and top congressional supporters
have called reporters in recent weeks to suggest that Duhalde would
resign as the Justicialist candidate and be replaced by someone
with a better chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing to the reports, but they underscored Duhalde's
weakness and the divisions in the party, which has had a stormy
history since it was founded by Juan Peron.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Menem and members of his Cabinet insist that they
fully support Duhalde, a contention many experts contest. ``Menem
has done all he can to damage Duhalde,'' said Joaquin Morales Sola,
a columnist for the paper La Nacion.
</P>
<P>
   Menem challenged Duhalde for the Justicialist nomination for
months until the courts and Congress resisted his attempts to
overturn a constitutional ban on his running for a third
consecutive term.
</P>
<P>
   Menem has since announced that he would like to return to the
presidential palace in 2003, and his aides say he is willing to
challenge Duhalde in a primary to do it.
</P>
<P>
   A poll made public last week by Mora y Araujo and Associates, a
respected Argentine polling company, showed de La Rua, who is
running a cautious campaign with little flair, with 48 percent
backing to 29 percent for Duhalde. Domingo Cavallo, a former
economy minister running on a conservative third-party ticket,
received 9 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Media coverage of the campaign has been dominated in recent days
by accounts of how the Duhalde forces are trying to regroup and
find a winning message. Many articles have been suffused with
sarcasm, especially when it became public that Duhalde's running
mate, Sen. Ramon Palito Ortega, made a panicked trip to Israel to
seek spiritual guidance from a rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   Duhalde was vice president during Menem's first term, but the
two have not been close for years. Duhalde rose in the polls
earlier in the year while distancing himself from Menem's
free-market economic policies, but more recently he has had nice
things to say about the president as he has attempted to unite the
Justicialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Menem has said he supports Duhalde, and he embraced him at a
recent public meeting. But Menem continues to tell reporters that
if he could have run for re-election, ``I would be the best
candidate of all.''

SWISS BANKS MAY BE FACING MORE HOLOCAUST PAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Anxiety appears to be rising in Swiss banking circles
that a long-awaited report from a commission seeking Holocaust-era
accounts may recommend that banks pay out more than the $1.25
billion agreed to in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A Swiss newspaper reported Saturday that a letter signed last
month by two high-level bankers reflected fears that the
commission, headed by the former Federal Reserve chairman, Paul
Volcker, would call for a new program to restore unclaimed funds
from Swiss bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   This would be in addition to the August 1998 deal agreed on by
Switzerland's two largest banks to settle claims that they had
profited from dealings with Nazi Germany and from holding onto
accounts of Jews killed in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was set up in 1996 in the wake of charges that
the Swiss banking community had hoarded money stashed in
Switzerland, a neutral country, by Jews who were later killed by
Hitler's henchmen.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier last week, the Volcker commission indicated that it
would wrap up its search and issue a final report by the end of
November, the same time that an independent commission of
historians is supposed to release its findings on the country's
treatment of wartime refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland has been accused of turning refugees away at its
borders, thus sending them to a certain death in Nazi Germany, and
the upcoming report is expected to review all historical records
and come to some conclusions about Switzerland's role.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, the Volcker commission's four
auditing groups have checked millions of names for possible links
to accounts that had been established in Swiss banks between 1933
and 1945. It has investigated 61 banks, provoking complaints by
some banks earlier this year that the search was too expensive and
had gone on too long.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The commission's activities are separate from the billion-dollar
1998 settlement between Holocaust victims and Switzerland's two
largest banks, UBS A.G. and the Credit Suisse group. That accord,
generally unpopular in Switzerland, was viewed as bowing to threats
of boycotts of the Swiss banking sector, an important part of the
country's economy and prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss disdain for the deal, coupled with the high price tag, has
made bankers particularly anxious that the Volcker commission might
add to their debt. Working out arrangements, under the supervision
of a U.S. district court judge, for the disbursement of the $1.25
billion took months. At the end of June, a campaign to inform
victims of Nazi persecution, began in 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss newspaper, Le Temps, said that top-level bankers from
UBS and Credit Suisse, together with the head of the Swiss banking
association, had sent the letter on Aug. 27 to Volcker, expressing
concern that he and his aide, Michael Bradfield, would put in place
a program parallel to the $1.25 billion settlement, and that a
Jewish organization was considering it.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, the newspaper said, was signed by Marcel Ospel, who
heads the UBS group, and Lukas Muhlemann, his counterpart at Credit
Suisse group, and George Krayer, president of the Swiss Banking
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the letter was not available, and the letter's
signers could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Volcker commission, officially called the Independent
Committee of Eminent Persons, has uncovered 62,000 accounts with
possible links to Nazi-era victims, the newspaper reported. Of
these, 2,800 have been matched with the names of Holocaust victims.

A U.N. SPECIAL SESSION ON CLIMATIC THREATS TO ISLAND NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ For more than a decade, several dozen small
island nations threatened by rising seas and increasingly violent
weather have been awaiting the world's attention as they face
forces well beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 27 and 28, they will get a chance to air their fears in
a special session of the General Assembly. Their leaders say the
time has come to go beyond reciting statistics to demonstrate the
human toll that climate changes are already taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we learn from the scientific community does not give us a
great deal of comfort,'' said Tuiloma Neroni Slade, Samoa's
representative at the United Nations and chairman of the Alliance
of Small Island States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we certainly know is that in the low-lying areas,
the sea has claimed our burial grounds,'' he said. ``That, of
course, reflects the smallness of the available territory. But it
also says that areas that are so very close to families and
communities are being invaded. It is the beginning of that loss to
communities that we fear.''
</P>
<P>
   To compound the natural disasters, Slade said, the smallest
nations now face a loss of trade concessions that sustained their
agricultural economies. Recent World Trade Organization rulings
made in the name of liberalization are cutting trade preferences,
especially in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism, which many island nations turned to as a rapid money
earner, is no longer a panacea for several reasons, cultural and
environmental. But the greatest threat to this industry may also be
coming from the sea, Slade said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no escaping a hurricane that decides to hover over a
relatively small land mass,'' he said. ``In an industry like
tourism, hotels are often destroyed. It takes a long time to
rehabilitate.'' Beaches and reefs are also disappearing, and
biodiversity is being lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Climate change is already taking effect in terms of some of
the life support systems,'' he added. ``For instance, in the
Maldives, there is infiltration of fresh-water reserves by sea
water. In many places, there is a degree of brackishness in the
drinking water. You can see this in the Caribbean. You can
certainly see this in the Pacific. Fresh-water reserves have been
contaminated. Whether it is a storm surge or the sea rising, the
waters get into the fresh water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Climate change is the type of global issue not of our making,
so it raises questions of equity and ethics,'' he said, adding that
the island nations will once again ask that larger nations cut back
on their use of fossil fuels that heat the atmosphere.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Slade said that the island nations, often guided by
international experts, initially tried to build barriers against
the oceans. This is no longer realistic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural protective action is to set up walls against an
invading sea,'' he said. ``It is quite physically impossible and
also economically impossible for any one country or group of
countries to undertake this. There are certain things we can do to
adapt, but we cannot hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Several envoys of island nations said that global economic
liberalization is hitting them just after they have diversified
agricultural economies and begun to introduce small-scale
industries, including textiles. These small-volume farming and
factory products cannot compete in world markets. The 42 nations
and territories represented this month at the special session,
occurring five years after the first conference on small island
states in Barbados, are expected to ask for better advice and
concrete relief measures.

   COPENHAGEN, Denmark _ Swedes may share history, culture and some
language with the Danes, but they haven't always been welcome when
they have crossed the Baltic channel that separates the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the nations have fought a series of bloody wars over
the centuries, usually with the Danes on the losing side.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in a move symbolic of how the new Europe is breaking
down its age-old divisions, the Danes are about to make it easier
than ever for Swedes to come calling, and far from fearing the
consequences, they view the occasion as a chance to bury hatchets,
raise future prospects and smooth over clashing national
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   A new 9.5-mile, $2 billion tunnel and bridge connection called
the Oresund Fixed Link is being completed that will tie Sweden to
the continent of Europe for the first time and create a new
European trade and marketing center that will surpass Stockholm and
equal those of cities like Berlin; Hamburg, Germany; Zurich,
Switzerland, and Amsterdam, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   When the four-lane highway and dual-track railroad is opened to
traffic next July 1, Copenhagen, Denmark's capital, will be only an
11-minute ride from Malmo, Sweden's third-largest city, and a
single metropolitan region with a population of 3.2 million people
will be born.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Swedes won a series of wars
with the Danes and kept walking off with territories that had been
Danish.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Danes were more prosperous and powerful than
the Swedes but a lot less lucky. When Sweden's King Charles X was
casting covetouq eyes this way in 1658, an unusually cold winter
arrived, allowing his troops to march across the frozen sea. The
Swedes caught the enemy by surprise and diminished Denmark a little
more. By the 19th century, the two nations were still fighting, and
the conquering Swedes made the Danes cede to them all of what is
now Norway.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the moment of bonding provided by the new link has
become a chance for Denmark and Sweden to put to rest their
belligerent old relationship, and this time the Danes finally seem
to be on the winning side. ``We love the Danes more than the Danes
love us,'' conceded Per Olov Enquist, 65, the Swedish novelist and
playwright who lived here during the 15 years he was married to a
Danish woman.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while he never encountered ``aggressive
anti-Swedish feelings,'' he felt that Danes are generally
appreciated more than Swedes. ``For example, when a Swede speaks
Danish, it sounds stupid, but when a Dane speaks Swedish, it's
considered cute,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the judgment is a stereotype popular in Copenhagen and
largely undisputed in Malmo of Swedes as stiff, formal, reserved,
humorless, collective-minded and ever obedient to intrusive state
rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danes will say, `Oh you Swedes, you have laws against
everything,''' Enquist said. ``They make it sound as if we have
barbed wire around the whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Danes, by contrast, are thought of as the Southerners of
Northern Europe, cosmopolitan, individualistic, extroverted, high
spirited and fun-loving, and they are quite content to feed the
image. ``When I go to the Nordic Council,'' said Magrethe Auken,
54, a member of Parliament, ``you can be sure that where there is
laughing, celebrating and drinking, that's where the Danes are.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbro Reinestrand and her husband, Hans, both 56-year-old
Swedes from the southwestern town of Kungalv, stood on the Malmo
shore one recent afternoon and looked admiringly out at the bridge
melting into the mists above the Oresund on its curving trajectory
to Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to go over there,'' Mrs. Reinestrand said. She raised
her arms in a folk dancer's pose and tapped her feet. ``Danes are
so happy, and Swedes are so moody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Swedes in Scania, the southern province of the country, are
willing to accept this unflattering picture of their national
character because they're really talking about Swedes in the North,
particularly in the area of Stockholm, the national capital 400
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who live in Scania think of themselves as more Danish
than Swedish, and they think of Stockholmers as gray and dull, more
like Russians,'' said Fredrik Nilsson, a Swedish anthropologist
from the University of Lund who conducted a study of attitudes on
either side of the Oresund and published his conclusions in a book
called ``When One Hour Became 10 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that, as in other parts of Europe where centuries-old
conflicts affect present day senses of identity, many Scanians
still think of themselves as former Danes. The province was annexed
by Sweden 341 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Scanians, who often fly their own distinctive red and yellow
flag in place of the blue and yellow national standard, refer to
residents of the capital scornfully as ``Zero-Eights,'' a reference
to the city's telephone area code.
</P>
<P>
   Scanians resent being caricatured by other Swedes as provincial
lowlanders, and they feel neglected by the national government.
``For a lot of people in Scania, the bridge is their exit from the
Swedish nation state'' Nilsson said. ``They feel that they're going
home to Denmark.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reinestrand gently patted her own backside and confirmed
the sentiment. ``We call ourselves the rump of Sweden,'' she said
brightly, ``and we feel much closer to Copenhagen than to
Stockholm.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson added: ``The people behind the bridge like to say we are
uniting Sweden and Denmark, but to ordinary people here it is a
question of uniting Scania and Denmark. People don't think about
two countries, they think about one region.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what the state-backed investment promotion and tourism
development agencies have been focusing on in the run-up to the
bridge's opening. It is their hope that Denmark will not become
simply a ``footprint'' for Swedish transports on their way to
Germany and the European heartland but that the 8,000-square-mile
Oresund area will become a place unto itself as regionality and
nation-to-nation cooperation become more important, and national
identity less.

</P>
<P>
   While the European Union, of which both Denmark and Sweden are
members, has broken down trade and currency barriers, it has lagged
in building transportation connections like the Oresund link to
make come true its hopes of a continental community that is
geographically rational and accessible.

<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)

<P>
   Lars Kolind, 52, a manufacturing executive who is one of
Denmark's most innovative business leaders, believes that there are
complementary resources on either side of the Oresund that are
particularly well suited for the region's specialities like
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical research, environmental
science and information technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of business depend on networking, close
communication and exchange of knowledge, and though I'm fully aware
of the advantages of the Internet, there is no substitute for
physical contact,'' he said.

   A country with real industrial might, Sweden has businesses that
are large and muscular where Danish businesses rely on their
centuries-old skills in international commerce. ``Swedish business
is more powerful than ours, but we are the traders, the
manipulators, the ultimate pragmatists,'' said Michael
Christiansen, 54, the director general of the Royal Danish Theater
who is chairman of the consortium that built the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The collaborative possibilities are inviting, but the divisions
between the two like-minded countries could still stall progress.
Christiansen said he believed that Denmark and Sweden had drawn
farther apart in the last 20 years, and he recalled that at the
time the decision was taken to construct the Oresund link in 1991,
majorities of both populations were against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two areas are like bears just sitting sleeping,'' he said.
``The question is, are they ready to move. We're not quite sure.''

EDITORIAL: EARLY START FOR THE POLITICAL PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Sept. 5:
</P>
<P>
   For some, the year 2000 campaign season is starting one Labor
Day too soon. In this conventional view, all political races,
especially on the presidential level, are overly protracted. The
electoral process wearies the citizenry, we are told. Voters are
said to be tired of a permanent campaign kept on life support by
the news media, political consultants, pollsters and fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point in 1999, New Yorkers and Americans in general
seem to be enjoying a political parade featuring Rudy versus
Hillary, the meteoric rise of the latest Bush and the low-charisma
showdown between Al Gore and Bill Bradley. It may also be that,
especially in the presidential nominating race, there is a good
civic purpose in getting interested early. In six months, it could
be over. In campaign time, that half-year will be shortened by the
holidays in December and the hurrah over the new millennium in
January.
</P>
<P>
   This ``big bang'' theory of presidential primary politics was
created by the vigorous me-first competition among the primary
states. The scramble to be an early primary led to
``front-loading,'' meaning a knot of early primaries tilting the
whole process to the start of the season. The race to be first
became so intense that the New Hampshire Legislature recently
decided to maintain the state's position as the first 2000 primary
even if they had to move their Election Day into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This early cluster of votes has also driven an early stampede of
fund-raising. The Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, is expected to amass more than $50 million by the end of
September, freeing him from public money and its limits. Four years
ago, the eventual Republican nominee, Bob Dole, had raised about
$19 million.
</P>
<P>
   Being early has always counted for something in presidential
politics, although not all early candidates do well on energy
alone. Tennessee's Lamar Alexander, who recently ended his run as a
semipermanent GOP candidate, comes to mind here. More successful
early risers include Jimmy Carter, who locked in the Iowa caucuses
before most voters had even heard he was in the race. Ronald Reagan
started his winning 1980 campaign shortly after he lost the
nomination in 1976. President Clinton's 1996 general election
campaign really began in the summer of 1995, spending mostly soft
money in what ultimately became a $50 million ad campaign. By the
time the Republicans got their act together, it was really too
late.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to Labor Day 1999. This is the time to inspect
the choices. In New York's Senate race, the public might as well
start vetting the candidates, because neither Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani nor first lady Hillary Clinton is likely to be tested by
primary opposition. On the presidential side, it is time to start
asking Bush about more than his youthful cavorting. Potential
voters need to know how he would tackle health care, trade issues,
the next Kosovo. This is also the time to sort out the Democratic
differences between Gore and Bradley. The National Association of
Secretaries of State, one group trying to stop the primary
front-loading, has suggested that each party hold at least one
presidential debate this fall. For this year, at least, that does
not feel too soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ King County Council member Larry Gossett believes
Seattle and its surrounding county have a great secret to share
with the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living here in Martin Luther King Jr. County, and nobody
seems to know it,'' said Gossett, a Democrat. ``When I tell
visitors who this county is named for, I cannot begin to tell you
the joy and excitement that people feel, the surprise and
disbelief, also. It's, `Wow! We didn't know that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the issue of the county's name, which is 147 years
old, is not quite that simple. And a recent proposal by Gossett to
change the county's logo to include a likeness of King, the civil
rights leader who was slain in 1968, has revived a debate over an
unusual action taken by the County Council 13 years ago, when it
officially voted to change the county's namesake, but not its name.
</P>
<P>
   As Council member Chris Vance, a Republican who is skeptical of
Gossett's proposal, put it: ``This county is not named after Martin
Luther King Jr. We all like to pretend it is, but it's really
not.''
</P>
<P>
   King County was originally named in 1852 for William Rufus
Devane King, a slaveholding senator from Alabama who, by all
historical indications, never got anywhere near the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to curry favor in its bid for statehood with the
incoming White House, the Oregon Territorial Legislature gave a
territorial division where Tacoma is located the name Pierce
County, after the new president-elect, Franklin Pierce. And it
named the county to the north after King, the vice president-elect.
</P>
<P>
   King was seriously ill with tuberculosis during the campaign,
and he never even made it to Washington, D.C., for his swearing-in.
He went to Havana, for convalescence, and under a special act of
Congress, he was sworn into office there by the American consul. A
few weeks later, he went to his plantation in Alabama, where he
died on April 18, 1853.
</P>
<P>
   A historian of the nation's No.-2 office, Sol Barzman, once
wrote of King: ``Of all the inglorious and unknown vice presidents,
the 13th must surely lead the list.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remained that the county in which Seattle and a
considerable ring of suburbs are located was named for this
forgettable figure, whom even Vance referred to once as ``William
Rufus Whatever Devane King.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the case until 1986, when the County Council,
on a 5-4 vote, passed a resolution decreeing that King County
should henceforth be considered named for Martin Luther King, not
William King.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over that vote grew a bit raucous, as one opposing
Council member urged her colleagues to ``leave the historical
record alone'' and a few Seattle residents even attended the
Council meeting to speak up for the late Alabamian. One called him
a ``marvelous man'' who cared deeply about adequate housing and
``proper nutrition'' for his slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also said that King County residents believed
that ``the ownership of another human being is an injustice against
humanity'' and indicated that the county did not wish to be named
for a slaveholder anymore. But opponents questioned that part of
the resolution as well, noting that the state of Washington is
itself named for a slaveholder, President George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution had little practical effect, and no change was
made in the county's logo, which, evoking the word ``king,''
depicts a gold crown.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to 1999, and the recent proposal by Gossett, the
only African-American on the 13-member Council, to revise the logo
to include a depiction of the civil rights leader and Nobel Peace
Prize winner.
</P>
<P>
   That means an image of King would appear on the logo, the flag,
on county cars and buses, and on official documents and stationery.
</P>
<P>
   Just how the Council, which consists of seven Republicans and
six Democrats, will handle the matter remains unclear. So far,
there is no strong opposition: Even Vance said he might well vote
in favor of the change _ if it can be phased in to minimize its
cost and if the state Legislature, which he contends is the proper
authority to approve any changes in the county name (or namesake)
to begin with, passes some sort of measure certifying that the
county is, indeed, named for Martin Luther King.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, there does not seem to be wild enthusiasm
for the idea, at least not yet. Several Council members raised the
issue of the cost of the logo change, to pay for things like new
stationery and repainting buses, and noted that the county could be
in for a major round of budget cuts if a controversial statewide
tax-reduction measure known as Initiative 695 is approved by voters
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``As important as symbols are, this could wind up being a very
low priority compared to the delivery of services,'' said Maggi
Fimia, a Democratic Council member. ``The ones that could be most
affected by budget cuts are the very people that Martin Luther King
spoke for.''
</P>
<P>
   And King County Executive Ron Sims, who is black and was a chief
proponent of the namesake change in 1986, is noncommittal on the
proposal as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to take a look at what it all means,'' said a
spokeswoman for Sims, considered a likely candidate for statewide
office in the future. ``Cost is definitely an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gossett is forging ahead, and, as his proposal notes,
changing the logo means that Seattle would fly three flags
representing the community's diversity, with images of ``President
Washington, an Anglo-American; Chief Sealth, a Native American, and
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., an African-American'' on the
state, city and county flags, respectively. There are about 1.7
million people in King County, 5.5 percent of them black.
</P>
<P>
   And even as he frets over the legalities and historical
revisionism involved, Vance concedes that he finds the proposal
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if we could start all over from scratch, I'd wish
this county were named for Martin Luther King Jr.,'' he said.
``Clearly, he's a much more important historical figure, a better
role model, a better symbol for these times than William Rufus
Devane King.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE LEGENDARY LEMON DROP KID LIVES ON THROUGH A
3-YEAR-OLD COLT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Al Capone was sitting in a steambath in Chicago one day when a
stranger struck up a conversation. The stranger talked glowingly of
an impending business deal and said that if mum was the word,
Scarface, er, Al, could make a quick killing, so to speak. All
Capone had to do was lend the stranger $2,000 until later.
</P>
<P>
   Capone gave the man the money, but later he never arrived.
Capone sent two men to locate the con man and bring him back to
Capone's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you pick on me?'' asked the incredulous Capone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pick on you,'' replied the stranger. ``You picked on
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Capone was supposedly so charmed that he called to his wife,
``Mae, set another plate for dinner. We've got a guest.''
</P>
<P>
   The stranger was a man named Harry Morgan, called Swifty, but
better known as the original Lemon Drop Kid, whose namesake, a
3-year-old colt, won the Travers Stakes at Saratoga last Saturday,
earning $600,000, after his triumph in the Belmont Stakes in June.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan flourished from the 1930s to the '60s. Jimmy the Greek,
in his autobiography of the same name, wrote that Morgan was ``one
of the premier con artists of my time, and the time before that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like con men generally, Morgan was a charming extrovert. A man
of wit and dash. A short man's man, a ladies' man, debonaire and
daring. ``It seemed,'' said a friend, producer Dave Siegel, ``that
people liked giving Swifty money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember once we were at a race track and the financier Lou
Wolfson walked by and stuffed $500 in Swifty's pocket,'' Siegel
said. ``He was funny, Swifty was, and fun to be around, and listen
to.'' (The guess here is that Wolfson, rather than be intrigued by
a Swifty scam, took the easy way out.)
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Morgan known among marks and the con cognoscenti,
but the Kid had also been featured on stage, screen and in
literature. The short story ``The Lemon Drop Kid'' by Damon Runyon
related the tale of a race-track tout.
</P>
<P>
   In the story, Runyon wrote that the Kid's tales were compelling
even to ``prominent citizens,'' ``especially if the tale has any
larceny in it, because it is only human nature to be deeply
interested in larceny.''
</P>
<P>
   Runyon's short story was later made into a movie starring Bob
Hope as Swifty (who snacked from an ever-present bag of lemon drops
in his pocket). The Kid was also a featured character in Runyon's
``Guys and Dolls,'' and in the autobiographical movie of Joe E.
Lewis, ``The Joker Is Wild,'' starring Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   When Sinatra, struggling to make a comeback in the early 1950s,
was producing ``Joker,'' he asked Swifty how much money he wanted
for rights to use his character. Swifty said with magnanimity and
foresight, ``Take care of me when you can.'' Sinatra did, for many
years paying for a room for him in the exclusive Beverly Wilshire.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Vance, owner of the current Lemon Drop Kid, said she had
admired a show horse in the 1950s named Lemon Drop Kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was named for the character in the Runyon story,'' she
said. ``I thought that my horse resembled the other not in color _
the first one was a chestnut, mine's a bay _ but in personality.
They're both kind, but don't push 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Vance said she did not know the original, Swifty Morgan. But
this correspondent had made his acquaintance, as the saying goes.
It was in a nursing home in Los Angeles in 1975. The Kid was then
91 years old, lying in the middle of three beds in the convalescent
room. He was small and frail and on public welfare. He wore a
little white beard, and had few teeth left, but his eyes were still
alert.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the time he asked actor George Raft for a pair of
his initialed cuff links on loan. Raft agreed, though he didn't
know why Swifty wanted them. That night, Raft had a date with a
rich woman. Swifty showed up at their table, and when Raft excused
himself for a moment Swifty sold the woman the ``GR'' cuff links so
she could give them to George as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   But for a man who lived with the elan he had, who had traveled
first class to Europe and back 38 times on ocean liners, it must
have been an indignity to be told that he must use toilet paper
instead of the more costly tissue paper to wipe his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Swifty had learned to make the best of any situation. At one
point in my visit, he pointed to the fire extinguisher on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open that bottle of Scotch and take a drink,'' said the Lemon
Drop Kid, with customary charm. ``Pour one for the nurse, too.''
</P>
<P>
   While Swifty Morgan is no longer with us, he would have surely
enjoyed knowing that the Lemon Drop Kid is still having his way at
the track.

``outside agitators'' and leaders of Mexico's Zapatista rebels.
Bruised and terrified, the three were finally let go. The chilling
incident near this remote rebel stronghold has fueled fear that
anti-Zapatista vigilantes loyal to Mexico's ruling party are on the
rise in spite of a truce. In addition, Rangel, a volunteer doctor,
said Mexican soldiers just 100 meters from where she was attacked
did nothing to help her and the two Spaniards. One soldier, she

EDITORIAL: DAMAGING DELAY ON A TEST BAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Sept. 5:
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996 was a
triumph for U.S. diplomacy. Its provisions, which prohibit all
atmospheric and underground nuclear tests, would lock in the United
States' current technological lead, prevent China from testing
advanced new weapons designs and block non-nuclear countries that
have signed the treaty from conducting future nuclear tests. It
would also put increased pressure on countries that have not yet
signed, like India and Pakistan, to avoid further testing and to
accept the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The 152 countries that have signed the treaty are all abiding by
its terms. But the agreement becomes legally binding only when
ratified by a list of 44 countries, including all current nuclear
powers. Only 21 of these countries have ratified so far.
Perversely, the United States, which has the most to gain from the
treaty achieving legal force, is among the holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Senate Republicans have held ratification
hostage to their own competing agenda of missile defense. No
defensive system yet exists that can reliably protect the United
States against incoming missile attack. The Clinton administration
has agreed to spend $4 billion over the next six years on research
and testing for a limited missile defense system and has set aside
a further $6.6 billion for possible construction. It is also
negotiating with Russia on changes in the 1972 Antiballistic
Missile Treaty to permit expanded missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not been enough for the Republicans, especially the
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms. He
wants his committee to delay taking up the test ban treaty until
the administration submits two other agreements that the
administration does not yet have the votes to pass _ an earlier set
of amendments to the 1972 ABM treaty and the completely unrelated
Kyoto treaty on global warming. That timetable would further
needlessly delay the test ban treaty and could even risk unraveling
it as other countries lose patience with the Senate's stalling.
</P>
<P>
   The test ban treaty, endorsed by America's top military
commander and the directors of the nation's nuclear weapons
laboratories, should be ratified promptly on its own merits. The
Republican leadership needs to show greater responsibility on this
issue. Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, should insist that
Helms put ratification on the Foreign Relations Committee's
calendar early this month.
</P>
<P>
   That would give the full Senate a chance to act in time for the
United States to take part in an important review conference
scheduled for October. A successful conference would encourage
India and Pakistan to join the treaty. Russia and China, the other
nuclear powers that have not yet ratified, are more likely to do so
once Washington does. Ratifying the test ban treaty would reduce
nuclear dangers around the world. Helms and his fellow Republicans
should stop holding it up.

CLINTON URGES CONGRESS TO ACT ON BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fighting any suggestions of a lame-duck presidency,
Bill Clinton challenged Republicans Saturday to approve an
ambitious fall agenda that includes gun-control proposals, a
patients' bill of rights and measures to fix up old schools, hire
more teachers and end the practice of promoting children to the
next grade even if they are failing.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton cast the Congress, which
returns to Washington after Labor Day, as sitting on all of these
matters while the nation waits.
</P>
<P>
   He made the argument most pointedly on the matter of gun
control. Noting that nearly five months have passed since the
school shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, Clinton
said: ``I'm still waiting, and America is still waiting, for
Congress to act. It shouldn't take another tragedy to shake them
from the summer slumber.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would send a letter Saturday to the Republican
leaders in Congress urging them to approve ``a balanced, bipartisan
juvenile crime bill that closes the gun-show loophole, requires
child safety locks for guns, and bans the importation of
large-capacity ammunition clips.''
</P>
<P>
   As the presidential campaign begins to heat up, many candidates
are putting education at the top of their agendas, and Clinton is
staking out the same turf. He taped his radio address at the
Waterman Elementary School in Skaneateles, N.Y.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHY SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS THE CRUCIAL ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BRENT STAPLES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The civil rights movement had made spectacular gains in the
courts _ including Brown vs. Board of Education _ before Rosa Parks
galvanized public opinion in a way that lawsuits had not. Ms. Parks
became an emblematic figure when she was arrested in Montgomery,
Ala., for refusing to sit in the ``colored only'' section of a bus.
The sight of this dignified woman being denied the simplest
courtesy because she was black crystallized the dehumanizing nature
of segregation and rallied people against it.
</P>
<P>
   Racism began to wane as white Americans were introduced to
members of the black minority whom they could identify as ``just
like us.'' A similar introduction is underway for gay Americans,
but the realization that they are ``just like us'' has yet to sink
in. When it finally does, the important transitional figures will
include state Rep. Steve May, a 27-year-old Republican from
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   May is a solid conservative who supports issues like vouchers
and charter schools. He was raised a Mormon and recalls himself as
the kid who ``had to go out and bring in the wayward souls.'' He is
also a former active-duty soldier and an Army reservist whose
record shows that he could have moved up swiftly and been given a
command.
</P>
<P>
   But May is about to be hounded out of the Reserve for publicly
admitting that he loves and shares his life with another man. This
acknowledgment came last winter during a heated exchange in the
Arizona Legislature over a bill that would have barred counties
from offering domestic-partner benefits, stripping them from gay
couples who currently enjoy them.
</P>
<P>
   May could have sat quietly, protecting his career. Instead he
exposed the provision as bigoted and told the Arizona House: ``It
is an attack on my family, an attack on my freedom. ... My gay tax
dollars are the same as your straight tax dollars. If you are not
going to treat me fairly, stop taking my tax dollars. ... I'm not
asking foB the right to marry, but I'd like to ask this Legislature
to leave my family alone.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rosa Parks declined to yield her seat on that bus, she was
telling Alabama that she was not just a colored person, but a human
being who deserved the respect and protection of the law. May's
words in the Arizona House were similarly clarifying. Fearful of a
backlash, gay politicians rarely mention their mates in public _
and shy away from speaking of them in terms that might disturb even
constituents who know that they are gay. But by framing his
argument in the context of ``the family,'' May disarmed his bigoted
colleagues and took the debate on same-sex unions exactly where it
needed to go.
</P>
<P>
   When May's comments became public, the Army Reserve began an
investigation that legal experts say will certainly end in
discharge. May will then become a casualty of ``don't ask, don't
tell,'' which ended more than 1,100 military careers in 1998, on
the grounds that homosexuals who reveal the fact are no longer fit
to serve.
</P>
<P>
   This is a staggering loss at a time when the armed services are
canvassing strip malls and lowering entrance requirements to find
personnel. By the time this policy is abandoned, thousands of
talented Americans will have been lost to a purge that will come to
be recognized as contrary to the public good and morally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans began the 1990s refusing campaign contributions from
gay organizations and demonizing homosexuals for political gain.
But in the race for 2000, the most prominent candidates are
accepting the money and say that they would hire gay workers as
long as they refrained from pressing ``a gay agenda'' _ a code
phrase for keeping quiet about issues of same-sex intimacy, up to
and including marriage. The trouble with this approach is that
legitimacy for same-sex unions is the heart of the matter. By
denying that legitimacy, we declare gay love less valid than
heterosexual love and gay people less human. We cut them off from
the rituals of family and marriage that bind us together as a
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The legislator who wished to revoke benefits from same-sex
partners in Arizona viewed those partnerships as culturally alien
and morally illegitimate. The military establishment may force May
out of the service _ despite an exemplary record _ because his
family consists of two men who are indistinguishable from their
neighbors, except that they sleep together.
</P>
<P>
   This persecution finds a parallel in statutes that made it
illegal for blacks and whites to get married up until 1967, when
the Supreme Court declared the laws unconstitutional. The laws were
based on the primitive belief that blacks and whites were set apart
on the tree of life by God Himself. Interracial couples were
initially seen as a threat to the social order and to the
institution of marriage. Over time, the culture began to discard
the filter of race, viewing the couples as ``just like the rest of
us.'' The same process will probably work out for same-sex couples
_ but only after an extended battle. When the matter is settled,
historians will look back at people like Steve May, who declined to
go quietly to the back of the American bus.

LOS ANGELES LOSES DUBIOUS DISTINCTION: WORST SUMMER SMOG DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A brown haze persistently shrouds the downtown
skyline, an ever-present reminder of the pollution that chokes this
city. But this year residents are breathing a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades _ going back at least 25 years to
when records were first kept _ there have been no full-blown smog
alerts in the four-county South Coast Air Basin, and the area has
relinquished its hold on having the worst smog day of the summer.
That title went to Texas City, Texas, which was followed closely by
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of the long-term trend of reducing
emissions from all sources as well as the weather,'' said Sam
Atwood, a spokesman with the South Coast Air Quality Management
District, the pollution control agency that covers two-thirds of
Los Angeles County, all of Orange County and the western sections
of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. ``This summer, unlike the
rest of the country, has been pretty darn nice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, that means relatively cool with few temperature
inversions that trap the gases that help make the region the
smoggiest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice news for people that breathe in Los Angeles. They
deserve a break,'' said Felicia Marcus, administrator for the
Environmental Protection Agency region that includes California.
``But it's not something I would get that excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles still has the worst air in the country, exceeding
the federal standard regulating ozone, or smog, on 62 days this
year as of Sept. 1. Still, there has been a steady decline of air
pollutants in the region.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Environmental Protection Agency found that
Texas City, about 30 miles east of Houston, had the highest
one-hour concentration of ozone, which is created when hydrocarbons
and nitrogen oxides are heated by sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Texas City, which had a one-hour concentration of ozone of .206
parts per million, was followed closely by Houston. Then came
Westport, Conn.; Galveston, Texas; White Plains, N.Y., and
Crestline, Calif., in the Los Angeles region. Federal health
standards mandate that the ozone concentration be no more than .120
parts per million, with health advisories issued when the level
reaches .150 and a Stage 1 alert at .200.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from this year, the Los Angeles basin typically leads the
country in both the number of bad air days and the worst day.
</P>
<P>
   The South Coast Basin faces serious challenges when it comes to
air pollution. It has more cars traveling more miles than in any
other part of the country, in a warm, sunny environment that
fosters the creation of smog. The problem is complicated further by
the basin's geography, with mountains on three inland sides.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the population between 1980 and 1997 increased
37 percent to more than 14 million. The number of miles being
traveled on roadways increased 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those increases, the South Coast Basin has been able to
reduce emissions significantly, leading to decreases in ozone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take credit and be pleased with the progress we've
made,'' said Tim Carmichael, executive director of the Coalition
for Clean Air, an environmental group based in Los Angeles. ``We
also have to remember we're a long way from clean air, and it's
going to take considerable effort from individuals as well as
businesses to get clean air in this region and, for that matter,
all the metropolitan regions of this country.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TAKING THE MENTAL SUBWAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not that New Yorkers need any excuse to indulge in feverish
hyperbole, but we are discussing a Subway Series as if it were our
divine right.
</P>
<P>
   The very phrase ``Subway Series'' tells you everything you need
to know about New Yorkers. We are the center of the universe. You
got a problem with that?
</P>
<P>
   Here we are in very early September and the Mets have no
guarantee that they will hold on to a wild-card position, what with
six games left against Atlanta. And the subway doesn't run to
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no wonder people are excited. New York has not come this
close to a Subway Series since 1956, because when the Mets were up,
the Yankees were generally down, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   The general assumption from old geezers (that is to say, anybody
six months older than me) is that baseball was better back in 1949
through 1956, when there were six _ count 'em, six _ Subway Series.
</P>
<P>
   Back in those glory days, legend has it, New Yorkers congregated
jovially on street corners and argued the relative merits of
Charlie Silvera, Sal Yvars and Rube Walker (second-string catchers;
you thought I was going to resort to the Mickey-Willie-and-the-Duke
cliche?).
</P>
<P>
   My own opinion about a 1999 Subway Series is that it would beat
anything from that hallowed age. It says here that the collective
buzz from the goofy guys making asinine puns on the television
sports centers and the new breed of yappers on talk radio (Imagine:
``Dawg, dey gotta get dat Hodges outta dere. He's killin' duh
Dodgers!'') and the blizzard of sites on the Web would whip New
York into a baseball frenzy it has never seen.
</P>
<P>
   Real New Yorkers with no particular affinity for baseball would
nevertheless be flicking Mets or Yankees ball caps onto their
noggins faster than some carpetbagger senatorial candidate.
</P>
<P>
   People would get all pumped about a Subway Series, because they
would be instructed that it is huge.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that kids in New York would experience a
smaller portion of the Subway Series than we did when they played
the World Series in daylight in early October. (Which is why they
call them the good old days.) We would rush home from school and
catch the last four or five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the geniuses who run baseball start World Series games
after 8 p.m. Eastern time, even when Eastern teams (Toronto and
Philadelphia, Cleveland and Florida, Atlanta and the Yankees) are
playing. Given the wretched four-hour trudge of baseball games
these days, this guarantees that New York kids would be nodding off
by the fourth inning, and would never get to see Mariano Rivera
pitching to John Olerud with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The kids would have to play catch-up in the morning,
understanding that a Subway Series is special, even if cleverly put
beyond their bedtimes by baseball's marketeers.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand the sense of entitlement in New York. From
1921 through 1956, there were 13 Subway Series involving the
Yankees and either the Giants or the Dodgers. Chicago, by contrast,
has had exactly one Subway Series _ in 1906 _ and had to resort to
inventing Michael Jordan to make up for this deficit. Philadelphia
and Boston have subways but never had a Subway Series when they had
two teams. The Bay Area had a Bay Area Rapid Transit series in 1989
that was so good, the earth shook.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and what was the first World Series totally west of the
Mississippi River? Trick question. It was the Browns and the
Cardinals in 1944. And St. Louis did not have a subway back then.
</P>
<P>
   Given the history, you can understand why New Yorkers
automatically think Cleveland and Arizona and all those other
poseurs are going to fall flat into a swoon. A Subway Series may
not be inevitable, but there is every reason to think the earth
would shake. The Subway Series is a big deal, although it does
require a certain amount of masochism to dredge up personal
memories from the golden age.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, I was a tyke raking leaves li3tening to Red Barber on
the radio when Cookie Lavagetto broke up Bill Bevens' no-hitter
with a game-winning double. I was too young to remember who won
that Series.
</P>
<P>
   I do remember the 1949 Series, rushing home from school to hear
Tommy Henrich's game-winning homer off Don Newcombe, but the rest
of the Series is a blur.
</P>
<P>
   My 1951 memories are stuck on Oct. 3, the single most epic
baseball game played between New York teams. Maybe it wasn't a
Subway Series, but it surely was judgment day.
</P>
<P>
   All of 34,320 fans bought their way into the Polo Grounds as the
Giants played the Dodgers in the third game of the National League
playoff. That's right. There were 20,000 empty seats that weekday
afternoon, although a dozen collectors will sell you Bobby
Thomson's home run ball, complete with Ralph Branca's fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Giants fans and Dodgers fans fought over that game, while Yankee
fans, perennially smug, sat back and said, wasn't it a shame about
Don Mueller's broken ankle and the chewed-up Giant pitching staff?
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, I vaguely recall Billy Martin making a racing catch of
Jackie Robinson's elusive popup in the seventh inning of the
seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, my father got me a ticket for my first World Series
game. Seated in the center-field bleachers of Ebbets Field, I saw
Mickey Mantle's grand slam get bigger and bigger and bigger. ...
aw, forget it.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 4, 1955, I was benched at halftime so I sat on the
Jamaica High bench at Bushwick High in Brooklyn and listened to
bells going off all over the borough of churches. Finally, there
was a Subway Series in which the good guys won.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, I listened to a car radio as Dale Mitchell took a
called third strike to complete Don Larsen's perfect game. From my
perfect vantage point, that ball was outside the strike zone.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They haven't had a Subway Series since, which makes New Yorkers
fantasize in this season of Derek Jeter and Robin Ventura, this
year of El Duque and Fonzie.
</P>
<P>
   Subway Series? Given the fat-cat profile of people who wangle
strips of expensive tickets for the World Series, this will be a
limousine series. But alliteration is nice, so go with it. Subway
Series.

ON RUSSIAN TV, 2 NEWSMEN DUEL IN POLITICAL POWER PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Refiling to include photo advisory. No other change.)  (js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If television is, as it increasingly seems to be, the
weapon of choice in Russia's intense and ugly political battles,
then Sunday night will offer Russian viewers, on two of the
country's major channels, a journalistic rendition of ``Gunfight at
the OK Corral.''
</P>
<P>
   ORT, Russia's largest TV channel, is controlled by Boris A.
Berezovsky, a financier, media baron and close ally of President
Boris Yeltsin. It will start a weekly news program whose host,
Sergei Dorenko, is an anchorman with the reputation of an attack
dog. He has in the past used his air time to tear political
opponents to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   Dorenko goes head-to-head with Yevgeny Kiselyov, a journalist
with a studied, more ponderous style, who is host of ``Itogi,'' or
``News,'' a long-running weekly program broadcast by NTV. An
independent channel, it is controlled by the media magnate Vladimir
Gusinsky, who in recent months has openly broken ranks with
Yeltsin's dwindling team.
</P>
<P>
   In another nation, competition on a Sunday at 9 p.m. might be
seen as the start of a ratings tussle. In Russia, with legislative
and then presidential elections over the next nine months, the
``mano a mano'' between Dorenko and Kiselyov is the latest skirmish
in a media war that has at least as much to do with power as it
does with viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty fierce because the competition exists on several
levels,'' said Sergei Markov, director of the Institute of
Political Studies. ``It is a competition between two journalists,
between two TV channels, between media magnates, all this against
the background of a battle between the existing party of power and
the future party of power.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 both television channels and their owners were solidly
behind Yeltsin's re-election campaign. In those days, as Dorenko
recalled in an interview, the stations scheduled their news
programs to avoid competition. The result, he noted, was all
Yeltsin, all the time, ``until the viewer was ready to hang
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the competition between Russia's two main media
groups has turned into a blood sport, not unlike the political
battle now shaping up between the Kremlin and its newly emerged
rival, a coalition headed by Yuri M. Luzhkov, Moscow's mayor, and
former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. In both media and politics,
the stakes are very high.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Luzhkov wins, then ORT will exist but without Berezovsky,''
Markov said. ``If the Kremlin is able to undermine the
Primakov-Luzhkov march to power, then NTV will exist, but under
different control.''
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's election year gets off to a running start, efforts
to police _ some say harass _ the media have become more blatant.
Last month officials from the Moscow fire department issued an
order to shut down the offices of Kommersant, a daily paper
recently bought by Berezovsky, in a move that the paper's new
editor said was driven by Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the Press Ministry pulled the plug on a TV station in
St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, after it failed to
respond to a warning about a program that savagely mocked a rally
organized by liberal politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is a powerful weapon,'' Kiselyov said in an
interview last week. ``And it can produce unexpected results.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kiselyov was talking about the ``Itogi'' program broadcast in
May, when he shocked the Russian political elite with a full-scale
assault on the Yeltsin administration.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking an unspoken taboo in the liberal media, he described it
as the Family, until then an insiders' code word. It refers to a
small group that includes most notably Yeltsin's daughter and
political adviser, Tatyana Dyachenko, Berezovsky and Berezovsky's
business associate, Roman Abramovich, who is described as the
Family's cashier.
</P>
<P>
   On that program Kiselyov described how the Family, in a
bald-faced power play, had handpicked appointees to Russia's latest
Cabinet. ``It was so open, so cynical, so outrageous that it was a
slap in the face of public opinion,'' Kiselyov said. ``It was like
Caligula when he went to the Roman Senate and presented a horse as
his successor.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after this, the war between NTV, controlled by
Gusinsky, and ORT, backed by Berezovsky and the Kremlin, moved out
into the open. All of a sudden, a government-controlled bank
recalled a $60 million outstanding loan to Media Most, the
Gusinsky-controlled media group. In newspaper interviews, a top
Yeltsin aide vowed to teach Gusinsky a lesson; Kiselyov, at a
conference, urged the aide, Alexander Voloshin, to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the heat has since gone out of the Kremlin's attacks on
Media Most, and according to news reports the disputed $60 million
loan was successfully renegotiated. But the television war is still
on.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin is again on the defensive, fending off corruption
charges now under investigation in Switzerland. And it is now that
Berezovsky has chosen to bring out his heavy artillery _ Dorenko, a
39-year-old Zen and motorcycle enthusiast who clearly relishes his
role as the enfant terrible of Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers remember him for his investigation of Anatoly Chubais,
the former privatization chief (and Berezovsky foe), and for his
attempt, on air, to examine the size of the skulls of top Communist
Party leaders, as alleged proof of their supposedly subhuman
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Dorenko has many enemies _ some of them, he
asserts, inside the Kremlin, where he says he is remembered for
repeated references to the president as a baboon. But his loyalty
to Berezovsky is unquestioned. He says that he speaks with
Berezovsky almost daily, and that he has twice been a guest at
Berezovsky's villa in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   Dorenko's stunts and aggressive style have also won him a
popular following, particularly in Russia's distant regions, where
he says some polls have shown that he is more trusted than the
Russian Orthodox Church. However, he admits that in Moscow,
Kiselyov's ratings are higher than his.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is more popular with the elite, I agree,'' Dorenko said.
``The elite thinks Kiselyov is one of them, a member of the
corporation. But the electorate believes me, not him, which is why
the elite fears me.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kiselyov and Dorenko insist that they themselves have no
stake in Russia's political fight, and that their programs will
provide neutral coverage of events in Russia, a full menu including
everything from an open-ended war in the Caucasus to the unfolding
scandals linking the Kremlin and the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   For Russia's political junkies, the question will be which of
the two programs to watch live. ``Mostly I will probably watch
Dorenko,'' Markov said. ``I think I know what Kiselyov will say.
But Dorenko is a killer, and harder to predict.''
</P>

ON BASEBALL: HANDS-ON EXECUTIVE RAISES METS' PROFILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steve Phillips is easy to find on the field before
the Mets play at Shea Stadium and easier to find in Manager Bobby
Valentine's office after games. The general manager is predictable
in these ways and in how he likes to maintain control and keep
track of what is lurking ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Phillips will initiate interviews even if no
reporters request one. He takes pains to wait for virtually every
reporter to assemble before he speaks. It is part of the way
Phillips assures that his voice, not Bob Murphy's, is the voice of
the Mets (with some room for utterances from Valentine).
</P>
<P>
   These are rewarding times for Phillips, who helped mold the Mets
into an impressive team that should qualify for the postseason for
the first time since 1988. The Mets have the best infield in the
major leagues. They have one of the best bullpens. They have
superstars in Mike Piazza, Robin Ventura and the still-improving
Edgardo Alfonzo, and they have a manager whose decisions in games
are well conceived.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Mets have a general manager who is shrewd and
who has put them in position to snare a World Series. Phillips
constantly praised his scouts and his assistants as he reviewed the
moves that have worked splendidly in 1999, but he was being too
humble. If Ventura were batting .220 or Alfonzo flopped at second
or Rickey Henderson strained another hamstring, the scouts would
not be roasted. Phillips would be. When the Mets are lauded,
Phillips deserves plaudits, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to watch now,'' Phillips said. ``But at this point,
you don't take the games personally. You take them for the
organization. I think that's the way everybody feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten months ago, in the midst of revamping the Mets, Phillips
could not be sure if he would ever be part of the results. He had
larger issues. Phillips had to take a leave of absence to deal with
an allegation of a sexual harassment and the repercussions of a
series of extramarital affairs. It was a painful time for Phillips
and his wife, Marni, and an awkward time for the Mets, who brought
back Frank Cashen, their former general manager, to handle
Phillips' duties.
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-day leave in which Phillips underwent ``extensive
personal counseling'' and admitted that he had caused ``a
significant wound in my family life,'' he returned. But Phillips
emphasized that his return did not mean his family situations had
been mended and admitted that it would be a ``lengthy process''
with uncertain results.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips does not want to elaborate on the process or the
results. With the Mets churning toward games in October, Phillips
was asked if he felt good about making it back to this point after
such a public display of his personal problems. The man who speaks
in paragraphs edited himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preference is not to comment on it,'' Phillips said. ``It
just opens it up completely. I regret having answered a question
about it a couple of months ago, and I don't think I want to go
back down that road.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Phillips' prerogative. Those issues are really between
him and his wife. It is hoped, for their sake, they have found
peace and somehow strengthened their relationship. It is hoped that
these are happier times.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips started the Mets' off-season by aggressively pursuing
Piazza and then signing him to a seven-year, $91 million contract.
The Mets probably overpaid, but Piazza meant more to them than he
would have to any other team. They had to have him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it really has helped change the perception of the
organization,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Once Piazza suddenly fell in love with New York, some other
crucial pieces were added. The Mets signed Al Leiter and Dennis
Cook, and they used Todd Hundley to obtain Armando Benitez from
Baltimore and Roger Cedeno from Los Angeles in a three-team trade.
When Hundley's aching elbow prevented him from playing much as a
catcher in the spring, Phillips looked smart for not clinging to
him.
</P>
<P>
   A day after trading Hundley, the Mets made perhaps the best
free-agent signing of this season or any other by giving Ventura a
four-year, $32 million deal. It enabled the Mets to switch Alfonzo
to second base, where his offensive numbers glow, and gave them a
Gold Glove third baseman with a sweet swing. Both Alfonzo and
Ventura are serious candidates for the Most Valuable Player Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it ended up falling for us and the way that we ended
up being configured, it couldn't have worked out any better,''
Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Some other additions have produced, from Henderson to Pat
Mahomes to Orel Hershiser. Phillips also acquired Darryl Hamilton,
Kenny Rogers, Shawon Dunston, Chuck McElroy and Billy Taylor for
the pennant push, which is three good and two bad. Instead of
getting Bobby Bonilla for Mel Rojas, Phillips should have eaten
Rojas' contract.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is difficult to watch the Mets and not see Phillips'
influence. This is Valentine's team, but it is the team Phillips
was instrumental in giving him and the team they discuss in the
manager's office after each game. You can count on it. Phillips
will be there.

JETS HOPING REPLACEMENTS FOR CHREBET CATCH ON FAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now the Jets will find out about their depth.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six weeks of the season, they will be without
Wayne Chrebet, their 1,000-yard receiver, who broke a bone in his
left foot Friday during the Jets' final preseason game, a 38-17
victory over the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells had been hoping to use the game to assess
the squad's depth and determine who the No. 2 quarterback would be.
He probably decided the quarterback issue when Rick Mirer directed
four touchdown drives after replacing Vinny Testaverde at the start
of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' backup wide receivers, Quinn Early and Dwight Stone,
produced big performances, each catching a touchdown pass from
Mirer.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer, Early and Stone were signed within the last month _
filling potential holes that Parcells, also the team's general
manager, had worried about. Faster than he expected, each player
has become important.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet's injury means that Dedric Ward will join Keyshawn
Johnson as a starting receiver, said Parcells, whose post-game
comments on Chrebet were terse. Parcells does not dwell on
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet never missed a game in his previous four seasons, and
had formed a durable, formidable duo with the irrepressible
Johnson. The injury occurred as Chrebet was trying to change
direction, just slightly, in the opening quarter. He was running on
the Giants Stadium artificial turf, which was being used the first
time this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's game, the Jets and the Giants had agreed to play
the preseason on a grass surface that is being considered for
regular-season use next year. The artificial surface was back in
play since that is what will be used starting next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet broken the fifth metatarsal in his left foot. He limped
off the field by himself, but was soon visited in the locker room
by his parents. Saturday, a screw was surgically implanted to help
repair the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Ward conceded after the game that he is not familiar with some
of the receiving routes Chrebet had run so well. Nor does Ward have
Chrebet's blocking talent or his proven ability to catch in a crowd
_ especially in the clutch. Chrebet is perennially among the league
leaders in third-down receptions.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ward is the team's big-play receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to use every weapon we can,'' he said. ``I'm very
confident I can do the things it takes to become a starting
receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Early and Stone will at least provide options that will enable
the offensive coordinator, Charlie Weis, to keep the defenses
guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 34-year-old Early is listed as Johnson's backup, he
said he has also played Chrebet's flanker position. On Friday, his
three receptions included a 74-yard score from Mirer.
</P>
<P>
   Early said he went into the game thinking that he needed to
impress his teammates. ``I'm an older player, and they might wonder
whether I still have it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Did he believe he had proved he still had it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, 35, also snared three passes, one a 24-yard touchdown
from Mirer.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer directed touchdowns in the three drives he led in the
third quarter, added another score in the fourth and then relaxed
as Ray Lucas did mop-up duty.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he liked Mirer's mobility (he had an 18-yard
scamper), but said he did not like something Mirer had done on one
play. He would not be more specific than that.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer benefited from having the first-team offensive line in
front of him against many of the Vikings' second-stringers. He
completed 5 of 8 passes for 145 yards and 3 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet's injury means the Jets will be missing two starters for
their home opener next Sunday against the New England Patriots.
Right cornerback Otis Smith remains sidelined with a broken
collarbone. Inside linebacker Marvin Jones did not play Friday as
he recovered from a sprained ankle, but he is expected to suit up
for the opener.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jets showed a marked improvement in punt returns. For the
first time in the preseason, LEON JOHNSON broke a pair for
double-digit yardage. His long return was for 42 yards. Johnson
also amassed 56 rushing yards on 11 carries.
</P>
<P>
   _ In winding up the preseason with a 3-1 record, the Jets have
made it three straight winning summers. Before Coach BILL PARCELLS'
arrival in 1997, the Jets never put together successive winning
exhibition seasons. They are 10-2 under Parcells, whose overall
exhibition record is 45-16.
</P>
<P>
   _ With 3-for-3 field-goal kicking, JOHN HALL finished 8 for 10
in the preseason.

BACKING PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS; MCCAIN'S BOOK; HISPANICS AND
REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif., Texas, N.M.)  (js) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCKS, THEN BACKING TO BUSH CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   The money just keeps on rolling in for George W. Bush, close to
$50 million now, or more than any other presidential candidate has
ever raised, even figuring in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   But money isn't the only thing that the Texas governor is piling
up. Endorsements by top elected officials around the country are
also rolling in, too, especially endorsements by governors and
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   By the Bush campaign's count, 23 of the 31 Republican governors
(24 including the candidate) have come out in support of Bush,
along with 169 of the 277 Republicans in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, even though Election Day is still more than a
year off, Bush already has won the support of roughly two of every
three Republican governors and Republican members of Congress. The
other Republican presidential candidates can claim only a handful
of endorsements _ all added together.
</P>
<P>
   So how does the endorsement game go over on the Democratic side
for Vice President Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere near as well.
</P>
<P>
   He is leagues ahead of his only Democratic challenger, former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, just as Bush is leagues ahead of
his Republican challengers. But equally important, who is the
stronger candidate within his own party?
</P>
<P>
   Bush, going away.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Gore lags Bush in polls of the grass roots, he also lags
Bush in winning early top-level endorsements. By his latest count,
he has commitments from only 6 of 17 Democratic governors and only
69 of the 256 congressional Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, while Bush has the support of more than
two-thirds of all Republican governors and members of Congress,
Gore has the support of less than one-third of all Democratic
governors and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Political pros say that such top-level endorsements seldom sway
a lot of votes down below. But endorsements are nevertheless
important because the officials often follow up by putting their
own political organizations to work for the favored candidates. ``I
believe in endorsements,'' Tony Coelho, Gore's campaign chairman,
said the other day. ``I don't believe in anything else. They're
tremendous validators.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Gore plans to make a high-profile push in coming
months to add as many endorsements as possible, not just more from
top elected officials but also from ethnic leaders and leaders of
major national organizations, like labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is trying to take the early-commitment race to another
level.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, on a trip to Des Moines, he collected the
endorsements of 31 of the 56 Republicans in the Iowa House and 16
of the 30 Republicans in the Iowa Senate.
</P>
<P>
   NO SALT NEEDED WITH MCCAIN BOOK
</P>
<P>
   One of the hoary givens in presidential politics is that any
book by a candidate that comes out at campaign time, especially an
autobiography or memoir, should be read with a full shaker of salt
nearby, or maybe not at all. The sole aim of such books, of course,
is to sell the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Faith of My Fathers,'' the newly published ``family
memoir'' by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is seeking the
Republican nomination and who, before getting into politics in 1982
was a Navy pilot for 22 years, spending five and a half of them
enduring torture and privation in North Vietnamese prisons after
being shot down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith of My Fathers'' (Random House) is a book about strong
character _ the strong character of McCain's father and
grandfather, both Naval heroes, and the strong character McCain saw
displayed by fellow pilots while in prison in Hanoi. His own strong
character also becomes evident in the book _ over the years, other
survivors of the ordeal have described him as among the toughest of
the tough _ but he modestly insists he was no hero, only ``among
heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally evident about McCain is this: As he sees Election 2000,
strong character is what Americans now long for most in their
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The early buzz in both political and publishing circles is that
``Faith of My Fathers'' just might be the exception in campaign
books, the self-serving tome that not only is a well-turned good
read but also has enough modesty, warts-and-all honesty and genuine
substance to maybe give the candidate a boost. A review by
Publishers Weekly says ``Faith of My Fathers'' is ``too good to be
dismissed as simply another campaign book'' and Kirkus Reviews
calls it ``impressive and inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   When you're hot, you're hot, in politics as in publishing, so
come Tuesday McCain will set off on a 17-day national tour to
promote his book (read, candidacy), trying to not only increase
sales but also the growing perception among some political pros
that he might be best positioned to pick up the Republican gonfalon
should George W. Bush somehow falter. In between stops at book
stores from New York to Los Angeles, he will show up on just about
all of the big early-morning, mid-afternoon and late-evening news
and talk shows, as well as on local news and talk shows without
number.
</P>
<P>
   Many asked him to appear. Usually with such book tours, it's the
other way around.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; REPUBLICAN SEEKING HISPANIC CANDIDATES &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The nation's 31 million Hispanic people now account for almost
11 percent of its population, and more and more of them are voting.
In the past five years, according to the Southwest Voter
Registration Education Project in San Antonio, the registration of
Hispanic voters has increased almost 30 percent nationwide, while
registration in general around the country has increased only 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-dozen or so states, the Hispanic vote is at or near
the point that when it is cohesive, it can tip a close election.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade or so, Democratic candidates have gotten
more of the Hispanic vote than Republican candidates, and Hispanic
Democrats have fared better as candidates than have Hispanic
Republicans. For example, there are now 18 Hispanic Democrats in
Congress but only three Hispanic Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans took heart after the 1998 elections. Though the
Hispanic vote went against them in the biggest state, California,
where Republicans had led several efforts to toughen immigration
restrictions, Republican candidates won heavy Hispanic backing when
they actively went after it.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, that backing helped Gov. George W. Bush win
re-election in Texas and it helped his brother, Jeb, capture the
governor's office in Florida. Further, in Arizona the Hispanic vote
helped another Republican, Sen. John McCain, win re-election
easily.
</P>
<P>
   One of McCain's Southwestern neighbors, Sen. Pete Domenici of
New Mexico, says it is now time for Republicans to begin fielding
more Hispanic candidates rather than concentrating mainly on
getting Hispanics to vote for non-Hispanic Republicans. He contends
that in the past the party has paid little more than lip service to
recruitment of Hispanic candidates and has lost much Hispanic
support as a result.
</P>
<P>
   So a few days ago, he announced the formation of Pete's PAC, a
political action committee that will help finance Hispanic
Republican campaigns around the country for national, state and
local offices. His hope, he said, is to raise $300,000 for the PAC
by early next year, probably not an insurmountable goal given that
he is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics need to be encouraged to run,'' Domenici said.

   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ Last week was a strange one for Chappaqua,
where life usually revolves around train schedules, soccer
practice, book clubs and cocktail parties.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, there was a frisson of excitement when
Vanessa Williams, still a resident, was crowned Miss America and
then disappointment when she was dethroned. In the late 1980s, the
spotlight returned when FBI agents staked out Felix Bloch, who had
holed up in his daughter's house here after he was suspected of
being a spy.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1990s had been quiet. At least until the president
decided to move in.
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement that President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton had signed a contract to buy a Dutch Colonial at 15 Old
House Lane, many residents here were a jumble of emotions: proud to
be judged the fairest suburb of them all, fearful of the
implications and, mostly, tired of the hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of dreading it,'' said Kathy Kiernan-Johnston,
summing up a widely expressed sentiment, as reporters canvassed the
usually sleepy business district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice quiet town, and that was the whole point of moving
here,'' she said. ``I have a feeling there will be another brouhaha
when they actually move in _ with Chelsea taking her first walk in
the town and Bill playing golf for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, were relishing the moment. Len Savanella, the
owner of Chappaqua Stationery, posted a sign on his storefront that
read: ``Bye Bye Beanie Babies. Hello Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Gerry Gorman, a pharmaceutical company executive
and father of three who is sure to have the ultimate cocktail party
boast, living as he does three doors down from the Clintons' home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, it's fun, it's different,'' he said with a big
grin.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Gorman seemed not all that worried about the traffic
on Old House Lane, a tiny slip of a street with only a half-dozen
houses. On Friday, it looked like an airport runway, with cars
streaming up and around the cul-de-sac for a glimpse of the house
and television satellite trucks vying for position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the cars, but that's temporary,'' he said. ``I
think it will all subside.''
</P>
<P>
   A hamlet in the Town of New Castle, Chappaqua was once
predominantly Republican, but it has shifted in recent years; all
five members of the New Castle town board, as well as the town
supervisor, are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Since they are moving to friendly territory, can the Clintons
expect a parade or a big banner across the town hall?
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Chappaqua, Tom and Maxine Baker?'' mused the town
supervisor, Clinton B. Smith, referring to hypothetical newcomers.
``There's no difference between Tom and Maxine Baker and Bill and
Hillary Clinton, so the answer is no.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Often, the most adamant reactions here to the president's move
came from people who also had the strongest reactions to his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Those like Dr. Rami Mosseri, who twice voted for President
Clinton, were delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Clintons,'' said Mosseri, who oversees treatment
programs in Westchester County for emotionally disturbed children
for the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. ``I like
what they stand for, and I'm flattered that they think of Chappaqua
as a town they would like to live in.''
</P>
<P>
   As for any upheaval the Clintons' presence may cause, he said,
``Chappaqua can use a little action.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Portlock, who said Clinton had ``brought shame to the
presidency,'' wondered how residents would get their children to
school in the mornings when the Clintons and their entourage are in
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody drives their kids to the high school, and there are
already massive traffic jams,'' said Ms. Portlock, a saleswoman at
Bloomingdale's in White Plains and a Chappaqua resident for four
years. ``Will they close the streets? How will you get through?''
</P>
<P>
   But Pat Miller, a fiction writer and grandmother who has lived
here for 23 years, blamed the news media for making much ado over
what she called a ``nonevent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mrs. Clinton gets elected,'' she said, referring to her
expected run for the U.S. Senate, ``she'll be here 12 days a
year.''

UNEASY LIE THE HELMETS THAT WEAR THE BRONCOS' LOGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems to be a tradition: Team wins National Football League
championship. Team celebrates. Calamities strike team.
</P>
<P>
   Free agency tears team apart. Or drugs. Or arrests. Or
controversial personnel moves. Maybe a retirement or two. Or, in
the case of the Denver Broncos, some variation of all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   First John Elway said a teary goodbye, which led to Coach Mike
Shanahan naming Bubby Brister as Elway's replacement at
quarterback. But Brister did what many thought he would: He played
terribly. He was so bad in the preseason, twice throwing
interceptions on the first pass play of a game, that last week
Shanahan made the controversial decision to bench Brister for the
second-year quarterback Brian Griese.
</P>
<P>
   Now Shanahan must deal with the consequences. The Broncos might
indeed be better for the move, but there may be some players who
wonder whether they can trust Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the quarterback controversy, the Broncos have had to
deal with a series of other distractions. The talented defensive
player John Mobley got into a serious automobile accident that
could have killed him; luckily, he is fine. Tight end Shannon
Sharpe blasted the league for forcing the Broncos to play a
preseason game in Australia. Then when the news media blasted back,
calling Sharpe a crybaby, he boycotted them. So far Sharpe is
sticking to his stance.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest Rocky Mountain headache surfaced late last week.
Linebacker Bill Romanowski, a fitness guru who takes dozens of
vitamins and nutritional supplements each day, is being
investigated for illegally obtaining a prescription drug by the
Douglas County sheriff's department in Colorado and the Drug
Enforcement Administration. Those agencies have asked that two
felony counts and one misdemeanor count be filed against
Romanowski. If convicted, he could face a prison term of up to
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski, through his lawyer, Jeff Springer, denied any
wrongdoing. Springer called the allegations ``scandalous.'' No
charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Romanowski's wife, Julie, and another woman
obtained prescriptions for Phentermine from a doctor and then gave
the drug to Romanowski. Phentermine is usually given to people with
severe obesity and can act as a stimulant. The National Football
League does not have a prohibition against it.
</P>
<P>
   The case could have serious repercussions for Romanowski and the
Broncos. If convicted of misuse of prescription drugs, Romanowski
would be in violation of the league's substance-abuse policy and
would be subject to a suspension and/or a fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have long been known as a team that does whatever it
takes to win. In part, that simply means hard work _ they won the
last two Super Bowls largely because Elway remained in great
physical shape, as did running back Terrell Davis, who takes part
in excruciating off-season workouts.
</P>
<P>
   But the league has recently kept a close eye on the Broncos, and
in particular on their relationship with EAS, a Colorado company
that makes nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the NFL sent a memo to each of its teams about the
use of Andro-6, which is supposed to boost testosterone levels and
thus increase strength and muscle mass. In the memo Dr. John
Lombardo, the league's adviser on anabolic steroids, said that
using Andro-6 would violate the league's substance-abuse policy
because it included two banned items, androstenedione and
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).
</P>
<P>
   What was unusual about Lombardo's warning was that while other
companies make products that contain the banned substances, the
only company he mentioned was EAS, which has a close relationship
with the Broncos. A number of Denver players use EAS products.
</P>
<P>
   While Lombardo's memo was circulated to each team, league
officials said privately at the time that they hoped the Broncos
took special notice since so many of their players were said to be
using Andro-6.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that when the Broncos look back over this season come
January, the Romanowski incident will have been nothing more than a
blip in what could be another great year.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most repeated words in a football locker room is
distraction. When one comes along, coaches and players act as if
they are not bothered, even though it may be sitting on their
shoulders. The Broncos have not one, but several of these pesky
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan is such a good coach, despite how poorly he handled the
Brister situation, that he will get the Broncos at least 10 or 11
victories. They have too much talent to get any fewer. And since
Brister appears to be better coming off the bench than as a
starter, Shanahan's decision may in the end be a wise one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a reason no team has won three consecutive Super
Bowls. A lot of these little things, these distractions, can add
up, and pretty soon the Broncos may not be fighting only other
teams, but also themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Costly Exhibitions
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants and Jets lost two key players to injury on
Friday, it provided more support to the critics of the preseason
system.
</P>
<P>
   Four preseason games in the highly violent world of professional
football seem like too many. Injuries to the Giants' Gary Brown
(sprained knee) and the Jets' Wayne Chrebet (broken foot) are the
latest in a growing number of hurt bodies left in the wake of
another preseason. St. Louis lost quarterback Trent Green for the
season last weekend after he severely hurt his knee. This
off-season the team had signed Green to an $11 million contract.
The New Orleans rookie Ricky Williams hurt his ankle, and the
Saints saw two other players injured as well.
</P>
<P>
   No team has been as devastated as the Miami Dolphins. Miami is
missing more than a dozen players to injuries, including the rookie
defensive lineman Dimitrius Underwood (shoulder). Coach Jimmy
Johnson has watched his once large group of running backs decimated
by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is simple: Cut the number of preseason games to
two. It would give coaches less game time to evaluate their
players, but the injuries would be drastically reduced. And the
preseason games would become more important, not meaningless as
they are now.

 &HT;    A `Pearl' at high tide
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A dozen years ago, Melinda Haynes was a preacher's
daughter who thought she had run out of miracles.
</P>
<P>
   A high school dropout who suffered from a panic disorder, Haynes
was in the middle of a bankruptcy and a rapidly disintegrating
marriage. Her husband had lost his job, and the bank had foreclosed
on their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I had nothing to live for,'' says the 44-year-old
Alabama author. ``I believed I had let everybody down.''
</P>
<P>
   When she couldn't stand it any longer, she attempted suicide by
taking an overdose of antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the miracles began happening.
</P>
<P>
   A chance encounter with a priest in a small Catholic church
landed her a job as a reporter for The Catholic Week. That resulted
in an assignment covering relief organizations in Jamaica. And that
led to a short story, a new husband and a book contract.
</P>
<P>
   Then the big miracle happened.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Oprah Winfrey called to say she had selected Haynes'
debut novel, ``Mother of Pearl'' (Hyperion, $23.95), for her TV
book club. (The taped segment airs this week, although at press
time producers had not settled on a firm date.)
</P>
<P>
   When Haynes first got the call, she didn't recognize Winfrey's
voice. ``She was talking so softly, I thought she was an office
worker who didn't want to be overheard. After a while, I
</P>
<P>
   asked her who she was. When she said, `This is Oprah Winfrey,' I
dropped the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   The book that captivated the talk-show host is set in Petal,
Miss., during the 1950s. It explores the intersecting lives of Even
Grade, a black man who was orphaned as a child; Valuable Korner, a
fatherless teen-age girl who is the daughter of the town whore; and
Joody Two Sun, the local soothsayer.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Conroy called the book ``a novel of staggering power'' and
The New York Times described Haynes' prose as being ``as profuse
and vigorous'' as kudzu.
</P>
<P>
   Before Winfrey's announcement, Hyperion expected to sell about
10,000 copies of the novel. Now the publisher has gone back to
press twice for a total of 700,000 copies. Paperback and foreign
rights have been sold, a movie deal is in the works and the book is
No. 7 on this week's New York Times Best Seller List.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the whirlwind, Haynes is trying to remain calm.
``I'm trying to keep my life simple,'' she says. ``We live out in
the country in Grand Bay (Ala.) in a trailer. It's very peaceful,
very quiet. We have another place on the river, a fish camp. Now I
can keep writing; I don't have to worry about going out and getting
a job.''
</P>
<P>
   She does, however, have to worry about facing the public. For
someone who has suffered for years from agoraphobia, that prospect
is frightening.
</P>
<P>
   The first panic attacks began when she was in seventh grade.
``Suddenly everyone in the room seemed to be getting closer and I
could hear my heart in my ear and I actually fell out of my desk,''
she recalls. ``It began to happen more and more at school.''
</P>
<P>
   As the daughter of a Baptist preacher, Haynes couldn't hide. She
was always called on to pray in Sunday school, and she was expected
to attend all church functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began missing a lot of school,'' she says. ``They took me to
a psychiatrist, but there was not a lot of information about the
disorder. Then the attacks began to happen in church, and then in
stores. I finally quit school in the 11th grade and was tutored at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as she got her diploma at 18, she married and started a
family. ``I was trying to find something,'' she says. ``I don't
know what. For a while, I felt safe.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 23, she had three daughters and a husband
who found it increasingly difficult to make ends meet at
blue-collar jobs. To supplement their meager income, Haynes began
painting portraits. Trained by her grandfather, Opie Braswell, a
Hattiesburg, Miss., artist known for his baptism scenes, Haynes
began to earn $5,000 to $6,000 per painting.
</P>
<P>
   But even that was not enough. When her husband lost his job, the
panic attacks returned and Haynes, unable to deal with her clients,
quit painting. The couple lost their house and filed for bankruptcy
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   That's when she tried to kill herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like if I had been a better painter I could have saved
us. That's the trick of depression. You start to believe everyone
would be better off without you.''
</P>
<P>
   After the suicide attempt, Haynes was driving and crying one day
when she stopped and went into a small church, which turned out to
be Catholic. ``This man came in and sat down beside me while I was
crying,'' she says. ``He wasn't dressed like a priest, but he began
explaining what the different things in the church were. I decided
then and there I was going to convert. It saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Haynes realized that perfection was not possible, she began
to recover. Until then, she was always concerned about her weight,
or the way she looked, or how well she did in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was nothing that my parents ever tried to put on me,''
she says. ``It was some standard that I set for myself at an early
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Converting to Catholicism proved to be a turning point in her
career as well. After divorcing her first husband, Haynes took a
job as a typesetter for The Catholic Week newspaper in Mobile. Nine
months later, she was assigned to cover relief organizations in
Kingston, Jamaica. Her photographs won the Mobile Press Club's
Award of Excellence but, more importantly, her essay was read by
co-worker Ray Haynes, 56, a retired Marine captain and Vietnam
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first thing I had read that really brought tears to
my eyes,'' Ray Haynes says. ``She's only about 5 feet tall, but I
told her she wrote like a tall woman. I also told her she was too
good for this place. Shortly thereafter, we started going out.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, they married and moved to Grand Bay, where
she began writing her first short story, ``Strange Dirt.''
Meanwhile, a friend had recommended that she subscribe to Poets &AMP;
Writers magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the first issue arrived, I read it from cover to cover
and then cried for two hours. The odds seemed impossible. Contest
fees, book recommendations, retreats I couldn't afford. ... There
didn't seem to be a profile of an undereducated Southern woman who
had grown up out in the middle of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There didn't seem to be a slot for a middle-aged grandmother
who had put away her paintbrushes and fallen in love with her
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Discouraged, she gave the magazine to her husband and went back
to her day job as production manager at The Catholic Week. Every
night she wrote until 3 a.m. on her novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 75 pages into the book and felt as though I had
wandered, by some sort of strange accident, into a world of
possibilities,'' she says. ``It was the most incredible time of
self-awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   As she wrote, her husband bundled up her stories and sent them
to literary magazines. Eight weeks later, she got a call saying two
of her stories had been accepted by The Crescent Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray began an aggressive course where my writing was concerned.
He cleaned out a bedroom, screened my calls and researched the
possibilities for a literary agent.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading a profile of agent Wendy Weil in Poets &AMP; Writers,
he sent her 104 pages of the novel. Sixteen days later, she called
Haynes at work and asked to see more. Six months after that,
Hyperion bought the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Weil says it was Haynes' cover letter that made her manuscript
stand out in a huge slush pile. ``It was very heartfelt. And then
we started reading the story and immediately fell in love with Even
and the other characters. She is a natural writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Levin, Haynes' editor at Hyperion, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melinda is a writer who is passionate about language,'' Levin
says. ``She's in love with it the same way writers such as Toni
Morrison are. Her writing combines a childlike innocence with a
very sophisticated manipulation of the language.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes derived her love of words from reading the works of James
Joyce and Flannery O'Connor, but she attributes her talent for
description to her training in art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I know how to paint scenes, I can make a translation
from what I was seeing into words very easily. And I've always been
able to anticipate moods, see emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Like her writing, Haynes possesses a certain kind of innocence.
``She's like a child in the way she looks at things,'' her husband
says. ``Her agent said she hoped she didn't lose that quality in
all this. I don't think she will. Neither of us is very
materialistic. We both like to fish and ride motorcycles. The
biggest thing we want to do is build a house on the river one of
these days and get out of the trailer. Every time a thunderstorm
comes through, she gets worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes has no intention of changing, even with the promise of
more money than she ever imagined and the pressure that comes with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing for me as a writer is to make sure
that I'm trying to please me, nobody else. I don't want to please
someone for commercial reasons. I feel like I'm the guardian of the
characters. I just want to be true and honest.''
</P>
<P>
   _ An excerpt from ``Mother of Pearl''
</P>
<P>
   Even Grade walked past the spot on the bridge where Canaan had
caught the bottle with his head and saw the blood mark was still
there, but just barely. The two-week bake of August sun beginning
to mask its humiliation, blending the old man's emission to a color
like that of rusted girder. On a day not spent dealing with death,
Even would have stopped one more time to wonder over the bigger
insult: that Canaan's middle-aged forehead got split by glass and
bled out, or that the bottle bearing skin and blood soared over a
rail and dropped into the water that he loved. Death or no, Even's
suspicion was the same as two weeks back: both. Both were equally
bad. ...
</P>
<P>
   When Even passed under the caution light at Central and Main, he
saw Canaan sitting on the warm deck of the loading dock of the Feed
and Seed. Leaning against the wall, his shades on his bony nose,
Canaan had put aside the bandage he'd worn for two weeks. ...
Canaan didn't stop reading. Just said from behind newsprint as Even
approached. ``I do say, Even Grade, somebody dead?'' ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody dead.

DOCUMENTS ON WACO POINT TO A CLOSE COMMANDO ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's elite Special Operations Command
sent observers to the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in
Texas more than a month before the final assault on the compound,
suggesting that military commandos had a far longer and closer
involvement in the disastrous 1993 operation than had been
previously divulged, according to declassified government
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act also
show for the first time that officials at the highest levels of the
Defense Department, including Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were briefed by the Special Operations
Command about the events near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The command, which is based at MacDill Air Force Base in
Florida, oversees the military's most secretive commando squads,
including the Army's Delta Force and the Navy Seals, and the
documents suggest that the command was monitoring the situation
virtually from the start of the 51-day siege. The command's
spokesmen did not return calls for comment on the documents.
</P>
<P>
   The exact relationship between the military and law-enforcement
agencies in the planning of the raid on April 19, 1993, which ended
in the fiery destruction of the compound and the deaths of about 80
people, has long been a mystery. It is expected to be a topic of
congressional hearings this fall into the siege, especially given
the new disclosure that possibly incendiary military-issue tear-gas
canisters were fired near the compound. Congressional officials say
they want to know where the canisters came from, and who gave
approval for their use.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials, aware of the severe legal
restrictions on the use of American troops within the United
States, have long said that the military's role during the siege
was purely that of adviser to law-enforcement agencies, including
the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily censored documents do not show that the military had
any operational role during the siege.
</P>
<P>
   Although administration officials have previously acknowledged
that three soldiers assigned to Delta Force were at the cult
compound on the day of the fiery raid as observers, the documents
show that the first Special Operations monitors actually went there
more than a month earlier, and that their findings were reported to
Washington and to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were provided to The New York Times by the
National Security News Agency, a nonprofit research group based in
Washington that has often unearthed internal government documents
and other information embarrassing to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the Joint Chiefs and to the FBI in Washington
that was dated March 2, 1993, commanders of the Special Operations
Command reported that they had carried out ``observation of
operations in Waco, Tex.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-page document was heavily edited by military censors but
appears to outline the deteriorating situation found by the
monitors at the site near Waco, where the Davidians had barricaded
themselves in their compound.
</P>
<P>
   The siege began on Feb. 28, when agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms conducted a failed raid on the
compound, resulting in a firefight in which four federal officers
and two of the cult members were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The report is stamped ``secret specat,'' or special category,
which would have limited its distribution to a select group of
government officials with security clearances. The identity of the
monitors sent to Texas and their ranks were not revealed.
</P>
<P>
   In a report dated March 30, nearly three weeks before the final
assault on the compound, the Special Operations Command responded
to an ``FBI request for assistance'' at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The exact nature of the request is not clear in the heavily
censored copy of the document that was released by the Defense
Department. But the request clearly was important because the
report prepared by the Special Operations Command was forwarded to
the highest levels of the Pentagon, including Aspin, and to the
Joint Chiefs, then led by Gen. Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law-enforcement agencies at the compound requested help
from the Pentagon, including heavy weapons and military training,
almost immediately after the raid on Feb. 28. Over the weeks that
followed, the FBI was provided with military helicopters, tanks,
armored personnel carriers and a variety of weapons.

   Mark McGwire has hit more home runs in losing efforts than any
player in history. He has slugged 34 of his 54 home runs this year
in games the St. Louis Cardinals have lost.
</P>
<P>
   But Sammy Sosa, his partner in historic home run races, has a
chance to do something no one ever has _ hit 50 or more home runs
and wind up with more home runs than his team has victories.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa took a 57-55 lead over McGwire into the Chicago Cubs' game
Saturday. He clouted his 53rd home run in the Cubs' 53rd victory
and 54th in their 54th. But then he connected for No. 55 in the
team's 7-3 loss at San Diego last Tuesday, and the Cubs haven't
been able to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Berger, Ralph Kiner and the original Frank Thomas (not the
one playing now) have come closest to achieving the odd feat.
Berger hit 34 home runs when the Boston Braves won 38 games in
1935, Kiner hit 37 when Pittsburgh won 42 games in 1952 and Thomas
connected for 34 when the rookie Mets dazzled the baseball world
with 40 victories in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-homer plateau had been reached 27 times before this
season. The closest finish in those 27 instances came in 1947 when
Kiner hit 51 home runs and the Pirates won 62 games. McGwire came
close to that difference last season, hitting 70 as the Cardinals
won 83 games.
</P>
<P>
   Can't Keep Up That Pace
</P>
<P>
   When Jose Canseco hit his 31st home run July 8, he was only one
behind Sammy Sosa and he was four home runs ahead of Mark McGwire.
But he played only one more game for Tampa Bay before he went on
the disabled list with a back injury. Since returning Aug. 20,
Canseco had played 11 games before Saturday night, and he still had
31 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   In his first 55 relief appearances for Texas, Jeff Zimmerman
allowed 10 earned runs in 771/3 innings for a 1.16 earned run
average. In two outings in Detroit last week, Zimmerman faced 13
batters. Nine of them got hits and eight scored, ballooning his ERA
to 2.06.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere to Go but Out
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Terry Collins as the Anaheim Angels' manager
could hardly have surprised anyone. The players might have deserved
to be fired more than Collins, but the Disney team wasn't going to
be the first to make that move.
</P>
<P>
   Between the first game after the All-Star Game break and
Collins' resignation Friday, the Angels endured losing streaks of
11 games, seven games and nine games. The first streak is the
longest in the American League this season, and the league's 13
other teams have a total of eight losing streaks as long as seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   No team has fallen faster than the Angels did in July. After
winning the first post-break game, the Angels plummeted 13 games in
the standings in the span of 18 games, 16 of which they lost.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies in Free Fall
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Phillies weren't ready to contend for the
playoffs this season, but they made a valiant effort, going as far
as their young talent and a healthy Curt Schilling could take them.
They were only 5 1/2 games out of first place and four games from
the wild-card lead as recently as a month ago, but they lost 18 of
24 games before breaking a seven-game losing streak Friday night
and tumbling 17 games from the division leader, Atlanta, and 13{
games from the wild-card hopeful Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling pitched the first game of that 24-game stretch but
then went on the disabled list with a sore shoulder. He returned
Friday, in time to stop the losing streak but not in time to stop
the fatal fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jaha Delivers for A's
</P>
<P>
   Teams stayed away in droves. John Jaha was a free agent, but he
was also a patient, recovering from major foot surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a whole lot of choices,'' said Jaha, a first
baseman, who spent his first seven seasons with the Milwaukee
Brewers. ``Nobody really was willing to take a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaha, 33, thought teams were ignoring a good opportunity. ``I
thought I could play,'' he said. ``I work pretty hard in the
wintertime. It was just a matter of someone giving me a chance to
come to spring training and let me work into shape and get my
confidence back.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland gave Jaha that chance, signing him on the eve of spring
training for a $400,000 salary. The Athletics included a bonus of
$75,000 if he is named the comeback player of the year. They might
as well pay the man now.
</P>
<P>
   Serving mostly as the designated hitter, Jaha entered Saturday's
game with Detroit tied for the team lead in home runs with 32 and
second in runs batted in with 96, two good reasons the Athletics
are competing for the wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the funnest time I've had in my career,'' Jaha said.
``I haven't been playing for much when September came around in
past years.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting for Luck
</P>
<P>
   Considering the overreaction to the brief bus scuffle between
the Mets' Rey Ordonez and Luis Lopez, some people must think two
teammates never had a fight before. Why it wasn't even novel for
the Mets (see Tim Foli and Ed Kranepool in 1971 for one precedent).
</P>
<P>
   Teams like the Oakland Athletics in the early '70s and the Los
Angeles Dodgers in the later '70s had intramural fisticuffs and won
pennants. Maybe the cut over Ordonez's eye is a harbinger of good
things to come for the Mets. Maybe that's the element of the fight
that should be viewed seriously, not the fight itself.

 &HT;    Possible Buchanan defection has GOP sounding alarms
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Voters such as Joe McCutchen of Ellijay, Ga., are the
reason Republican leaders worry that presidential candidate Pat
Buchanan will take his campaign to the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   McCutchen, a Republican activist, said he and his band of North
Georgians who are backing Buchanan will happily follow the
three-time candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's going to do it,'' McCutchen said. ``But
if he does, I'll be with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is back in the pack of Republican candidates, and the
social and foreign policy issues that are central to his campaign
are not getting heard as they did in 1992 and 1996, when he won the
New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   But if he runs as a third-party candidate, Republicans fear he
will drain enough votes from the GOP nominee to ensure the election
of a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich urged the Reform Party on
Friday to nominate whomever Republicans choose and run as a team in
2000. ``Because the alternative would be to offer assistance to Al
Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans point to 1992 to bolster their position. Ross Perot,
who left the GOP, was the Reform candidate and Bill Clinton won the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll shows that, in a hypothetical
matchup, Buchanan takes almost all his support from Texas Gov.
George W. Bush. While Bush still finishes ahead of Vice President
Al Gore in the poll, it is a much closer contest than a two-man
race.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
said he will meet with Buchanan and try to persuade him that he has
a place in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's firm opposition to abortion rights and hard-line
stance on other social issues may make it difficult for him to win
the nomination of the Reform Party, which tends to attract people
with more moderate views on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   But if he could capture the nomination, Buchanan would have
access to more than $12 million that the party will receive in
federal funds for the 2000 campaign, far more money than he expects
to raise.
</P>
<P>
   Gore criticized over Russia role
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's leading role in U.S.-Russian relations
is leaving him open to criticism from his presidential competitors
over allegations that Russian gangsters stole up to $200 million in
international loans and other foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a long history as the administration's point man in
U.S.-Russian relations, and the vice president's foreign policy
experience is one of the selling points in his campaign for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole have said that Gore
bears special responsibility for the scandal because of his
prominent role.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Bill Bradley last week chided the Clinton and Bush
administrations _ but not Gore in particular _ in his assessment
that ``American assistance and lending policies toward Russia have
been misdirected and ineffective.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign press secretary Kiki Moore said Gore ``is not
going to play partisan politics'' with the Russian money-laundering
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides have said the vice president was not aware that
loans from the International Monetary Fund may have been taken by
the Russian mafia and laundered through the Bank of New York into
U.S. accounts.
</P>
<P>
   They also have said that Gore has used his prominence to push
the Russians to crack down on corruption as a condition for the
continuation of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has vowed to keep the issue front and center, and already
has aired a radio ad in which he says Gore's aides said the vice
president ``was out of the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase was the same one used by then-Vice President George
Bush in response to critics of the Iran-contra scandal of the
Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates take S.C. Primary seriously
</P>
<P>
   You can forgive J. Sam Daniels for his exuberance when he says,
in all apparent sincerity, that South Carolina boasts the nation's
``most important primary.''
</P>
<P>
   As the state Republican Party's executive director, Daniels gets
paid to promote all things South Carolina and Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But his comment is more than mere bluster and as proof, he
offers the campaigns of Republicans Steve Forbes and George W.
Bush, who are spending part of the Labor Day Arizona Sen. John
McCain has made South Carolina and New Hampshire the focal points
of his campaign. Dole also has made several trips to the state,
next door to her native North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina does not hold the first primary and it is not
rich in delegates to the nominating convention. But it holds its
primary early enough, Feb. 19 in 2000, and first among Southern
states. Since 1980, every Republican who has finished first in
South Carolina has won his party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The state is deep with religious conservatives, yet presidential
primary voters have stood as a bulwark against insurgent
candidacies from the party's right wing and in support of the
mainstream candidate.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolinians helped Bob Dole stop Buchanan in 1996 and Bush
shut off Pat Robertson's momentum in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's plan to capture the GOP nomination is built around
using strong showings in New Hampshire and South Carolina, and a
decisive win in Arizona, to narrow the Republican field to a
one-on-one contest in California against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush does well in the Iowa caucuses and in New Hampshire, he
could use South Carolina to effectively end any serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Dole and Forbes would like to use South Carolina as a
springboard to the round of early March primaries that include
Georgia, but also the big prizes in California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be 11 days between us and New Hampshire,'' said
Daniels, who worked on Guy Millner's campaign for Georgia governor
last year. ``I think you'll see candidates spending a lot of time
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky race has Democrats excited
</P>
<P>
   Five seats will determine who controls the House of
Representatives after next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   So Democrats were practically giddy last week when former Rep.
Scotty Baesler of Kentucky said he would run for his old seat in
the Lexington area.
</P>
<P>
   Baesler lost a race for the U.S. Senate last year to Republican
Jim Bunning by 6,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   But his election is no sure thing against freshman Rep. Ernie
Fletcher, who has amassed $533,000 in campaign funds to defend his
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Cook, a Washington political analyst, said a
Baesler-Fletcher contest would be ``one of the most competitive
races in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Baesler, then an incumbent, beat Fletcher in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party expects more than a handful of seats to change
hands anywhere in the South, meaning both sides intend to pour as
much as they can into any campaign that appears competitive.

OUTDOORS: A SALTED VERSION OF FLY FISHING WAS QUITE A HIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT H. BOYLE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here was Eric Leiser of Wappingers Falls, N.Y., a devotee of
trout, a guru of fly-fishing and the author of ``Fly Tying
Materials,'' ``The Book of Fly Patterns'' and ``The Complete Book
of Fly Tying'' (now in its 21st printing, 90,000 copies sold),
sitting in a 14-foot rowboat with a six-horsepower engine, joyously
pumping a spinning rod _ a spinning rod! _ up and down to jig a
strip of cut squid 20 feet down on the bottom of the Housatonic
River where it empties into Long Island Sound at Stratford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   And here was Leiser's pal, Pete Zito, the proprietor of Black
Canyon Flies and Supplies in Wappingers Falls and a licensed New
York state guide who takes Masters of the Universe fly-fishing on
the Beaverkill, wielding, heaven help us, a spinning rod with a
baited dead killie weighed down by a 3-ounce sinker. ``This is not
catch and release!'' Pete exclaimed. ``This is the gut 'em and eat
'em society!'' What was the world of fly-fishing purists coming to?
</P>
<P>
   ``A good time,'' said Eric, and that's true.
</P>
<P>
   He and Zito were fishing for fluke, a delicious flatfish that
also goes by the names of summer flounder, sole and, if big enough,
doormat. I'd gone on the trip after the end of a July heat wave to
observe Leiser's extraordinarily successful fluke fishing methods.
Friends who had gone with him before reported there were days when
they came back with 30 to 40 fluke while other boats landed only
one or two.
</P>
<P>
   Before launching, Leiser stopped at the Stratford Bait and
Tackle Shop to get the latest intelligence from the owner, John
Posh. ``A lot of fluke,'' Posh said. But then he added that just
about every fish was frustratingly short of the new 15-inch length
limit in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, out we went, and we had action from start to
finish. In three hours of fishing we caught more than three dozen
fluke, with Leiser catching the most. But Posh was right; all but
two were just short of the 15-inch limit. ``These fluke came in
from deep water as the water warmed up,'' Leiser said. ``They're
looking for food, and they find it in estuaries or along the shore,
not in deep water. We'll come back when they've grown, before the
season closes on Sept. 15.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiser's success is attributable to the very refined techniques
and touches he brings to saltwater spinning from freshwater fly
fishing and fly tying for trout. Even as a 10-year-old in Brooklyn,
N.Y., nearly 60 years ago, he was a fastidious angler who heated
sewing needles over a gas stove so he could bend them to shape to
catch goldfish in the park. ``I got some up to a pound!'' he
exulted.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to fluke fishermen who fish heavy, Leiser goes as
light as possible. For starters, take his 5-foot-long
home-concocted spinning rod, which looks as if it were designed by
Rube Goldberg. It consists of the broken lower half of a graphite
bait-casting rod taped to the forward half of a broken Vince
Cummings fly rod with a flexible tip that sticks out 7 inches.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason for such madness. ``I wanted stiffness to
drive the hook home,'' Leiser explained, hefting the rod and waving
the tip like an orchestra leader, ``yet I wanted a tip with some
give so that when I was playing a fish, it wouldn't tear the hook
out. It's also sensitive to the slightest touch, unlike a heavy
boat rod. A lot of guys in fluke fishing figure to overpower the
fish, but if a fish makes a sudden lurch, the hook can tear out of
the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiser kept control of the boat so that his baited jig held
bottom no matter which way the wind or tide changed. ``The trick in
fishing a depth of 20 feet or more is to feel bottom as you go
along,'' he said, ``and the way to do that is to fish with a fine
line. Diameter is the most important thing, and with new lines like
Spider line, you can get, say, 12- or 15-pound test line that has
the diameter of what used to be 6- or 8-pound test line. And I use
a jig as light as the current will permit, a half-ounce, sometimes
a quarter of an ounce. Smaller jigs get more action than big jigs,
think about this, because they're smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some fishermen feel that unless they have 20- or 30-pound test
line, they're going to lose fish. Well, to get that line down
you're going to have to use a much heavier sinker or jig because
the current's going to sweep the line away because of its diameter.
You're also not going to have the sensitivity needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I was into fly tying, I decided to imitate the fish
that the fluke were feeding on. What I did was to tie white
marabou, not bucktail, on the jig because marabou has a lot more
life and an action similar to natural squid. I enhance that with
strands of silver mylar to add a bit of flash as an attractor, and
then I add a piece of squid and even a spearing on top of that.
Sometimes I use a killie.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his expertise and the gadzillions of fluke he has
caught, Leiser has yet to catch a bigger fluke than his wife June's
9.25-pounder or his daughter Kathleen's 7.5-pounder. ``Beaten
twice,'' he conceded, and then he quickly added, ``but the smaller
fish are better eating.''

TIMING IS EVERYTHING ON TEAMS' TRAVELS TO THE POSTSEASON
</HEADLINE>
   (SEE also BBO-NOTEBOOK-HOMERS) 
(rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks were busier making trades and spending
money in the off-season, and the Oakland Athletics changed their
roster a bit more with midseason deals, but no team was more active
than the Mets at both times of the year in making changes they
hoped would catapult them to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks engaged in such a massive roster turnover last
winter, acquiring such players as Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre,
Luis Gonzalez, Steve Finley and Tony Womack, and played so well in
the first half of the season, that the only spot they felt they had
to shore up at midseason was their closing relief role. They
accomplished that goal by obtaining Matt Mantei from the Florida
Marlins just before the All-Star Game break.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, the Athletics had no thoughts, other than in their
wildest fantasies, of contending for a playoff spot so they signed
a couple of veteran free agents, Tony Phillips and John Jaha,
hoping they would add to the team's offense. But when the Athletics
reached the July 31 no-waiver trading deadline, they found
themselves in the wild-card race, and General Manager Billy Beane
went on an all-out blitz to ensure that they stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   First, he traded Kenny Rogers to the Mets, then added two
starting pitchers, Kevin Appier and Omar Olivares; two relievers,
Jason Isringhausen and Greg McMichael, and a second baseman, Randy
Velarde. A couple of weeks later, when Phillips broke his leg,
Beane acquired Rich Becker to play the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, on the other hand,
completed a series of significant transactions during the winter,
then went back to business before the trading deadline. Did his
midseason work mean he hadn't completed the job in the winter?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more timing that it's done in season than the job
not being complete,'' Phillips said. ``It's a dynamic process that
doesn't start or finish at a specific time.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Phillips cited the Mets' desire after the 1997
season to acquire a marquee-type player. ``That sort of guy didn't
become available for the right deal until we were able to acquire
Mike in May '98,'' he said, referring to Mike Piazza. ``Often you
identify your need, but for whatever reason, you're not able to
fill it, whether it's not being able to sign a free agent or not
having the right fit for a trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Mets snared two free agents they wanted,
third baseman Robin Ventura and left fielder Rickey Henderson, two
players without whom the Mets would not be contending. The same day
he reached agreement with Ventura, Phillips executed a three-way
trade with Los Angeles and Baltimore. From the Orioles came Armando
Benitez, who was on hand to become the Mets' closer when John
Franco went on the disabled list two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   From the Dodgers came Roger Cedeno, who was on hand to fill in
for Henderson when he injured a knee in April. Benitez proceeded to
blow away hitters with his fastball, and Cedeno proceeded to take
off on a stolen-base tear that sent him to the head of the league.
Henderson, when healthy, has played like a rejuvenated player, and
Ventura is having a most valuable player-type season.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mets were playing well as the trading deadline
approached, Phillips was not content; he wanted to make the team
even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking to improve,'' the general manager said. ``That
is the challenge that our staff looks at every day. What can we do
to improve? In parentheses you say within the confines of your
budget and not giving away too much of the future. The trading
deadline just happens to motivate people to make deals. We would
have liked to have upgraded with a second left-hander in the
bullpen much earlier in the year, but that time of year makes it
easier to make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Working shrewdly ahead of the competition, Phillips grabbed
Rogers a week before the deadline for the starting rotation. Then,
on deadline day, he secured the left-handed reliever he wanted,
Chuck McElroy; added another reliever, Oakland's closer, Billy
Taylor; obtained a veteran, the versatile Shawon Dunston; and
swapped center fielders, Brian McRae for Darryl Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   All in a day's work.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some teams, the Mets did not add any players last
Tuesday, the last day players could get onto the roster and be
eligible for postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Houston obtained Stan Javier for their outfield decimated by
injuries; Atlanta added a backup catcher, Jorge Fabregas; the
Diamondbacks picked up Lenny Harris, a versatile utility player the
Mets had last season; Cleveland acquired Tyler Houston, another
versatile player, four days after trading for Harold Baines, a
veteran designated hitter; and Boston tried to solve its closer
problem by securing Rod Beck.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some moves have helped teams win, others have
not been enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day,'' Phillips said, ``if you look at where you are on
that given day, you feel good or bad about your acquisition. Of
course, you don't draw a final conclusion until the season is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt that day, Phillips said, ``I feel pretty good
today. I think we've been right more than we've been wrong.''

   NEW YORK _ In the backyard of Anthony Casamassima's unassuming
red-brick house in Queens, there is a tabletop cemetery lavishly
planted with bonsai trees. Tiny slate pathways snake their way
around semiprecious stones, creating a glittering trail past
Lilliputian mausoleums.
</P>
<P>
   This ingenious homegrown tableau is notable for its creator _ a
career grave robber who pursued his treasures with warped ardor.
</P>
<P>
   Casamassima was the star witness in the trial of Alastair
Duncan, a leading authority on Tiffany stained glass who was
convicted last month of buying and selling a 9-foot-tall Tiffany
window that Casamassima, armed with obsession and a screwdriver,
pried off a mausoleum in Salem Fields Cemetery on the
Brooklyn-Queens border.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the bonsai graveyard is the workshop where Casamassima,
40, a former cemetery caretaker, fashions his own stained-glass
windows and repairs fractured ones jimmied off tombs. It is a
carefully designed and rather inventive work place, the walls
covered with cabbage rose wallpaper, a Lionel train running on a
track beneath the ceiling molding and the corners decorated with
iron lions taken from a nearby Lutheran cemetery. Casamassima
leashed Sophia, his massive Neapolitan mastiff, one afternoon
recently to give a guided tour of the singular home he shares with
his 78-year-old father, Alphonsus, a retired city employee.
Casamassima was wearing a red tank top and a ``Lost in Space''
baseball cap (the ``Lost in Space'' television show being another
enthusiasm, along with Popeye, the '64 World's Fair, model trains
and real railroad bridges). He was in a contemplative mood.
</P>
<P>
   Casamassima _ who has recently taken to calling himself Anthony
Big Mouth _ was arrested in January after boasting of his 15-year
nocturnal grave-robbing career to an undercover agent for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Among his crimes was the sale of the Salem Fields window for
$60,000 to a Bronx antiques dealer, who, in partnership with
Duncan, resold it for $219,980 to Takeo Horiuchi, a wealthy
Japanese collector. After his arrest, Casamassima, along with the
antiques dealer, Lawrence Zinzi, agreed to cooperate with the
federal government in expectation of reduced sentences, secretly
recording conversations with Duncan that included discussions about
stolen windows.
</P>
<P>
   Casamassima is awaiting sentencing on a variety of charges,
including stealing the window and trafficking in stolen property.
Duncan, who is appealing his conviction, is to be sentenced on Oct.
27 and is facing up to 35 years in prison. The window itself sits
innocently in a museum in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In two days of animated testimony last month in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, Casamassima offered a riveting account of the
underbelly of the antiques world, a ``don't ask, don't tell'' chain
of bottom-feeders and erudite experts in which a window stolen from
a Brooklyn cemetery percolated up to the stratosphere; in this
case, a Tiffany museum in Nagoya, Japan. He told of midnight visits
to overgrown cemeteries beneath shadowy expressway girders,
forgotten corners of New York where Tiffany windows hung free for
the taking.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Casamassima saw himself as a rescuer, stealing
Tiffany windows and other treasures, he said, to ``liberate'' them
from vandalism and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with them,'' he said in court about the 80 or
more sculptures, gates, pedestals, Tiffany windows _ even cremation
urns with ashes _ he plundered from graveyards throughout the New
York area, including the beckoning constellation of cemeteries
encircling Middle Village, his neighborhood in Queens. ``That is
the reason I so-called stole them.''
</P>
<P>
   To cemetery officials like Meg Winslow, curator of the historic
Mount Auburn cemetery in Cambridge, Mass., Casamassima is no
gallant protector.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a horrific and tragic desecration of a family's
private property, a place built to house people's deepest and most
profound emotions,'' she said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Casamassima started ``collecting,'' as he put it, in 1982. At
the center of his workshop is an ornate cabinet of Carpathian elm,
padauk and mother-of-pearl inlay that he built with proceeds from
his thefts to show off his own stained-glass work, installing
theatrical lighting to highlight their brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI confiscated Casamassima's creations, down to the candy
dishes. But they did not take his stash of Tiffany fragments,
hundreds and hundreds of them, which he gamely pulled out of a
plastic container to give a Tiffany tutorial to a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up an amber shard shaped like devil's horns and held
it up to the light, slipping a striated blue piece in behind it.
``Tiffany had a technique of layering to enhance his windows,'' he
patiently told a visitor. ``You can almost walk into them. It's
like a 3-D effect.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked, he went on to explain that the pieces he was holding
were stolen from a mausoleum in the Cypress Hills cemetery, which
straddles the border of Queens and Brooklyn. ``The window was all
bent out of shape and dangling,'' he recalled. ``The lock was off.
All I had to do was walk inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Cemeteries and the art within them have held an allure for him
since boyhood _ ``forgotten treasures,'' as he put it, ``just left
out in the wild.'' Casamassima, who did not graduate from high
school, learned how to drive sitting on his father's lap behind the
wheel in St. John's Cemetery, four blocks from home, where he later
got a job as caretaker before being fired for stealing a pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go to St. John's, and I was always looking around,'' he
recalled. ``It's hard to explain that inner feeling. It's very
emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   He has always been attracted to old things, he said, and
cemeteries have the oldest, most dazzling art he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mausoleums were built like Greek temples, with bronze on
the doors,'' he said. As a young boy he remembers seeing a bronze
relief of a woman. ``It looked like her gown was blowing in the
wind, and she was stepping on the head of a boar,'' he said. ``Oh,
my God, it was magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would see monuments of hands praying, or a lamb, and it just
got to me,'' he continued. ``The respect and dignity they felt.
They decorated tombs like they expected someone to come over, like
the court of Caesar, with wraparound marble benches. Even though I
knew what I was doing was kind of illegal, I wanted them.''
</P>
<P>
   His art appreciation took a criminal turn in 1982, when, seeking
ornaments for his backyard, he learned from friends in the
neighborhood about a scrap pile of broken pedestals, statuary and
gates at nearby Lutheran Cemetery. ``When I heard about it, I had
to go inspect this for myself,'' he said. ``Sure enough, they were
ripping up old plots and throwing out the debris. I was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   He took the pieces home and discovered he had a knack for
repair. ``I figured well, they're throwing it out, it's not going
to be missed,'' he said. ``That's when I started going into other
departments.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, he got a caretaking job at St. John's Cemetery
_ Casamassima nirvana _ where he acquired the pass key he later
used to break into mausoleums throughout the New York area,
including Salem Fields and the historic Woodlawn Cemetery in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   He began noticing vandalized tombs and damaged stained glass. He
had never heard of Louis Comfort Tiffany, the master
turn-of-the-century artist and designer, but began extricating the
broken windows from tombs and bringing them home to see whether he
could repair them. Casamassima enrolled in a six-week course in
stained glass at an adult center in Forest Hills, Queens. ``They
were teaching us how to make sun-catchers with suction cups,'' he
recalled with bemused disgust. He discovered he had a natural
talent for cutting and foiling. ``That's when I went full speed
ahead with the stained glass,'' he said. He had a handy theft guide
in Alastair Duncan's classic work, ``Tiffany Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I hate to say it, but his book helped me,''
Casamassima said, still expressing deep regard for the
heretofore-esteemed expert he testified against.
</P>
<P>
   During the nine-day trial Casamassima said that he had made
$12,000 to $13,000 in unreported income from his thefts over 15
years, before the $60,000 Tiffany windfall.
</P>
<P>
   To steal the window, he recalled in his workshop, he crept into
Salem Fields at dead of night, taking a route behind a reservoir so
isolated ``that even the cops avoided it.''
</P>
<P>
   He broke into the grounds through a damaged fence, and, worried
that a gang might further vandalize the mausoleum, he said, spent
the night in the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   He chose the Glaser-Bernheim mausoleum because of its decrepit
condition. ``It looked like a cave,'' he said. ``There were calcium
deposits on the ceiling. The grass was growing inside. The window
was stress-cracked. The building was unsettling and closing in
around it.''
</P>
<P>
   The window weighed more than 500 pounds, so he made ``a sandwich
out of plywood'' to carry it out with three friends, who arrived
the next morning in a van.
</P>
<P>
   The ``window with a problem attached to it,'' as its provenance
was referred to in court with deadpan understatement by Zinzi, the
antiques dealer, remained in Casamassima's workshop for six years
until it was purchased by Duncan, who, Zinzi testified, knew the
window was ``swagged,'' or stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Casamassima remains weirdly purist about the window. At one
point, according to court testimony, Duncan had the window's
original yellow background altered to include a sunset, which
Duncan said he did at his client's request. ``They changed the
fingerprint, that's what they did!'' Casamassima said, gesturing
extravagantly for dramatic effect. ``It was a Tiffany! Can you
believe it? It's like you telling me, `You know, I like the Mona
Lisa, but she looks better in glasses.'''
</P>
<P>
   After shipping the window to Japan, prosecutors said, Duncan
asked Casamassima to ``seek and find'' another window, which he
dutifully did. Shortly thereafter, Casamassima made a
reconnaissance trip to Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, N.Y., bringing
along a tape measure, a camera and ``another low-life'' who turned
out to be an undercover FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   They passed a house for sale next to the cemetery. ``Can you
imagine if I lived here?'' Casamassima said exuberantly, according
to the agent's testimony. ``This place would be emptied out in a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallout from the Duncan case is already changing the landscape
of Tiffany collecting. ``Provenance is going to be a key issue,''
said David Donaldson, a private Tiffany dealer and consultant in
Orlando, Fla., and the former curator of the Charles Hosmer Morse
Museum of American Art, in Winter Park, Fla., home to one of the
country's finest Tiffany collections.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the mystery of Anthony Casamassima, who learned
about art in part by stealing it, may be akin to the enigma of the
scholarly Alastair Duncan himself: why someone with obvious talent
and a deep instinct for beauty would squander it.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflective moment, Casamassima said he was motivated by
``laziness'' and his underappreciation for his own work, in
addition to the enticingly decayed condition of the tombs. ``I
figured if they weren't taken care of and there's no more family,
what am I doing that's wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``They ought to wise up,'' he added, speaking of cemetery
managers. ``They should go through their inventory. The national
historic preservation society should step in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, his professed desire to protect objects was
surpassed by his need to possess them, at any cost. Three years
after he began his career as a grave robber, Casamassima bought
Christmas wreaths and placed them at every mausoleum he had stolen
from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was to say thank you for letting me take these
things,'' he said. ``It was to clear my conscience, to show my
intentions were good.''

MEDIA COMPANY WALKS AWAY FROM TAX DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bertelsmann AG, the third-largest media company in
the world, has decided to walk away from $28 million in tax breaks
for the new headquarters for its Random House publishing division
rather than comply with a last-minute city request to conduct a
full environmental review of the $300 million project.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the company will proceed with construction of the
31-story tower on Broadway, between 55th and 56th streets.
</P>
<P>
   The company has spent more than two years looking for a suitable
location, and a year negotiating with city officials over an
incentive package. Construction is to begin Nov. 1, and the company
recently learned that to obtain the subsidies it would have to
conduct the environmental review, a process that could take a year.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to incur any additional delays, Bertelsmann balked
last week. Some executives said they suspected that the city's
last-minute demand was being used to renege on the tax breaks, and
city officials countered that they were not asking for anything out
of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Because the city's zoning law does not require an environmental
review in this case, Bertelsmann has decided to forgo the $28
million in tax breaks and proceed with what will be called the
Random House Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incentive package is not as important as our need to
consolidate our employees at Random House into one state-of-the-art
building,'' said Robert Sorrentino, president of Bertelsmann Inc.
``We did not ask the city for any special treatment. We respect the
mayor's decision, but we'll go ahead without the city's incentive
package.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorrentino said his company would conduct its own environmental
analysis and resolve any problems, like traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden turnabout by Bertelsmann raises a critical question
about the city's policy of granting tax breaks to some of the
largest, most profitable corporations in the world: If Bertelsmann
can proceed without the tax breaks, why did Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's administration offer them in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   ``Turning down a tax break is pretty good evidence that the
subsidy wasn't ever needed,'' said Diana Fortuna, president of the
Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit organization. ``I'm sure a
lot of these projects could fly without government support.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban planners, anti-tax groups, labor unions, liberal analysts
and good-government groups like the Citizens Budget Commission have
long criticized the tax breaks as a form of corporate welfare,
particularly when the economy is strong. They say the deals shift
the tax burden to small and medium-sized companies, while depriving
the city of needed tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Bertelsmann decision gives credibility to their contention
that companies choose to expand or relocate for business reasons,
not because city officials offer a special tax bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that they should be trying to create a good
business environment for all businesses, large and small,'' Ms.
Fortuna said. ``That can be done by improving schools and public
transportation and lowering taxes across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the New York economy surged in recent years, the
Giuliani administration provided more than $2 billion in tax breaks
for 50 companies, including Viacom, Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber,
the New York Stock Exchange, and News Corp. Under the state law
governing such subsidies, the tenant must sign an agreement saying
that if it were not for the tax breaks, it would have moved out of
the city or been unable to build a new skyscraper.
</P>
<P>
   So-called corporate retention deals have become so common that
Bear Stearns, CBS and others did not even threaten to leave New
York before getting tens of millions of dollars in tax incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our policy of providing incentives has been
enormously successful,'' Deputy Mayor Randy Levine said. ``In this
case, Bertelsmann was in a time bind. Their need to get into the
building on time outweighed their need for incentives. So the city
gets the best of both worlds: It gets a new building, and it gets
to save money for taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Bertelsmann had completed its acquisition of Random
House in July 1998, the German company had been looking for a home
for both Random House and its Bantam Doubleday Dell consumer
publishing group. The company spent more than seven months last
year negotiating over a site in Times Square across the street from
Bertelsmann's headquarters at 1540 Broadway, but the deal fell
apart.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Bertelsmann opened talks with Steve Ross of Related
Cos., who needed a tenant for an 860,000-square-foot building he
planned to build on the west side of Broadway, between 55th and
56th streets. By May, the two sides had come to terms: Bertelsmann
would own and occupy 640,000 square feet of the building and move
in more than 1,500 employees. Retail space and about 130 apartments
would take up the rest of the building. The project did not need
any city approvals.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Levine agreed to provide Bertelsmann with
$28 million in tax breaks, a bit less than what the company had
asked. In the meantime, Ross completed most of the demolition on
the Bertelsmann site.
</P>
<P>
   But before the deal could be approved by the city's Industrial
Development Agency, city officials unexpectedly told Bertelsmann in
early August that to get the tax breaks it had to conduct a full
environmental review, rather than the more perfunctory analysis
that is usually done at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The demand took Bertelsmann by surprise because city officials
had not mentioned that requirement in more than a year of talks on
an incentive package. City officials said the company's lawyers
should have anticipated the request.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the review could kill the project altogether,
while Levine and Michael Carey, the president of the city's
Economic Development Corp., said the city was not asking for
special treatment, according to people on both sides of the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came up at the last minute,'' said one person involved in
the Bertelsmann project. ``It looked like the city was hiding
behind the technicality to pull the tax breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine denied that the Giuliani administration's real motive was
to withdraw the incentive package. Rather, he said, it feared that
the absence of a full environmental review might arouse
neighborhood opposition. ``We didn't want the project delayed by
lawsuits,'' he said. ``We wanted it to go forward.''

</P>
<P>
   In an embarrassment for the Giuliani administration, the state
Supreme Court recently struck down a year-old zoning rule that
allowed Broadway theaters to sell air rights above the theaters to
nearby developers, saying that the city should have conducted an
environmental-impact statement.
</P>
<P>
   Two people familiar with the Bertelsmann project suggested that
the Giuliani administration was now gun-shy. But they said the
city's decision also raised the dangerous possibility that all new
projects might have to conduct what many regard as a torturous
environmental review to obtain tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Several real estate lawyers said that most deals approved by the
Industrial Development Agency involved existing office space, not
new buildings like the Bertelsmann project, and did not require a
full environmental review.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, said Richard Leland, who heads the environmental
practice group at the Rosenman &AMP; Colin law firm, it is reasonable
to assume that a building will be built at Broadway and 55th
Street, whether or not there are tax breaks. ``So there is no real
environmental impact from the tax abatement,'' said Leland, who did
the environmental work for the Bear Stearns tower, which is being
built on Madison Avenue with a city tax break. ``In those
circumstances, it's unusual to require an environmental review.''

33 POSSIBLE ENCEPHALITIS CASES REPORTED, MAYOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As emergency management officials dispatched
pesticide-spraying helicopters to northern Queens and the South
Bronx, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday that as many as 33 New
York City residents might have contracted the mosquito-borne viral
disease known as St. Louis encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now 33 cases that are at some level of suspicion.
Some of them may not turn out to be St. Louis encephalitis,'' said
the mayor, who confirmed the outbreak on Friday, when he said that
one elderly person had died of the disease and that at least nine
others had been infected.
</P>
<P>
   The city's health commissioner, Dr. Neal L. Cohen, sought to
reassure people that the risk of contracting the disease is remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are taking extensive precautionary measures to reduce
the mosquito population, the risk of contracting St. Louis
encephalitis remains minimal,'' he said. Outbreaks elsewhere in the
nation have shown that only 1 in 1,000 mosquitoes carries the
disease, and most people who are infected recover fully after mild
periods of illness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the extent of the infections in New York City still
unknown, the mayor and other officials advised people to take
extreme care to avoid contact with mosquitoes, to use mosquito
repellent and to avoid wearing shorts or short-sleeved garments
when they go outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern Queens neighborhoods of Whitestone, Flushing and
Auburndale, where health officials said the outbreak had been
centered, residential streets were eerily quiet. People stayed
indoors, resisting the temptation to spend the beginning of a Labor
Day weekend over barbecues, at playgrounds or in other outdoor
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Those who might have missed the city's health warnings on Friday
afternoon would have had a difficult time remaining unaware of the
problem by early Friday evening, when helicopters began spraying
the pesticide malathion over the section of northern Queens close
to the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   City crews returned to the area Saturday morning, and continued
spraying parks, low-lying marshy areas and some people's lawns. The
spraying was to be expanded around dusk last night _ when
mosquitoes are most active _ to sections of the South Bronx, said
Jerome M. Hauer, director of the City Office of Emergency
Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the neighborhood is very concerned, but no one is
pushing the panic button,'' said Paul Leonardo, a 45-year-old
resident of 138th Street in Whitestone, who stepped outside briefly
Saturday to respond after a reporter rang his bell.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency command center set up by Hauer's staff at 138th
Street and 11th Avenue. The center was dispatching city workers
Saturday with bags of mosquito repellent and brochures describing
protective measures to neighborhood nursing homes and senior
citizen centers. Health officials said elderly people and young
children are most vulnerable to St. Louis encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the initial outbreak on Friday, health officials
said that an 80-year-old man died of the disease on Tuesday at
Flushing Hospital Medical Center and that two middle-aged men were
being treated for symptoms of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The health officials said another death, that of an 87-year-old
woman at Flushing Hospital on Thursday, was suspected of having
been caused by St. Louis encephalitis.

STUCK IN MIDDLE, HARLEM LOSES A QUIET WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MILLION-YOUTH-MARCH) 
(lh) 
 By MIKE ALLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The White Man Is the Devil'' buttons were on sale
near an antidrug van labeled Mr. Crack, bow-tied men calling
themselves ``messengers of Allah'' hawked Muslim newspapers, and as
many as 30 of New York's finest guarded deserted corners as a
sparse troupe of black teen-agers chanted: ``Whose street? Our
street!''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbert W.D. Love II, an undertaker in Harlem for 47 years, kept
his distance. That was not hard to do on the seven blocks of
Malcolm X Boulevard that had been set aside Saturday for the
Million Youth March, where shortly after the noon starting time,
the crowds on the six-lane boulevard were so thin that frustrated
vendors began packing up almost immediately. Love, wearing a straw
hat, black waistcoat and high-collared white shirt, declared the
rally's organizer, Khallid Abdul Muhammad, ``ignorant and
pompous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a whole bunch of mess _ a waste of time and money,''
Love said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the neighborhood have felt caught between Muhammad
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and seemed to blame both leaders
equally for the fact that central Harlem had lost a peaceful summer
weekend for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Even with what appeared to be a far smaller crowd than last
year, they felt their neighborhood was being occupied. Anthony W.
Bowman, 47, who was holding a barbecue in his backyard and said he
did not know anyone who went to the rally, was one of many who
contended that Giuliani had promoted Muhammad's event by denying
him a permit, prompting a widely covered court fight that the city
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being invaded,'' said Bowman, who conducts walking and
bus tours of Harlem. ``Khallid Muhammad and Mayor Giuliani have a
grudge match, and our children are being put on the front line.''
</P>
<P>
   Some participants, however, contended that the event was in
keeping with Harlem's heritage as a center of black culture and
political power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of Harlem _ that's where black people belong,'' said
Ronnie Hodge, 40, the superintendent of a five-story apartment
building, who was standing near the stage. ``There was a time you
couldn't move into the white man's neighborhood. But now they come
here, and we don't say nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Diop, 19, a high school senior who has lived on Malcolm X
Boulevard for five years, said all the attacks on Muhammad made him
even more determined to show up, and he skipped a soccer game to
hear the speeches. ``When white people see a crew of blacks
together, they think it's a gang,'' he said. ``This is about peace
and love, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Muhammad who live near the rally site said they
feared that publicity about him would negate the strides Harlem has
made toward redevelopment. Several longtime residents said
Muhammad's anti-Semitic remarks seemed especially out of place
since many of the churches in the area were once synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   During last year's rally, many neighborhood leaders and local
ministers canceled vacations so they could offer health and safety
services to rally participants in an effort that one organizer
likened to ``the Red Cross in a hostile zone.'' Six churches opened
to supply water and emergency haven, while 300 volunteers donned
T-shirts saying ``Harlem Community Observer'' and fanned out with
walkie-talkies to try to keep the rally peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, as part of Harlem leaders' repudiation of the
rally, many of those organizers and ministers left for the Labor
Day weekend, and no such network was set up. ``It was our actions
last year that gave Muhammad any credibility at all,'' said Terence
D. Tolbert, who was one of the last year's coordinators. ``What's
the expression? `Fool me twice, shame on me.' We were not going to
put ourselves in harm's way for Muhammad's inciting rhetoric.''

   Saturday's event shut down a summer school program that usually
serves about 125 neighborhood young people on a summer Saturday.
Geoffrey Canada, president of the Rheedlen Centers for Children and
Families, closed three training sites near the march zone because
he feared for the safety of his participants, and because he said
he did not want the comings and goings at his centers to add to the
perceived size of the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Canada's group held what it called a Children's
March for Peace, with an attendance estimated by organizers at
3,200. Supporters noted wryly that the march produced no violence,
no bigotry and little media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Selina Stinson, who heads a neighborhood group called
Looking Forward Tomorrow, spent all week trolling beauty parlors,
grocery stores and soup kitchens, urging residents to stay away
from the rally. ``Please don't be fooled,'' she said over and over.
``Our children don't need to be taught to be hateful. They need to
be taught to go to the library.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra Johnson, 40, a school security guard who has lived in
the neighborhood all her life, took her 13-year-old son, Jonathan,
shopping for sneakers during the speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right before school starts, they're getting these kids all
riled up,'' she said. ``They're going to get in trouble, and then
they're going to say, `At the peace march, they told me I should
have free speech.'''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were more police officers than participants as
the second Million Youth March got under way in Harlem around noon
Saturday, after a bitter court fight in which the organizers of the
event won a city permit over Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's vehement
objections.
</P>
<P>
   Many who attended the rally were disappointed by the yawning
expanse of pavement in front of the stage at 118th Street and
Malcolm X Boulevard, and blamed the low turnout on politicians who
condemned the march and media coverage that, they said, scared
people away.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:30 p.m., when a woman kicked off the program with chants
of ``black power,'' and a prayer, there were about 400 people
milling about _ far fewer than the estimated 6,000 who attended
last year's event, which ended in a violent clash with the police.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd barely filled half a block, never mind the six closed
off under the permit. By 2:30 p.m., the crowd had swelled to more
than 1,000 people, and organizers had set up a second set of
speakers north of 119th Street, though the rally did not stretch
that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have long been denied self-determination for black
people,'' Shaunette Daniels said in the opening speech. Calling for
black militias to protect themselves from the New York Police
Department, she added, ``We must make sure there are no unarmed
black men on these streets. Black power to the year 2000. Let me
hear you say black power.''
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman said about 1,400 officers, most in uniforms,
were deployed in the area, but only some 300 were visible in
clusters in the rally area, along Malcolm X Boulevard between 118th
and 124th Streets, making it seem like a lighter, and friendlier,
police presence than last year.
</P>
<P>
   The rest were stationed nearby _ including handfuls on top of
buildings _ with a phalanx of mounted units and other special
forces at the ready along the northern edge of Central Park at
110th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Khallid Abdul Muhammad, the primary organizer of the rally,
arrived to cheers about 11:20 a.m., and said he was confident more
people would show up before his speech. ``What do you mean?''
Muhammad said when asked about the sparse attendance. ``Our people
don't come until the main speaker. That's the tradition in the
black community.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, as he shopped at Century 21 clothing store to
celebrate no-tax week, Giuliani was smug. ``I think we have more
people here,'' he said to about two dozen reporters gathered for a
noon question-and-answer session. Earlier, after throwing out the
ceremonial first pitch at the Latin American Little League World
Series in Brooklyn, the mayor indirectly criticized what he has
referred to as a ``hate march.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you want to be doing with children,'' he said.
``You want them to be playing baseball, basketball, you want them
to be reading, you want them to be considering other pursuits, work
in the library, just having fun and learning teamwork rather than
talking about hating other people.''
</P>
<P>
   At the rally, there were precious few children, to whom the
event was supposed to be directed. Instead, there were adults
waving the green, black and red flag of African nationalism and
shooting videotape and photographs of, among other things, the
scores of newspaper and television reporters and photographers on
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to get a positive message and not worry about the
negativity from the media and the black politicians,'' said Cecil
Payne, 34, who brought his two sons to the march from Hackensack,
N.J. ``I came out here to see what Khallid Muhammad is all about.
I'm not a black Muslim, but I came out because he is the only one
to speak out against injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Curbside chatter, at some points, reflected the hate-filled
language of Muhammad ``Jews make all the decisions in this
country,'' said one man roaming the area with a megaphone. ``It's
about time for them to be overthrown.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people said they thought the march was about reparations
_ reimbursing black people for decades of discrimination. Some saw
Muhammad as a role model. ``He's a strong black man who speaks the
truth,'' said a woman who gave her name only as Sarah. ``We need
more black men like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Janita Fitzgerald, 18, a college student, said she thinks
Muhammad can help get teen-agers off the streets. ``It takes a
whole village to raise a child, that's what he's saying,'' she
said. ``Everybody's everybody's parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said that they support Muhammad's program of
self-reliance for African-Americans, but worry that his message has
been distorted, in part by the news media, and in part by his own
insistence on using epithets for whites in general and Jews in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``His message is good; it's just that I don't like the way he
gives it,'' said Omotayo Riley, 18, of Jamaica, Queens, part of a
five-man rhythm and blues group, Impact, which was scheduled to
perform later in the rally.
</P>
<P>
   James Udofia, 17, another member of Impact, said, ``Sometimes
you have to be aggressive in the way you speak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's aggressive,'' countered Riley, ``and then there's
threatening.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Johnson, a music producer from Teaneck, N.J., said blacks
need ``a rabble-rouser'' like Muhammad. ``We really need somebody
to let them know, hey, we're not content yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the crowd said they came not so much to support Muhammad
but to exercise their rights to free assembly, which were upheld by
two courts last week after the city denied the organizers a permit.
</P>
<P>
   One woman said she had decided not to attend because of the
problems after last year's march, in which 16 police officers and
14 participants were injured, but changed her mind after she heard
the Jewish Defense League asking people to stay away. ``Who are
they to tell us what to do?'' asked the woman, who identified
herself only as Linda.
</P>
<P>
   Others wore buttons reading, ``To Hell with Adolf Giuliani,''
and said they were marching to show opposition to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Shabazz, an attorney for the Million Youth March, held a
picture of Muhammad aloft on the stage and announced, ``White
America, you have created Khallid Muhammad, and now the chickens
have come home to roost.'' Then, he turned to the crowd and asked,
``How to you find Giuliani on the charge of police brutality?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilty,'' came the response.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you find Giuliani on the charge of the murder of
Diallo? How do you find Giuliani on the charge of the sodomy of
Abner Louima?'' Shabazz continued, prompting echoes of ``guilty,
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the perimeter of the rally, people in the neighborhood
were less than lukewarm to the event, although they said they
appreciated that the subways were open, unlike last year, and there
seemed to be more freedom to move about the streets than last year.
At the Salvation and Deliverance Church on 116th Street, about 100
people gathered for a special prayer service, holding hands in
small circles as they chanted, sang and hopped from one foot to
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a cause we believe in; we're not advocates of
hatred,'' said Jonathan Graham, 45, a guest minister at the church.
``Jesus is about love. That's what we believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, though, could not stay away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, just to see the spectacle,'' Ned Burrell said when
asked why he had attended the rally. ``Just the same way I would
come out to watch Hitler or David Duke. It's kind of like watching
a car wreck.''

 &HT;    Henley Gray: Driven by love of the chase
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, Ga. _ Henley Gray speaks of his life in two distinct
chapters: before the wreck and after.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just two different lives, really,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the wreck, Gray, now 66, was one of stock-car racing's
nomads. From 1964 to 1977, he drove in 374 NASCAR Grand National
races.
</P>
<P>
   But that life hit the wall Sept. 14, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He was coming into the pits at Michigan Speedway after a
pre-qualifying practice run. The car hit a bump and broke the right
front ball joint. Suddenly, the car took a hard left turn and
headed for the wall at 125 mph.
</P>
<P>
   An independent owner-driver who had to make his only race car
last, Gray didn't even consider what might happen to him. ``Before
I hit, I'm thinking: `How am I going to get this car back together
for the race?'''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been in a race car since, nearly 22 years. He keeps a
picture of the remains of that car in a drawer. But he lives that
moment every day. It's like time stopped on that September morning.
The truck he used to haul his car to races is in the back yard,
rotting in the grass. ``I used to think I'd want to be buried in
that truck,'' Gray said, ``but it's in worse shape than me.''
</P>
<P>
   He lives in the same frame house he has for 37 years. He can
point to the spot in the dining room where he and some friends
rebuilt a blown engine on a race weekend at Atlanta. That was
before he built the race shop out back. ``My wife stayed down
there; she didn't know what we were doing, rolling that engine over
on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray gets around gingerly. The wreck nearly took off his left
leg. He walks with a slight limp, and his joints are a barometer.
``I can tell you when it's gonna rain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His feet bear the scars of the acid that sprayed everywhere when
the battery in the Chevelle exploded against the wall. ``The doctor
wanted to know how I'd gotten this blue paint all over my feet,''
he said. The feet are discolored. ``To this day, I wouldn't go
swimming in a public place.''
</P>
<P>
   Still available to help
</P>
<P>
   He's got a shop full of race cars and equipment that might or
might not be for sale; he wants to be ready in case someone calls
him to help out a race team. Gray owned a car that made three races
in 1993; his last try was in 1995, but the car wrecked in
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Steve, works on the Winston Cup team of the No. 4
Chevrolet driven by Bobby Hamilton. When Steve calls and tells his
dad what's going on in the shop, he takes notes. Never know when
they'll come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through it so many times, thinking we were going to
get a deal,'' he said. ``It would go all the way to the last man
and fall through. That's a big letdown, when you think you're
getting ready to get some money to go race on and don't get it.
I've been talking to a guy with a lot of money. Until I see the
money, I won't let it bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife get by on minimum Social Security. ``It's not a
lot, but I didn't pay in a lot over the years,'' Gray said.
``Working for myself, there wasn't that much profit at the end of
the year. It was hard work. But we got by and paid all the bills. I
made a living all them years.''
</P>
<P>
   To race car drivers, especially from the early days, a
retirement fund was like a part for a foreign car. ``It was a case
of, `I'll take care of that next year,''' Gray said. ``If I could
have took 10 percent of all the money I handled and put it back (in
the bank), I'd have a decent retirement fund. I just spent it on
the car.''
</P>
<P>
   If it hadn't been for some inheritance money his wife came into,
some money donated by the racing wives' auxiliary and a $15,000
NASCAR insurance policy, Gray would have had trouble paying the
$20,000 bill for his 2 1/2-month hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't take care of their people,'' Gray said about
NASCAR. ``As far as they're concerned, you're just something
they've got to make money with. If they take care of their own,
it's because the drivers take care of each other, not because
NASCAR took care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray has no trouble recalling the wreck that changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the cars are made, the roll bars and the seat, when it
hit that concrete wall, it just acted like a big knife going down
the left hand side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just peeled the roll bars and the seat right out of the car
and just slung me out of the car against the concrete retaining
wall. I didn't go but about two car lengths before it stopped. I
didn't have any idea that I was really hurt. (But) it didn't take
long for the pain to start. It separated my left knee joint, just
tore it all loose. It was just dangling. When they picked me up, I
couldn't see my leg and I thought that it was gone. I remember
saying, `Well, a lot of people just have one leg; that won't be a
problem.'''
</P>
<P>
   During the years, he has come to terms with how close he was to
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two inches,'' Gray said. ``I feel like two inches was the
difference in me living and dying. That's how close that wall was
to me. I mean, I don't know how close it come to me, but right at
my left foot is right where the battery set. And the battery was
disintegrated. The wall hit that battery dead center. If I had hit
the wall, well, that would have been it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was months before Gray realized he'd never drive again. He
returned to simply being a car owner, hiring for a late 1977 race a
young Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnhardt was just getting started,'' Gray said. ``He drove
our car at Charlotte. Had a hard time making the race. And look
what's he's done now and where I am. I was having too much fun
driving, and I should have been working on sponsorships.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray began racing in 1956, winning more than 100 Sportsman
races, including the 1962 Dixie 400 in Atlanta, before moving up to
the big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from a quarter-mile dirt race to Daytona. It scared to
me death,'' he said. ``I don't know how you can be that scared and
having that much fun at the same time. Didn't run but 150 mph; I
thought I was going a thousand.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 374 races as a driver and another 118 races as a car
owner, 1964-95, he never won a Grand National _ later Winston Cup _
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way to do that,'' Gray said. ``It took a lot of
money to do that. I had to run the best I could with what money I
had. I did whatever it took to survive and be around at the end of
the year: Slowing down a little bit to finish or using a higher
gear in the car to make the motor last.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple game plan: Do well enough to recover the entry
fee and be running at the end to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to my first race at Nashville, if you bought one
tire for $55, they'd give you another tire. So I bought a set of
tires up there, cost me $110 for four new tires. They only paid
$100 to start, so I was going in the hole to start with. If it was
a hundred-mile race, they paid $100 to start. If it was a 500-mile
race, they paid $500 to start. I had to go by the starting money,
that's what I knew I had made. Everything made above that was
extra.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of times, he had to race on the best used tires he
could afford and nurse his car along, to be there at the end. Or
know when to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darlington in '71 paid $550 to start the race. You had to
finish 21st to make $150. It paid $175 for finishing 12th. You
gotta run a long time, a lot of laps, and it wasn't worth the
difference in the money. Sometimes, I'd just have to park. I had to
decide whether I could make the most money running or parking it.''
</P>
<P>
   He did finish fourth in the Winston Cup points race once, in
1966, by saving his car. ``I done it by running miles, finishing
races,'' Gray said. ``Just backing off going into the turns, not
turning quite as many rpms, I'd make sure the engine would live
till the end. You cannot race hard with no money. You have to race
by whatever your pocketbook will let you.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsponsored and without much funding, Gray found out quickly
that there was honor and money in making the field and just
finishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 25 of us that were called independents,'' Gray
said. ``We had one car that we carried everywhere. If we wrecked
it, we had to have that thing fixed by the next week or we didn't
have any money coming in. I used to make the statement if that
thing gets cut in half this week, I'd better have it put back
together by the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it felt like a great adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running all the races, going all over the United States,
getting to see the country, getting paid for it. I was really
enjoying it. Every week was a new experience going somewhere else
I'd never been before, getting on a different race track. It was
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loaded the family up and went on the road every week during
the summer. There was five of us. We had to find a motel with a
good pool for the kids (Cheryl, Pam and Steve). Pam said the other
kids at school only got to go someplace once a year. She got to
where she wouldn't even talk about it because she felt guilty, like
she'd be braggin' or something.''
</P>
<P>
   He was racing so often, 52 times a year, a friend told him,
``You must have ball bearings in your brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Raced everywhere
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a record book that says I went to Savannah three
times,'' Gray said. ``I don't remember going to Savannah but once.
See, every week you just went somewhere. I always had that fear I
was going to go to the wrong race track.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest headline he made in his career read: ``Henley Gray
Fined By NASCAR Heads.'' He was caught using nitrous oxide to juice
his Chevrolet to 186.521 mph in qualifying at Talladega in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just spray it right in the air cleaner,'' he said. ``If
you spray enough of it, it could make 100 horsepower more. A lot of
people were using it. You didn't want to get caught because you
didn't want to quit using it. If you was using that and had it
where it really worked right, you could make every race with no
trouble. I used it for a year solid before I finally got caught
(and fined $1,000.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the nitrous oxide is laughing gas. I had one guy
call me and ask, `What does it do to you? Does it make you brave?'
He thought it was something I was taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing left Henley Gray with a lot of pictures, some trophies
and a bum leg. But the warm memories, like the newspaper clippings,
have faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back now, I can't understand where the excitement
was,'' Gray said. ``I mean, I can't get that enthused. I'd like to,
but I just can't do it. One time we went to California on vacation,
back when I was running them dirt races, probably 1960. I had a
25-lap dirt race here that weekend. I wanted to be here for that. I
drove all the way straight through from California to run that
25-lap race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't walk across the street to sit down in a car now. I
done it so much and seen so much of it that I guess I just wore out
on it.''

   MACON, Ga. _ The letter arrived from Augusta, Maine, and was
postmarked Sept. 9, 1985 _ the 20th anniversary of the only
major-league game with just one hit.
</P>
<P>
   The younger son of Bob Hendley _ the forgotten pitcher in that
game _ excitedly tore open the envelope and marveled at the
contents. Inside was an autographed newspaper clipping, two signed
index cards and a personal note:
</P>
<P>
   ``Please say hello to your dad for me,'' it read. ``Sincerely,
Sandy Koufax.''
</P>
<P>
   Bart Hendley, now 28, still can't believe he got a response from
the reclusive Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wrote him, I really didn't think I'd hear back,''
Hendley said. ``It meant a lot to me. I think it did to my dad,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Koufax won three Cy Young Awards, pitched four no-hitters
and was a first-ballot inductee to the Hall of Fame. But even at
the top of his career, Koufax had to be perfect to beat another
left-hander on a September evening in Los Angeles almost 34 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant pitcher of the mid-1960s beat Macon native Bob
Hendley and the Chicago Cubs 1-0 in a pitching duel for the ages.
Koufax pitched a perfect game, striking out 14. Hendley allowed
only one hit _ a bloop double by Lou Johnson with two out in the
seventh inning. The Dodgers' run scored on a throwing error in the
fifth inning after Hendley's only walk.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Koufax told reporters, ``It's a shame Hendley
had to lose a game like that. But I'm glad we got that run, or we
might have been out there all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days later in Chicago, Hendley got a little revenge. He
pitched a four-hitter to beat Koufax and the Dodgers 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know about that,'' Bob Hendley said, smiling.
``All they remember is the other game. But I guess it's good to at
least be remembered for something.''
</P>
<P>
   Once hailed as the next Warren Spahn by Milwaukee Braves manager
Bobby Bragan, Hendley hurt his arm in the minors after reporting
late to spring training because of Army duty. He was only 48-52 in
seven major-league seasons with four teams. After a second elbow
surgery in 1969, he retired at age 30 and began a long coaching and
teaching career in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Hendley attended Mercer University in the offseason while
playing baseball and graduated in the spring of 1970. This year is
his 18th at Stratford Academy, after he had coached at Tattnall and
River North, also private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one to live in the past,'' said Hendley, 60. ``Who
knows what would have happened if I hadn't got hurt? What good does
it do to look back and think about it anyway? I've had a good life.
I really enjoyed getting a chance to coach my sons.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent, 31, and Bart, 28, were hard-hitting first basemen at
Stratford Academy and went on to play at Georgia Southern and
Georgia College, respectively. Brent also played three seasons in
the Oakland A's farm system.
</P>
<P>
   Hendley's school office has no memorabilia from his playing
career, and the items he has at home are tucked away out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd never know my dad had been a major-league pitcher,''
Bart said. ``He just doesn't like to show off or anything. I used
to have to get out baseball cards to show my friends that he really
had been a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendley did attend one old-timers' game in Atlanta in the 1980s,
but it mainly was to let his sons soak up the experience of being
in a major-league clubhouse. ``I was afraid the other players
wouldn't remember me,'' Hendley said. ``But they did. It was
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could forget Hendley, who saw the 6-foot-3 left-hander
match Koufax almost pitch for pitch. Just recently recalled from
the minors, Hendley did not give up one hard-hit ball against the
Dodgers. Johnson's bloop hit to right field came on a slip pitch,
Hendley's change-up.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had scored the game's only run two innings earlier. He
walked, was sacrificed to second by Ron Fairly, who also was born
in Macon, and then tried to steal third. Rookie catcher Chris
Krug's throw sailed into left field, and Johnson trotted home with
the game's only run.
</P>
<P>
   Given a lead, Koufax became even more dominant. He struck out
the last six batters he faced. Harvey Kuenn, pinch-hitting for
Hendley, whiffed to end the game, which was played in 1:43. Hall of
Famer Ernie Banks struck out three times. Koufax finished 26-8 in
1965 and struck out 382 _ a National League record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy had great stuff that night,'' Hendley said. ``I should
know. He struck me out twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hendley also was on the top of his game, he insists it
was not the best game of his career. Pitching for the Milwaukee
Braves in 1963, he had a no-hitter until Curt Flood of St. Louis
tripled with two out in the ninth inning. Hendley ended up winning
9-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing that no-hitter hurt,'' Hendley said. ``I was really
locked in and focused. That's the game I remember most.''
</P>

 &HT;    10 things you should know about hockey
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fred Shero, late coach of Philadelphia's ``Broad
Street Bullies,'' once defined his hockey philosophy as follows:
``Take the shortest route to the puck and arrive in ill humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Shero's words give some clue as to hockey's nature, but they
don't fully define what separates the sport from those with the
``ball'' suffix _ as in baseball, football, basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, as a primer for the NHL's return to Atlanta, we offer
this list of 10 things that make hockey different:
</P>
<P>
   1: ICE
</P>
<P>
   The NFL can claim some January playoff games in Green Bay and
Buffalo, but even the clumsiest of NHL goons is more graceful than
a nose tackle on frozen sod. According to legend, hockey has its
roots in England and France in the 1400s, when players of field
hockey or a facsimile sought an activity when lakes froze in the
winter. The French word ``hoquet'' means ``bent stick.'' Some
people felt the sport should be banned because it disrupted
peaceful skaters. Les Wimps.
</P>
<P>
   2: ZAMBONI
</P>
<P>
   Where there's ice, there's the funky tractor-like vehicle that
scrapes, cleans and floods the ice between periods. People have
become so fascinated with the machine that there is now a Web site
and a ``Zamboni Driver of the Year'' contest. And take this,
Canadians: The machine was invented by rink owner Frank Zamboni _
in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   3: PUCK
</P>
<P>
   A character in Shakespeare's ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
Anybody seriously defining puck that way instead of as hockey's
version of a ball _ a 3-inch-disk of hard, frozen rubber _ gets a
faceful of Tie Domi (No. 28, taunting Sandy McCarthy).
</P>
<P>
   4: FIGHTING
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, basketball and football most often eject fighters.
Hockey either embraces it or turns the other way, depending on what
seems politically correct at the moment. Fighting majors draw a
five-minute penalty. Translation: Players are thrown out for 1/12th
of a game. It's worth noting that Rule 52, ``Deliberate injury of
opponents,'' states as an example: ``A player with taped hands
injures an opponent in a fight. During the same fight, he is also
called for head-butting his opponent. The referee must assess a
match penalty (which includes a suspension) for injuring the
opponent with tape on his hands. A major and a game misconduct
shall be assessed to the player for head-butting.'' It contains a
lesson for younger players out there who want to avoid a
suspension: When in doubt, only head-butt your opponent.
</P>
<P>
   5: STICK
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a baseball player gets to use a stick, too. But it's
usually to hit the ball. A hockey player can find multiple uses for
his stick. For example, we have the ``butt-ending'' penalty, in
which the knob of the stick is jabbed into an opponent's rib cage.
We offer Ulf Samuelsson as an expert stickman, who, when asked his
opinion of the NHL's dirtiest player, responded, ``Can I vote for
myself?''
</P>
<P>
   6: PENALTY BOXES
</P>
<P>
   How much would you have paid to see Conrad Dobler in a penalty
box? Or Dennis Rodman? No other sport includes an incarceration
station. The Thrashers already have asked Matt Johnson for
decorating preferences in the home box at Philips Arena. Kidding,
Matt.
</P>
<P>
   7: POWER PLAY
</P>
<P>
   No other league allows a team to play short-handed, unless you
count the Clippers. When one team has a player in the penalty box,
the other team goes on the ``power play'' and more often than not
spends the next two minutes passing the puck 27 times but fails to
get off a shot. It is completely appropriate for fans to yell
something derogatory at the coach of the team that squandered the
scoring opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   8: CHANGING ON THE FLY
</P>
<P>
   No, it has nothing to do with the woman in seat 2A deciding to
go with the Halston instead of the Versace while somewhere over Des
Moines. It's a team making substitutions during play. All other
sports require a stoppage in play _ and, in the case of baseball, a
20-minute dissertation from the manager to the home-plate umpire.
</P>
<P>
   9: GOALIE MASKS
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has face masks. The NHL has works of art. Football's
togs police ensure that all helmets and masks conform to league
artistic standards. The NHL puts no limits on how goalies paint
their masks, within reason. The first goalie to decorate his mask
was Boston's Gerry Cheevers, who painted stitch marks to indicate
the cuts he would have received without the mask. At the other end
of the spectrum: Gump Worsley, the last mask-less goalie who
received more than 200 facial stitches in his career. Vancouver's
Corey Hirsch, a reflection of his sometimes flaky fraternity,
saluted ``Psycho'' by having a ``Bates Motel'' replica painted on
his mask.
</P>
<P>
   10: EUROPEANS
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has a Europe League. The NHL has a European flavor. No
other sport's top athletes _ Hasek, Jaromir Jagr, Peter Forsberg,
Alexei Yashin, Teemu Selanne _ carry a foreign passport. However,
that fact does not go over well in the provinces.

 &HT;    Thrashers on the (b)rink of debut
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Now, they are like every other NHL team. No more
mock expansion drafts, no more choreographed jersey unveilings, no
more blur of breakfasts with men's clubs from the local church and
synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this morning, when 65 players ranging in age from 18
to 35 and in dimensions from 5 feet 8, 185 pounds to 6-5, 232, and
hometowns from St. Paul, Minn., to Pribham, Czech Republic, step
into an Orlando ice rink, the Thrashers are just like everybody
else _ a hockey team in search of an identity, a roster and a power
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this is the climax to what we've been building the
last 13, 14 months,'' said the team's general manager and chief
architect, Don Waddell. ``We're 2 years old at this point, but
we're getting ready to kick off our second life.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't officially begin until Oct. 2, when the NHL expansion
team opens its regular season against the New Jersey Devils at
Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Waddell and coach Curt Fraser have more player
grading, trimming and molding to do than any other GM-coach duo in
the league. The 65 players represent 10 to 15 more than most NHL
teams will bring to camp, in large part because the Thrashers are
the league's closest thing to a ``help wanted'' sign. There are no
fan favorites yet, no players who will be retained merely for
salary or political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers have more jobs to fill than anybody else:
Twenty-three will make the NHL team; an additional 12 to 15 will be
kept and assigned to the top farm team, the IHL's Orlando Solar
Bears; and a few will be placed on the ECHL's Greenville Grrrowl.
The rest will be cut, traded or returned to their respective junior
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Most coaches will be looking to change a few roster spots and
maybe shuffle forward line combinations and defensive pairings.
Fraser's immediate concern is getting across to his players
elements of the big picture: rules, attitude, philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Like rule No. 1: No golf. Although, as Fraser said, ``If any of
our guys feel up to golfing, we're probably not doing our jobs as
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely going to lay out what I expect and what I need
out of everybody,'' Fraser said. ``We have guys coming from a lot
of different camps. Some of these guys probably feel like they've
been going to training camp for 100 years. But our work ethic has
to be second to none; our intensity has to be way above average.
This is the time to prove yourself and get a jump on other teams.
This is no country club.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he expected camp to be more physical than normal,
Fraser said, ``I'm sure some guys are going to try to show their
stuff. I don't want anybody getting hurt. I don't want anybody
getting hit from behind. But I do want them to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 65 players in camp, 10 are being given free-agent tryouts
and four are invitees of the Solar Bears. But the majority of the
Thrashers' roster will comprise players acquired in the expansion
draft (forwards Kelly Buchberger, Terry Yake and Matt Johnson, for
example), those picked up in pre- or post-expansion draft trades
(goalie Damian Rhodes, defenseman Gord Murphy) and free-agent
acquisitions (forwards Nelson Emerson and Ray Ferraro).
</P>
<P>
   The lone draft pick who will make the final roster will be
center Patrik Stefan, although rookie center Andreas Karlsson, a
former Calgary draft pick who has been playing in Sweden, also is
given a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers will rely on goaltending, defense and
aggressiveness in its first season, because skilled scorers are in
short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Based on last year's NHL statistics, the Thrashers' major
goal-scorers will be Ferraro (13), Emerson (13), Andrew Brunette
(11), Terry Yake (9), Mike Stapleton (9), Johan Garpenlov (8).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams can be skilled, and everybody can try to work
hard,'' Fraser said. ``But if we can have an edge to our hockey
club, work hard and pay attention to details, we can be
competitive. And we're going to have to be physical. My philosophy
is to be aggressive offensively and entertaining. I want to attack,
force the other team in mistakes. I want a team that energizes the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, the oldest player on the roster at 35, says he is
looking forward to a new atmosphere after Los Angeles decided he
could not return to 20-goal form because of injuries and age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel L.A. made a mistake not re-signing me? Yeah, I do,''
Ferraro said. ``I know I can still play. I'm disappointed they
didn't give me an opportunity to come back. But to be honest, I'm
excited to go to Atlanta. I'm excited to go to a team that wants me
to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   As to what he expects in camp, Ferraro said, ``I'm good friends
with one of the assistant coaches in Nashville, Brent Peterson, who
I used to play with in Hartford. He really liked what went on in
Nashville. He liked the enthusiasm everybody had. Nashville became
a tough team for everybody to play because they were enthusiastic
and they worked hard and all the players wanted to show everybody
that they belonged. Our biggest challenge will be to show everybody
we belong and that we can compete.''
</P>
<P>
   It holds true not just for the players but also for the general
manager and the coach. Waddell and Fraser have proved their
abilities at the Class AAA level, the IHL, but not in the NHL. The
fate of Ted Turner's $80 million investment is in their hands. But
both men will stick with the formulas that got them where they are.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, not blessed with an abundance of natural ability to play
hockey, nonetheless accumulated 193 goals and 433 points in 12
seasons and left his imprint on a number of imposing chins,
collecting 1,306 penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell, who also built independent expansion franchises in San
Diego and Orlando into league finalists, has excelled at the
business side of the sport and thinks that player evaluation is his
strength. That this is the NHL doesn't make a difference, he says.
The same thing that makes a player successful at one level _
talent, character, discipline, effort _ makes him successful at
another.
</P>
<P>
   In Waddell's blueprint, the team will be equal parts dash and
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing we wanted to do was create a foundation for the
future,'' he said. ``This is not a short-term project; it's a
long-term project. You lay the groundwork, you hire good people
and, when the puck drops, you start to move in another direction.
You look for ways to improve. You identify who are are, what you're
about, who are your leaders. It's not important what our record is
after five games but how we're doing three to five years from now.
That starts Oct. 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, who has a one-year contract plus an option, knows he
isn't here for the five-year plan. The transition must be quick and
painless, even if going to camp with an expansion team ``is a
complete unknown for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the guys personally, but in camp I'll have a lot
of time to get to know everybody a little bit,'' Ferraro said.
``It's going to be interesting. We're all starting on the ground
floor.''

 &HT;    What's happening in the NHL
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Need to get up to date on the NHL? Here are some
things to remember:
</P>
<P>
   Who are the rivals?
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers, who open the regular season Oct. 2 against New
Jersey at Philips Arena, are the NHL's 28th team. Two more
expansion teams, Minnesota and Columbus, will begin play in the
2000-01 season.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta will play in the Southeast Division with Carolina,
Florida, Tampa Bay and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   MVP eyes retirement
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek didn't retire, but he announced his
desire to do so after the season. Hasek, who almost single-handedly
won an Olympic gold medal for the Czech Republic and led the Sabres
to the Cup finals, said he wants his children to grow up in his
homeland, remarks that will not be amplified by the Buffalo Chamber
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the money?
</P>
<P>
   Right now, several NHL veterans don't plan to retire, but their
asking prices are scaring off buyers. Among the available
unrestricted free agents going into training camps: Ulf Samuelsson,
Joe Murphy, Pat Verbeek. Further, Boston granted Dmitri Khristich
``walkaway'' free-agency rather than accept a $2.8 million
arbitration decision.
</P>
<P>
   New season begins
</P>
<P>
   The regular season opens with two games Oct. 1: The defending
Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars will host Jaromir Jagr and the
Pittsburgh Penguins, who did not change addresses because they were
rescued in bankruptcy court by Mario Lemieux. In the other game,
the New York Rangers visit the Edmonton Oilers in a meeting between
the teams that bookend Wayne Gretzky's resume. Appropriately,
Gretzky, who retired after last season, will be honored in pregame
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers open wallet
</P>
<P>
   OK, not everybody is practicing fiscal responsibility. The
Rangers assaulted the free-agent market as if it were the
``seconds'' bin at Wal-Mart. They bought five players for $62.85
million, including Theo Fleury, whom Colorado chose not to re-sign
after his playoff fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   In the crease
</P>
<P>
   The NHL, red-faced after last year's Stanley Cup final ended on
a disputed goal by Brett Hull, moved quickly to chuck the
``skate-in-the-crease'' video rule. Video replays now will be used
only for determining whether a puck crossed the goal line. On-ice
officials will determine whether an attacking player has his skate
in the crease or causes interference during a goal.
</P>
<P>
   New overtime look
</P>
<P>
   League officials got a little gimmick-crazy in the offseason.
Determined to reduce the number of tie games _ 162 last year _ the
league decided that teams tied after regulation will be guaranteed
a point in the standings, no matter what happens in overtime.
Further, the teams will play four on four (not counting
goaltenders) during the five-minute overtime. Apparently, the NHL
has no plans to make anybody skate blind-folded.
</P>
<P>
   Twin-less in Vancouver
</P>
<P>
   While the first overall pick in the draft, the Thrashers' Patrik
Stefan, will play in the NHL this year, the second and third picks
won't. Vancouver's Daniel and Henrik Sedin decided to return to
Sweden to play with their team, MoDo, finish their last year of
high school and, presumably, attend their Swedish prom, which is
said to be killer.

TRIAL SET FOR OFFICERS LINKED TO ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Early on the morning of Dec. 19, 1997, a 36-year-old
Brooklyn man, Reginald Bannerman, was struck and killed by a No. 2
subway train rumbling into the Sterling Street station in Crown
Heights. The city medical examiner's office called his death a
suicide, although other investigators said they could not rule out
the possibility that he had accidentally fallen onto the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   His death might have remained an obscure misfortune, except for
what law enforcement officials say happened less than an hour
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   They said Bannerman, a recreation specialist in an after-school
youth program who also worked as a porter in a Crown Heights
restaurant, had been kicked and beaten by at least two off-duty New
York City police detectives outside the restaurant. The authorities
said a group of detectives had become disorderly during a
liquor-fueled birthday party in the restaurant, and Bannerman was
attacked after he had tried to quiet them down. The assailants also
fired their guns over Bannerman's head as he ran away from them,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 minutes later, Bannerman was struck and killed by the
train. In the interval, investigators say, a deeply upset Bannerman
had stopped at a friend's house, where he had refused the friend's
offer to take him to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of some or all of the four detectives is scheduled to
begin Tuesday in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn. None have been
charged in connection with Bannerman's death. Rather, they are
accused of crimes including assault and tampering with evidence
stemming from the confrontation with Bannerman outside the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear how many are to go to trial this week,
defense lawyers and prosecutors said, because the judge, Albert
Tomei, has not yet ruled on defense motions for separate trials and
for dismissal of the charges against one detective. The judge is
expected to issue his rulings Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Although the trial is expected to illuminate the violent
encounter outside the BBB Soul and Seafood Restaurant at Bedford
Avenue and Crown Street, lawyers in the case say it is not expected
to establish definitively what propelled Bannerman onto the subway
tracks less than an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   After Bannerman's death, his relatives said they had been told
by witnesses that the detectives had beaten Bannerman at the subway
station until he had jumped onto the tracks to escape. But the
investigators said witnesses they had spoken to had rebutted that
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have witnesses seeing him come into the station,'' one
investigator said last week, and ``nobody sees anybody pursuing him
to the station.'' The investigator said no witnesses saw any
detectives at the station.
</P>
<P>
   Other investigators have quoted a passenger at the station as
saying that Bannerman had been alone, pacing back and forth on the
platform. And the authorities also quoted the motorman of the train
that hit Bannerman as saying he had jumped.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Bannerman's family, Ronald L. Kuby, agreed last
week that there was no evidence that the detectives had chased
Bannerman to the station. But Kuby also rejected the theory that
Bannerman had committed suicide, insisting that the detectives were
responsible for the death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most likely thing that happened is that he was
injured so badly, about the head and one of his eyes, which was
protruding from its socket, that he accidentally fell in front of
the train because he was incapable of seeing where he was
walking,'' Kuby said. ``But for the beating, that would have never
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the indictments last year, the Brooklyn district
attorney, Charles Hynes, took a similar tack. While there was no
evidence to support murder or manslaughter charges, he said, ``if
Bannerman had not been assaulted in this manner, he would probably
be alive today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the indicted detectives, who at the time of the
incident were all members of the Brooklyn South narcotics unit,
said their clients were not guilty of any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the detectives, Lloyd Barnaby, 38, and Mark Cooper, 29,
are charged with second-degree assault, prohibited use of weapons
and reckless endangerment. Court papers indicate that the
prosecutors _ Charles M. Guria and Lance Ogiste, executive
assistant district attorneys in Brooklyn, and Matthew Greenberg, an
assistant district attorney _ will argue that Barnaby and Cooper
kicked and stomped Bannerman, beat him with a bottle and fired
shots over his head as he staggered to his feet and fled.
</P>
<P>
   Barnaby is also charged with intimidating a witness, Cooper is
charged with menacing Bannerman's brother with a gun, and both are
accused _ along with Detective Edward Howard, 31 _ of tampering
with evidence by picking up and hiding the spent shell casings to
thwart investigators. The fourth detective, Orice Connor, 30, is
charged with official misconduct, accused of failing to report the
actions of the others. Connor's lawyer is seeking to have the
charges against him dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Barnaby's lawyer, Dino J. Lombardi, said the detectives had
``felt themselves threatened by a couple of individuals who were
for some reason taking a negative attitude,'' and Bannerman had
``continued to provoke the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's lawyer, Alan I. Friess, said he was confident that the
jury would acquit his client.
</P>
<P>
   And Marvyn M. Kornberg, the lawyer representing Howard and
Connor, said, ``There's no question in my mind they will be
vindicated because they did nothing wrong.'' Kornberg said his
clients would forgo a jury trial, so that Tomei would render a
verdict for them while the jury rendered a verdict on the other
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives, who are free on bail, are on restricted duty
pending the outcome of the case. The most serious charge,
second-degree assault, is punishable by up to seven years in
prison.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sitting on a golf cart Saturday morning, puffing
contentedly on a thin cigarette, Richard Williams did not hesitate
when asked what his big-picture goals were for his fast-moving
daughters, Venus and Serena, in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep them sane until they are 25 years old,'' one of America's
most famous fathers said with the slightest of bemused smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Venus was on one of the nearby practice courts, hammering serve
after 100 mph serve. Serena was off resting for her third-round
match later in the day against Kim Clijsters. Behind Richard
Williams and family, he hoped, was the latest so-called tennis
controversy, an old-fashioned cafeteria food fight between Serena
and Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Martina to Serena: ``Big mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena to Martina: ``Bird brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Pete Sampras' withdrawal, this is what passed for
headlines during a mighty slow first week of the U.S. Open. And
when you really think about it, when you compare this to what
consistently stains the pro and college sports environment, we
should be accessed a penalty point and threatened with default of
news media privileges for so much as insinuating the
Williams-Hingis tiff as ``controversy.'' Abuse of concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said a couple of things that should never have been
said,'' Richard Williams said. ``Martina and Serena are just kids.
How many times do you tell your kids, `Don't say that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, unwittingly, it was Richard Williams who knocked over
the first glass, when he confidently raised the notion of an
all-Williams final, which naturally got under Hingis' thin,
competitive skin. He said he was postulating more than he was
forecasting. Either way, it wasn't a crime, not even an insult. It
was just another harmless observation that drew smoke from
sensitive teen-age ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trying to raise your kids in front of the world out
here, and at the same time you want them to win,'' Richard Williams
said. ``You're bound to make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, degrees of teen-age separation and tennis
family dysfunction. Practicing alongside Venus Williams Saturday
was Mary Pierce, whose father had to be legally severed from her
side, if not her psyche. And first on in the Arthur Ashe Stadium
Saturday was Jennifer Capriati, overpowering 11th-seeded Nathalie
Tauziat, 6-3, 1-6, 6-1, adding another stitch to the tatters that
the unfettered pressures of teen-age tennis made of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the extreme cases, the Hingis and Williams families
could collaborate on the how-to manual. The parents of these
players _ and throw in Lindsay Davenport's, too _ never seem to get
enough credit for the jobs they've done, under the most oppressive
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martina's a good kid,'' said Richard Williams, who Friday had
his shirt signed by Hingis in a staged peace process. ``She's No.
1, and that creates a whole new set of problems because everybody
is nipping at you, and it's only natural, especially for a kid, to
feel threatened. I can already see that Venus and Serena made
better decisions on certain things when they were younger than they
do now. These kids are out there trying to please the media, the
sponsors and their parents. I wouldn't be surprised if we see some
kid go nuts out here one day. It's rough, and that's why I kept my
daughters away from this for as long as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   wo years ago, more than a few tennis people were willing to
wonder if Richard Williams' girls, schooled away from the junior
tennis grind, faced the possibility of being colossal flops. Now,
every day at the Open is Williams Family Day. The sisters are
energetic, engaging, edgy. They appear to have it all, except Grand
Slam victories, and those are obviously coming.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis has five Grand Slam titles, but she is naturally wary of
the Williams sisters, the new girls strutting down the halls of her
school. Hingis isn't the first 18-year-old to be threatened by the
calamity of less attention. She'll survive these occasional,
inevitable eye-poking contests. Her nasty remarks last winter about
Amelie Mauresmo's lesbian lifestyle were not so easy to laugh off,
even if they were less scornful, more snide.
</P>
<P>
   When Billie Jean King heard that Hingis had called Mauresmo
``half a man,'' she said she would have to call Chris Evert, who is
Hingis' tour mentor. Zina Garrison and Pam Shriver serve in similar
capacities to Venus and Serena, as part of a Women's Tennis
Association player development program that, in Richard Williams'
typically expressed opinion, doesn't really work.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have any effect, it has to be about more than tennis,'' he
said. ``It has to be about family, about education.''
</P>
<P>
   Father or friend, mother or mentor, they all face the same
eternal obstacles of adolescence. There are always concessions,
bearable conditions in the interests of granting teen-agers their
space. Melanie Molitor's daughter, Hingis, had a rebellious early
summer, but what 18-year-old doesn't occasionally tell her parents
to get lost? Formal education or not, Hingis arrived on tour
thoughtful and well-spoken in a third language. She's talented and
smart, and with any luck, she'll survive being a kid. She'll be 25,
and then she and the Williams sisters can insult each other in more
mature ways.

 (SUBS top 14 grafs to rewrite with U.S. official's assessment of
Albright-Assad meeting and to add details.) (js)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ A widely anticipated meeting here Saturday
between Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the Syrian
leader, Hafez al-Assad, failed to yield anything that would lead to
the immediate resumption of talks between Israel and Syria, a
Clinton administration official said after the session.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the official said, the meeting between Albright and
Assad, their first in two years, was encouraging in laying the
groundwork for new Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who attended the meeting and has dealt with Assad
in the past, said that the Syrian leader stuck to his public demand
that Israel must recognize the 1967 border between the two
countries before talks can resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I heard any movement on that,'' the official said
of Assad's position.
</P>
<P>
   But in a general sense the encounter had been encouraging
because Assad said he recognized the new Israeli prime minister,
Ehud Barak, as a ``serious and honorable'' man, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright arrived here a day after announcing a new peace deal
between the Israelis and the Palestinians that the Clinton
administration hopes will boost the chances of a broader Middle
East settlement, including peace between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, who is in failing health, appeared to be in no worse
condition than expected Saturday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian leader, who met with Albright; Dennis Ross, the
administration's top Middle East negotiator, and other U.S.
officials, appeared to recognize the improved atmosphere for peace
in the region, according to the account given to reporters
traveling with Ms. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   But both Israel and Syria hold different views on how the talks
should begin, and the United States would work to bridge the
differences, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries wanted the United States to play a role in
bringing them together in a way that would produce a final
agreement rather than arranging talks for the sake of talks, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' role would be that of a ``facilitator,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides want us to play a role to find a way for them to
get together in a way that would produce a result,'' said the
official. The Syrians have said that once negotiations begin, they
can be completed in a matter of months. The Israelis have not
disagreed with this.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa,
the official said that Albright had raised the issue of Syria as a
country that is annually listed by the Clinton administration as a
terrorist state. In apparent preparation for making peace with the
Israelis, the Syrians have told Palestinian groups in Syria that
they should deal only with political matters and stop their
terrorist activities. The official said that Sharaa had confirmed
that directive.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before sitting down with Assad at his palace here, Albright said
at a news conference that she had brought ``some assessments'' made
by the United States on the particulars of the Israel-Syria
negotiations before they stopped in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that Washington was the depository of record for
the past talks, which involved Warren M. Christopher, the former
secretary of state, and that finding a formula for restarting the
negotiations on the basis of that record was the key to unlocking
the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the Syrian leader has insisted on what Damascus has
called an agreement by Yitzhak Rabin, made when he was Israeli
prime minister, to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which
Israel captured during the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has specifically said that he will agree to restart
negotiations only if the Israelis take as a baseline the return of
the Golan Heights to the boundary of June 4, 1967, meaning that
Syria's border with Israel would go to the shore of the Sea of
Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has also said that Rabin promised this in the last round
of negotiations if security measures for Israel, including the end
of hostilities in Southern Lebanon, were met. But the Israelis have
said that Rabin never made such a definitive pledge and that as a
new boundary, they want a border agreed to internationally in 1923,
which does not reach to the Galilee shore.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By demanding that Barak accept the 1967 line as a starting point
for the talks, Assad is leaving the Israeli prime minister with
little leverage, Israeli officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Saturday that the United States was willing to
help Israel and Syria again. President Clinton and Assad exchanged
letters in July on the prospect of resumed talks between the
Israelis and the Syrians, and they have spoken once on the
telephone since Barak's visit to Washington in July, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Albright stressed that the announcement of an
agreement on Friday night between the Israelis and the Palestinians
should spur on the Syrians. ``We have a window of opportunity, and
the light that came from yesterday's agreement should illuminate
the whole region,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister, repeated Saturday after a
joint news conference with Albright that Syria would like to
``resume the talks at the point where they left off,'' indicating
that the June 1967 line remains the Syrian starting point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all hope that will bring some good news from Israel,'' the
foreign minister added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the picture for the United States, according to
U.S. officials, was the effort over the last several years by
Ronald S. Lauder, a former U.S. ambassador to Austria, to negotiate
with the Syrians on behalf of the previous Israeli prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu. Clinton administration officials said that they
had not been briefed on what Lauder had done but were concerned
about the message that his talks had left with the Syrian leader.
Lauder has not commented on his talks with Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Itamar Rabinovitch, who conducted the Israeli side of the talks
with the Syrians from 1993 to 1996, said that Albright's trip was
vital for Barak's goal of completing a peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The new Israeli prime minister has said he wants to pursue two
tracks of the peace process _ with the Palestinians and the Syrians
_ at the same time, an ambitious plan that has not been
successfully pursued by former Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak needs to know whether the Syrian track is feasible,''
Rabinovitch said. ``Her trip could be an opportunity to see if it
is feasible.'' Rabinovitch said that Assad's ``cordial music''
toward Barak immediately after Israeli elections had been replaced
by ``critical tones, but not inimical tones.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rabinovitch said that Assad's failing health and his
desire to have a peace deal with Israel in hand before his son,
Bashar, succeeds him was a driving force for the Syrian leader.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Syria, Albright made a quick and unscheduled stop
in Beirut, the first secretary of state to fly in to the Lebanese
capital on an official plane since George Schultz in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Her visit was intended to demonstrate two important points,
administration officials said: that the Lebanese government was
making strides in normalizing life in the country and that the time
was right to widen the Middle East peace process to include
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met with the Lebanese prime minister, Selim Hoss, and
expressed the desire of the United States to see talks resumed
between Israel and Lebanon, her aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government is crucial to a successful negotiating
track between the Syrians and the Israelis because terrorist
groups, chiefly Hezbollah, operate in Southern Lebanon under the
control of the Syrians and with Lebanese acquiescence.
</P>
<P>
   One of Syria's conditions for negotiating with Israel is that a
negotiating track also begin with the Lebanese, an administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   While security conditions have improved substantially at the
Beirut airport, they have not improved sufficiently for U.S.
commercial aircraft to land there. A U.S. travel ban on American
citizens' visiting Beirut was lifted two years ago.

AMERICANS ON FAST PACE TO SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you do not count the volunteers who sneaked on the track
after midnight for a run and a well-deserved giggle, the last race
contested at this year's world track and field championships in
Seville, Spain, was won by Michael Johnson and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That victory in the 4x400-meter relay last Sunday was an
appropriate finish. Johnson had been the only athlete to break a
world record in Seville, running the 400 in 43.18 seconds, and the
United States was again the leading nation at the biennial
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it won its lowest total of medals, 17, since the
event began in 1983, 11 of the medals were gold, which was five
more than any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lingering paradox that Americans are dominant in this
global sport in which the American public takes scant interest,
except for a few days every four years at the Olympics. Imagine
what sort of greeting would have awaited Johnson at home if he were
an Italian; or what might have awaited Maurice Greene, a triple
gold medalist, if he were Swedish or South African.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' continuing success is a tribute to its vast
depth of athletic ability, the enduring strength of scholastic
programs and the expertise and energy of thousands of coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most visible of those coaches _ John Smith, who
coaches Greene, and Joe Douglas, Carl Lewis' former coach and
manager _ are guardedly optimistic about their sport's future in
the United States, after a season in which the number of domestic
meets and the level of domestic television exposure increased along
with revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some good responses; we're starting somewhere,''
Smith said. ``We've got a new chief executive officer taking over,
and we're trying to change a sport in one year that's been run
another way for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, the former miler who is USA Track and Field's new
chief executive officer, expressed particular delight with the fact
that for the first time at a world championship, both the American
men and women finished first overall, based on points acquired by
the top eight finishers in each event.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a good thing, as is the breakthrough by Inger Miller
in the sprints, C.J. Hunter in the shot-put, Anthony Washington in
the discus and the confirmations by Maurice Greene, Michael Johnson
and Marion Jones,'' Masback said. ``But there is also plenty of
room for improvement. We had what seemed to be an unfortunate
number of mishaps here.''
</P>
<P>
   Those included John Godina's unexpected struggles in the shot
put and discus; Jeff Hartwig's failure to qualify for the pole
vault final; Mark Crear's disqualification for two false starts in
the heats of the 110-meter hurdles; and Jones' season-ending back
injury in the 200 semifinal, which held her to one gold medal and
one bronze in Seville instead of the multiple golds she had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Her ability to achieve her even more ambitious goal of five gold
medals at next year's Olympics in Sydney, Australia, will depend on
her health and her ability to improve in the long jump. Several
experts, including Carl Lewis' sister Carole, who won a bronze in
the long jump at the world championship in 1983, believe that
Jones' back problems are linked to her jumping technique.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' awkward landings put considerable stress on her knees, as
well, and while Carl Lewis rarely needed to use all his jumps in
competitions where he was also sprinting, Jones had to use all six
of hers to acquire her bronze medal in Seville.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Lewis thinks that Jones needs to hire a long jump coach
to work alongside her coach Trevor Graham, whose specialty is the
sprints. But that will be for Jones and her entourage to decide,
and if her back problems are not new _ as Austrian agent Robert
Wagner has indicated and Jones' agent Charlie Wells has denied _
then even more reflection is in order.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, at age 23, is the world's dominant sprinter, a dominance
he underscored by bolting past Dwain Chambers of Britain with great
ease on the anchor leg of the 4x100 relay last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had around a two-meter lead, but that is not enough if I go
into the last leg knowing I'm racing against superman,'' Chambers
said wryly.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Masback's mind, in addition to the United States'
fortunes, were the doping and corruption scandals that have plagued
track and other sports recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much more we need to do and do better,'' Masback said.
``But we are doing something, unlike professional baseball and
unlike many other professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question needs to be asked of FIFA, what are you doing?
What are you spending on doping and what is your budget for it and
how many out-of-competition tests did you do last year? Because
that's good for the youth of the world that those questions are
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``And frankly as an administrator of sport, I feel that if we
need to take the hit so that all other sports begin to do what they
are supposed to do, then ultimately in the scheme of things, it
will be worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lingering doubts, there was much to value. There was
Hicham el-Guerrouj of Morocco floating more than running on his way
to the fastest 1,500 meters in major championship history.
</P>
<P>
   There was the wide-eyed Greene practically pawing the track
before running the second-fastest 100 meters in history. There was
the cancer patient Ludmila Engquist of Sweden covering her eyes and
crying after qualifying for the final of the 100 hurdles; Wilson
Kipketer diving across the finish line to preserve his dominance in
the 800; Inger Miller lying on her back after winning the women's
200 in the absence of Jones and kicking her legs in the air like a
teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   There was also Johnson hunched over next to the clock just past
the finish line, posing for photographers as his 43.18 glowed
behind him. But by Sunday night, there were no more numbers on
display on that device, only a farewell message: ``Adios Sevilla.''
</P>
<P>
   It was time to turn the clock ahead to Sydney.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Medical residents at Bellevue Hospital Center are
accustomed to seeing patients without insurance _ they flow through
the emergency room doors by the dozens daily. The residents never
anticipated that they would be among them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet often for weeks at a time, many of the more than 300
residents who study and practice medicine at the hospital find
themselves without medical insurance, apparently because of an
administrative problem that residents say they have been begging to
have corrected for almost two years.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has caused headaches over bills and put some
residents in the odd position of delivering care to patients while
having to scramble to obtain medical care for themselves, even at
times of serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue residents, like many young doctors in the city's
hospitals, work not only in the hospital where they are officially
employed. These residents also spend a significant amount of time
at New York University Medical Center, often in weeklong or
monthlong stretches.
</P>
<P>
   When they work at Bellevue, they are covered by Group Health
Inc., an insurance plan that is used by many city employees. Once
they move over to NYU, they go on that center's payroll and
benefits program and are assigned to another insurance program. The
problem occurs, residents say, when they return to Bellevue. There,
the benefits office is open a scant number of hours each week and
takes upward of six weeks to re-enroll the doctors in GHI.
Meanwhile, their NYU coverage expires, leaving them uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Residents at other hospitals who also do tours _ Mount Sinai
residents, for instance, often rotate through Elmhurst Hospital
Center in Queens, which, like Bellevue, is part of the city's
Health and Hospitals Corp. _ do not face this problem because they
are automatically and instantly enrolled in whatever system for
which they are working. Repeated requests to administrators to fix
the problem at Bellevue have gone unanswered, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is that you are not put on a health plan for about
two months,'' said Dr. Aaron Hexdall, a third-year resident in
emergency medicine. ``So you are not covered, and then in the
meantime you are transferred to another hospital again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents met Wednesday with Bellevue administrators, who
told them they would have to wait until the inspection of the
hospital by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care
Organizations, a national hospital inspection concern, before the
administrators would look into the problem, Hexdall said.
</P>
<P>
   But when reached by a reporter, a Bellevue spokeswoman said the
hospital would begin to address the problem soon. ``We are working
collaboratively to fix this problem,'' said Pam McDonnell, the
spokeswoman. ``The long-term plan is to have a discussion with the
chief financial officer regarding an automated system because
automation is the problem. We have hired a new person for the human
resources department to handle the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the hole in coverage has led to serious
problems. Dr. Lars Beattie, for instance, started his residency at
Bellevue in 1997 and later, after an injury, got a diagnosis of a
rare autoimmune disease. He started treatment in October 1998, and
the specialists he needed at NYU grudgingly accepted his GHI
insurance as a professional courtesy, he said. He went to NYU in
April and May, and when he returned to Bellevue in June, he had to
wait nearly two months for his GHI benefits to kick back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I had to pay out of my own pocket for
medications,'' Beattie said, adding that he paid $1,500. A device
for home therapy to suction a dangerous wound was needed, and the
company that made the device threatened to take it away, he said,
because of the lapse in his insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still haggling with GHI,'' he said. ``But you know, I can
call and I can speak, but if someone was injured badly enough that
they can't get to the benefits office, it is terrible because they
provide no help at all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What is more, GHI, the program that nearly all Bellevue
residents choose because it requires the lowest contribution on
their part, is not accepted by most of the doctors the residents
study with at Bellevue, the doctors interviewed said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem appears to center on the way the benefits office at
Bellevue operates. It is open only two days a week, residents say.
Because they work long hours and are frequently on call, residents
often cannot fit those times and the hour it takes to complete the
paperwork _ not needed at other hospitals _ into their schedule.
Moreover, there is rarely anyone available by telephone to walk
them through their options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us don't have time to even eat,'' said Dr. Salvatore
Pardo, a third-year resident who also works in the emergency room
and said that some bills for diagnostic tests he needed fell into
the black hole between hospitals' coverage. ``You come in before
they open and leave after they are closed. People feel like they
don't have access to medical care even though they are doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Levy, executive director of the Committee of Interns and
Residents, the union that represents 9,000 doctors in training in
New York, said that as far as he knew, this was a problem limited
to Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hexdall said, ``We can always walk into our own
emergency room, but why do we have to ask for a personal favor to
get personal health care?''

   CANTON, N.Y. _ Poor Canton, so close to Canada, so far from any
really decent malls. How is it going to get college students to
come all the way up here?
</P>
<P>
   St. Lawrence University, Canton's biggest employer, worries
about those kids and that problem, and it thinks one answer is to
get the old farm village to spruce up a bit, put a little modern
gloss on the aging Main Street, something Starbucky, maybe,
something GAPpy. Anything that _ in the words of Tom Coakley, the
university's vice president _ creates a sense of ``retail
vibrancy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Retail vibrancy is important for the social atmosphere of a
university,'' said Coakley as he showed off an example of what he
means, the university's new bookstore, whose dark wood and
slate-green accents mimic Barnes &AMP; Noble right down to the category
signs on the bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shopping is entertainment; these kids have been raised being
entertained in malls, and that goes to this atmosphere, but dressed
up in a book-oriented, liberal arts environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even a 100-year-old university with 600 well-paid jobs has
to tread softly when it comes to telling people up here that they
should follow its lead to make Main Street more appealing to
prospective students and _ more important, Coakley believes _ to
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Albany and Syracuse are downstate to people in St. Lawrence
County, and New York City, seven hours away by car, may as well be
in Virginia. So when the campus basically tells the locals to wash
their faces and tuck in their shirts for the visitors, some people
get their backs up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the North Country are very independent, always have
been,'' said Marilyn I. Mintener, a former mayor and the owner of
the Pear Tree gift shop on Main. ``So sometimes they don't like
being told what to do, and maybe the university has been pushing a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Kingston, owner of Josie's Little Pizzeria, calls the
university ``the company,'' and puts the friction down to class.
``It's just two different classes of people, the university and
everybody else, and they just think differently, and they have
different agendas.'' She paused, then added, ``But they bring a lot
of culture. If the university wasn't here, we'd have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The campus is hardly struggling. Enrollment has dropped from
2,400 in the mid-1980s to 1,900, but only because the university is
choosier, Coakley said. It has been spending $20 million a year on
physical improvements for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the university is trying to look ahead, and it would help if
Main Street had a little more of Chapel Hill or Harvard Square
about it, and a little less deep-woods-barely-hangin'-on.
</P>
<P>
   So St. Lawrence has already handed out tens of thousands of
dollars in low-interest loans to help merchants improve their
storefronts. In exchange for closing Leigh Street through campus,
the university has promised $300,000 to open up more parking behind
Main Street ``to give the village a more mall-like feeling,''
Coakley said.
</P>
<P>
   But the village is balking, and who knows when anything will be
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people in the village think St. Lawrence is trying to
run the place,'' said David Curry, the owner of a no-name bar on
Main and a village trustee who opposed closing Leigh Street. ``But
if it wasn't for them, no one would have heard of Canton.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can move Canton in the right direction, it ought to be
Tommy Coakley. He grew up here, played hockey for Canton High and
went to Brown on a hockey scholarship. He lost a leg in an ambush
in Vietnam and married a nurse from the amputee ward. He earned a
master's in economics at Wharton, and, in the timeless pattern of
North Country kids who leave for a while, he found himself headed
home.
</P>
<P>
   Now he worries about making sure young people who visit Canton
and St. Lawrence see what he sees _ the clean air, the quiet, and
the friendly people, even if they do get a little crusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban campuses worry about urban blight, and rural campuses
worry about isolation,'' Coakley said. ``In terms of running a
successful university, having a little isolation and being a little
behind the rest of the world is OK The important thing is not
getting a lot behind.''

For 14 years, Henley Gray raced against the best NASCAR could
muster, but he seldom had the speed to make a big splash on the
track. And now, with the exception of his beat-up body, he doesn't
have much to show for his career _ few trophies, not much money.
``Raced all over the country,'' said Gray. ``And I can't for the

   PAGE 1: TARGETING THE QUARTERBACKS - NFL quarterbacks have
become an endangered species. Rushing the quarterback is at a
premium, and blitzes have become an integral part of nearly every
team's defensive package. And it's no longer just defensive linemen
running down the quarterback. Linebackers, cornerbacks and safeties
are flying into backfields as well. (Schlabach, Atlanta

   HKN-THRASERSSTART _ ORLANDO, Fla. _ Now, they are like every
other NHL team. No more mock expansion drafts, no more
choreographed jersey unveilings, no more blur of breakfasts with
men's clubs from the local church and synagogue. The Thrashers are
just another a hockey team in search of an identity, a roster and a
power play as 65 players take the ice for the beginning of training
camp. ``I guess this is the climax to what we've been building the
last 13, 14 months,'' said the team's general manager and chief
architect, Don Waddell. ``We're two years old at this point, but
we're getting ready to kick off our second life.'' The first
regular-season game is Oct. 2 against New Jersey at Philips Arena.

   w/HKN-THRASHERS-KNOW _ ATLANTA _ Fred Shero _ the late coach of
the Philadelphia's ``Broad Street Bullies''_ once defined his
hockey philosophy as follows: ``Take the shortest route to the puck
and arrive in ill humor.'' If Shero's words give some clue as to
hockey's nature, it still doesn't fully define what separates the
sport from those concluding with ``ball'' _ as in baseball,
football, basketball. Therefore, as a primer for the NHL's return
to Atlanta, we offer a list of 10 things that make hockey
different. Led by ice, of course. (Schultz, Atlanta

REAL ESTATE: BATTLING BACK AFTER HOUSEHOLD DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BEVERLY SOLOCHEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For four days last spring, Eve and Stanley Queler
lived in an occupied zone, their sprawling Upper West Side
apartment taken over by a small platoon of workers with ladders,
steam-cleaning machines, vacuums and crates stuffed with rags,
sponges and brushes. Streaked with soot and reeking of rubber _ the
residue of a baby-bottle burn-down atop the stove _ the apartment
had been rendered useless.
</P>
<P>
   In Montrose, Gregory Fucheck and his family similarly shared
their home for five days with six former strangers, all workers
dispatched to undo a storm of soot from a malfunctioning furnace.
On the Upper East Side, Maryell Semal lived briefly with a small
group of workers and then for 19 months with the equipment
necessary to dry out a flooded apartment.
</P>
<P>
   And in Chelsea, Kieran McGonnell and Gregg Driben welcomed five
workers who, over four days, performed a miracle of cleanup after a
fire swept through their ground-floor co-op.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these cases, the workers and equipment came from
companies that undertake the nightmarish tasks of cleanup, repair
and restoration when homeowners or renters are hit with household
disasters: floods, fires, foul odors, soot and other kinds of
calamities.
</P>
<P>
   Usually referred to the site by insurance companies, these
specialists in household disasters labor to save as much property
as possible in an emergency so that losses to both the insurers and
the residents are minimal. But that they exist at all is the big
surprise _ and relief _ to the householder in the midst of
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would have to clean the house myself,'' said
McGonnell, an artist and scenic designer whose fire-blackened
apartment held more than 70 of his oils and watercolors.
Envisioning endless trips to the hardware store for buckets and
brooms _ ``my brain kind of stopped working,'' he said _ he planned
to spend two to three weeks cleaning. But by the next day, Maxons
Restorations Inc., a large local property-restoration company, was
on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come in at peoples' worst moments and try to turn a
negative into a positive,'' said Damon Gersh, president of Maxons,
which works on both commercial and residential properties. With a
staff of 25 that responds to emergencies around the clock, Gersh
also taps into a network of 500 other specialists who attend to
everything from fine arts and antiques to damaged books to
chandeliers, silver sets or oriental rugs.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 1,200 such companies worldwide, 115 of which
are in the New York metropolitan region, according to Kimberly
Howard, executive director of the Association of Specialists in
Cleaning and Restoration, one of several trade groups.
</P>
<P>
   Most provide full disaster-restoration services, although some
specialize in one kind only, such as water damage. Yet, Ms. Howard
said, ``Most people are not familiar at all with their services;
after all, most people don't like to think about disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Disaster was the last thing on Fucheck's mind when he woke up
one morning last winter to find black soot in his tissue when he
sneezed. For two days he had noticed but ignored some soot on the
walls of his newly built four-bedroom colonial. But now, he said,
the soot was everywhere. The smell of oil pervaded his home, which
is heated by forced air in open grates in the floors.
</P>
<P>
   A call to his oil company produced an inspector who called
Fucheck's insurance broker. He, in turn, reached for Westfair
Restoration Services of Thornwood. The Fucheck's malfunctioning
furnace was producing ``puff-back,'' an industry term for a
houseful of soot. The soot not only blackened the hems of the white
curtains skirting the heat registers on the floors but also fell
like a veil over every surface and object in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the house of our dreams,'' Fucheck said. ``We thought
everything was ruined. We felt terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Goomrigian, one of four project managers at Westfair,
quickly arranged for six people to be at the Fucheck home from 8:30
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. for five days to methodically scour, polish,
vacuum or shampoo each object in the house. Clothing was picked up
for dry cleaning. Every dish, every knickknack, every toy, was
individually hand-washed. Each room was deodorized. ``It looked
like a brand-new house,'' Fucheck said. ``It had never been so
clean before.''

   Soot, smoke and a powerful, noxious stench greeted the Quelers
one mild April morning when they returned home from a stroll with
their grandson, for whom they were baby-sitting. A forgotten potful
of rubber nipple rings and a plastic baby bottle being sterilized
on top of the stove had melted and burned in their absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a stupor,'' Ms. Queler said. ``I could not breathe.
We kept thinking that if we opened windows and put on the ceiling
fans, it would help. But we didn't realize it was going into the
carpets and upholstery.'' By the time Maxons was called more than
36 hours later, the soot was everywhere.

work, memorabilia from their international travels, oriental rugs,
colorful textiles and musical and office equipment, needed over
$8,000 worth of cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical damage to the naked eye was not apparent, except
in the kitchen,'' said Howard White, a vice president of Maxons who
supervised the systematic work. The odor, however, was
``overwhelming,'' he said, ``and on closer inspection, you could
see the fine residue of soot that had settled everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Queler, the conductor who leads the Opera Orchestra of New
York, was especially worried about her music. ``I have essential
work that I keep here,'' she said. Aside from a grand piano that
she feared would rust, she had records and books, stereo and CD
equipment, and endless materials from her 30-year-career as an
international musician.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she said, ``I had nothing to worry about. They took
every book out and cleaned it; every record album. They cleaned my
fax, my word processor. They washed curtains. It was just
amazing.'' The piano was cleaned inside and out. Radiators were
dismantled and vacuumed. Item by item, room by room, the house was
sanitized and deodorized. ``The apartment needed a painting
before,'' Ms. Queler said. ``It doesn't anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every household mishap is as extensive or costly as those
that befell these residents. Indeed, according to a 1997 study by
the Insurance Research Council, average national residential
property claims, including thefts, range from $2,000 to $4,000. For
New York City, the average was $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Some accidents _ a spill of merlot on the sofa, a toaster fire _
might be handled by the occupants themselves, with a boost from
Good Housekeeping. But according to Michael Griggs, president of
the National Institute of Disaster Restoration, most restoration
companies handle small problems and large, even if householders
prefer to pay themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gilbert, president of Westfair Restoration Services,
said it is largely when the insurance deductible is high, about
$1,000, and the damage relatively small that people prefer this
option.
</P>
<P>
   The most common situation, Gilbert said, is a water-damaged
carpet in a small flooded room, which would run $400 to $450 to
extract water, remove the padding, apply anti-microbial agents,
dehumidify, provide fans and then return to install new padding and
clean the rug. Cost estimates are provided free.
</P>
<P>
   When the restoration specialists are hired, insurance companies
and individual householders typically receive itemized accounts of
the work performed. One such 15-page report by Maxons for fire
damage in a SoHo loft included these items: cleaning of three frame
mirrors at $5 each; dismantling and cleaning of a toaster oven, $5;
painting the spiral staircase of 13 steps, front and back, plus
banister, using oil-based metal paint, $195; cleaning 300 CDs, 25
cents each, and a 10 percent ozone-decontamination charge on the
dry cleaning of a host of furs, linens and other fine materials,
$91.15.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Howard of the restoration association,
insurance companies often work with preferred vendors and send one
they trust to a site after they have been notified. Indeed, Ralph
Chardavoyne, an insurance broker with Cernese, Pomerantz, Kirtman
in Croton-on-Hudson, who represents Fucheck, said he almost always
calls Westfair in an emergency. ``My clients,'' he said, ``are
looking for immediate help.''
</P>
<P>
   Others prefer to let clients pick their restoration companies.
Either way, policyholders are typically covered for restoration and
cleaning services if that is what is needed. ``It is the
responsibility of the insurance company to make you whole,'' said
Jeanne Salvatore, vice president of consumer affairs at the
Insurance Information Institute in New York.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When William B. Martin, the claim section manager for State Farm
Insurance in Jericho, gets an emergency call, he sends out an
adjuster who makes an immediate assessment at the scene and lets
the policyholder decide whom to call. Knowing that homeowners may
well be in shock, the adjuster will offer names, if asked. But,
Martin said: ``People are sometimes touchy, and rightfully so. A
certain percentage want to be directly involved in picking their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   When clients choose their own restoration companies, Martin
recommends that they check with the local consumer affairs
departments or Better Business Bureaus for complaints and that the
chosen company be licensed, bonded and willing to provide
references. Another useful benchmark, specialists say, is an
affiliation with professional associations or the employment of
workers certified by the associations.
</P>
<P>
   And when clients pick their own restoration companies, Martin
suggests a conversation between the companies and the insurance
adjusters to be sure there is agreement on pricing.
</P>
<P>
   How much residents end up paying out-of-pocket _ deductible
notwithstanding _ depends on how much and what kind of coverage
they buy.
</P>
<P>
   It is wise, brokers say, to choose replacement coverage rather
than actual cash value, even though premiums might be 10 percent to
15 percent higher. With cash value coverage, depreciation is
deducted on everything from carpeting to computers and that can
make a huge difference should a loss occur.
</P>
<P>
   Owners and renters alike need to be covered for personal
property and liability. Homeowners should be covered for the total
cost of rebuilding their home, Ms. Salvatore said.
</P>
<P>
   Co-op and condominium owners need coverage for improvements and
alterations like new kitchen stoves or built-in storage cabinets.
Most basic policies cover damage caused by fire, smoke and water
problems stemming, say, from plumbing breakdowns. But brokers warn
that flooding is not covered in standard policies and also
recommend that homeowners check to see if they are covered for
backups of sewers or drains.
</P>
<P>
   While water damage is the most common kind of problem that
restoration companies face, they also encounter the unusual.
Gilbert of Westfair recalls the vandal-like damage caused by three
wild turkeys in one Pound Ridge home. And every year, he said, his
company is called to as many as 25 homes that have been visited by
spraying skunks (which is not covered in most insurance policies).
Timing is critical in all cleanup jobs. Once eau de skunk
infiltrates fabrics, Gilbert said, it is ``very difficult'' to
remove.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring books is a particular challenge. It is not that they
cannot be saved; libraries and bookstores confer accolades on
companies that have rescued large collections. But water damage can
be fatal to books.
</P>
<P>
   Gersh of Maxons said, ``They warp, pages dry as a sodden mass,
ink runs and paper yellows.'' Yet if the book is valuable _ an
assessment that can sometimes be intensely personal _ the volume
can be freeze-dried and reborn in a frozen environment. This is a
very expensive process and more often done for commercial or
institutional clients. Despite the elaborate process, the results,
Gersh said, ``may not be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Ms. Semall's books were salvaged from a devastating flood
she lived through several years ago after firefighters put out a
blaze that claimed the life of a tenant in the apartment directly
above her own two-bedroom Manhattan co-op.
</P>
<P>
   The water first soaked the master bedroom, where she had quickly
propped an umbrella to protect a new computer. With the help of the
superintendent and her son, who lived nearby, she put out pails and
drop cloths and watched as the water, which travels slowly,
mysteriously and relentlessly, continued to saturate her home for
more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Maxons arrived the day after the fire and immediately lifted and
removed the wall-to-wall carpeting throughout the apartment, all of
which was ruined. Using blowers and commercial-grade dehumidifiers
that pull 200 pints of moisture out of the air a day, the company
started a process that ultimately saved Ms. Semall's handsome
herringbone-patterned oak floors, and indeed, almost her entire
home.
</P>
<P>
   But it took an unusual amount of time. The apartment above was
sealed and off limits for months as the estate was being settled,
so no one could get to the source of the problem. ``Every room
upstairs was piled with debris that had been hosed down by
firefighters,'' Gersh said. Even when the dripping stopped, the
moisture, trapped in the floors and walls, was unyielding, and
created a constantly high humidity level in Ms. Semall's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year she lived in chaos, occupying just a small
slice of the living room. She slept on the sofa. Painters,
plasterers, electricians and other workers, all deployed by Maxons,
were regular visitors. ``All I did was give them coffee and cake,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Three elegant antique wooden chests were removed so specialists
could repair their warped and loosened veneers and joints. Window
frames were replaced. The contents from a corridor of dampened
closets were dry-cleaned, boxed and stored. All surfaces, as well
as her books and objets d'art, were treated with mildewcide to
prevent mold and mildew.
</P>
<P>
   Seated now in her comfortable and dry living room, she points
out, with gratitude, that she lost nothing she cared about. Two
dresses, maybe. A few blankets. And yes, the drapes disintegrated.
More important, her ceiling did not collapse and the walls
eventually stopped cracking. And her precious books and other items
of real value to her were saved, treated ``with love and care.''
</P>
<P>
   McGonnell, the artist whose home burned in Chelsea, said he
feared that his richly colored oils, swathed in soot, could not
possibly be restored ``to their glory.'' But he watched ``in
fascination,'' he said, as their vibrant colors re-emerged at the
gentle hands of skilled cleaners applying chemical sponges.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful that his losses were limited, he also acknowledges the
psychological role that the restoration company played in the
ordeal. ``They were not just courteous, but so sensitive to our
needs,'' he said. ``It was extremely comforting to me.''

REAL ESTATE: RULES ON PERMITS VARY WIDELY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Conn.)  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your home is your castle, right? Just try building a moat
without getting permission from the plumbing inspector first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're here to ensure the safety of the occupants of
a home,'' said Brian Webster, code enforcement officer for the town
of Vestal in Broome County, N.Y. ``And if you tell me, `Hey, it's
my house, I can do what I want,' I'll tell you, `That's fine while
you live in it, but what about future owners who will have to live
with your mistakes?'''
</P>
<P>
   That sums up the rationale behind the millions of words
contained in the volumes of building, electrical, plumbing and
construction codes found in code-enforcement officers' offices in
cities, towns and villages across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And while the laws of physics ensure that the rules of proper
construction are basically the same wherever you live, the manner
in which those rules are applied and enforced varies _ sometimes
significantly _ from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some towns around here require you to get a permit when you
put new siding on your house,'' Webster said. ``But we count siding
as a property-maintenance thing, so we have no permit
requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the building and construction rules that apply to
owners of commercial properties and residential rental dwellings
are fairly strict; most local governments require building,
plumbing or electrical permits for any work that could even
remotely affect the health or safety of occupants. The rules for
owner-occupied one-family and sometimes two-family houses, on the
other hand, range from permissive to prohibitive, depending on the
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the only way you're going to be able to find out for sure
what rules apply to you,'' Webster said, ``is to call the local
building inspector.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, for example, owner-occupants of one-family houses
can perform just about any type of work imaginable on their
buildings, subject to certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a one-family house, a homeowner can do almost everything,''
said Louis Scala, the construction official for North Bergen, N.J.
``All you have to do is demonstrate that you have the knowledge and
ability to do it.'' And that can be done, he said, by a simple
question-and-answer session with the appropriate inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Because a homeowner can do work in a house, however, that does
not mean the homeowner's work will escape the scrutiny of local
officials. Scala explained that under New Jersey's Uniform
Construction Code, building, plumbing or electrical permits are
generally required whenever a property owner intends to build,
repair, renovate, alter, reconstruct, demolish or change the use of
a structure.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Scala said, permits are generally required whenever
any electrical work is being done, and for any mechanical work that
could affect public health or general safety. And whenever permits
are issued, Scala said, one or more inspections are sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Scala said that if a new doorway is cut in an exterior wall, the
inspector will likely require a framing inspection to determine
whether the support beam above the new opening is of adequate
strength and size, an insulation inspection to determine whether
adequate insulation is installed in the exterior wall, and a final
inspection after all work has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   And if electrical or plumbing work was performed as part of the
project, he said, an inspection of the work must be performed both
before and after the walls are plasterboarded.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York City, homeowners generally do not have to worry
about working on their electrical or plumbing systems because, by
law, they are not allowed to touch them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules here for electrical work are pretty simple,'' said
Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of
Buildings. ``For anything other than plugging something into an
outlet, you have to hire a licensed electrician.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fink said that the installation of things like
waste-disposal units, ceiling fans and even light switches
typically required the services of a licensed electrician because
it is necessary to tap into the house's electrical system to
perform the work. And while that may seem like overkill, she said,
the rules are intended to protect residents' safety by ensuring
that everything connected to the electrical system is properly
wired and grounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a ceiling fan installed by a licensed
electrician,'' she said. ``I ended up paying more for the
electrician than I did for the fan, but I have the peace of mind of
knowing it was installed properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Satish Babbar, acting deputy commissioner for technical affairs
for the Department of Buildings, said that while a homeowner could
do some minor plumbing work in a single-family home without having
to obtain a permit, the law typically required a licensed plumber
for any work for which a permit was required.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to change a faucet or retile the bathroom walls,
you don't need a permit,'' Babbar said. ``But if you want to move
the sink across the room, you need a permit, and only a licensed
plumber can take out a plumbing permit.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, unlike places that require
inspections by local officials, New York permits licensed
professionals to inspect and sign off on their own work. For
example, he said, a plumber who remodels a kitchen can provide the
Department of Buildings with a certification that all work has been
completed according to applicable codes.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that homeowners in New York City can do
themselves, Babbar said, is construction work. However, he said,
permits are generally required for any work that alters or enlarges
the structure or changes the use of the building _ a broad caveat
covering everything from adding new doorways in load-bearing walls
to adding new walls that create additional rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And whenever a permit is required for a construction project,
Babbar said, a registered architect or professional engineer must
submit plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say you want to build a deck yourself,'' Babbar said.
``Well, you can do that. But first you have to hire an architect or
engineer to submit plans with the application for the permit and
you have to file a certification saying that you're not employing
other people to do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, New York's building code allows the professional _ in
this case, the architect or engineer _ to inspect the finished work
and then submit a certification to the department that the work has
been completed in accordance with the plans and the code.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut homeowners, like those in New Jersey, are generally
allowed to perform most work in their homes themselves. And while
permits are typically required for anything other than minor
repairs, it is not necessary to hire a licensed architect or
registered engineer to draft them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most towns in Connecticut, anybody can draw up your
plans,'' said Aris George Crist, a licensed architect in Greenwich,
``but a good architect will enter into a dialogue with an owner.''

REAL ESTATE: IN SAN JOSE, HOPES FOR A MORE LIVABLE DOWNTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By MORRIS NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Two high-density residential developments,
one a rental building and the other a condominium project, are the
latest expressions of a 20-year effort to create a vital downtown
in the largest city in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The projects represent the city's attempt to introduce new
housing into a thinly populated urban center. With 900,000 people,
San Jose is the third-largest city in California, but less than 1
percent of its residents live downtown.
</P>
<P>
   With the completion of the new apartment and condominium
complexes, the city will have built only a quarter of the 8,000
units it hopes to complete by 2010, when it expects the population
of downtown San Jose to have swollen to 19,000, from 6,585 today.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders hope that the two new projects, with 424 housing
units, and projects with 1,200 more housing units in the planning
stage will bring hundreds of new residents into the downtown area,
where extensive redevelopment has already brought new office
buildings, parks, cultural venues and historic preservation
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those new developments were either created by or heavily
subsidized by the San Jose Redevelopment Agency, which is sprucing
up the downtown area to compete with better-established office
locations throughout suburban Santa Clara County _ the region
popularly known as Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being the largest urban center in Santa Clara County,
downtown San Jose is still coming from behind in the competition
for high-tech tenants in Silicon Valley. Smaller, more suburban
cities like Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Mountain View and Cupertino have
been the main beneficiaries of the phenomenal expansion of computer
and Internet-related companies.
</P>
<P>
   Until World War II, San Jose was an unremarkable farming
community whose greatest distinction was being the seat of Santa
Clara County. Surrounded by fruit orchards, the city was a center
for the canning of pears, prunes, cherries and apricots. After the
war, it grew as a bedroom community for the region's computer- and
defense-related businesses. In the 1950s, city officials saw
homebuilding and annexation as sources of growth, and the city
expanded by 47 square miles during that decade.
</P>
<P>
   The small downtown area was suffering from the loss of major
employers, however, many of them leaving for the suburbs. And it
sustained a severe symbolic loss in 1954, when the city government
left downtown for peripheral neighborhoods. The image of a
depressed downtown became even more dismal in the 1960s, when
entire blocks of aging buildings were bulldozed in the name of
urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Korabiak, downtown coordinator for the Redevelopment
Agency, recalled the dismay he felt when walking through downtown
in 1982, shortly after joining the organization. ``I walked down
First Street and said, `What have I got myself into?' '' he
recalled. ``It was that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, San Jose was just starting a long-term
redevelopment program, funded principally by a portion of the
property taxes levied on newer, suburban-style business parks on
the city's northern and southern edges. The success of those
business parks provides downtown San Jose with the richest flow of
tax increment financing available to any California city, about $90
million annually, Korabiak said. (In tax increment financing, a
portion of property tax revenues is used for redevelopment.)
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Redevelopment Agency has assisted or
provided partial funding for so many downtown projects that it
would be only a slight exaggeration to say that San Jose's new
downtown is the agency's creation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the projects that the agency assisted are the Children's
Discovery Museum, the San Jose Arena, the San Jose Convention
Center, the San Jose Repertory Theater, the Tech Museum of
Innovation, the Biblioteca/Youth Center and the Mexican Cultural
Heritage Gardens. It also helped restore the Civic Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   The city has also provided big subsidies to businesses willing
to relocate downtown. Adobe Systems, the software maker, moved into
a new downtown building in 1994 after receiving a $35 million
subsidy from the city. (Much of the subsidy paid for a parking
garage.)
</P>
<P>
   The Redevelopment Agency has also paid for most of an extensive
landscaping program that has turned the banks of the Guadalupe
River into a 20-mile regional park. The riverfront was a selling
point for the Adobe deal, according to Korabiak, who added that the
riverfront is now so popular that the city no longer provides
incentives to companies willing to relocate along it.
</P>
<P>
   The single most ambitious project of the Redevelopment Agency is
the San Jose Civic Plaza, a seven-block redevelopment project that
would bring City Hall back to downtown San Jose, together with a
new Symphony Hall, a new elementary school, a renovated
supermarket, a multitiered public parking structure and 50 housing
units. The City Council approved the project in June.
</P>
<P>
   But downtown housing remains an unrealized ambition. Elsewhere
in Santa Clara County and in San Jose, the expansion of
computer-related businesses has stimulated home development and
prices. At the end of July, existing single-family houses in San
Jose were selling for an average of $400,657, while condominiums
were selling for an average of $228,576, according to the Santa
Clara County Association of Realtors. In 1994, the average
single-family house sold for $238,258; the average condominium
price was $150,575.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, the 104-unit Paseo Villas condominium complex,
currently under construction, is being built by Goldrich &AMP; Kest
Inc. of Los Angeles with the assistance of the Redevelopment
Agency. The agency contributed the land and is a partner in the
venture. Completion is expected next March.
</P>
<P>
   Although the developer has not yet set prices for the units,
comparable condominiums in the area are selling for $250 to $300 a
square foot, ``which is not that high for the area,'' according to
Korabiak. The condos, all two-bedrooms, will range from 1,600 to
1,900 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 320-unit apartment complex, known as 101 San Fernando, is
being built by Forest City Enterprises Inc. of Cleveland.
Completion is expected in fall 2000. Rents have not been announced,
although city officials say they expect the apartments to rent for
about $1.85 per square foot. The apartments will range from a
421-square-foot studio to a 1,390-square-foot three-bedroom. The
city agency assisted the project by buying the land from the
developer and leasing it back for 55 years, which gave the
developer cash to build the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of people with well-paying jobs looking for
places to live that are closer to where they work,'' said Greg
Anderson, vice president for development at Forest City. ``We are
responding to that with this project.''
</P>
<P>
   The city allowed the developer to build up to 107 units per
acre, making 101 San Fernando the densest housing project ever
built in downtown San Jose, and possibly in the entire city.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are densities that are comparable to those in Berlin and
Vienna,'' said Daniel Solomon, a San Francisco-based architect who
designed the complex. With the high densities, civic leaders can
concentrate housing in certain areas of downtown to create a
natural customer base for neighborhood merchants.
</P>
<P>
   The architect and the city collaborated to produce a design for
the apartment building that would not seem imposing or impersonal,
Solomon said. He provided seven separate entrances to the building,
each with its own small courtyard. In this way, the large building
resembles a row of smaller courtyard apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The multiple entrances of 101 San Fernando also have an urban
design role: the street is enlivened with doorways, rather than
deadened by impenetrable walls.
</P>
<P>
   Housing is the ``final ingredient'' needed to make downtown San
Jose successful, Anderson said. The city has ``done a lot, and the
downtown has hotels and restaurants, it has night life, and the
retail is coming along.''

NEW HOMEOWNER FINDS BODY IN A BARREL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERICHO, N.Y. _ When Hamid Tafaghodi and his family moved into
their new $455,000 split-level home, they found a rusted 55-gallon
drum. The drum was later discovered to contain the mummified
remains of a pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   Tafaghodi asked the seller of the house to remove the drum from
a crawl space in the rear of house at 67 Forest Drive. The seller,
Ronald Cohen, asked his movers to take the drum, which weighed 345
pounds, to the curb. But the garbage men would not touch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The garbage men told the owners: `We can't take it because it
might be toxic or noxious. You are responsible for opening it,'''
said Sgt. Robert Edwards, a detective in the Nassau County homicide
squad. ``If they had just taken it and put it in the truck, that
would be it.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Thursday, Cohen and his real estate agent pried the lid of
the drum open with a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   Inside they found another container with a rusted bottom. Then
they saw a hand and a shoe and decided to call the police.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrived at 1:35 Thursday afternoon and removed the
body from the drum. The body was that of a woman who was nearly
full-term pregnant, and was 4 feet, 9 inches tall and 59 pounds,
the police said. She was wearing a skirt, button-down sweater, high
socks and a shoe with a mid-high heel.
</P>
<P>
   Around the neck was a locket with the words ``Patrice, Love
Uncle Phil.'' On her left hand was a wedding band with the
inscription ``M.H.R. XII-59'' and another ring with a green stone.
An imitation leopard-skin coat and a pocketbook filled mostly with
makeup were also found in the drum.
</P>
<P>
   The container was tightly sealed, largely preventing oxygen from
entering and the body from decomposing. The bulk of the drum was
made up of what police call moisture-absorbing grain, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The police brought in dogs and searched the rest of the house
and yard, but found no other bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Though the police estimated that the woman had been dead for
nearly 25 years, they said they had leads. ``It's tough, but we do
have some parameters,'' Edwards said, adding that the barrel was
made in 1963 and originally contained pigments used to tint plastic
and paints, which were no longer made after 1972 or 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate records show that the owners before the Cohens were
Frank and Bernadette Salmaggi, who bought the house from Arthur and
Judith Ebbin. The Ebbins lived there from 1972 to 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Howard B. Elkins sold the house to the Ebbins. Reached by phone
in Boca Raton, Fla., Elkins said Saturday that he knew nothing
about a drum or a body.
</P>
<P>
   Before moving out in 1972, Elkins said, he and his wife, Ruth,
lived there for at least 15 years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We built a room off the kitchen to the back of the house,''
Elkins said. ``A big den with a fireplace. It was built up to the
level of the living room and the kitchen, so there was a crawl
space.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had ever gone into the crawl space, Elkins
replied, ``What for?''
</P>
<P>
   Elkins said he could not recall the name of the contractor who
did the work on the house, but remembered that the job went
smoothly. ``It wasn't bad. It probably only took a few months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of the gardeners and landscapers, and the contractor
who built the addition, I can't think of anyone else who had access
to the house,'' Elkins continued. ``We did have maids on and off
over the years'' who often had keys to the house, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor, who would not give her name, said: ``I just can't
understand how this can be undetected for so long. Wasn't someone
declared missing? Wouldn't it smell?''
</P>
<P>
   As the new owners carried out rusty wire hangers and old carpets
to the street on Saturday, cars and children on bicycles slowed to
a crawl while passing the house.

EDWARD BASSETT, 77, ARCHITECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ind., Hawaii, Wash., Mich.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Charles Bassett, a widely praised architect whose work
ranged from San Francisco's symphony hall to the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow, died Aug. 28 in a San Francisco hospital. He was 77 and
lived in Mill Valley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke he had suffered 10 days earlier at his
home, said Craig Hartman, a partner in the San Francisco office of
the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   Bassett, known as Chuck, was the partner in charge of design in
Skidmore's San Francisco office for 21 years until he retired in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Temko, the former architecture critic of The San Francisco
Chronicle, said Saturday that for years Bassett (pronounced
BASS-ett) ``was a leader in the efforts of younger modern
architects to seek alternatives to the arid formulas of the
International Style.''
</P>
<P>
   Temko described him as the best architect working in San
Francisco in his time and ``a very inventive architect wherever he
worked.'' His more far-flung projects included the Australian
Mutual Provident Society complex in Melbourne, Australia, the Royal
Dutch Shell headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands, and the Mauna
Kea Beach Hotel in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   He designed a city hall for Columbus, Ind. In 1989 it was
described in The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., as ``a not to
be missed, imposing triangular building with a cantilevered front
lintel.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman said, ``A number of his buildings incorporate in them
very traditional qualities of architecture, especially in the use
of very traditional materials, but generally reinterpreted in the
modernist idiom.''
</P>
<P>
   Temko had particular praise for Bassett's design work early in
his San Francisco years for the John Hancock Building, now called
the Industrial Indemnity Building, in the city's financial
district. He said the structure ``isn't a glass box, but it's
contextual in the best sense: It respects the whole cityscape.''
</P>
<P>
   The elegant corporate headquarters of Weyerhaeuser Co. near
Tacoma, Wash., Temko called ``another beauty: It's so handsomely
sited the building is like a dam overlooking a lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassett was born in Port Huron, Mich., served in the Army in
World War II and was wounded on Okinawa. He received a bachelor's
degree in architecture in 1949 from the University of Michigan and
a master's degree in architecture in 1951 from the Cranbrook
Academy of Art, in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., where he was influenced
by the Finnish-American architect Eliel Saarinen.
</P>
<P>
   From 1950 to 1955 Bassett worked with Saarinen's son, the
architect Eero Saarinen, in Eero's office, also in Bloomfield
Hills, before joining Skidmore in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The honors Bassett received included the Brunner Prize in
Architecture from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the
Maybeck Award from the California Council of the American Institute
of Architects and numerous other awards for the designs of
individual projects.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Doris West, known as
Dory; four children, Christine Carlisle Bassett, Ann Bassett
Wheelock, Joseph and Peter, all of California, and three
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Bassett and his wife went to elementary school together. ``I had
never thought about marrying him,'' she recalled after his death.
``But when I heard he was wounded, I just fell apart.''

AFTER 129 YEARS, ST. JOHN'S UNIVERSITY ADDS DORMS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (rk) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Jayare Lendor moved into his new dorm room,
other students offered to carry his boxes just to get a look at the
place. His friends became so envious that he tried not to make a
big deal about it.
</P>
<P>
   But living on campus at St. John's University is a big deal.
``The buzz around here is amazing,'' said Lendor, 22, who used to
ride two subway trains and a bus from Washington Heights to get to
class. ``It's like when the Knicks are in the playoffs _ everyone
knows about it.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's 100-acre main campus in Jamaica, Queens, threw open
the doors to three shiny new dormitories early Saturday and ushered
out a 129-year-old tradition of educating only students who
commuted from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The residence halls _ named Millennium, Century and Hillcrest
(after a golf course originally located at the site) _ will house
more than 750 students from 28 states and 16 foreign countries
including Cyprus, Japan and Portugal. They cost a total of $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Donald J. Harrington, the university president, said
the dormitories were the latest stage in St. John's evolution from
a local school to a world-class institution. ``We're very conscious
of the fact this is a historic moment for us,'' he said. ``It's
something that will clearly enhance the educational experience of
our students.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, 1,500 applications come from students outside the
New York metropolitan area _ nearly one-quarter of the university's
total application pool, Harrington said. In the past, those
students had to scout out apartments near campus, even though many
of them did not know the area or have family here.
</P>
<P>
   Marcio Ferreira, 18, said the on-campus housing made it easier
for him to leave his home in Portugal to study at St. John's and
try out for its basketball team. He has moved into a six-person
suite in Century Hall that has four bedrooms, two bathrooms, a
living room and a kitchen. ``I want to stay here all four years,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some anxious parents, the security of on-campus housing was
one of the university's main selling points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dorms make it a lot more palatable,'' said Gary Blosser,
who drove with his 18-year-old daughter, Emily, from Columbus,
Ohio, in a van crammed with her belongings. ``I don't have to worry
about her walking through neighborhoods at night.''
</P>
<P>
   The dormitories have enabled the university to increase freshman
enrollment by 300 students, for a total of 2,800 freshman this
year, Harrington said. In addition, 100 more upperclass students
transferred from other schools than did last year.
</P>
<P>
   During the next three years, the university plans to add eight
dormitories to bring a total of 2,800 students on campus. The
buildings are part of a $300 million expansion of the Queens campus
that will also include a new university center, a student dining
hall, a church and several athletic centers.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said the expansion was being financed through a bond
sale and donations from alumni and supporters, but he would not
give specific numbers.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's main campus, which was originally located in
Brooklyn, moved to the site of the former Hillcrest Golf Course in
1955. Other campuses were established in Staten Island in 1971, and
in Rome, Italy, in 1995. The Queens campus is the only one with
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   Several St. John's alumni said the dormitories would anchor a
thriving student life on campus and lamented that the change came
too late for them.
</P>
<P>
   Carol A. Gresser, former president of the New York City school
board, said she missed out on an integral part of the college
experience because she commuted to classes at St. John's in the
late 1950s. She encouraged her four children to go away for
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that even if I cry and hang on your leg and beg
you to stay home, pay no attention and go away to school,'' she
said. ``I thought it was an important experience for them to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of volunteers and university workers came out Saturday to
help new students get settled. The multistory residence halls have
been outfitted with cable and Internet connections in every
bedroom, living area and lounge.
</P>
<P>
   And the rent is cheap, for New York City. For a full academic
year, students pay from $4,800 for a 140-square-foot double room to
$6,200 for a 115-square-foot single room.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone has a key to the new hot spot on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Guy, 19, a junior, said she could not afford to move out of
her parents' home in Bethpage, on Long Island. So for now, she has
to be content with watching other students move into the
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may feel like they're in a real school,'' she said with
envy. ``They don't have to leave to go to work like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   But even those students who do not live on campus can still take
advantage of the budding residential life, university officials
said. Library hours have been extended at night, and social
activities are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Lendor, a senior and a residential adviser in Century Hall, is
already making up for all those hours that he spent on subways and
buses. He has cranked up the air conditioning in his room, hooked
up the stereo, and plugged in two television sets so that students
can watch football games with him on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of an 8-to-4:30 school, now we can actually have
midnight movies,'' he said. ``That's a lot different for students
who used to come to class and leave.''

FIRST LADY URGES PRESIDENT TO WITHDRAW CLEMENCY OFFER FOR TERRORIST
GROUP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton called on President Clinton Saturday to
withdraw his offer to commute the prison sentences of 16 members of
a Puerto Rican terrorist organization linked to 100 bombings in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour of Mrs. Clinton's statement, the White House set
a deadline of 5 p.m. Friday for the prisoners to meet the
president's conditions for their release.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's supporters have voiced concern that the issue
could complicate her prospective run for Senate in New York, as
Republicans have attacked the clemency offer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's statement, issued as she spent the weekend at
Camp David with her husband, did not quarrel with Clinton's initial
offer, made on Aug. 11, of a conditional clemency to 16 members of
the Armed Forces of National Liberation, or FALN, the initials for
the Spanish rendering of the name. But she noted that the president
had made the offer on the condition that the prisoners _ none of
whom had been directly related to any crimes that resulted in death
or injury _ renounce violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been three weeks and their silence speaks volumes,'' Mrs.
Clinton said in the statement. ``I believe the offer of clemency
should be withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she had not known in advance about her
husband's clemency offer. An aide said she learned about it while
touring New York for her anticipated run for the U.S. Senate next
year. Her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said that the first lady told
Clinton Saturday morning that she would issue a statement calling
on the president to act.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said Saturday that attempts to draw a
unified response from the 16 prisoners to the offer of clemency had
been complicated by the fact that they were scattered among 11
federal prisons.
</P>
<P>
   But up through Friday evening, the president's advisers had kept
the offer open-ended.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides said they did not know of Mrs. Clinton's
intentions to release her statement. Wolfson said that the first
lady first informed her husband of her decision Saturday morning at
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 prisoners have arranged a conference call with their
lawyer for this week to discuss their response to Clinton's offer.
Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman, said, ``We have always
believed that renunciation of violence was the critical condition
of this clemency offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the White House sent a letter to the prisoners'
counsel Friday afternoon informing them of the deadline. ``We
informed them that if we did not hear from them in writing by 5
p.m. Friday Sept. 10, that would be considered a rejection of the
president's offer and they would continue to serve their
sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican who is likely to run for
the Senate against Mrs. Clinton, and who has been critical of the
president's action, declined to comment on Mrs. Clinton's statement
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement marked the latest, and clearly the most striking,
attempt by the first lady to distance herself from administration
policy since she first began seriously considering the race. This
had proved to be a particularly complicated issue because some
important supporters of her _ among them Rep. Jose E. Serrano of
the Bronx, Rep. Charles Rangel of Harlem and Dennis Rivera, the
head of 1199, the 150,000-member National Health and Human Service
Employees Union _ had backed Clinton's action.
</P>
<P>
   But there had been a wave of criticism of Clinton, from
Republicans as well as Democrats, notably Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, whose decision not to run for re-election created the
opening that is now the subject of the expected contest between
Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   And a number of Republicans have asserted that the president, in
taking a step that was not in keeping with the administration's
generally tougher line toward terrorists, was using his position to
try to help his wife's campaign for the Senate. Hispanic voters
make up a growing and increasingly influential segment of New
York's electorate, and Giuliani, in particular, has gone to great
effort to build support among those voters.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, Clinton's aides have refused to
elaborate on the president's decision-making process, even as it
became known that a number of federal law-enforcement agencies who
reviewed the clemency petition filed by the group unanimously
opposed it. Mrs. Clinton has, until now, through a spokesman said
only that the prisoners should not be released until they renounce
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has gathered increasing force both in New York in
Washington. The New York Police commissioner, Howard Safir, held a
news conference with three retired officers who had been injured by
bombs placed outside Police Headquarters in 1982 to denounce the
president. The FALN had claimed credit for placing those bombs.
Giuliani did not appear with Safir, but made clear he approved of
the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   It also has appeared increasingly likely in recent weeks that
the issue could be kept alive through congressional hearings in
Washington, which would, no doubt, be an unwanted distraction for
Mrs. Clinton's campaign. Republicans in Congress have begun to
subpoena White House and Justice Department records on the clemency
process in anticipation of hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, in her statement, insisted that the White House
had acted on its own in granting the clemency petition. ``When the
administration first offered these prisoners clemency, I made it
very clear that I had no involvement in, or prior knowledge, of the
decision, as is entirely appropriate,'' she said.

 &HT;    Congress faces tough issues in a partisan climate
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The big question facing Congress when it returns
this week is whether it can pass enough legislation to escape a
``do-nothing'' branding.
</P>
<P>
   Deep partisan divisions on Capitol Hill may make that an uphill
battle.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the impeachment trial of President Clinton, the
106th Congress has saved most of its tough work for the final
legislative session of this century, prompting political experts to
wonder whether it's possible to adjourn without upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative agenda is crammed with contentious spending
bills as well as thorny issues such as overhauling the campaign
fund-raising system, gun violence, managed care and funding for
Georgia's coveted F-22 fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   And a budget gridlock is predicted as soon as the president's
signature is dry on his promised veto of the Republican Party's
$792 billion tax cut bill.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to that explosive mix are the ferocious campaigns under
way for control of the House and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the looming distraction of more congressional
investigations into the FBI and Justice Department's handling of
the deadly 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian complex near Waco,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want and need some accomplishments so they can inoculate
themselves against the `do-nothing Congress''' label, said William
F. Connelly, a professor of politics at Washington &AMP; Lee
University.
</P>
<P>
   But passing legislation could be more difficult than usual,
Connelly said, because ``both parties are looking for ways to score
points and play politics instead of forming policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood's fight
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues Congress will address are the bill introduced
by Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.) to dramatically change the way
managed care is administered across the country. It would give
patients the right to sue their health plan insurers, choose their
doctors and appeal health plan decisions to an external appeals
board.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is strongly opposed by groups such as the American
Association of Health Plans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce _ not
to mention the elders of Norwood's own party.
</P>
<P>
   But such opposition has served only to energize Norwood, who
crossed the aisle to work with Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) to piece
together the latest incarnation of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind getting beat,'' Norwood said. ``I'm a big boy. If
you get beat, you get beat. But I do believe in a fair fight, and
so far it hasn't been a fair fight, and it won't be until there is
a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr will play a pivotal role
in the fall legislative season. Barr, a member of the House
Government Reform and Oversight Committee, has taken the lead in
demanding more information about why the FBI took six years to
acknowledge using incendiary tear gas canisters in the Branch
Davidian siege. In particular, Barr wants to know more about the
role played by the Army's secretive Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   And as a member of a special panel of House and Senate members,
Barr will help shape the juvenile violence bill aimed at responding
to a spate of recent shootings in schools in Georgia, California
and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than regulating guns, Barr said final juvenile violence
legislation should bring the Ten Commandments to school classrooms
and ``require federal prosecutors to start prosecuting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that the bill that emerges will focus on the real
problems and real solutions, not cosmetic approaches such as gun
control,'' said Barr, a board member of the National Rifle
Association. ``But I know there will be a lot of pressure from the
gun control advocates to do otherwise and a lot of pressure by some
Republicans to just sort of roll over and avoid the issue and give
in partway.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the dollars go
</P>
<P>
   Locally, few issues rival the importance of the spending battle
set to unfold as soon as Congress returns Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is funding for the F-22 Raptor. Before recess, the
House eliminated $1.8 billion in planned funding for the first six
of the F-22 fighters, saying the plane was too costly and the money
was needed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That created quite a stir among Georgia's congressional
delegation because Lockheed Martin builds the aircraft at its
Marietta plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved funding for the F-22 fighters in its version
of the $264.7 billion defense bill this summer. The final outcome
now rests in the hands of a special committee of House and Senate
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, has made it clear he will not take the
spending bill to the Senate floor without funding set aside for the
F-22 fighter.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to sell the project, Lockheed Martin has hired
former Republican Sen. Mack Mattingly of Georgia to lobby on its
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22 is not the only target of budget cutters.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $40 million in public housing funds slated for Georgia
are in jeopardy. The cuts are part of a Republican proposed trim of
$1.6 billion from the Housing and Urban Development budget. The
proposal, which cleared the House Appropriations Committee this
summer, will be voted on by the full House when Congress resumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be devastating,'' said Hattie Dorsey, president of
the Atlanta Neighborhood Development Partnership, a nonprofit group
that builds affordable housing. The cuts, which amount to $9.4
million for Atlanta alone, would dramatically impact the affordable
housing and public housing supply, she said. ``You wonder where the
heart and soul of some of these people are.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said he intends to fight the HUD cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed cuts are irresponsible and mean-spirited,'' he
said. ``We are trying to balance the budget on the backs of the
people who can least afford it.''

 &HT;    Gingriches likely to settle out of court
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lawyers who thrive on domestic cases that make
headlines say there's little chance Newt and Marianne Gingrich will
put their marriage on trial, no matter how bitter their pending
divorce might appear.
</P>
<P>
   The thing to remember, they say, is that in the high-stakes game
of divorce among the rich and powerful, politicians often have the
most to lose.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than a week, a Cobb County judge is scheduled
to preside over the first public clash of the couple's attorneys in
a pre-trial hearing over assets. The Gingriches plan to be present.
</P>
<P>
   Their joint courtroom appearance is likely to be a rare event.
This split will probably follow the pattern of most other celebrity
divorces.
</P>
<P>
   Each will threaten and bluff until the other side is ready to
strike a deal. Scandal-hungry Americans will serve as useful
go-betweens, until the judge agrees to seal the settlement and the
public is told to go away. Divorce settlements among average people
are rarely decided by judges or juries, and the trend is even
stronger among people with money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart, powerful people want to control their own destiny. They
don't want someone else telling them how they're going to live the
rest of their lives,'' said Sanford Ain, a Washington attorney who
counts dozens of congressmen and senators among his past and
present clientele.
</P>
<P>
   But neither side is expected to roll over easily. Marianne
Gingrich has hired attorney John Mayoue, who also represents
Evander Holyfield's wife in her ongoing divorce case. Newt
Gingrich, once the national leader of the GOP, has hired Thomas
Browning, a Democrat and former law partner of Gov. Roy Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingriches' divorce trial has been tentatively scheduled to
begin around October.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers watching the proceedings from afar say there are two
closely linked reasons to bet on an out-of-court settlement: money
and reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's been out of office eight months, Gingrich remains
a $50,000-a-pop speechmaker and a cash magnet in the pass-the-plate
world of Washington fund-raising. Since leaving office in January,
he's raised at least $1.3 million for his new political action
committee.
</P>
<P>
   But a bitter divorce could raise all sorts of personal and
financial details that might have an impact on his future career as
a speechmaker or on any return to politics.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the best example of the damage a divorce can do to a
politician dates back to 1977, when U.S. Sen. Herman Talmadge filed
for the divorce that ruined his political life. During the
proceedings, tales of kickbacks, hidden cash and campaign
contributions converted to private use resulted in a formal
denunciation by his Senate colleagues. Talmadge was voted out of
office in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   So far as the public is concerned, Newt Gingrich's closets are
free of any such clutter. But Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney,
has said he intends to fully investigate Newt Gingrich's personal
and political business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich can't afford to tarnish her estranged
husband's image too much _ at least, not without risking her
potential share of his future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the threat of a trial can be a valuable bargaining
chip when it comes to getting the best settlement possible, said
Ain.
</P>
<P>
   The chip is even more valuable in Georgia, which is the only
state where juries can decide alimony payments and how to split a
couple's assets, said Atlanta divorce attorney Shiel Edlin. In
fact, Georgia and Texas are the only two states in the union that
use juries at all in divorce cases. The rest rely on judges.
</P>
<P>
   A divorce by jury in Georgia requires a request from only one of
the parties. Marianne Gingrich made that request in her August
answer to her husband's July 29 divorce petition.
</P>
<P>
   While Ain says judges are fairly predictable in their divorce
rulings, it's a well-known adage among lawyers that juries, on the
other hand, are unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Gingrich's years-long relationship with a
33-year-old congressional aide named Callista Bisek. Proof of an
extramarital affair ``could affect a jury more than a judge,'' said
Atlanta attorney Joe McGee, former president of the Georgia chapter
of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Pros and cons
</P>
<P>
   Besides keeping dirt out of a public courtroom, settlement
offers a distinct advantage to couples in search of discretion. The
agreements can be sealed or even kept out of the public record
entirely. Once a case goes to trial, however, it's very hard to get
the record sealed, McGee said.
</P>
<P>
   Judges are particularly willing to seal the record when a
divorce includes vast amounts of money or a large alimony payment.
</P>
<P>
   McGee helped represent PC modem entrepreneur Dennis Hayes during
his noteworthy 1988 divorce. Hayes, whose Norcross-based
microcomputer products company was once valued at $500 million,
chose to settle the divorce with a confidential agreement that was
billed as the largest in Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   Like Newt Gingrich, Hayes was accused of having an affair and
the woman in question was forced to give a videotaped deposition.
Callista Bisek's is scheduled for late September.
</P>
<P>
   But even cases destined for settlement often provide an intimate
and sometimes embarrassing look at a couple's life together, as
each attempts to influence the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich has claimed in divorce pleadings that his wife
``abandoned'' him in 1987. The Gingriches signed a separation
agreement at the time that divided up bank accounts, furniture and
automobiles and gave Marianne Gingrich $12,000 in alimony over six
months, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster his claim that Marianne Gingrich left him first, Newt
Gingrich has filed a letter he attached to the signed settlement
agreement 12 years ago that expressed sorrow over her abandonment.
He addressed it to ``Marianski,'' and signed it ``Merry Christmas,
Newtie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you more than I hate this,'' the letter began,
referring to the notarized agreement, which was not filed in court
at the time. ``... I hope this allows you to relax, heal up, and
truly decide what you want to do with your life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you decide you want to start a new relationship with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusations were in response to charges by Marianne Gingrich
that her husband attempted to hide assets before filing papers to
end their 18-year marriage. Newt Gingrich denies the assets charge.
Divorce lawyers in the know say Newt Gingrich's response is unusual
because it is not required by law. For some, it's an obvious
attempt to play to the media, which is routine in high-profile
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case becomes one of sound bites for the press, rather than
what's likely to influence the judge by the end of the day,'' said
Ain, the Washington-based divorce attorney. ``What they are doing
is trying to influence the public in order to put pressure on the
other side to gain a more favorable settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it works even better than expected. Consider the early
1990s divorce of drug store magnate Herbert Haft, which made the
front page of The Washington Post for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest in one of the pretrial hearings was so intense,
Maryland court officials had to set up a lottery and ticketing
system to dole out the courtroom's limited seats, said Ain, who
represented Haft.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge handed down photocopies of the judge's detailed
ruling on the motion, lawyers in the case couldn't help but notice
that it contained minor facts that had never been introduced at
trial. That judge had apparently been reading the newspapers, just
like everyone else in town.

anti-Zapatista vigilantes loyal to Mexico's ruling party are on the
rise in spite of a truce. In addition, Rangel, a volunteer doctor,
said Mexican soldiers just 100 meters from where she was attacked
did nothing to help her and the two Spaniards. One soldier, she

``statehood'' issue because they think it's a simple question of

SECRECY MOUNTING AS AMERICA'S CUP DRAWS NEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CAITLIN KELLY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few months ago, before it moved to New Zealand for the
challengers trials, America One, one of five U.S. entries in the
America's Cup, had an increasingly common problem. It needed to
find a secure spot, away from the prying eyes of competitors, where
its two training boats could be tested.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, America One chose as its U.S. testing ground one of
the least glamorous sites imaginable: a berth at a commercial
shipyard at the end of the road on Terminal Island, the port of Los
Angeles. The site was ideal because the two boats could be quickly
towed into open waters to practice and because local wind
conditions are similar to those in the Hauraki Gulf, the racecourse
site off Auckland, New Zealand, where the America's Cup will be
contested.
</P>
<P>
   But tight security was also paramount. Their site was situated
in a desolate area next to a federal prison, and it was protected
by chain-link fence that was covered with plastic until the boats
were hauled out of the water for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where these million-dollar boats of the America's Cup
series are housed, protecting their unusual design features _ the
culmination of years of testing and refinement _ remains a matter
of serious concern. The New Zealand Herald recently reported that
the America True skipper Dawn Riley was enraged after a local
sports television crew broke into the syndicate's Auckland base and
climbed over its boat.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike America One, which has three boats, America True is a
one-boat campaign, making knowledge of the only craft especially
valuable to potential competitors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper's report, three members of the
television crew got into the base with a small boat around 10 p.m.,
climbed onto the keel bulb of their boat and started filming.
``We're worried that this could become the cool thing to do,''
Riley told a Herald reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Breaches like this were not likely at America One's Los Angeles
site. In keeping with America's Cup challenger tradition, the keel
of 49, the team's training boat, was always sheathed from view by
an opaque nylon skirt in and out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Every low-flying plane that approached America One's compound
was photographed and its features were noted.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Billingham, the project manager for America One, who also
worked with Bill Koch on his $100 million A3 campaign in the last
America's Cup, said recently that security concerns were no joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on spying,''
usually from helicopters, he said. ``We'd pass the Italians doing
the same thing and we'd wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Of America One's $32 million budget, $7 million alone represents
the cost of design, an investment Billingham and the skipper Paul
Cayard, not to mention their sponsors, are eager to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Races for the Louis Vuitton Cup, awarded to the winner of the
challengers series, begin in Auckland on Oct. 18. Even until the
last moment boats can be modified based on what a spy discovers in
a competitor's design, Billingham said.
</P>
<P>
   The closer the start date, the more likely this would mean
altering the shape of the keel bulb or the winglets, thin flat
protrusions on either side of the bulb. (Keeping the keel bulb
concealed is therefore an article of faith for most teams.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much information out there now that there are
fewer things to copy, which makes the paranoia and secrecy even
more intense,'' Billingham said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   America One's two training boats are now on their way to
Auckland, stripped of rigging and masts, electronics and deck
hardware. They sit in cradles atop a container ship, the cradles
welded to the ship's surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lost 49, we couldn't compete,'' Billingham said.
</P>
<P>
   The entry's newest yacht, 61, which is still under construction
in Long Beach, Calif., her final tweaking and modifications based
on a month of complex data from 49's daily testing, is scheduled to
arrive in New Zealand in November.
</P>
<P>
   While the shore team now starts to arrive in Auckland, its work
being conducted under the aegis of the St. Francis Yacht Club in
San Francisco, Cayard is continuing his own quest: trying to find
an elusive final $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still working on that,'' he said somewhat wearily. He
did manage to drum up $1 million last month _ $250,000 from one
sponsor, another $500,000 from private investors, and the rest as
time, labor and other nonmonetary contributions from Ford, which is
a major sponsor of the program.
</P>
<P>
   What does he need another $6 million for? ``Everything,'' he
said. ``We have to feed and insure and house the crew and the
team,'' some 70 staff members in all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the last one to head down there,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were more police officers than participants as
the second Million Youth March got under way in Harlem around noon
Saturday, after a bitter court fight in which the organizers of the
event won a city permit over Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's vehement
objections.
</P>
<P>
   Many who attended the rally were disappointed by the yawning
expanse of pavement in front of the stage at 118th Street and
Malcolm X Boulevard, and blamed the low turnout on politicians who
condemned the march and media coverage that, they said, scared
people away.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:30 p.m., when a woman kicked off the program with chants
of ``black power,'' and a prayer, there were about 400 people
milling about _ far fewer than the estimated 6,000 who attended
last year's event, which ended in a violent clash with the police.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd barely filled half a block, never mind the six closed
off under the permit. By 2:45 p.m., when Khallid Abdul Muhammad,
the march leader, began his 70-minute speech, the crowd had grown
to more than 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to tell the white man we are too black and too
strong,'' Muhammad told the crowd. Speaking of black politicians
who had condemned his rally, he added: ``We're going to show them
what politics is all about. We're going to use politics as a war
mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad urged black men and women to increase their
self-respect and to love one another, rather than form gangs and
battle over turf. He said ``crackers'' had taken over Harlem,
replacing storefronts with malls, and he led the crowd in chants of
``Teach the youth the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't stop me from calling the white man a devil,'' he
said. ``That's my religion. There is no devil under the ground,
black man. There is no devil under the ground, there is no hell
under the ground. Heaven and hell are states of mind, states of
being. Your heaven and hell is right here, black man and woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, another speaker, Shaunette Daniels, called for black
militias to protect themselves from the New York Police Department,
saying, ``We must make sure there are no unarmed black men on these
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman said about 1,400 officers, most in uniforms,
were deployed in the area, but only some 300 were visible in
clusters in the rally area, along Malcolm X Boulevard between 118th
and 124th Streets, making it seem like a lighter, and friendlier,
police presence than last year.
</P>
<P>
   The rest were stationed nearby _ including handfuls on top of
buildings _ with a phalanx of mounted units and other special
forces at the ready along the northern edge of Central Park at
110th Street.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m., when the rally permit expired, rap music blared from
the stage and the crowd began to disperse peacefully, with no sign
of the problems that marred the end of last year's event.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before the rally, Muhammad shrugged off the
sparse attendance, saying, ``Our people don't come until the main
speaker. That's the tradition in the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, as he shopped at Century 21 clothing store to
celebrate no-tax week, Giuliani was smug. ``I think we have more
people here,'' he said to about two dozen reporters gathered for a
noon question-and-answer session. Earlier, after throwing out the
ceremonial first pitch at the Latin American Little League World
Series in Brooklyn, the mayor indirectly criticized what he has
referred to as a ``hate march.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you want to be doing with children,'' he said.
``You want them to be playing baseball, basketball, you want them
to be reading, you want them to be considering other pursuits, work
in the library, just having fun and learning teamwork rather than
talking about hating other people.''
</P>
<P>
   At the rally, there were precious few children, to whom the
event was supposed to be directed. Instead, there were adults
waving the green, black and red flag of African nationalism and
shooting videotape and photographs of, among other things, the
scores of newspaper and television reporters and photographers on
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   A cadre of Black Muslims in matching gray suits and burgundy
ties stood to one side. A group of young men dressed head to toe in
the red regalia of the Bloods street gang hovered a block away,
making machine-gun sounds with their mouths to punctuate the
incendiary remarks broadcast over loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to get a positive message and not worry about the
negativity from the media and the black politicians,'' said Cecil
Payne, 34, who brought his two sons to the march from Hackensack,
N.J. ``I came out here to see what Khallid Muhammad is all about.
I'm not a black Muslim, but I came out because he is the only one
to speak out against injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Curbside chatter, at some points, reflected the hate-filled
language of Muhammad ``Jews make all the decisions in this
country,'' said one man roaming the area with a megaphone. ``It's
about time for them to be overthrown.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people said they thought the march was about reparations
_ reimbursing black people for decades of discrimination. Some saw
Muhammad as a role model. ``He's a strong black man who speaks the
truth,'' said a woman who gave her name only as Sarah. ``We need
more black men like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Janita Fitzgerald, 18, a college student, said she thinks
Muhammad can help get teen-agers off the streets. ``It takes a
whole village to raise a child, that's what he's saying,'' she
said. ``Everybody's everybody's parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said that they support Muhammad's program of
self-reliance for African-Americans, but worry that his message has
been distorted, in part by the news media, and in part by his own
insistence on using epithets for whites in general and Jews in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``His message is good; it's just that I don't like the way he
gives it,'' said Omotayo Riley, 18, of Jamaica, Queens, part of a
five-man rhythm and blues group, Impact, which was scheduled to
perform later in the rally.
</P>
<P>
   James Udofia, 17, another member of Impact, said, ``Sometimes
you have to be aggressive in the way you speak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's aggressive,'' countered Riley, ``and then there's
threatening.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Johnson, a music producer from Teaneck, N.J., said blacks
need ``a rabble-rouser'' like Muhammad. ``We really need somebody
to let them know, hey, we're not content yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the crowd said they came not so much to support Muhammad
but to exercise their rights to free assembly, which were upheld by
two courts last week after the city denied the organizers a permit.
</P>
<P>
   One woman said she had decided not to attend because of the
problems after last year's march, in which 16 police officers and
14 participants were injured, but changed her mind after she heard
the Jewish Defense League asking people to stay away. ``Who are
they to tell us what to do?'' asked the woman, who identified
herself only as Linda.
</P>
<P>
   Others wore buttons reading, ``To Hell with Adolf Giuliani,''
and said they were marching to show opposition to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Shabazz, an attorney for the Million Youth March, held a
picture of Muhammad aloft on the stage and announced, ``White
America, you have created Khallid Muhammad, and now the chickens
have come home to roost.'' Then, he turned to the crowd and asked,
``How to you find Giuliani on the charge of police brutality?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilty,'' came the response.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you find Giuliani on the charge of the murder of
Diallo? How do you find Giuliani on the charge of the sodomy of
Abner Louima?'' Shabazz continued, prompting echoes of ``guilty,
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the perimeter of the rally, people in the neighborhood
were less than lukewarm to the event, although they said they
appreciated that the subways were open, unlike last year, and there
seemed to be more freedom to move about the streets than last year.
At the Salvation and Deliverance Church on 116th Street, about 100
people gathered for a special prayer service, holding hands in
small circles as they chanted, sang and hopped from one foot to
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a cause we believe in; we're not advocates of
hatred,'' said Jonathan Graham, 45, a guest minister at the church.
``Jesus is about love. That's what we believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, though, could not stay away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, just to see the spectacle,'' Ned Burrell said when
asked why he had attended the rally. ``Just the same way I would
come out to watch Hitler or David Duke. It's kind of like watching
a car wreck.''

RANGERS SAY STRONG START IS A MUST
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., also includes reports on Islanders, Devils) 
(rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early Sunday morning, the Rangers' latest grand experiment will
begin in Burlington, Vt. And during their weeklong training camp,
coach John Muckler hopes to etch a rough sketch of the team, which
was profoundly altered by Neil Smith, the team's president and
general manager, during a busy and expensive off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine a more productive off-season in Rangers
history,'' Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden,
said last week, as the team formally introduced its new faces at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The question facing Muckler is how long it will take for all the
players in camp to mold into a cohesive unit. Smith and Muckler are
hoping to have the answer by Oct. 1, when the Rangers open the
regular season in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, even though they were quite familiar with one
another coming in, the Rangers were terrible from the start,
opening the season 0-4-1. They finished 33-38-11. This season, the
Rangers will be much less familiar with each other on opening day.
And like last season, they will not be able to afford a wretched
opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to try to have a better start,'' Muckler said.
``That's one of the reasons I want to get to a team concept as soon
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler intends to divide the team into two groups, A and B
squads, after three days of scrimmaging in Burlington, with the A
group consisting of players expected to make team.
</P>
<P>
   The team's core will be familiar. Brian Leetch will be back as
the captain for the third season. Mike Richter will again be in
goal. Adam Graves will return to man a forward line. But there will
be an infusion of new faces, too. Old new faces, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Theo Fleury, the prize addition who played most of his career in
Calgary, is 31. Valery Kamensky, from Colorado, is 33. Tim Taylor,
from Boston, is 30. On defense, Sylvain Lefebvre (Colorado) is 31
and Stephane Quintal (Montreal) is 30. Backup goaltender Kirk
McLean, a free agent from Florida, is 33. And the Rangers were
already aging to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they are hoping that newcomers like 18-year-olds Pavel
Brendl and Jamie Lundmark and 22-year-old Jan Hlavac, along with
19-year-old Manny Malhotra, who is entering his second season, can
contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd like to see is a good mixture of veterans and younger
people,'' Muckler said. ``And I'd like to see the younger people
pushing the veterans. Because what's going to happen is the
veterans are going to start pushing back.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent seasons, young players have not been given many
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the patience is still there for the young players
to be on the team,'' Smith said. ``I think where the patience is
gone is that we missed the playoffs two years in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a mood of guarded optimism among the team's
executive leadership, stemming from all the moves Smith has made.
Checketts proudly noted that there was a 97 percent renewal on
season tickets. And nearly all those ticket holders were
disgruntled by the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't the last game; it was probably the last 10
games,'' Checketts said. ``I knew the patience had run out. If we
had made the playoffs the last year or two, maybe we would not have
felt the same urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Rangers went out and re-signed Leetch to a
four-year, $35 million contract. That led to the avalanche of
signings, opening the way, Checketts said, for free agents Fleury
(four years, $28 million), Kamensky (five years, $21 million),
Quintal (five years, $14 million), Lefebvre (five years, $12.5
million), Taylor (four years, $5.8 million plus incentives) and
McLean (two years, $1.7 million plus incentives).
</P>
<P>
   Muckler said he thought the Rangers would be a stronger
forechecking team, that they would be faster overall and improved
on both offense and defense. ``It's not going to be as easy as it
looks on paper, however,'' Muckler said. ``A lot of things need to
be developed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are still searching for someone to emerge as the
second-line center behind Petr Nedved. Muckler also pointed out
areas such as mobility to move the puck and team toughness that his
team needs to work on.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'll be a feisty team, a gritty team,'' Muckler said.
</P>
<P>
   ISLANDERS
</P>
<P>
   An Uncertain Roster
</P>
<P>
   As the Islanders' training camp opens in Lake Placid, N.Y.,
there's only one thing more uncertain than who will own the team in
two weeks: who will be on the team in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen new players and a new coach were on the
Islanders' roster when the team took the ice at Olympic Center for
the season's first practice Saturday. Still, the new season is very
likely to bring more of the same results.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the fire sale that gutted the Islanders of the few
legitimate stars they had, the young and inexperienced team will
almost certainly struggle to win 20 games under Butch Goring this
season. With a payroll of only $18 million come expectations that
are equally low.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Jonsson, Mariusz Czerkawski, Mark Lawrence and Oli Jokinen
are among the few proven commodities the Islanders have. Most of
the other players listed on the preseason roster represent a mix of
first-round draft picks, veteran journeymen and minor leaguers
hoping to catch a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camp is going to be really open,'' said Mike Milbury, the
Islanders' general manager. ``For a lot of the players, it's an
opportunity to get a toehold in the National Hockey League. We are
very young, and if nothing else, we have that going for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Milbury must rely on his team's youthful exuberance and hope
that it will be worth something, even if it probably won't help his
team make the playoffs. One of the few bright spots at camp will be
the four 1999 first-round draft picks _ Tim Connolly, Taylor Pyatt,
Branislav Mezei, and Kristain Kudroc _ all of whom have an outside
chance at making the team.
</P>
<P>
   But the first order of business won't be anywhere near the ice.
With the players arriving for photos and physicals Saturday, there
will be one notable absence: center Mats Lindgren, who is expected
to skate on either the first or second line, is still not signed.
The 24-year-old Swede is seeking $1 million a season. Milbury said
he has offered Lindgren a 20 percent raise over the $650,000 he
made last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most deserve a pay cut at this point,'' Milbury said
last week. ``We think a 20 percent raise is more than fair.''

   DEVILS
</P>
<P>
   Among the Missing
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Elias and Brendan Morrison were missing _ along with
notable acquisitions from other teams _ when the Devils reported
for their physicals Saturday in West Orange, N.J. The two are
restricted free agents, and as of Saturday morning, they had not
come to an agreement with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison, a rookie-of-the-year candidate last season, has
practiced with a group of other members of the team in informal
workouts for the last month, and he is closer to signing a contract
than Elias, who has been in his native Czech Republic for most of
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison made a base salary of $450,000 last year, but bonuses
brought that figure to $800,000. He is seeking a contract similar
to that of Bill Muckalt, his former teammate at Michigan, who
recently signed with Vancouver for $2.9 million for three years.
Morrison finished second in scoring among rookies last year with 10
more points that Muckalt.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' other restricted free agents during the summer have
been signed, with Jason Arnott the last one to come to terms.
Arnott agreed to a new one-year contract on Friday and reported
with 56 others officially on the training camp roster.

Jerry Falwell, an outspoken critic of homosexual activity, in
Lynchburg, Va., next month. White is with his partner, Gary Nixon.
White plans take 200 people to Lynchburg to meet with Falwell, and
the 200 people he has invited, for the talks. Such an encounter
will certainly be unusual, perhaps even a first in the long,
contentious debate over gay rights. ``I believe we're going,'' says

an effort to revitalize the ski resort. Objections over plans to
build affordable housing for people who work in local hotels, shops

the organizers of the event won a city permit over Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's vehement objections, many who attended the rally were
disappointed by the yawning expanse of pavement in front of the
stage at 118th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard, and blamed the low
turnout on politicians who condemned the march and media coverage
that, they said, scared people away. (Jeffery A. Salter/New York

said when asked about the sparse attendance. ``Our people don't
come until the main speaker. That's the tradition in the black

More than a decade after leaving office, Koop, now 82, faces

not trying to make everyone conform to our stereotypes of aging,''
says Dr. Metzger. Some experts on aging worry that modern medicine
may end up trivializing the despair that the elderly feel as they
confront the dwindling of their days by trying to medicate away the
sadness that comes with losses. (Michele McDonald/New York Times

-- A soldier's monument, part of the 15-year nocturnal
grave-robbing collection of Anthony Casamassima, 40. Casamassima's
testimony helped convict Alastair Duncan, a leading authority on
Tiffany stained glass, on charges of dealing in stolen mausoleum
art. Casamassima is awaiting sentencing on a variety of charges,
including trafficking in stolen property. Duncan, who is appealing
his conviction, is to be sentenced on Oct. 27 and is facing up to
35 years in prison. (Jeffery A. Salter/New York Times Photo)

-- Anthony Casamassima, 40, a career grave robber whose testimony
helped convict a leading authority on Tiffany stained glass on
charges of dealing in stolen mausoleum art, with the bonsai-studded
cemetery tableau he created in his Queens backyard. Casamassima,
who is awaiting sentencing on a variety of charges, including
stealing the window and trafficking in stolen property, sees
himself as a rescuer, stealing Tiffany windows and other treasures,
he says, to ``liberate'' them from vandalism and neglect. (Jeffery

Richard and Oracene, the parents of Serena and Venus Williams, at
the United States open on Friday. Two years ago, more than a few
tennis people were willing to wonder if Richard Williams' girls,
schooled away from the junior tennis grind, faced the possibility
of being colossal flops. Now, every day at the Open is Williams
Family Day. The sisters are energetic, engaging, edgy. They appear
to have it all, except Grand Slam victories, and those are
obviously coming. (Steve Berman/New York Times Photo)

FALWELL-GAYS-MEETING, 9-4 -- The Rev. Mel White, right, an
outspoken supporter of gay rights, plans to meet with the Rev.
Jerry Falwell, an outspoken critic of homosexual activity, in
Lynchburg, Va., next month. White is with his partner, Gary Nixon.
White plans take 200 people to Lynchburg to meet with Falwell, and
the 200 people he has invited, for the talks. Such an encounter
will certainly be unusual, perhaps even a first in the long,
contentious debate over gay rights. ``I believe we're going,'' says
White, ``and we're going in love and peace.'' (Monica Almeida/New

King County Council member Larry Gossett wants the likeness of Dr.
Martin L. King Jr. on the logos of King County, Wash. The county,
originally named for a forgettable Vice President, William King,
was renamed for Dr. King in 1986. The proposal by Gossett to change
the county's logo to include a likeness of King, the civil rights
leader who was slain in 1968, has revived a debate over an unusual
action taken by the County Council 13 years ago, when it officially
voted to change the county's namesake, but not its name. (Larry

   (NYT6) VAIL, Colo. -- Sept. 4, 1999 -- VAIL-HOUSING-DISPUTE, 9-4
-- Vail mayor Rob Ford, has been strongly criticized for planning
lower-cost housing in the upscale resort town. The plan is part of
an effort to revitalize the ski resort. Objections over plans to
build affordable housing for people who work in local hotels, shops
and restaurants grew so heated this summer that Ford quit, two
years before his term expires. ``At some of the meetings we had,
things got so bad that I was uncomfortable without an undercover
police officer there to protect me,'' says Ford. (Kevin Moloney/New

   (NYT5) NEW YORK -- Sept. 4, 1999 -- MILLION-YOUTH-MARCH-2, 9-4
-- A crowd barely filling half a block at the second Million Youth
March in Harlem on Saturday. After a bitter court fight in which
the organizers of the event won a city permit over Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's vehement objections, many who attended the rally were
disappointed by the yawning expanse of pavement in front of the
stage at 118th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard, and blamed the low
turnout on politicians who condemned the march and media coverage
that, they said, scared people away. (Jeffery A. Salter/New York

Million Youth March, surrounded by bodyguards, in Harlem on
Saturday. Muhammad said he was confident more people would show up
before his speech later in the day. ``What do you mean?'' Muhammad
said when asked about the sparse attendance. ``Our people don't
come until the main speaker. That's the tradition in the black
community.'' Still, for the most part, there were more police
officers than participants and there were precious few children, to
whom the event was supposed to be directed. (Nicole Bengiveno/New

and recognizable public figures on the subject of health during the
eight years he held the post of U.S. surgeon general, preparing to
testify before Senate task force on tobacco legislation in 1998.
More than a decade after leaving office, Koop, now 82, faces
criticism from medical ethicists and consumer advocates. Among the
complaints are that his hugely popular health information Web site,
DrKoop.com, blurs the line between objective information and
promotional content, and that his ties to business have not been
properly disclosed. (Paul Hosefros/New York Times Photo)

Yevgeny Kiselyov, a television journalist in the anti-Yeltsin camp,
is facing a media battle with much more at stake than higher
ratings. Kiselyov, a journalist with a studied, ponderous style, is
host of ``Itogi,'' or ``News,'' a long-running weekly program
broadcast by NTV. NTV, an independent channel, is controlled by the
media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky, who in recent months has openly
broken ranks with President Boris Yeltsin's dwindling team and ORT,
Russia's largest TV channel. (Jacqueline Mia Foster/New York Times

Eran Metzger, a geriatric psychiatrist, with an 81-year-old patient
at the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for Aged near Boston. ``We're
not trying to make everyone conform to our stereotypes of aging,''
says Dr. Metzger. Some experts on aging worry that modern medicine
may end up trivializing the despair that the elderly feel as they
confront the dwindling of their days by trying to medicate away the
sadness that comes with losses. (Michele McDonald/New York Times

RUSSIA SAYS DAGESTAN IS WON, BUT BOMBS RAIN ON REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ For the past week the Kremlin has been declaring
victory over a determined group of Islamic rebels in Dagestan, a
predominantly Muslim province in Russia's volatile Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   But the bombs kept falling Saturday, with Russian jets striking
the village of Chabanmakhi, a separatist stronghold. Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin vowed to stop rebels who ``are trying to break up
that which cannot be broken, our common future and history.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombs fell a day after Russia's military pledged to complete
the Dagestani campaign _ and several days after Moscow said that
federal forces already had captured Chabanmakhi.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has rushed to declare victory before. On Aug. 9, he
predicted the battle would be won in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any claims of victory in Dagestan by the Russian authorities
should be treated with skepticism,'' said Alexander Iskandaryan, a
Moscow-based analyst of the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict began Aug. 7 when Islamic rebels poured into
Dagestan from neighboring Chechnya. Led by Shamil Basayev, a field
commander who helped drive Russian forces out of Chechnya three
years earlier, the rebels occupied several villages in Dagestan's
southwestern Botlikh district. Basayev sought to oust the Russians
and set up an independent Islamic state. Moscow responded with two
weeks of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite holding their ground, Basayev's troops unexpectedly
began retreating Aug. 23, a move analysts say is typical of his
combat strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Defense analyst Pavel Felgenhauer, writing in the
English-language daily The Moscow Times, said Basayev's plan is to
``infiltrate here and there, provoking the Russian military to
`liberate' region after region with bombs and artillery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Dagestanis do not want Chechen warlords to take over
their country and are backing federal troops. But as more towns are
liberated their attitude may begin to change,'' Felgenhauer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Iskandaryan agreed, saying: ``You can't fight extremism by
bombing innocent villagers.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, after declaring victory over Basayev, Russian
forces began bombing Chabanmakhi and Karamakhi, in southeastern
Dagestan's Buinaksk district, where religious leaders had declared
``independence'' and imposed a strict form of Islamic law. Those
caught using tobacco, drinking alcohol, or listening to music faced
public beatings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Basayev surfaced in Chechnya last week, where he
declared a ``holy war'' against Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   During Moscow's war with Chechnya in 1994-96, the Kremlin
repeatedly said victory was just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1995, for example, President Boris N. Yeltsin said
in a radio address that Russian troops had driven rebels forces out
of Grozny, Chechnya's capital. The only military activity, he
assured listeners, was that of Russian soliders laboring to rebuild
the city.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, a military commander in Grozny told reporters that
he had to crank up the volume on his radio just so he could hear
Yeltsin's speech over the deafening gunfire outside his window.
</P>
<P>
   After bombing Chechnya for 20 months and killing tens of
thousands of civilians, Russia was forced in late 1996 into a
humiliating withdrawal, losing control of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another problem flared for Moscow in the Caucasus
region Saturday when a gunfight broke out in the republic of
Karachayevo-Cherkessia, injuring six people.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, the Cherkess, an ethnic minority in the republic,
have been protesting the results of a presidential election won by
a candidate supported by the rival Karchayev ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   The Cherkess have threatened to split from the republic if the
results are not nullified.

MOSCOW'S SPIN ON BANK SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Iron Curtain, the Berlin War, McCarthyism _ and
Monica Lewinsky. These are the images being evoked in Russia, in
response to a Kremlin money laundering scandal that is making
headlines all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations that Russian mob bosses, with Kremlin complicity,
may have laundered as much as $15 billion in pilfered public and
corporate funds, through the Bank of New York, have touched a nerve
here. The matter has insulted this vast country's battered pride _
and has provoked responses of fear, anger and denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not so long ago, the phrase `Soviet threat' was born in the
American political lexicon,'' a front-page story read in Thursday's
Kommersant, a popular newspaper among the country's business elite.
``But political fashions change, and today, `Soviet threat' has
been replaced by `Russian mafia.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The paper went on to say that Americans were equating all
Russian business with organized crime, and that US banks may stop
dealing with Russians ``simply because they are Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cold War photograph of Senator Joseph McCarthy, testifying
before Congress in the 1950s during the Red Scare, accompanied the
story, which also reported that the Bank of New York money
laundering case, then being investigated by US and British
law-enforcement bodies, is fabricated. And they vowed to its
readers to unmask those behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, the newspaper Izvestia ran a banner headline
reading ``The Iron Curtain,'' over a photograph of the Berlin Wall,
with a menacing soldier peering through a crack. Izvestia's story
warned readers that as a result of the scandal, a possible halt in
International Monetary Fund loans to Moscow could be ``the first
step toward the isolation of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal broke as US media outlets reported that US and
British agencies were investigating an alleged money laundering
scam in which, according to the allegations, as much as $15 billion
in embezzled Russian and corporate funds had been channeled through
the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   These reports linked the laundered funds to Russian organized
crime figures, as well as to past and present members of President
Boris N. Yeltsin's government. Some reports also alleged that
International Monetary Fund loans may have been pilfered, although
the IMF is denying this. The IMF has lent Russia some $20 billion
since 1992, with a new loan installment due this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates are already picking up on the scandal as a
theme, and the White House has called future IMF loans to Russia
into question. Congressional investigations are also getting
underway, as both the House Banking Committee and the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee are planning to hold hearings this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most original _ and amusing _ take on the scandal in
the Russian media came from the newspaper Vremya MN, which accused
the Republican Party of cooking up the money laundering case as a
campaign tactic _ and in doing so, invoked the name of Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that a whole scandal could be provoked by Republicans
who aspire to occupy the White House would have been unrealistic
prior to the Lewinsky scandal,'' Vremya MN said. ``But now, to use
material like bank transfers, international finance and the Russia
question against the Democrats looks quite respectable and even
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers running the stories are all controlled by banks
and financial institutions with close ties to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here say that the media-inspired conspiracy rhetoric
will find a receptive audience among most Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accusations that the West is again attacking Russia will
unfortunately have considerable resonance in our society,'' said a
Moscow-based sociologist, Alexei Levinson. ``This scandal reminds
people how dependent Russia is on the West, it makes them angry
about this and it inspires fear that Russia will lose the Western
aid and credits that it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding that ``Russians are sufficiently cynical about their own
public officials, and have no illusions about their honesty,''
Levinson said that most people here believe the corruption
allegations raised in the money laundering scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what people believe to be true is not important,''
Levinson said. ``What is important is emotions and this scandal is
pushing all of Russia's emotional buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   And Russia's journalists aren't the only ones pushing those
buttons; the Kremlin is also getting into the act. Last week,
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said that the scandal was ``an attempt
by certain circles'' to prevent Russia's revival as a great power.
</P>
<P>
   But with elections looming in Russia, some anti-Yeltsin
politicians are themselves trying to take advantage of the scandal.
On Friday, Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, a Kremlin foe who hopes to
become Russia's next president, called on Yeltsin and his allies
either to admit that the allegations are true, or to sue the
Western newspapers that are printing them. ``Until this is done, I
am going to believe everything I read,'' Luzhkov said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A small tumor was removed from the surface of the
brain of Cardinal John O'Connor last week by doctors at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and a course of radiation therapy is
to begin shortly and continue for several weeks, a spokesman for
the Archdiocese of New York announced late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Zwilling, the cardinal's spokesman, gave no prognosis and
few medical details in a brief statement, but said that doctors had
determined that ``no other areas of the body were affected.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Zwilling said that the 79-year-old
archbishop of New York had been released from the cancer center
Saturday morning, after a 10-day hospitalization, and that he had
returned to his residence on Madison Avenue at 51st Street, behind
St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling described the cardinal as being ``in good spirits,''
and said that he continues to work, has been celebrating Masses
privately during his hospitalization, and was looking forward to
returning to ``a full and vigorous'' schedule. But he noted that
the cardinal's schedule ``will be somewhat lessened for the
immediately future.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who has been the spiritual leader of 2.3 million Roman
Catholics in the Archdiocese of New York for more than 15 years and
is regarded as Pope John Paul II's most important American ally,
was admitted to the cancer center on Aug. 25 after experiencing
weakness and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said that a team of doctors under the leadership of Dr.
Kevin M. Cahill, his personal physician, and Dr. Thomas J. Fahey of
Memorial Sloan-Kettering, had performed ``a thorough series of
tests over six days,'' the results of which were given to the
cardinal last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, made shortly after 5 p.m. Saturday, said:
``Doctors removed a small tumor from the surface of the cardinal's
brain. They determined that no other areas of the body were
affected. A course of radiation therapy will begin shortly and
continue over the next several weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not say when or by whom the operation had been
performed, and it gave no details about the precise size or nature
of the tumor that was removed, its position on the surface of the
brain, or the medical prognosis. Zwilling said he could not release
any more medical information about the tumor, or the operation to
remove it.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said that the cardinal would not celebrate Mass
publicly at the cathedral Sunday, and that he had scheduled no
public events for the remainder of the Labor Day weekend. He noted,
however, that the cardinal had been celebrating Masses in his
hospital room and that, after his release at 10 a.m. Saturday, he
had celebrated Mass in a chapel at his residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the cardinal's schedule will be somewhat lessened for
the immediate future, he is looking forward to returning to the
full and vigorous schedule which he has followed since becoming the
archbishop of New York,'' Zwilling said. ``The cardinal is in good
spirits. He has been celebrating mass privately, and he continues
to work on the business of the archdiocese.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling also said that the cardinal had extended ``deep
personal gratitude'' to doctors, nurses, technicians and support
staff at Memorial Sloan-Kettering who had cared for him, and to New
Yorkers and others who had prayed for him and conveyed their good
wishes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the cardinal entered the hospital last month, Zwilling
said that the choice of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, one of the
nation's most prominent cancer centers, did not necessarily mean
that he had cancer. He also declined to say whether the cardinal
had a history or a family history of cancer, hypertension,
cardiopulmonary illness or other medical problems. The hospital,
citing privacy considerations, also declined to provide details.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of his health, the cardinal may retire on his 80th
birthday in January. In 1995, when he turned 75, he submitted his
resignation to the pope, in accordance with church law. But the
Vatican declined to accept, ``until other provision is made,''
which was widely interpreted to mean until a suitable successor
could be found.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, no successor has been announced. Church law
prohibits a cardinal who turns 80 from voting for a new pope, and
it has been widely reported that the cardinal might retire in
January, although church officials have said such a decision would
ultimately be up to the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal has had a number of minor illnesses in recent
years. In 1991, he was briefly hospitalized for heat prostration.
In 1992, he collapsed at the Alfred E. Smith black-tie dinner, and
was hospitalized at St. Vincent's Hospital for what was later
diagnosed as a stomach virus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate, and in
April 1998 he had minor surgery to remove a growth from his nose.
The cardinal's last illness was in January, when a bout of the flu
worsened as he accompanied the pope on a trip to Mexico. He was
unable to continue with the pope on a later stop in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Word that the cardinal had undergone surgery for a brain tumor
drew expressions of concern from a number of people at St.
Patrick's Cathedral, where an announcement was read out at a Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's all right,'' said Jim St. John, of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., who had not attended the Mass, but was drawn to
the cathedral by the crowd of reporters waiting outside, fearing it
might mean bad news about the cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the spokesperson of the American church now,'' St. John
added. ``He's brilliant. He's done more for the church than anyone
in this century. I was here for his installation and that makes it
very emotional for me. We're all very interested to find out what's
going to happen to the church with his retirement pending. We're
just praying. We're just waiting. I'm sure the Holy Spirit will
guide what goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo Dinan, of Oshawa, Ontario, who attended the Mass at St.
Patrick's, said: ``We didn't realize he was ill, and we're glad
they kept us up to date. It is very important that they inform the
parishioners. Our prayers will be that he has a very speedy
recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, David, said of the church: ``It's a close-knit
community. Prayers are being said across North America for the
cardinal. Our parishes will be saying prayers for him as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Skosky, of Collinsville, Ill., said solemnly: ``I hope he
recovers. I pray for his speedy recovery.''

LEADERS OF ISRAEL, PALESTINIANS SIGN PEACE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt _ Surrounded by a panoply of Middle East
leaders and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the Israeli
prime minister, Ehud Barak, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Saturday night signed a broad agreement that the Clinton
administration hopes will quickly usher in a new era of peace
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, held in a beach hotel aired by cool breezes from
the nearby Red Sea, represented an early victory for the apparently
growing trust between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and
crowned a busy day of diplomacy for Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Although her closely watched trip on Saturday to Damascus to
meet Syrian President Hafez Assad yielded no immediate sign that
Israeli-Syrian peace talks can open soon, an administration
official said that the meeting nonetheless laid what he termed an
encouraging basis for negotiations in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Albright then became the first secretary of state in almost 17
years to land in Beirut on an official American government plane,
and held talks with Lebanese leaders on a previously unannounced
stop. Her aides said the negotiations were intended to underline
the administration's desire to see all parties, including Lebanon,
engaged in the search for regional peace .
</P>
<P>
   Many of the principals necessary for achieving that tantalizing
goal were on hand for Saturday night's ceremony, essentially the
signing of a revision of an accord reached last year with the
previous Israeli government, but redolent with hope for a final
settlement. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and King Abdullah of
Jordan applauded as Barak and Arafat, seated side by side on gilt
chairs, signed the latest accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli and the Palestinian, who do not know each other well
but appear to have forged a certain understanding since Barak took
office in July, acted before a backdrop of Egyptian, Israeli,
Jordanian, Palestinian and American flags symbolic of the shared
effort needed for this and future agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we are paving the way toward the end of a century-old
conflict between us and the Palestinians,'' Barak said. ``I am
committed to Israel's security,'' he stressed. ``I also want the
Palestinians to feel secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who on a brief visit to Italy on Saturday hailed the new
accord as a continuation of the venture for which he said the late
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin gave his life, referred to
Barak as ``my new partner in the peace process'' and pledged to
carry out the accords swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   But he also reiterated that Palestinians are determined ``to
build our independent Palestinian state'' with Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Barak, 57, injected energy into a quest for
peace that had been on hold for much of three years and is now
resumed at a time of transition in the Middle East. Both Arafat,
and Assad are 69, and in frail health. Barak is new to power and
comparatively young, while King Abdullah, who is 37, is taking over
from his late father, King Hussein, whose contributions to Middle
East peace were often critical.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ceremony, Israeli, Palestinian and American officials
mingled and chatted easily with each other.
</P>
<P>
   At President Clinton's Camp David, Md., mountain retreat, where
the 1978 framework Middle East peace accords were signed, the
president said the breakthrough ``represents a wonderful
opportunity to move the peace process forward,'' The Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement envisions the end of conflict between the
Palestinians and Israelis a year from now with the emotional issues
of the boundaries of Israel and the Palestinian lands and the
disputed status of Jerusalem solved by then. Other long standing
differences over the return of Palestinian refugees now scattered
through the Middle East and the use of water resources would also
be resolved under this bold strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In the shorter term, the agreement calls for the implementation
of a land-for-security deal signed by the Israelis and Palestinians
at Wye, Md. last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Sept. 13, the Israelis will transfer 7 percent of
the West Bank from its total control to partial control for the
Palestinians. On Nov. 15, another 5 percent of the West Bank will
be transferred to the Palestinians and on Jan. 20, the final
transfer called for in the agreement will be completed, meaning
that 40 percent of the West Bank will then be under partial or full
control of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The longer term goal of a final status agreement between the
Palestinians and the Israelis _ which Barak would like to see
conducted alongside talks with the Syrians _ is now the toughest
business at hand.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the ceremony Saturday night, Albright alluded to
the difficulties ahead. ``The obstacles that permanent status
negotiators will face are daunting,'' she said. ``The issues are
tough, laden with emotion, and deeply rooted in the region's
troubled past. They involve life and death issues for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The final status negotiations, which are supposed to start by
mid-February, will help determine Israel's size, its role in the
Middle East and its position as a secure or threatened state. The
agreement signed Saturday night does not mention specifically the
emergence of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials have acknowledged that in essence the
final status negotiations mean that the Israelis and Palestinians
will sit down for the first time to discuss the terms of that
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Following on what is envisaged as a more generalized agreement
on the framework for such talks, the negotiations on final status
will deal with such vital issues as contiguity of the Palestinian
territory and ways of entering and leaving Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Saturday night whether the February 15 date for a
framework agreement was too ambitious _ as officials on both sides
have suggested _ a senior American official said: ``Maybe. But if
you set sights too low, you won't reach that. If you set sights
high, that's good.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The way Saturday night's agreement was finally stitched together
boded reasonably well for the broader negotiations, the senior
American official said. In the end, Arafat wanted some assurances
on specific concerns _ including the fact that the final transfer
of land would be completed before the framework agreement was drawn
up.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat reportedly had been concerned that Barak would not follow
through on his pledge to deliver the final portion of land if it
was not transferred before the framework agreement was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Going back over some of the key moments in three days of shuttle
diplomacy, the official recalled that when Albright and top
American officials arrived at Gaza City Friday night, it was
unclear whether Arafat had signed off on the complete document. But
Arafat was relaxed when the Americans walked in and ``optimistic
about the future,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Americans placed a call to Barak from Arafat's office
for the two leaders to talk on Friday night, Arafat opened the
conversation with the Israeli by saying: ``'Shabat, Shalom,''' one
of the Americans said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at the ceremony Saturday night was in a totally
celebratory mood. ``This marks moving from a frozen process to a
working process,'' said Nabil Shaath, one of the Palestinian
negotiators who worked on the agreement with the Israelis. ``It
promises a happy future but it will be really happy when it is
implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaath said he was delighted that the United States was back in
the process of trying to agree on peace.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have been anxious to play down their role. One of
the officials involved in the talks of the last few days said that
in contrast to the Wye document last fall and an earlier agreement
in 1997 dealing with Hebron, the Palestinians and Israelis drafted
and wrote this document themselves. The other two had been drafted
by the Americans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had made a dozen phone calls during the past few weeks
urging both sides on, the official said. And Dennis Ross, the
administration's senior Middle East negotiator, was on the phone
daily with them, sometimes on conference calls with the two sides.
But this was a qualitatively different role to pushing the two
sides together as was necessary under the former Israeli prime
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the American official said.
</P>
<P>
   The American official cited as an indication of the trust built
in recent months what he said was a remark by Saeb Erekat, the
senior Palestinian negotiator. He quoted Erekat as saying that he
could now understand, if not always agree with, the Israeli point
of view. ``I am finally able to put myself in their shoes,'' Erekat
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of the tough road ahead, Albright summoned the
Palestinians and Israelis to muster still more courage, and invoked
the example of past Middle East leaders who had done the same. ``If
we were to ask, where will the negotiators find the required
strength and confidence?'' she asked. ``I can only think of the
model provided by Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin, by Yitzhak Rabin
and King Hussein. These leaders experienced war and understood,
therefore, the need to prevent war.''

A LOSING PROPOSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ The Gambler is a masochist moved by the
excitement of thundering horses and animated jocks. He thinks he
can defy the arithmetic lined up against him, but he never does
even though he vainly keeps trying.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in a perpetual agony because of the maddening
fickleness of his pursuit. There are no certainties in horse races
or games, but he lives with the illusion that he can beat a system
that conspires against him.
</P>
<P>
   He can't resist the dark temptation of making money without
working for it, but inevitably winds up broke for giving in to such
an inane impulse. He knows after a while that his addiction is
self-destructive, but he refuses to change because he enjoys the
emotional jolts he receives during his rare moments of financial
gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Gambler does not fit any stereotypical mold. He is just as
liable to be an erudite college professor as he is to be a
bartender, and I know a one-time professor who's shattered his life
because of his race track forays. He is just as liable to be a
high-priced heart surgeon as he is to be a ticket scalper, and I
knew a doctor, now dead, responsible for the down payment on a
bookmaker's home. He is just as liable to own a lucrative car
dealership as he is to be a liquor salesman, and I know a guy who
blew his lucrative car dealership because of the millions he lost
from his uncontrollable betting urges.
</P>
<P>
   The football season is now upon us, and The Gambler is being
heavily recruited by bookmakers. That in itself should make him
wary, but it never does. He accepts their phone numbers with naive
gladness, and blithely ignores the harrowing fact that the calls
he'll make during the autumn will result in the drastic
diminishment of his bank account.
</P>
<P>
   This is the inevitable outcome because he must lay 11 dollars
for every 10 dollars he bets, and thus the numbers are aligned
against him. It's difficult enough to guess which side will win a
football game based upon a point spread, but this 11 to 10 gimmick
known as the vigorish makes the entire proposition a mathematical
impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't matter to The Gambler, who wallows in a fog of
self-denial, who boasts shamelessly about his winners and lapses
into a silent depression when his handicapping results in losers.
</P>
<P>
   He often doesn't understand he's engaged in a fool's sport until
it's too late, until the creditors foreclose on his properties,
until the car is repossessed, until the wife and kids depart, until
he loses his job or business, until he finds himself having to live
in the den of his best friend, until he realizes he must spend his
evenings attending Gambler's Anonymous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Gambler spends wasteful hours studying the form sheets and
listening to the views of pundits, but winds up cursing his
misfortune when a jockey miscalculates or a running back fumbles or
an official blows a call.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps practicing his hopeless art year after dreary year even
though his ultimate fate never changes, and he has nothing to show
for all of his wagering.
</P>
<P>
   He is a likable fellow, quick to pick up tabs on those rare
occasions when his pockets are stuffed with money. He can be fun,
and light up a party with his one liners.
</P>
<P>
   But most of his life is spent curing his misfortune. Oh, if only
I hadn't taken that horse out of the Pick 6 I could have won that
million dollar payoff, oh, if only that quarterback hadn't been
intercepted, oh, if only that receiver hadn't dropped the ball in
the end zone, oh, if, if, if, ad nauseam.
</P>
<P>
   He so often has a blank expression fixed on his florid face
because his life is an endless roller-coaster of emotions, with the
giddiness from winning never quite matching the horrible gloom that
envelops him from losing.
</P>
<P>
   The Gambler perceives his bookmaker as his friend, but this is a
misguided perception because the bookmaker is an unlicensed
pawnbroker who puts his customers in hock. A bookmaker is a
heartless scoundrel who earns his living from the compulsive
weaknesses of his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Betting is a sham that exploits those who pursue it, and even
the government of the states are involved in it with their
lotteries that fleece millions of dollars each week from people who
can't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a terrible habit that those addicted can't easily shake,
and I've known too many people ruined by it. I'll defend the right
of a person to make a bet, but I'll also ridicule him harshly for
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   But The Gambler doesn't care about the odds stacked again him,
about the unfortunate events that await ominously on the horizon
for him.
</P>
<P>
   He just cares about getting down, and feeling that wicked
adrenaline rush that one feels when he's punched out a race ticket,
or when he gives a clerk his gridiron selection.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a mean facade, and at the end The Gambler will be broke
because only those taking the action in his endeavor make money.
The bettors never come out on top at the end, but the suckers keep
trying for reasons not even the psycho-babblers have been able to
figure out.

BAYLOR IS THE MAN TO TURN ANGELS AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Terry Collins didn't quit Friday. His players got
him fired two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The trick for the Anaheim Angels, who face a winter even more
chaotic than the regular season, is to make sure that never happens
again.
</P>
<P>
   Hire Don Baylor. Hire him now.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem as though getting the playoff-bound Atlanta Braves
batting coach at this point in the season would be like hiring a
coach just before he goes to the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But protocol is out the window at this point. The Angels aren't
going to be able to gut their roster in the offseason. They need
someone who can give them some guts.
</P>
<P>
   They need someone who can get the players _ who mutinied against
Collins before cannibalizing themselves _ to look in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   For the modern player, that is so much harder than hitting a
curveball.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor can do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Robin Yount what the scariest sight was during his Hall of
Fame career and he'll say it was seeing Don Baylor coming in on him
to break up a double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels need more than a metaphor. And in Baylor they would
have one.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor was the American League MVP with the Angels in 1979 and
still lives in the area. His leadership led the club to some of its
greatest seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He offers sound managerial credentials, taking expansion
Colorado to three winning seasons in six years.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, Baylor offers something Collins, for all his
attributes, never could. A clubhouse presence that turns 25 players
into one.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers won four World Series with the team of GM Buzzie
Bavasi and manager Walt Alston, who played one major-league game
between them. But those days are over. Players are bigger, stronger
and faster than ever. They are also more fragile.
</P>
<P>
   There is no excusing how poorly the Angels players acted this
season. They used the team's injuries as their out-clause and when
that wasn't enough they ripped the manager.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins' playing career, which never reached the majors, is
not much different than Earl Weaver's or Tom Lasorda's. Only the
time in which he managed has changed. The others are in the Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is headed home with $450,000 to be paid for next year,
but without the legacy he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   When Baylor was at Dodger Stadium last month with the Braves, he
couldn't say he wanted the Angels job. Collins was still in place,
but the obvious was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, aware that only two of 11 African-American managers ever
have been given a second chance, knows that the odds have not
always been in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   But now he holds the hammer. Baltimore, where he broke in as a
player, wants him desperately. The Orioles have an old, unmotivated
team in need of some fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels need to act now. The last time they waited, they let
Mo Vaughn take their free-agent offer and shop it around for two
months before saying yes.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good chance GM Bill Bavasi and club president Tony
Taveras will be gone by next spring training. So too will Disney,
which is expected to sell the club to Irvine-based billionaire
Henry Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans will still be there. So will most of the team,
underachievers or not.
</P>
<P>
   They need Don Baylor now.

FIRST LADY URGES PRESIDENT TO WITHDRAW CLEMENCY OFFER FOR TERRORIST
GROUP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton called on President Clinton Saturday to
immediately withdraw his offer to commute the prison sentences of
16 members of a Puerto Rican terrorist organization, saying they
had failed to meet his demand to renounce violence in exchange for
clemency.
</P>
<P>
   The White House responded by saying it had set a deadline of 5
p.m. Friday for the prisoners, who have been connected to at least
130 bombings of military and political installations in the United
States between 1974 and 1983, to meet the president's conditions.
But the first lady said that was not soon enough for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believes the offer of clemency should be withdrawn now,''
her spokesman, Howard Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp disagreement between the first lady and her husband on
this high-profile topic came at a time when Mrs. Clinton's
supporters have voiced growing concern that the president's offer
of clemency _ which the first lady asserted Saturday was done
without her knowledge _ threatened to complicate her likely
campaign for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats have assailed the clemency offer, and
Mrs. Clinton's opponents have accused the president of using the
White House to curry favor for Mrs. Clinton among Hispanic voters,
an influential and growing segment of New York's political
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's statement, issued by her Senate exploratory
committee as she spent the weekend at Camp David with her husband,
did not take issue with the president's original decision,
announced on Aug. 11, to offer a conditional clemency to the 16
members of the Armed Forces of National Liberation, or FALN, the
initials for the Spanish rendering of the name. But she noted that
the president had made the offer on the condition that the
prisoners _ none of whom had been directly related to any crimes
that resulted in death or injury _ renounce any future acts of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been three weeks and their silence speaks volumes,'' Mrs.
Clinton said in the statement. ``I believe the offer of clemency
should be withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's announcement set off a confused couple of hours
involving the White House and Mrs. Clinton's exploratory campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said the administration
had sent a letter on Friday to the Chicago-based lawyer for the 16
FALN members, setting the Sept. 10 deadline. White House aides said
they were unaware that Mrs. Clinton was about to step into the
dispute when they set the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's aides alerted reporters to her statement just
before 1:30 p.m. Saturday. Wolfson said that Mrs. Clinton did not
know about the White House letter at the time. He said she had
alerted the president to her concerns about the clemency while they
were vacationing, but did not inform the president of her intention
to issue a public statement until Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``She found out about the letter when she told the president
about the statement,'' Wolfson said. ``While she is pleased with
the letter, she believes the offer of clemency should be withdrawn
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now the first lady had, by all appearances, embraced the
administration line, saying that the prisoners should not be
released until they renounced violence. This was the first time
Mrs. Clinton had made any mention of a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican who is
likely to run for the Senate against Mrs. Clinton, and who had
called on the president to withdraw the clemency offer, declined
through a City Hall spokesman to comment on Mrs. Clinton's action.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's statement marked the latest, and clearly the most
striking, attempt by the first lady to distance herself from the
administration on an issue in which White House policy might prove
problematic to a Democrat seeking to become senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, she had joined New York political and labor leaders at
a White House meeting complaining about Clinton's proposed cuts in
Medicare reimbursements to hospitals. She had also parted with the
State Department on Mideast policy, saying she thought Jerusalem
should be the ``eternal and indivisible capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The conditional commutation had proved to be a particularly
complicated issue. Some of Mrs. Clinton's most important supporters
_ among them Rep. Jose E. Serrano of the Bronx, Rep. Charles Rangel
of Harlem and Dennis Rivera, the head of 1199, the 150,000-member
National Health and Human Service Employees Union _ had supported
the president's action.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's announcement had been met with wave of
criticism of Clinton, from Republicans as well as Democrats,
notably Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose decision to not run for
re-election created the opening that is now the subject of the
expected contest between Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has gathered force both in New York in Washington,
particularly after it emerged that the president made the decision
over the objections of a wide range of federal law-enforcement
agencies that had reviewed the clemency petition. The White House
has refused to elaborate on the reasons for the president's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Police commissioner, Howard Safir, held a news
conference with three retired officers who had been injured by
bombs placed outside Police Headquarters in 1982 to denounce the
president. The FALN had claimed credit for placing those bombs.
Giuliani did not appear with Safir, but made clear he approved of
the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   It also has appeared increasingly likely in recent weeks that
the issue could be kept alive through congressional hearings in
Washington, which would be an unwanted distraction for Mrs.
Clinton's campaign. Republicans in Congress have begun to subpoena
White House and Justice Department records on the clemency process
in anticipation of hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, in her statement, insisted that her husband had
acted on his own in granting the clemency petition. ``When the
administration first offered these prisoners clemency, I made it
very clear that I had no involvement in, or prior knowledge, of the
decision, as is entirely appropriate,'' she said.

 &HT;    ALBRIGHT WITNESSES PROGRESS AMONG ISRAEL AND PALESTINIANS,
CONTINUED STALEMATE WITH SYRIA
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM As U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright looked
on last night, two long-time foes, Israelis and Palestinians,
affirmed a plan to settle all their differences within a year. But
her efforts duriing her visit to the Middle East to coax Syria into
settling that country's disputes with Israel still showed little
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Albright witnessed the signing of a new Palestinian-Israeli
peace agreement in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh,
land once conquered by Israel and then returned under the Camp
David Agreements of 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Israelis and Palestinians negotiated this pact
directly is a rich source of hope for the future,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The pact signed just after midnight in Egypt is the seventh plan
signed since 1993, the start of the on-again, off-again Oslo peace
process and is acutally a revision of the Wye River Memorandum, an
agreement signed in Washington in October. The plan sets a schedule
for the Israeli withdrawal from predominantly Arab land in the West
Bank, which Israel captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's four-day tour of the region aims at taking advantage
of what American officials believe is a new opportunity for peace
between Israel and all its neighbors: the May election of Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   In an another hopeful sign earlier in the day Saturday, she made
a surprise visit to Lebanon to consult with Prime Minister Salim
el-Hoss and she became the first secretary of state since 1983 to
use the public airport in that war-scarred country. In her previous
visit, she had helicoptered directly to the heavily fortified U.S.
Embassy complex.
</P>
<P>
   The signing represents more of a new atmosphere than any
substantive change in the plan for settling the throny issues that
separtate the Israelis and Palestinians . The Wye memorandum was
signed but abandoned by former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians are worried that the new agreement will also not be
implemented. But, Albright said the new agreement represents a
return to the mutual trust the parties showed in signing the
original outline for peace, the 1993 Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton, from Camp David, called the agreement a
``new beginning'' and asked Congress to approve $1.6 billion in aid
promised to the two sides for implementing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Barak noted that the agreement sets a
timetable for all issues to be settled within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we are paving the way to the end of the century-old
conflict between us and the Palestinians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his election campaign, Barak had promised to resume the old
Wye process, but then he refused to do so until it was
renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   He won a deal that lets him slow down the land transfers while
speeding up the discussions of the major issues between the two
sides such as whether Israel will share Jerusalem with the
Palestinians or allow the return of millions of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The methodical former general has been apprehensive about giving
away land without knowing how the final issues will be solved. The
agreement sets a new deadline of September 2000 for the resolution
of all issues.
</P>
<P>
   What the Palestinians get in the deal is less apparent. Much of
the new plan is a repeat of the old Wye, but Barak seems more
determined to carry it out than Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement lets the Palestinians start construction on an
$80 million seaport in The Gaza Strip, promised in the old
agreement. It promises to let Palestinians travel, in controlled
caravans, through Israel between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
anther item promised before.
</P>
<P>
   It also promises the release of 350 Palestinians in Israeli
jails for anti-Israel activity. Palestinians, viewing the prisoners
as political detainees, had sought more, but this would be more
than Netanyahu afforded.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they await to see if this agreement will be implemented,
unlike the last, and they still bristle Barak's insistence on
renegotiating a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He insisted on changing it and called the Palestinians
stubborn for not wanting to go along with him,'' said former
Palestinian cabinet member Hanan Ashrawi. ``With every new
agreement, we have managed to chip away at the substance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, the chances that they will get what was written are
higher than have been,'' said Israeli political columnist Chemi
Shalev.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's dealings on Israel's northern front were not as
productive.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years, Israeli troops have occupied a 9-mile-wide swathe
of land in southern Lebanon, battling forces that have opposed the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon is now controlled by Syria. It is believed that Syria
would rein in the anti-Israeli Hezbollah guerrillas if Israel
returns the Golan Heights, conquered from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   But, talks between the two sides broke off in 1996 and Syria has
asked that Israel agree up-front on the principle of returning the
entire Golan Heights before talks restart. Syrian officials
repeated those conditions Saturday to Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts speculate that progress between Israel and
the Palestinians will put pressure on Syria to also make peace.
Albright, who had helped close Palestinian deal the night before,
hoped it would carry momentum through her trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The light that came from yesterday's agreement should also let
us illuminate the whole region,'' she said in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   She was scheduled to go to Turkey Sunday, but possibly return
for a night in Israel.

FOR U.S. SOCCER TEAM, EXHIBITION IS A CORONATION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ The American women's soccer team that captured
the fancy of sports fans and the news media this summer returned to
action for the first time Saturday afternoon since winning the
World Cup. The players walked onto the Foxboro Stadium field waving
their arms and blowing kisses to the crowd of 30,564 in an
atmosphere reminiscent of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But because this was an exhibition game against Ireland, a
rather weak team that the Americans demolished by 5-0 despite only
one day's practice, there were no wild celebrations after goals.
Nothing like Tisha Venturini doing a back flip in the World Cup
victory over North Korea or Brandi Chastain shedding her jersey
after her deciding penalty kick against China in the championship
game in July.
</P>
<P>
   After close to two months of endorsements and public appearances
off the field for the American team, this game against Ireland was
a coronation of sorts. It was like raising the banner to the
rafters by a hockey or basketball team, a reunion with the fans who
fell in love with a group of soccer players because they brought a
world championship to this country and recognition for women in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Only three players from the World Cup roster were missing.
Goalkeeper Briana Scurry, who made the crucial save in the shootout
against China in the World Cup final, had a prior commitment.
Defender Lorrie Fair is back in school at the University of North
Carolina. And midfielder Michelle Akers, who has chronic fatigue
syndrome, is still recuperating from the World Cup and will not
return to play until January.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain started in the second half because she joined the team
just before the game and had not practiced. Her place at left
fullback had been taken by Christie Pearce, while Saskia Webber
took Scurry's place in goal and Tiffany Roberts started in midfield
in place of Akers.
</P>
<P>
   The game came 56 days after the Americans' World Cup triumph
before a crowd of 90,185 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. This
is in contrast to 1991, when the Americans won the World Cup and
then took nine months off.
</P>
<P>
   Despite only a single practice in preparation for this game, the
Americans orchestrated a great deal of action that excited the
crowd. The Americans played with imagination and creativity in
midfield and finished their efforts effectively, especially in the
second half, when they scored three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffeny Milbrett, the engine for the Americans in midfield in
the World Cup, led the team Saturday with two goals, including the
game's opening goal in the 25th minute. Julie Foudy, Joy Fawcett
and Kristine Lilly had the other goals for the Americans, who
improved their 1999 record to 21-2-2, with the penalty-kick victory
over China in the World Cup counting as a tie in the official
records.

MICHIGAN BEATS NOTRE DAME, 26-22  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ Forget the feud over Notre Dame's adding an
extra game; it was manufactured. Michigan's quarterback
controversy? It was solved early and emphatically. But one thing
remained true to form when the Wolverines and the Fighting Irish _
the nation's two winning-est programs _ renewed their bitter
rivalry Saturday: they played until the final minute and stayed
within a couple points of each other.
</P>
<P>
   For the 11th time in their last 18 meetings, 7 or fewer points
decided the game. This time, with Notre Dame out of timeouts and
desperately trying to line up on Michigan's 11-yard line, a
National Collegiate Athletic Association-record crowd of 111,523
sent a roar of approval reverberating through Michigan Stadium over
the final score: Michigan 26, Notre Dame 22.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen points were scored in the final eight minutes, and with
4 minutes 8 seconds to play, the No. 16-ranked Irish looked as if
they were in command. Lloyd Carr, coach of No. 7 Michigan, had
complained that the Irish had violated a gentleman's agreement by
adding an opening game last week against Kansas. He claimed it was
an unfair advantage. It hardly looked like it Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fighting Irish's drive to take a 22-19 lead pretty much
captured how a young, talented team can alternately tantalize and
torment. On the seven-play, 65-yard march, there were passes that
accounted for 40 yards, and there were false starts and missed
blocking assignments that gave half of that back.
</P>
<P>
   There was quarterback Jarious Jackson's composure: on
fourth-and-1 from the 19, he faked a handoff, rolled left and threw
across the field to a wide-open Jabari Holloway, who walked into
the end zone for the 20-19 lead. There was Bobby Brown's costly
enthusiasm: after catching a 2-point conversion pass to put the
Irish ahead by 22-19, he and his teammates were penalized for
excessive celebration. It meant Notre Dame had to kick off from its
own 20-yard line, and Michigan started its game-winning drive on
its own 42.
</P>
<P>
   The senior quarterback Tom Brady acted quickly. He passed to
Marcus Knight for a 15-yard gain that became 30 when Notre Dame
safety A'Jani Sanders was penalized for a late hit. He took
Michigan to the Irish 5-yard line with a slant pass to David
Terrell. Two plays later, Anthony Thomas swept left into the end
zone; Jeff Del Verne kicked the extra point and Michigan was ahead,
26-22.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Irish had 1:38 left. They had Jackson and hope but no
timeouts. The senior quarterback took them to the 11. But that
wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different Wolverines team that came out in the second
half _ one led by Brady, who had started the game before giving way
to Drew Henson in the second quarter. The senior tri-captain wasted
no time, taking the Wolverines 80 yards in 3:08. He completed 4 of
5 passes for 63 yards before Thomas took it over from the 2-yard
line for a touchdown, giving Michigan a 16-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Two more times in the third quarter Brady moved Michigan down
the field: a 32-yard drive ended with Del Verne missing a 26-yard
field goal, and a 29-yard drive saw Del Verne kick a 27-yarder to
put Michigan ahead, 19-14. Brady remained the Wolverines'
quarterback for the remainder of the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Brady and Henson each played a quarter as an
audition to be the Wolverines' quarterback in the second half.
Michigan controlled the clock in the first half _ 15:35 to 14:24 _
but failed to convert critical third downs; the Wolverines were 4
for 9.
</P>
<P>
   With Brady at the helm on the opening drive, the Wolverines
marched 41 yards in nine plays to the Irish 9. But the Notre Dame
defense stuffed Thomas on third-and-6, and Michigan settled for a
21-yard field goal by Del Verne.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines stalled again on their next possession. On
third-and-3 from the Notre Dame 18, Brady tried to find Knight on a
square-out pass but the pass was caught out of bounds. This time
Del Verne kicked a 25-yarder for a 6-0 Michigan lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish, however, were ready to break free, and they did it on
the first play after the kickoff. On first-and-10 from their own
20, Jackson rolled left and found Tony Fisher, who had circled from
the backfield, alone on the 40-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher caught the pass over his shoulder and raced down the
sideline to Michigan's 25, and another 5 yards was tacked on for a
face-mask penalty. On second-and-9, Jackson turned a near certain
sack into a 9-yard gain down to the 16-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-goal and the Michigan Stadium crowd at full volume,
Jackson and the Irish line rolled right while flanker Joey
Getherall circled back left. Jackson pitched the reverse to back to
Getherall and he scampered into the end zone alone. Jim Sanson
converted the extra point and the Irish were up, 7-6, after an
eight-play, 80-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Then Henson took over for Michigan in the second quarter, but he
had no better luck than Brady in turning a big play into 6 points.
Again, the Wolverines could not convert on third down and Del Verne
came in to kick his third field goal of the first half, a
37-yarder, to give the lead back to Michigan, 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:20 left in the half, the Irish got the ball on Michigan's
41. It didn't take Jackson long to torture Michigan with his
footwork. Two of his scrambles picked up half of that yardage and
the last one translated into a spectacular touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   On first down from the 12, Michigan sent all its linebackers
after Jackson. Fullback Joey Goodspeed blocked one linebacker, but
Jackson still needed to roll left to elude three more blue jerseys.
He then cut back between them, jittered left, shuffled right,
picking up a block from center John Merandi, before twirling into
the end zone to give Notre Dame a 14-9 halftime lead.

METS LOOKING FOR SHORTCUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo went 6 for 6 with
three homers Monday. The defense has a .988 fielding percentage.
Rookie right-hander Octavio Dotel has walked into a pennant race
and put himself in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the New York Mets go far in the postseason, expect
them to use Alfonzo and Dotel as part of a package to acquire
Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also are fascinated with the idea of trading for the
future Hall of Famer. But the Mets, who would also throw in
shortstop Rey Ordonez, have the players to make this a real
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are faced with Rodriguez and Ken Griffey Jr.
leaving through free agency after next season. Both are seeking
long contracts for well over $100 million. It is expected Seattle
will make a deal with Rodriguez if it cannot re-sign him this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Means nothing in October: If the season ended today, the
wild-card Mets would face the Arizona Diamondbacks in the first
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Right now that doesn't look too good for the Mets, who went 2-7
this year against the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is 8-16 against the other first-round possibilities,
Atlanta, Houston and Cincinnati, but they have outscored the Mets
63-39.
</P>
<P>
   It should be remembered that the last time the Mets made it to
the postseason (1988), they faced a Dodgers team they had defeated
10 of 11 times during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers won the NLCS in seven games and went on to beat
Oakland in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get into October, who cares what happened in the
regular season?'' Arizona left-hander Brian Anderson said. ``The
Mets won't come in here intimidated by us by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   First things first: Of course, the San Francisco Giants took a
seven-game lead into Saturday's action and cut the Diamondbacks'
lead to five games with a month to play. Barry Bonds took off
Friday's 12-2 win over Pittsburgh, but he continues his amazing
late-season run. Wednesday he had his fourth two home run game in
his past 13 games. He finished August with 14 homers, the most by a
Giants player since Willie Mays hit 17 in August 1965. ``Thank God
that it's happening now,'' manager Dusty Baker said. ``You've
almost come to expect it. He does it day in and day out. The main
thing now is to win. He wants to win badly and we want to win
badly.''
</P>
<P>
   More problems: Although most of the blame for the Phillies'
decline has been traced to Curt Schilling 's three-week stay on the
disabled list, third baseman Scott Rolen hasn't helped. Rolen, who
missed just eight games in his first two seasons, has missed 24
this season with a sore lower back. Since July 21, Rolen has just
two homers and 14 RBI. In 16 games before the injury, Rolen hit
.317 with nine homers and 22 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Bright future: The Pirates' .500 season is already an
overwhelming success. They have not challenged Houston or
Cincinnati in the Central Division, but they have laid the
foundation for future success. Second baseman !bolod!Warren Morris
is a rookie of the year favorite. First baseman Kevin Young became
the fourth player in frachise history to hit 20 homers and steal 20
bases in the same season. Brian Giles, acquired from Cleveland
after the Indians said he could be an everyday player, had 12
homers and 31 RBI in August and is at 34 and 100 for the year.
Giles could challenge for Paul Waner 's club record of 131 RBI set
in 1927.

 &HT;    50 years of racing at Darlington
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ In the first Southern 500 at Darlington
Raceway, the majority of competitors drove their stock cars to and
from the track.
</P>
<P>
   Few hotels existed near the tiny, rural South Carolina town _
located 72 miles east of the capital city of Columbia _ so many
drivers spent the night in their cars during the 15 days of
qualifying. On race day, masking tape was used for car numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have seat belts, so we had to tie ourselves in the
car with a rope,'' Hall of Fame driver Cotton Owens said. ``And the
doors had handles, so we had to tie them shut with a dog collar.''
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural Southern 500 was Sept. 4, 1950. Today's 1 p.m.
event is the 50th anniversary of the race, which is a bona fide
Southern and NASCAR tradition. The aura of the 1.366-mile banked
oval, once known as ``The Lady in Black'' for its tendency to scar
shiny new cars, has changed little over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much history at Darlington,'' Jeff Burton said.
``To me, it's one of the biggest races of the year. It's a race
that has put Winston Cup racing where it is (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Mantz's claim to fame was winning the inaugural Southern
500, which was the first Winston Cup (then called Grand National)
race to be held on a paved raceway and the first to go 500 miles.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mantz's lone Cup victory. He took the checkered flag in
six hours, 38 minutes and 40 seconds at an average speed of 75.250
mph. One of the co-owners of Mantz's car was Bill France Sr.,
founder of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sport's most memorable moments have occurred at the
Southern 500 in the past half-decade:
</P>
<P>
   1962: Junior Johnson drove into the winner's circle, but a
protest by Lee Petty caused a review of the manual scoring cards.
Larry Frank was declared the official winner and was honored in a
ceremony the next day in front of empty grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   1965: Ned Jarrett had one of the most dominating victories of
his career, winning by 14 laps. Rookie driver Buren Skeen was
involved in a collision on the second lap and died nine days later.
Cale Yarborough was knocked over the wall in Turn 2, with a young
college student by the name of Robert Yates watching nearby.
</P>
<P>
   1966: Earl Balmer nearly destroyed the press box after his car
hit the rail and became airborne.
</P>
<P>
   1976: David Pearson claimed the first of three Southern 500
victories. He won the most races (10) at Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   1985: In the most famous race of his career, Bill Elliott won
the race and the inaugural Winston Million on national television.
Elliott appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated for the
monetary feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has just been a good race track for me, for whatever
reason,'' Elliott said. ``The '85 race was big, and I also think
it's ironic that my last (Cup) win came there in '94.''
</P>
<P>
   1998: Jeff Gordon became the first driver to win four years in a
row and trails only Yarborough in career victories (five) in the
Southern 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darlington has turned into one of my favorite tracks,'' Gordon
said. ``It wasn't one of my favorite places in the beginning, but
eventually it became a place where I really enjoy racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough, tough race track _ one of those tracks that no
matter how perfect your day is going, you'll have a situation when
you say, 'Hey, I just barely made it through that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Darlington Raceway is shaped more like an egg than a modern
oval. The turns on the west end are much tighter than the other end
because builder Harold Brasington refused to destroy a minnow pond
on the outside on turn 4. The unusual design has created problems
for drivers since the inaugural race.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can do everything short of blowing the damned place up,
but Darlington is still the same treacherous old track that it was
15 years ago when I first raced there,'' said Rusty Wallace, who
has yet to win a Southern 500.

 &HT;    Martin to have surgery
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Mark Martin won the Dura-Lube 200 on Saturday
for his fifth Busch Series victory in 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the season-long success in the Grand National division,
Martin's victory at Darlington Raceway was a minor surprise. Martin
had said the car was an ``embarrassment'' after qualifying Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just never dreamed that we could win the race, but I've got
to give credit to the team and (crew chief) Tony Lambert,'' Martin
said. ``They never gave up. They still thought (we) could win.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Blaney and Matt Kenseth, who is second in the points
standings, rounded out the top three.
</P>
<P>
   Offseason surgery
</P>
<P>
   Martin canceled back surgery during the the last offseason but
says he will have the operation Nov. 22, the day after the
season-ending race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Martin's injury has
been diagnosed as a deteriorating disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm up for the fusion (surgery) as long as somebody will
not guarantee me but really convince me that I'm going to be better
after I have it,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   New millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   Through the Winston No Bull 5 program, five race fans each have
the chance to become a millionaire if their driver takes the
checkered flag in today's race. The eligible drivers are Dale
Jarrett, Tony Stewart, Bobby Labonte, Jeff Burton and Martin. With
a victory by any of the five, the driver and paired fan each win $1
million. The fans were selected at random by a nationwide
sweepstakes program The drivers became eligible by finishing in the
top five at May's Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR rocks
</P>
<P>
   The rock group Blessed Union of Souls is shooting a video this
weekend for its last song ``Rev It Up, NASCAR Rocks.'' Drivers
participating in the filming include Darrell Waltrip, Dale
Earnhardt Jr. and Bill Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   Off track
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the day on the feud between Dale Earnhardt and Terry
Labonte came from Jarrett: ``Oh, (Earnhardt) is aggravating as hell
to race with, but that's him. It's aggravating, but it's fun
racing.'' . . . Mike Dillon has signed to drive a Grand National
car for Richard Childress Racing through the 2002 season. . . . For
the second race in a row, Jerry Nadeau is the substitute driver for
the No. 36 Pontiac. Now that Ernie Irvan has retired, Nadeau likely
will remain the car for the final 11 races. ``If things keep going
the way they're going, I could be there the rest of the year,''
said Nadeau, who will start third in today's race. He is under
contract to drive for Hendrick Motorsports next season. Johnny
Benson and Todd Bodine have surfaced as candidates for the No. 36
car next year. . . . A.J. Foyt, who is seeking a driver for his Cup
team next year, confirmed he is not considering Kenny Brack, who is
the defending Indy Racing League Champion and drives for one of the
two Foyt-owned IRL teams. ``I don't think Kenny is ready yet,''
Foyt said. ``He liked the IROC races, but there's a big difference
between that and Winston Cup.'' Foyt's Cup car will apparently be
No. 14, the same number Foyt made famous as driver in open-wheel
racing.

 &HT;    Tear gas was part of FBI inventory, spokesman says
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When the FBI took over the government's standoff
with the Branch Davidians, it quickly asked for and got a store of
equipment from the military.
</P>
<P>
   The list was extensive: 10 Bradley Fighting Vehicles; four
Combat Engineering Vehicles; two Abrams tanks; an M88 tank
retriever; helicopters; Humvees; tents, generators and video
equipment; gas masks, night vision goggles and concertina wire.
</P>
<P>
   What the FBI didn't get was tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman told the Waco Tribune-Herald that the agency's
Hostage Rescue Team in 1993 carried military tear gas as a regular
part of its inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Media representative Dave Miller said the FBI did not have to
turn to the military to get canisters of M-651 CS, a pyrotechnic.
At least two canisters of military tear gas were shot at an
underground area beside the Davidians' residence _ several hours
before a fire destroyed Mount Carmel, leading to the deaths of
David Koresh and 75 followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all munitions, the FBI goes out on bid, just as all
government entities do,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that the FBI had to get the military
tear gas from a military source. Department of Defense spokesman
Bill Darley, however, said his agency ruled that out after
painstakingly examining its role in the 51-day standoff, with much
of the examination done to prepare for the 1995 Congressional
hearings on Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our assertion is that we didn't provide them any CS gas,''
Darley said. ``Not from Fort Hood, not from Fort Bliss, not from
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the audio portion of a recently released infrared
film, HRT Commander Richard M. Rogers gave approval at 7:48 a.m. on
April 19, 1993, to fire the military tear gas. Film taken that day
by KWTX-TV, Channel 10, of Waco shows the back of a Bradley vehicle
lowering and a man taking aim toward the underground bunker area
with an M-79 grenade launcher shortly after 8 a.m. The KWTX camera
caught a small whiff of smoke coming from the grenade launcher,
then panned to the left, where smoke could be seen rising from the
bunker area.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's acknowledgement that its Hostage Rescue Team carried
military tear gas in its arsenal reflects what some call the
militarization of civilian law enforcement. That trend bothered the
Committee on Government Reform and Oversight that looked at Mount
Carmel four years ago _ even without its knowing about the use of
pyrotechnic tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When ATF had to decide between arresting Koresh away from the
Branch Davidian residence or a direct confrontation, it chose
direct confrontation,'' the committee reported. ``ATF also chose to
conduct a dynamic entry as opposed to a siege.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee concluded, ``Civilian law enforcement's increasing
use of militaristic tactics is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Paschall, one of the reviewers who blistered the ATF for its
handling of the raid on Mount Carmel, said he doesn't find the
FBI's use of military tear gas ``sinister.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure civilian law enforcement should be restricted
from using it,'' said Paschall, a former commander of Delta Force.
``To my mind, you need to use whatever it takes to get the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Paschall said a so-called burster releases the tear gas in a
military tear gas canister.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a burning effect,'' he said. ``There's an advantage
to that. If you toss it into a crowd of rioters, for example, the
probability of one of them picking it up and tossing it back are
remote.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Paschall said the use of military tear gas must be
carefully considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use a round that's pyrotechnic, you have to consider
the possibility of fire and the resulting cost,'' Paschall said.

FUGITIVE FINANCIER CAPTURED FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE FLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., this story has been added to NYT Page 1)  
 (HLW)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN and KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin R. Frankel, the Connecticut money manager suspected of
defrauding insurance companies of hundreds of millions of dollars
before fleeing overseas, has been captured and is now in Federal
custody, an official with the Federal Bureau of Investigation said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of his capture were unclear Saturday evening,
as FBI officials withheld details of his arrest. But the official
confirmed that Frankel had been arrested four months to the day
after fleeing his Greenwich, Conn., mansion for Italy, where he
relied on business associates, a cache of diamonds and a streak of
good luck to stay a step ahead of law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed likely that Frankel had been apprehended while on the
run. When reached early Saturday evening, Hugh F. Keefe, a lawyer
who represents Frankel, said he was unaware that his client had
been apprehended. When asked if Frankel might have turned himself
in as part of a negotiated deal, Keefe laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut lawyer added that he had spoken to a federal
prosecutor in the case as recently as Saturday morning. ``He asked
me if Frankel was still alive,'' Keefe said. ``I have a feeling he
knew more than he was letting on.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest appeared to mark a concluding chapter in what
authorities have described as one of America's largest and most
bizarre cases of insurance fraud.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Frankel, federal law enforcement officials and
prosecutors charged, lived a sybaritic life on the money he claimed
to be managing for a string of Southern insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   His operation grew to depend on scores of other people,
including prominent lawyers, insurance industry executives, private
detectives, a coterie of women, and priests with ties to the
Vatican, all of whom say that they were innocent dupes of a man
that they thought was a brilliant speculator in stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   If official accounts are accurate, Frankel, 44, also had
remarkable success in fooling state insurance regulators. His
strategy was to buy small, troubled insurance companies through
intermediaries, then manage the sometimes considerable investment
assets those companies held against future policy claims.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Frankel claimed to be earning returns that were well
above industry norms, but he was not exposed as a fraud until after
he fled the country, leaving behind smoldering documents in one of
his several houses in Greenwich, a wealthy enclave outside New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Toledo, Ohio, Frankel first ran afoul of financial
regulators in the early 1990s, when a small investment fund he ran
generated steep losses for retirees who entrusted their savings to
Frankel. After an investigation, the Securities and Exchange
Commission reached an out-of-court settlement with Frankel in early
1992. He agreed to a lifetime ban from the securities business.
</P>
<P>
   Even before that agreement was final, however, Frankel had begun
a new operation in Tennessee. Using the names of several friends
and acquaintances in Ohio, Frankel set up a Tennessee trust and
began buying insurance companies, first in Tennessee and later in
Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   He also moved his base of operations to Greenwich. He rented and
later bought a multimillion-dollar, four-acre estate on Lake
Avenue, surrounding the area with elaborate security. He later
rented other upscale homes in the area, using one as his office and
another to house some of the women he recruited through the
Internet and help-wanted ads as personal assistants and full-time
companions.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1998, Frankel began to fear that insurance regulators
would sooner or later catch on, he told friends and associates. It
was then that he apparently decided to rapidly expand his insurance
holdings in hopes of growing big enough and involving enough
well-known people that authorities would consider his business
unassailable.
</P>
<P>
   He hired many insurance consultants and retained several
prominent law firms, including Robert Strauss and his well-known
firm, Akin, Gump. Frankel persuaded a high-level retired priest at
the Vatican to back a charity that Frankel used as a holding
company for his insurance assets. Friends and associates said
Frankel also sought help from people with long criminal records,
all in a pell-mell effort to expand his holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Though he tried to buy new insurance companies in Colorado,
Washington, Nicaragua and Britain, his expansion program failed.
</P>
<P>
   By spring of this year, insurance regulators were asking pointed
questions about his investment strategy and about the structure of
his companies. Frankel, who liberally used aliases and disguised
his control of companies, was not suspected of a crime. But by late
April, he prepared to flee the country.
</P>
<P>
   Like his operation, his flight to safety abroad was highly
disorganized. A last-minute purchase of diamonds turned into a
fiasco when Frankel decided to leave early and security officers
fought over control of some diamonds that remained behind. He also
proved to be a novice at international intrigue, growing depressed
on the run and several times coming close to exposure after making
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   He spent time on the run with at least two women who had worked
for him, and flew a third to join him when those two grew bored and
homesick.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel spent most of his exile in Italy. But by July scattered
reports had him traveling in France and later Brazil.

GORDON COULD RETURN TO RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oakland and Boston each entered Saturday's action
with 27 games remaining. The Red Sox had just a one-game lead in
the wild-card race after losing 2-1 in Seattle on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland has eight games left against teams with .500 records and
the Red Sox have 15, including back-to-back series against the
league's winningest teams, New York and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston might get back closer Tom Gordon, who was feared lost
for the season with elbow problems. Gordon, who converted 46 of 47
save opportunities last season, was clocked at 89 mph during a
workout in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   His possible return comes at a time when the Red Sox are
uncertain about former Dodger Ramon Martinez, who struggled
Thursday in his first start since July 1998 elbow surgery. But they
also acquired Grant High product Rod Beck , who is coming back from
elbow problems that ruined his season with the Cubs. Beck arrived
in the fourth inning of Wednesday's game against Kansas City and
earned a save in the ninth. &QL; 
That was some trade: While the Angels are almost forced to re-sign
left-hander Chuck Finley for around $7 million a year, the
potential free-agent they let get away, Omar Olivares , has been
great in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares is 5-0 in seven starts since arriving in Oakland. He
had never won more than four in a row in his career. Randy Velarde,
another pending free agent acquired in the trade, already has had
hitting streaks of 13 and 10 games since joining the A's. More
importantly, the A's are 24-10 since the two players arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Who's in left?: When Orioles center fielder Brady Anderson moved
to left field Wednesday, it might have been a glimpse of the
future. The switch has been talked about much of the season, but
now that Baltimore is so far out of the race, the team would like
to see youngster Eugene Kingsdale. Right now it looks as though
Anderson will be back in center next season, but if Cal Ripken
retires after next year, B.J. Surhoff could wind up at third with
Anderson in left full-time.
</P>
<P>
   Up and coming:Some good might have come from Brian McRae 's bad
knee in Toronto. The Blue Jays have called up center fielder Vernon
Wells, a top prospect just two years out of high school. Wells
began the season at Single-A, but sailed through three levels in
five months, batting a combined .334 with 18 homers and 81 RBI. He
went 0 for 7 in his first two games, and an 0 for 5 on Friday night
dropped his average to .150. But Wells felt better when All-Star
Shawn Green came up and said he began his career 0 for 15.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers reload: The Texas Rangers, fearful of New York and
Cleveland's big left-handed bats in the playoffs, acquired
left-hander Jeff Fassero from Seattle at the Aug. 31 postseason
trade deadline. They weren't comfortable going with former Angel
Matt Perisho, a 15-game winner at Triple-A. They obviously worried
about using veteran John Burkett or veteran Mike Morgan, who has a
10.80 ERA in his past six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Runaway: Although it is no guarantee of postseason success, the
lead the Cleveland Indians have in the Central Division is very
impressive. Their 7-6 victory over Baltimore on Friday gave the
Indians a 22{-game lead, their biggest since 1995 when they set a
major-league record by finishing 30 games in front.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they have superior talent, the Indians have had nine
players on the DL this year, including regulars Travis Fryman,
Sandy Alomar, Wil Cordero and Kenny Lofton and one-time staff ace
Jaret Wright.
</P>
<P>
   For the stretch, Cleveland acquired Harold Baines from Baltimore
earlier in the week. Baines wants to return to the Orioles to close
out his career, but Baltimore was willing to give him a chance for
one more shot at a World Series.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Liberty guard Teresa Weatherspoon put a crimp in the
Comets' celebration plans Saturday with a desperation 3-point shot
launched from beyond half court with four-tenths of a second to
play. The shot banked off the glass and into the basket to give the
Liberty an improbable 68-67 victory and force a Game 3 in the
Women's National Basketball Association championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Before this afternoon's game, and even in the first half, it
looked like all the Houston Comets would have to do to pick up
their third straight WNBA championship was to goof around the court
for 40 minutes and then walk to center court of the Compaq Center
and reach out their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty put on a furious rally to overcome a 14-point
halftime deficit with a 19-3 second half run. Then it came down to
the final moments.
</P>
<P>
   Kym Hampton was fouled by Sheryl Swoopes while making a basket
and made the free throw, then hit a 15-footer to put the Liberty in
front by 63-62 with 1 minute 24 seconds left. Swoopes was fouled on
the next trip down the floor and made both free throws with 1:05 to
go to give Houston a 64-63 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the next possession, Cynthia Cooper, the league's leading
scorer who was just 1 for 10 Saturday, stole the ball from Vickie
Johnson. Tina Thompson was fouled with 28 seconds left and made one
of two free throws, leaving Houston up by 65-63.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Robinson tied the score at 65-65 with 16 seconds left,
and Thompson hit a jumper with 2.4 seconds remaining that nearly
brought the house down as Houston took a 67-65 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty was out of timeouts, and the ball was inbounded
quickly to Weatherspoon. Her improbable shot stunned the crowd of
16,285, who had already started throwing streamers and confetti.
But Weatherspoon's basket insured there will be the final game on
Sunday. And the way things unfolded Saturday, it is no longer a
lock for the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching the flight of the ball and the arc of the ball, I saw
that the ball had a chance to go in,'' said Robinson, who score a
game-high 21 points (18 in the second half). ``When it hit the
square on the glass, I thought it was going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the shot went in, fans were silent as
Weatherspoon, who finished with 8 points and 5 assists, was mobbed
by her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt pretty good when it left my hands,'' Weatherspoon
said. ``I was just praying that it went in and that we'd have a
chance for Game 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said: ``My thought when the ball was in the air was I
called it a basket. I've never seen a shot like that. I've never
experienced anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weatherspoon said she had just one thought when she took the
inbound pass. ``I wasn't going to look for anyone,'' Weatherspoon
said. ``I was going to live or die with that shot. I didn't want
any of my teammates to have to live with missing that shot during
the off season. If it didn't go in, I wanted to be the one to have
to live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough the desperation shot is something that a few of the
Liberty players work on at the conclusion of each practice.
Weatherspoon said that guard Becky Hammon normally won the shooting
contests.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the way that the Liberty started and the way the
game ended, it was truly miraculous that it is alive for Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty was horrendous from the field in the first half,
shooting 1 of 11 in the first 10 minutes. The Liberty was quickly
trailing by 17-2 against a team that was on fire in a building that
was filled with raucous fans. The Liberty's first basket came at
15:11 on a 16-foot jumper by Johnson. The Liberty didn't get its
second field goal until Sophia Witherspoon hit a driving layup with
9:17 to play. In the interim the Comets, and their fans, began
their stroll toward their third straight coronation as WNBA
champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were stifling us in the first half,'' said Liberty Coach
Richie Adubato. ``We were on that 2 points for a long time. I
haven't seen anybody play defense like that ever. I'm glad there
aren't any shutouts in games like these.''
</P>
<P>
   As they had done on Thursday night in Game 1, the Comets were
able to force the Liberty out of their game. This time they did it
with a suffocating full court press.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty came out with more life in the second half, holding
the Comets scoreless for the first 2 minutes and cutting into that
14-point halftime lead with three field goals from Robinson and a
3-pointer from Weatherspoon that made the score 37-29. Robinson
continued to have the hot hand and her teammates kept finding her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't buy a basket in the first half,'' said Robinson,
who was 1 of 6 from the field in the first half. ``I was getting
shots, but they weren't falling. Coach told me to just keep
shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing she listened. The Liberty continued their rally and
took its first lead of the game, 42-40, on a 3-pointer by Robinson
with 11:55 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cooper, who had blistered the Liberty for 29 points
on Thursday night, went into a second-half drought. She finished
with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't let me get into a rhythm,'' Cooper said. The
good news is we do have a second chance. We do have a chance to
play a 40-minute game and match the intensity that we showed on
Thursday night and the intensity that the Liberty showed in the
second half today.''

OUT OF THE SHADOWS, CAPRIATI SEIZES SPOTLIGHT IN THE OPEN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She has called her reincarnation close to complete.
No longer the distraught teen-ager who turned to darker recreations
when the scrutiny that came with tennis fame began to chafe like a
pair of golden handcuffs, Jennifer Capriati ignored the leaden air
Saturday and jumped for joy following her successful debut in the
Arthur Ashe Stadium at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of self-destruction that segued into three
more of self-help, Capriati, instantly lauded as a big-stadium
player when she made her pro debut at the age of 13, was back in
business in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   As her last passing shot streaked by 11th-seeded Nathalie
Tauziat to seal her 6-3, 1-6, 6-1 upset, Capriati took her cue from
the whimsical lilac and yellow butterfly clips restraining her
hair: she practically levitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excited,'' Capriati said in explaining her post-match
euphoria. ``I'm working hard, being focused, doing all the right
things. Just keep doing it, keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time is a good time to win a Grand Slam. It doesn't matter
whether you're the youngest or the oldest or whatever,'' said
Capriati, who at 23 has studied Andre Agassi's transformation from
141st-ranked has-been to 1999 French Open champion like a
blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday the second-seeded Agassi, with Pete Sampras' No. 1
ranking all his if he wins this title, advanced with a 6-1, 4-6,
6-3, 6-4 throttling of Justin Gimelstob of New Jersey. Agassi left
the histrionics, along with an on-court change of shorts, to
Gimelstob, who injured his left wrist with a rotisserie-style
spinning swan dive in the fifth game of the final set but stuck
around for a regulation finish. Gimelstob even performed curtain
calls for his local fans once Agassi was done blowing air kisses in
the general direction of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I needed to do,'' said Agassi, still not convinced
he has a lock on a berth in the final. ``If we could phone in the
results of the highest seed left _ but you can't, you've got to go
out there and play. And win.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, seeded seventh and trying hard to fulfill her
father Richard's prognostications about an all-Williams final,
repaired the damage she did herself with 27 unforced errors in the
opening set by scrambling into a 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 comeback against
16-year-old Kim Clijsters of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Though an Open neophyte, the 98th-ranked Clijsters was not
intimidated by Williams, and it showed. In the final set, their
match was choreographed like a ``West Side Story'' rumble: Williams
mimicked a machete with her racquet after breaking Clijsters'
serve, who slipped, fell and did the splits on the baseline, to
trail by 3-4. Then Clijsters performed a Connorsesque pump-and-roar
maneuver after breaking back with an overhead for a 5-3 lead and a
chance to serve for the upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It relates a lot to my mental toughness,'' said the
17-year-old Williams, who responded to the overhead with a 14-point
rampage to win the match. ``That's when my determination really
kicked in.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Capriati, who validated her phenom label by capturing
a gold medal at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain, the
Open's defending champion, Lindsay Davenport, a gold medal Olympian
in Atlanta in 1996, reached the Round of 16 with a 6-1, 6-1
demolition of Amy Frazier. Davenport's next opponent, ninth-seeded
Julie Halard-Decugis of France, beat her three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Davenport, still disinclined to do any
celebrating at this Open until she replicates last year's
breakthrough title, Capriati reacted to her third-round success
with uninhibited glee. She has already met her imperative of
improving on three straight first-round losses in the 1996-98 Open.
</P>
<P>
   First Capriati whacked a ball into the stands and accepted a
well-rehearsed ``Well done,'' from Tauziat, a player Capriati has
beaten in all four meetings. Then she waved and blew kisses to her
cheering fans. She was once fearful that her off-court exploits,
including a court-ordered stint in drug rehabilitation that
convinced her she had more in common with tennis phenoms than
substance abusers, would ostracize her supporters. But Capriati
realized in the past year that it was time to return the public
embrace she has received throughout her comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really scared me,'' Capriati said about the years when she
doubted her ability to re-create herself as a contender. ``I just
thought, `God, what if this is it?' Then I just thought: `How
ridiculous. I mean, why not? You have the power in you. Just to do
it if you want.'''
</P>
<P>
   And there was no better place to solidify her comeback than this
Open. It was in this tournament that she quit tennis after an
opening-round loss in 1993 but in which, as a 15-year-old
semifinalist in 1991, she played and lost the finest match of her
career, a 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(7-3) slugfest against Monica Seles, her
potential fourth-round opponent. For years that defeat gave
Capriati nightmares, but lately it became a reminder of a place she
would like to revisit.
</P>
<P>
   After falling in and out of comebacks, Capriati earlier this
year _ on the verge of turning 23, which is middle age in her
profession _ decided to take her job and herself seriously. She
hired Harold Solomon, a practice courts drill sergeant, to whittle
down her physique and add some strategy to her backcourt repertory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick of losing, sick of not reaching my full potential
that I think I can reach still,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With Solomon in her corner, and with Tauziat as her quarterfinal
punching bag, Capriati slogged through the draw of her French Open
tune-up at Strasbourg and won her first title in six years. Her
fourth-round exit at Roland Garros was her best progress in a Grand
Slam tournament since her quarterfinal finish at Wimbledon in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Now ranked 40th, Capriati is far from complacent about her place
in the pecking order. After finishing 1991 ranked a career-best
sixth in the world, Capriati, no longer the ``goofy'' teen-ager who
wilted when asked to inherit Chris Evert's mantle as the darling of
American tennis, wants to make her mark on her profession as an
adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very gifted and she kind of forgot that,'' said Solomon,
who used tapes of the Barcelona Olympics to remind Capriati of her
gifts. ``This whole thing has been self-inspired. She finally said,
`I have to do this.' She took a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in a match she said she probably would have squandered
a year ago and in which her attention took a second-set hiatus,
Capriati retrieved her concentration and treated the net-charging
Tauziat like a convenient target in the third set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more determined just to fight back, not give up, and
regroup, just get it back,'' Capriati said. ``Maybe before I didn't
have the confidence to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with her opponent eliminated, her fans rewarded, and the
news media admonished that she would like to stop rehashing her
imperfect past, Capriati made her exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so hungry I can't think,'' she said, and headed to the
lunchroom to correct that, too.

NEWS ANALYSIS: IN MIDEAST, WARINESS MIXED WITH NEW HOPE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Palestinians have been far more riveted by the
recent Arab Games, in which their ragtag soccer team captured the
bronze medal, than by the latest peace talks that yielded yet
another agreement with Israel, signed Saturday night in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Experience has dashed their hopes one too many times. After the
festive signing ceremonies, many feel, the interim peace agreements
become contracts to be violated. It is hard for Palestinians not to
note that the late-night signing ceremony celebrated a memorandum
that reaffirms an agreement feted last year at the White House _
and suspended less than two months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your heart gets broken so often, you don't let yourself
keep falling in love,'' said Walid Khalil, who was shopping for
running shoes Saturday in the Old City. ``Why should this time be
different?''
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that circumstances make this time different,
riper with promise. And the new agreement itself, which contains a
detailed and negotiated time line, should make compliance easier
and more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement as it was would have led us to a clear
deadlock,'' a senior Israeli official said. ``There was no real
pathway for how to proceed. It would have led to a violent
freeze.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian and Israeli officials agree that the new
understanding helps their leaders accomplish their goals. Ehud
Barak, the new prime minister of Israel, and Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, are both bearing down on personal deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is a man with a mission and a stopwatch: He wants to
sketch the broad outlines of a regional peace within 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   And Arafat, 70 and still wearing his revolutionary fatigues,
wants to deliver to his people a Palestinian state by next
September at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Like Barak, Arafat has fixed a keen eye on the American
political calendar, which leaves President Clinton barely a year to
shepherd a permanent peace agreement. And he is anxious that his
quest not be sidelined by Israel's pursuit of peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is believed to think that a deal with Syria, once a
relationship is revived, could be easier and neater than
negotiating the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and the
refugees with the Palestinians. But the relationship will take a
while to revive; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright did not
leave Syria Saturday afternoon with any invitations for Israeli
diplomats to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an outbreak of terrorism, then, Barak could be expected
to plow through his obligations under the new agreement. He may not
be a polished diplomat _ witness the ultimatums he issued to the
Palestinians last week _ but he is known for being a rock-solid man
of his word.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would take him eight weeks from the time he took
office to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, and it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the most important thing is the implementation,
and it will happen immediately,'' said Yossi Beilin, the minister
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of thinking or believing but doing,'' he
said. ``We came into power to make this happen, not to bypass
decisions and find excuses not to do things.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly negotiated agreement allows little wiggle room,
providing a very full agenda for the next month. In about 10 days,
Israel will turn 7 percent of the West Bank over to Palestinian
civil control, keeping its army there. It will also release the
first group of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, Israel will open a southern safe-passage route
between Gaza and the West Bank, connecting the Palestinian
territories in a very important development to Palestinian
businessmen, students and families who are separated. Also on Oct.
1, construction will begin on a commercial seaport in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is maintaining a relatively quiet, behind-the-scenes
profile, in vivid contrast to his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu,
who dominated the television screens and provided a regular
commentary on his own accomplishments and the shortcomings of
others.
</P>
<P>
   During the negotiations, for instance, Barak signed a series of
measures to ease the entry of Palestinians into Israel. It went
unpublicized. Palestinian officials knew, and some took it as a
good-will gesture, easing what to them have been Israel's noxious
border restrictions. But Barak, by not demanding credit, did not
antagonize the Palestinians or stir up the Israeli right wing.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement only slightly modifies the text of the Wye
memorandum, negotiated last fall in Wye River, Md., by the previous
Israeli Government. But both Israelis and Palestinians feel that it
offers them a more concrete plan _ with dates, numbers and
intentions spelled out. Both sides, using the same phrase,
described it as a ``win win'' approach compared with the ``zero sum
game'' approach under Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement compels the Israelis to withdraw from 11
percent more territory in the West Bank, in three stages, and to
release 350 security prisoners, among other things. The Israelis
somewhat softened their criteria for which prisoners could be
released, adding some Palestinians who had committed violent acts
against Israel that did not result in death.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians agreed to submit a detailed list of their
security officers by Sept. 13 and to abide by a plan, to be
thrashed out by a committee, to collect illegal weapons. They also
acquiesced to a protracted transfer of land, over six months.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, Palestinian mothers of prisoners protested the
agreement Saturday. And Saturday night, the umbrella group of
Jewish settlers, the Yesha Council, issued a statement condemning
the deal. The settlers accused Barak of caving in to ``Arab
demands'' by deciding ``to withdraw from more parts of the homeland
and to release terrorists with blood on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said Saturday night that Barak got what he
wanted most from Arafat _ a Palestinian commitment to plunge
immediately into ``final status'' negotiations and to make the
talks concurrent with a protracted transfer of land.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli negotiators persuaded the Palestinians to divide the
final-status talks into two six-month stages. The first half, in
which a broad-brush framework agreement would be established, is
supposed to conclude on Feb. 15. That is also the date for the
third and, from the Israeli perspective, most sensitive transfer of
land.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials said Saturday night that Barak had
abandoned a key goal: to make that third transfer of land
contingent on progress in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli officials replied that had Barak never intended to
use the land as a bargaining chip; they said he told Clinton that
there would be a third withdrawal even if talks failed.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians agreed, ambitiously, to conclude final
talks in about a year _ that is, to have a permanent peace plan
readied by September of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fail to reach a final agreement, then we have the full
right to declare a state after that,'' Saeb Erekat, the senior
Palestinian negotiator, told Reuters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the agreement was concluded, Israel was officially
shut down for the Sabbath. There has been little public discussion
Saturday. But Shira Weiss, 29, who was walking her dog in downtown
Jerusalem, said she was inclined to be hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be an idiot and believe too much,'' she
said. ``But we've waited a long time for a step in the right
direction. Wouldn't it be great if we could move toward peace and
the buses didn't start blowing up again?''
</P>
<P>
   An American-born religious man, who gave his name only as
``Shmuel on my way to shul _ that's synagogue,'' interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want something, you have to pray for it,'' he said, and
added, referring to the Sabbath, ``You have to respect Shabbes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a reminder that, be it soccer matches or the Lord, many
Israelis and Palestinians have other things on their mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is our obsession,'' said Moti Shneyer, a student, who
also joined in. ``But peace is a real bore.''

ATTEBERRY LEFT KICKING HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they filed numbly into the visitors' _ and losers' _ locker
room at Alumni Stadium Saturday, Baylor coach Kevin Steele put his
arm around Kyle Atteberry. The Bears kicker figured he was a prime
candidate for strangulation at that point, and he wasn't about to
launch a self-defense. His shanked extra point in overtime had just
saddled Steele with a 30-29 loss to Boston College in his Baylor
debut, and Atteberry was intent on hogging the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a routine kick, to be honest with you,'' he recalled
mournfully. ``I should get axed for something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   So he was surprised to discover that instead of vengeance,
Steele was offering a valentine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you,'' he told Atteberry.
</P>
<P>
   A deeply religious sort, Atteberry was relieved to discover that
his coach could forgive the sinner while condemning the sin. Even
more heartening, his teammates turned his misfortune into a revival
meeting of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them came up to encourage me,'' he said. ``We're a
close-knit team.''
</P>
<P>
   They're a losing team, too, as their 2-9 records the past two
seasons prolaim. And they missed a golden opportunity for
redemption largely because Atteberry experienced a kicker's day
from hell _ a blocked extra point in the second quarter after
Baylor seemingly had seized the momentum, a blocked punt in the
third quarter that set up BC's tying touchdown, and the overtime
horror show when he barely got the would-be tying kick off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ours,'' said a conciliatory Steele. ``And he's one of the
best and we'll take him any time.''
</P>
<P>
   BC took advantage of him this time. After McKinley Bowie's
83-yard interception return for a touchdown late in the second
quarter, Atteberry stepped to the 10-yard line, poised to build the
Baylor lead to 17-7. Not so fast. The Bears were penalized for
excessive celebrating because a player ran onto the field after the
TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had so little to celebrate that I'll take that one,''
said Steele. ``I won't take the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that Atteberry now had to take his extra-point
kick from field goal distance _ 35 yards away. And Eagles defensive
tackle Chris Hovan broke through the Baylor wall to knock it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good snap and a good hold,'' said Atteberry. ``I hit
it good. He must have gotten it just as it was leaving the turf.''
</P>
<P>
   BC got him again with Baylor nursing a 16-10 lead midway through
the third quarter. Punting from his 11, Atteberry watched onrushing
Eagles defensive back Ralph Parent swat the ball sky high, and it
wound up on the Bears' 4, where another BC defensive back, Doug
Bessette, recovered. That set up Cedric Washington's tying TD burst
on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to come through clean and you know it,''
Atteberry said, ``you take just one step and kick it. I stayed with
my normal routine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steele didn't hold him culpable for those botches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have a kick blocked,'' said the coach, ``there's
obviously a breakdown in coverage. We got soft in protection.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no doubting the culprit on the climactic calamity.
Perhaps Atteberry wasn't familiar with the assignment _ kicking a
routine extra point _ because after another penalty following
Baylor's go-ahead TD, he'd been forced to attempt the conversion
from an extra 5 yards back, which he did successfully. Perhaps he
was unfamiliar with the holder _ Ryan Chapdelaine, who was pressed
into service because the regular in that role, quarterback Jermaine
Alfred, had been ``dinged,'' according to Steele, while sneaking in
for the TD.
</P>
<P>
   But no, Atteberry wasn't going to invoke any alibis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practice with both holders,'' he said. ``And the snap was
perfect. The hold was perfect. I just mis-hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sideline, Steele couldn't believe his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, you miss wide right or wide left,'' he said. ``This
one looked like it had no intention of going through.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Atteberry had no intention of ducking the flak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome the pressure,'' he said. ``It's a neat situation. A
lot of guys would crawl into a corner and never come back.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Atteberry intend to do?
</P>
<P>
   He looked his questioner square in the eye and said, ``I'll be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   And his coach gladly will let him.

PLAYERS GETTING WHAT THEY BARGAINED FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Training camps opened throughout the National Hockey League this
weekend and there were plenty of name players _ unsigned free
agents and one disgruntled and misguided soul in Ottawa who does
have a contract _ not in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long list _ including Boston's No. 1 goalie Byron Dafoe,
defenseman Hal Gill, and left wing P.J. Axelsson _ and suffice to
say, it's bound to become an annual event, so get used to it. You
want to argue wrong or right? It isn't as difficult a situation to
assess as you might think.
</P>
<P>
   One factor often distorted is that both the Players Association
and the league signed the collective bargaining agreement. It's not
a one-sided document. There was no coercion, no collusion, no
sleight of hand, no fraud. Both sides read it and agreed to sign.
So why now are teams being vilified by players and agents for
utilizing a tool the players agreed they could have?
</P>
<P>
   It's mind-boggling, but predictable. In the midst of
skyrocketing player salaries, teams are finally realizing they have
a tool, one they've had all along but have been ignoring. After a
couple of years of lulling players into a false sense of security
(``Hey, he's a good kid, let's give him the money''), clubs now are
making the most of their power under the collective bargaining
agreement, and it's driving players and their agents crazy. Which
is somewhat understandable. Players have had the upper hand for
several years. A half-dozen years ago, Islanders general manager
Mike Milbury, then the assistant GM in Boston, was saying there was
no one to feel sorry for anymore because there was so much money.
It wasn't all that long ago _ OK, it's been a while _ that players
had to get summer jobs to help make ends meet. It certainly wasn't
that long ago when players regarded $500,000 as a lot of money. Not
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Things are vastly out of whack, and owners faced with
increasingly higher operating costs and a smaller profit share are
saying they now expect to take advantage of the CBA. The exception
is the Rangers. Then again, it's nearly always the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   There was a report out of Calgary that indicated the weekly
conference call among general managers Aug. 27 was a rallying cry
to hang in there in the face of rising salary demands among Group 2
(restricted) free agents. Bruins president/general manager Harry
Sinden said that wasn't so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody tells us that,'' said Sinden. ``We have a conference
call every Friday, but the league never advises the clubs in the
relationship with players. They often tell us the numbers, we share
information, but we'd never do that. There's always a caution about
your budget, you all have budgets, there's always a caution about
exceeding it, but everyone is free to make up their own minds. Many
people go way over their budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if teams were now, finally, starting to use the CBA
as the tool for which it was intended, Sinden said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was negotiated with the players and they agreed with it,''
he said. ``They should use it for the reasons it was negotiated. If
you have certain rights and you failed to exercise them in the
past, you should use it now. You never, ever have one situation
with a player in which the team doesn't live up to the collective
bargaining agreement that you're not called on. You're called on it
right away. You couldn't get by with five cents. The teams have
been reluctant to take the same position with the players. I think
more and more, they're saying `This is a contract with the
players,' and we have every right to do what it says in there. I
think teams, having tried a lot of other things that didn't work,
are coming around to this.''
</P>
<P>
   It says here that Dafoe deserves a great raise for his stellar
work in goal for the Bruins. That's indisputable. But before
everyone piles on Bruins management for failing to sign him at the
start of training camp, keep in mind that the club is exercising
its rights under the CBA and that Dafoe had the option of
arbitration, which he decided to forgo in order to keep the holdout
option alive.
</P>
<P>
   Take sides if you must, but remember, both sides are right here.
And both sides are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In holding pattern
</P>
<P>
   Another player who has yet to reach contract terms is Edmonton
standout Mike Grier. Grier was a bargain last season at $400,000
Canadian. This season, he's reportedly asking for
$800,000-$900,000. That's certainly not ridiculous for the 20-goal
season he had but it is a big bump from a year ago . . . Patrik
Stefan, the No. 1 overall pick in the June draft, did come to terms
with the Atlanta Thrashers late in the week. The 18-year-old center
will be paid the rookie salary cap maximum of $1.025 million base
salary for three years. That was a given. The stumbling block is
the bonus structure. Neither the team nor the player's agent, Steve
Kotlowitz, revealed details of the bonuses but they are said to be
in line with those of Tampa Bay's Vincent Lecavalier, who can earn
$3 million a year or $8 million total in bonuses over the three
years. Atlanta GM Don Waddell made comments similar to Sinden's
after Joe Thornton agreed to terms two years ago, saying the
measure of Stefan will be in the long haul. ``We're not too
concerned with Patrik Stefan this year or next year,'' Waddell
said. ``We want to bring him along right. I'm more concerned with
where he is four or five years from now.'' . . . The Vancouver
Canucks re-signed forward Todd Bertuzzi to a two-year deal said to
be worth a little more than $1 million per season. Bertuzzi had a
nightmarish season last year, missing 31 games with a broken leg
and then tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee on
March 5, an injury that caused him to sit out the remaining 19
games. Bertuzzi, regarded as a huge disappointment early in his
career with the Islanders, has shown signs with the Canucks of
being the kind of force expected of him when he was taken 23d
overall in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Is all not forgiven?
</P>
<P>
   It has been a big mystery why former Coach of the Year Ted
Nolan, who won the Jack Adams Trophy in 1997 with the Sabres, has
been out of work so long. Robin Burns, cousin and agent of Bruins
coach Pat Burns and Nolan's former representative, offered some
interesting insight into the situation late last week. It was
widely believed that Nolan had been blackballed despite an offer
from the Lightning two years ago. Burns said that, during his two
years behind the Sabres bench, Nolan made many enemies in positions
of power. The other point Burns made was that after Nolan walked
away from a one-year $500,000 extension with Buffalo, he committed
a ``catastrophic error'' in turning down a $2.2 million, four-year
offer from Tampa Bay some four months later. ``I thought it was a
very fair offer and suggested he take it,'' Burns said. ``When he
said, `No,' I was floored.'' Nolan also turned down an assistant
coaching position with the Islanders and though he was interviewed
briefly by the Kings, he was not offered the head-coaching job that
eventually went to Andy Murray. There have been reports that
Rangers coach John Muckler, former Sabres general manager, is
behind some of the negative perception of Nolan. Nolan denies he
was trying to angle for Muckler's job. ``I never did anything
wrong, I don't think,'' said Nolan. Burns came to the conclusion
that Nolan perhaps miscalculated his worth. ``The problem is, if
you say no in the NHL too many times, they stop asking,'' Burns
said. ``I think a lot of people are wondering, `What does this guy
want?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Skate on the other foot
</P>
<P>
   As expected, former NHL superstar Mario Lemieux took over
ownership of the Pittsburgh Penguins after US Bankruptcy Court
Judge Bernard Markovitz approved the $85 million purchase Friday
morning. Lemieux gave up $7.5 million in deferred salary the
Penguins owed him in order to make the deal work. He had been owed
$32.5 million by the former owners and previously agreed to put $20
million into the team. It will be fascinating to see how Lemieux
deals with contracts. He forfeited more money to make this deal
work than some players will ever see in a lifetime . . . The Flyers
took a great many lumps last season for their underachieving
finish. Part of the reason for that disappointing playoff showing
is becoming more clear now. Left wing John LeClair, who suffered
from lower back problems late in the year, doesn't seem to have
received much relief. Now the club is saying LeClair could miss all
or most of training camp. That has to come as a huge disappointment
for Philadelphia's front office _ which weathered the frightening
saga of star Eric Lindros's collapsed lung last spring. If there's
any good news, LeClair's problem appears to be muscular rather than
disk-related . . . As expected, good guy Doug Risebrough has been
named Minnesota Wild executive vice president/general manager.
Risebrough won four Stanley Cups as a Canadien from 1976-79. He was
vice president of hockey operations with the Oilers for the past
three seasons . . . The Senators signed 35-year-old forward Kevin
Dineen to a one-year-plus-an-option contract worth $450,000 this
year and $550,000 next. Dineen won't be a replacement for
malcontent Alexei Yashin but he can certainly add character and
grit that was missing last year as Ottawa went up in flames during
the first round of the playoffs. ``He brings a lot of leadership to
our club,'' said coach Jacques Martin. ``He's an individual who's
been around. He brings some intensity and some fire to the game. He
can spark a team and he's well-respected.'' Reportedly, the
Senators remain interested in defenseman Steve Duchesne . . . There
appears to be little or no progress on the Yashin front. Yashin,
the Ottawa star who thinks he's a free agent but actually has a
full year remaining on his contract, is threatening to head to
Europe to play rather than honor the final year of his deal valued
at $3.6 million. Our suggestion? Go right back to Russia and pump
gas. Maybe that would trigger some perspective. Good riddance . . .
The Lightning have invited 13-year NHL defenseman Zarley Zalapski
to camp on a tryout basis. Last year, he was rehabbing a balky knee
and playing in Europe . . . Speaking of the Lightning, former
coach/GM Jacques Demers will return to Montreal to work as a TV and
radio analyst. Demers coached the Habs from 1992-96.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling their Oates
</P>
<P>
   Center Adam Oates, who was a prolific scorer during his tenure
in Boston, has been named captain of the Washington Capitals. It's
kind of ironic, isn't it? Oates was vocal to the point of stunning
during the Bruins' stop in Denver in February 1997, getting
stripped of his alternate captain's ``A'' after his outburst.
Oates's frustration at the state of the Bruins _ shared by many _
led to his being dealt to the Capitals on March 1, 1997. Now he's
the spokesman for the team, taking the place of retired forward
Dale Hunter, who didn't say boo his entire career. Hunter preferred
to let his playing do the talking. Oates, a very intelligent man,
isn't shy about offering opinions . . . The Maple Leafs say they'll
move No. 1 center Mats Sundin to left wing for much of the
preseason in an effort to take some of the workload off him and
utilize his substantial skills. It's an experiment worth trying
even if it lasts only a few games . . . This will mark Burns's
third year behind the Bruins' bench. Last year was fascinating.
This year promises to be much more so. Stay tuned . . . 26 days to
opening night. With all due respect to legendary goalie Gerry
Cheevers, here's hoping it's not him in the net when Boston kicks
things off.

PROGRESSIVE APPROACH COULD MOVE PATRIOTS OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have all heard of political football, but this is getting
ridiculous. When, exactly, did leading an NFL offense become akin
to leading a conservative think tank? Next thing you know, you'll
be reading quotes from offensive coordinators named Newt Gingrich
and Orrin Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have heard people complain about parity in the NFL.
Parity is not an issue. In fact, it's a myth when you're talking
about players. The problem is that many pro coaches and their
offensive coordinators think alike. It's as if they gather at the
same Cliche Trough and decide what they are going to say _ and run
_ on autumn afternoons. So they run on first and second downs, pass
on third, punt on fourth, and then explain it all by saying,
literally, ``It was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots decide to follow that conservative philosophy
this season, it is only because they want to. The scant offense
they showed during the exhibition season will still be good enough
to win eight games by itself. But the offense they have stored in
the pantry could easily increase that total to 10 or 11.
</P>
<P>
   Remember this about the NFL: It is a league designed for
quarterbacks. History shows that if you've got a quarterback who
can complete a high percentage of passes, you're going to win more
than you lose. And you might even win the Super Bowl. Out of the
top 10 single-season pass-percentage QBs in league history, nine
led teams with winning records. Three made it to the Super Bowl.
One _ Wade Wilson of the '92 Falcons _ directed a losing team.
</P>
<P>
   As I write this, I can hear someone yelping, ``Defense wins
championships.'' Is that you, Clarence Thomas? Show me a great
defense that has supposedly won a Super Bowl, and I'll counter with
Mercury Morris/Larry Csonka ('72 Dolphins), Terry Bradshaw/Lynn
Swann/Franco Harris ('78 Steelers), Walter Payton and his entire
offensive line ('85 Bears), Phil Simms and his line ('86 Giants),
Joe Montana/Jerry Rice ('89 49ers), and John Elway/Terrell Davis
('98 Broncos).
</P>
<P>
   Now, think of the Patriots. You have heard enough of what they
cannot do, but think of what they can do. If I were making a film
about two of my favorite offenses of all time _ the 1980 and '81
San Diego Chargers _ I would hire the Patriots to play the leading
roles. Drew Bledsoe would star as Hall of Famer Dan Fouts, who
threw for 4,802 yards in '81. Ben Coates would play Hall of Fame
tight end Kellen Winslow. Terry Glenn would be Wes Chandler, and
nine-year veteran Shawn Jefferson would have to play a younger
version of legendary receiver Charlie Joiner. There wasn't anyone
like Michael Bishop on the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings me back to the NFL, where the Wing formation has
evolved into right-wingers disguised as coordinators. Maybe Pete
Carroll and Ernie Zampese don't want to tip off the Jets by saying
it, but I am sure they have a role in their offense for the dynamic
Bishop. They have to. Bill Belichick may be a great defensive
coordinator, but imagine what he would tell the Jets in the
following scenario:
</P>
<P>
   It is third and 3. The Patriots are in a shotgun formation, with
Kevin Faulk to Bledsoe's left and Bishop to his right. Will there
be a snap to Bledsoe? Or will there be a direct snap to Bishop, who
has the option of throwing for a first down or running for one?
Maybe Bishop goes from the backfield to the slot. Maybe Faulk goes
in motion, leaving a dangerous Bledsoe-Bishop backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Stumped? Well, I'll tell you what Belichick might tell his
players. He would tell them that blitzing is not an option. He'd
also tell them to pray.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that teams have a hard enough time stopping
Bledsoe, Coates, and Glenn. Put Bishop on the field with all of
them, and you'd have chaos. This would be the natural thing to do
if you were simply picking the most talented players and putting
them in the game. That happens when you are playing sandlot
football. That happens in college, when players who were
linebackers in high school learn to be fullbacks or tight ends,
simply because they want to play. It rarely happens in the NFL. The
Patriots could make themselves indefensible in certain situations
if they did it with Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone can see the Patriots' offense is geared toward passing.
Why frustrate yourself trying to establish an average run game when
you could be passing better than any team in your division, if not
conference? If that sounds like a wild exaggeration, look at the
Patriots' top four receivers and compare them with the Jets', minus
the injured Wayne Chrebet: Glenn, Jefferson, Troy Brown, and Tony
Simmons vs. Keyshawn Johnson, Quinn Early, Dedric Ward, and Dwight
``Hands Of'' Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Asking this team of Patriots to win the Super Bowl is probably
not realistic. But there is no reason they can't win 10 games. No
team in the division is superior, and the only AFC team that should
frighten anyone is Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   What the Patriots should do is pass. They should utilize Bishop.
They should become the '80 Chargers (1-3-1 preseason, 11-5 regular
season). They should remember that this is football and that the
acronym of their league is NFL, not GOP.

MARTINEZ JOINS ELITE BOSTON CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's a pretty impressive group, this private club that
includes Cy Young, Babe Ruth, Smoky Joe Wood, Lefty Grove, Jim
Lonborg, Luis Tiant, Dennis Eckersley, and Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above had at least one 20-win season for the Boston
Red Sox, and Saturday at dangerous Safeco Field, Pedro Martinez
earned lodge membership with eight innings of two-hit, 15-strikeout
pitching in a 4-0 victory over the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez becomes the first 20-game winner in the majors this
season and Boston's first since Clemens turned the trick way back
in 1990. It's Pedro's first 20-win season, which means the Martinez
brothers join the Perrys and Niekros as brother combos with 20-win
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was jubilant when he greeted his teammates in the
clubhouse immediately after the game. He could be heard shouting,
``I did it, I did it.'' Later, when he met with the media, he put a
little perspective on the accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really a big deal, but it's the level every pitcher
dreams about,'' he said. ``To me, it's something I will always
remember. I pretty much had the hint that I could get there. After
a couple of years in Montreal, I realized I could get 20 wins. Up
there, I just never had the support, the experience, or the
breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no stopping the Pedro Train in 1999. He was 11-1
by June 4 and 15-3 when he earned the MVP award at the All-Star
Game. He missed three starts with shoulder woes, then got himself
in the blender when his manager benched him for tardiness. But
everything appears back on course, and Friday night at Yankee
Stadium, Pedro will take the mound with a record of 20-4 and an ERA
of 2.26. He has 257 strikeouts and only 34 walks.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that folks in the Dodger organization (Tommy Lasorda in
particular) gave up on him in 1993, fearing that he was too slight
(5 feet 11 inches, 170 pounds) to pitch more than five innings,
Pedro smiled and said, ``Not to mention any names, but they didn't
know anything about baseball. Pick up the newspaper tomorrow and
read that I got 20 wins, and I went more than five innings in all
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday he had to do it without K-cards, Dominican flags, or
Spanish-speaking reporters from the Globe _ and against a lineup
that includes Ken Griffey, Alex Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez, and Jay
Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro was at the ballpark well ahead of Jimy Williams's
deadline. He spent a few moments watching the Boston College
football game on the clubhouse television and said he had visited
with some of the BC players last week. Down the hallway, in the
home locker room, Buhner walked past the lineup card and screeched,
``Oh my god, I am in there!''
</P>
<P>
   Prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the game, Buhner was 0 for 5, all strikeouts, against
Martinez. The streak now stands at 0 for 8, all whiffs. Buhner was
one of four Mariners who fanned in the first two innings, then he
struck out on a 95-mile-per-hour fastball to end the fourth, and
was caught looking in the seventh. Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle starter Paul Abbott was perfect through four but the Sox
broke it open with three runs in the fifth and Pedro knew what to
do to nail down the Magic No. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough,'' said Seattle manager Lou Piniella. ``He gets
ahead of you and stays ahead of you. He gets every pitch over the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez seemed possessed. We know he pitches better when he's
angry or inspired, and maybe he got a shot of adrenaline from the
news that brother Ramon had been scratched from the rotation after
one brief outing.
</P>
<P>
   He punched out the side in the seventh, ending the inning with a
95-m.p.h. heater to an overmatched Tom Lampkin. It was 1-2-3 again
in the eighth. His final victim (pitch No. 128) was poor Brian
Hunter, who spent the entire day at the plate looking like a kid
facing a polio vaccine shot, desperately trying not to strike out.
Martinez retired the final 11 batters he faced before yielding to
David Crosby, er, Rod Beck, who struggled through the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Did Martinez want to come out for the ninth?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that,'' he said. ``I don't know pitch limits. I just
have a game to win. I know they are concerned about me down the
stretch, but I felt getting the win was more important than to go
over any limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more positive about our team than ever. We're playing
solid baseball. The playoffs are not here yet, but if we're in the
playoffs, I'll go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he is a Red Sox 20-game winner, just like Young
(21-15) in 1907, Ruth (23-12) in 1916, and Bill Monbouquette
(20-10) in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen, who first accomplished the feat for Kansas City
in 1985 when he was 21 years old, said, ``It's always sweet,
especially the first one.''

AGASSI LOOMS LARGE ABOVE THE REST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The metallic cloud with a motor hovered somewhere
above Arthur Ashe Stadium. The sun may or may not shine on the US
Open, but that cloud is omnipresent. It is called the Fuji blimp _
a floating camera position for a bird's-eye TV shot _ and it was
getting on Justin Gimelstob's nerves.
</P>
<P>
   With a blobby airship in his line of vision as he tossed the
ball up to serve, and the gleaming scalp of scalp-hunting Andre
Agassi on the other side of the net, 22-year-old Gimelstob had a
couple of serious reasons to be frazzled. He may have felt like
Mick Jagger warbling, ``Hey, you, get offa my cloud!'' But of
course he couldn't ``get no satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin tried anyway. A lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get that blimp outa here!'' he demanded of umpire Steve
Ullrich. Ullrich has heard a lot of complaints from distraught
performers, but the request to reroute a blimp from Flushing Meadow
was a first. Since he had no pull with an aerial tow truck, or the
TV networks employing the blimp, Ullrich merely nodded
sympathetically and indicated that Gimelstob, an All-America from
UCLA, should get on with it.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't too easy because Agassi, the heir apparent to
1997-98 champion Patrick Rafter, is no zinc zeppelin. This is a
year in which he is ballooning large on the scene, reaching for his
second major and the No. 1 ranking that injured Pete Sampras will
lose after six years as the caretaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are maybe two people in New York who can order a blimp
to move and have it happen,'' Agassi was smiling Saturday after his
6-1, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory had elevated him to the fourth round.
``And Justin isn't one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during the third set that Gimelstob issued his stressed
plea for the umpire to roust, or at least ticket, the dawdling
blimp, parked overtime. He was still in the match then, but needed
all the help he could get. Agassi was behaving like the German
dirigibles that bombed London in World War I. After a second-set
lull, he started exploding again and no longer looked so small
opposite the huge-serving, 6-foot-5-inch Gimelstob.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Sampras called in sick with an aching back and Rafter
begged off with a cranky shoulder, this US Open has been Agassi's
to lose. They were going to play it out through Sept. 12 because
that's customary, but how could anybody doubt that Agassi would be
in the winner's circle accepting the trophy from US Tennis
Association president Julia Levering?
</P>
<P>
   Because he looked so good in pulverizing Swedish Davis Cupper
Nicklas Kulti in the first round (6-0, 6-1, 6-3), it was suggested
by some that Levering hand Agassi the prize then, asking only that
he go through the formalities of playing the remaining six matches.
</P>
<P>
   The Open was falling apart around him, the Meadow beginning to
resemble an emergency room. Six of the 1998 quarterfinalists were
gone. Semifinalist Carlos Moya, perhaps catching back pain from
Sampras, said, ``Adios.'' Finalist Mark Philippoussis's gimpy knee
cried, ``Uncle.'' Tom Johansson came down with a heart ailment, and
Karol Kucera was wounded here and there. Of the last eight of '98,
only Magnus Larsson and Jonas Bjorkman ventured past this year's
first round, and Bjorkman got the hook Saturday, courtesy of
Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
</P>
<P>
   After he won, Kafelnikov said that only three possible winners
remain: himself, Richard Krajicek, and, of course, Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi hates to hear that kind of talk. Anybody who concedes him
``or anybody else this championship doesn't know anything about
tennis _ or sports,'' he said. ``You can't mail it in. I feel I'm
getting better with every match, but there are people here who can
beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those is No. 46 Vince Spadea. Agassi is keenly and
painfully aware of what happened at the Australian Open, which also
appeared wired for him. Until the fourth round, where Spadea
intervened. He had labeled Spadea ``just a journeyman'' _ and Vince
sent him on an abrupt journey home. Agassi won't make that mistake
again. Spadea, a peppery Floridian, is still around but only after
surviving a tense five-set duel with Italian Laurence Tieleman with
a backhand passer on the last point of the decisive tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Another who can challenge Agassi is his next foe, the zippy
little Frenchman, No. 52 Arnaud Clement, a semifinalist at the US
Pro eight days ago at Longwood. ``I remember Clement, all right,''
said Agassi, rolling his eyes at the memory. Clement came within
two points of beating him in a second-round match in Paris, early
sabotaging that glorious ascent to the French Open title.
</P>
<P>
   Curioser and curioser this Open becomes, at least in the male
precinct, where the lineup _ other than the three guys owning major
titles, Agassi, Kafelnikov, Krajicek _ seems as recognizable as a
roll call at a Foreign Legion camp. Who are these people?
</P>
<P>
   ``All professionals, all dangerous guys,'' insisted Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   He has to keep himself in that frame of mind. But it's Andre's
to lose, and the only way he will is if the blimp falls on him.

TO CLUB PROS, CUP RICHNESS ISN'T MONETARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just about every 30 years or so, it seems those who play golf
for a living become restless. The PGA of America was once the sole
governing body of men's golf, but the guys who played for pay grew
restless under it. The result was a breakup in 1968 into two
organizations. The PGA of America, with nearly 25,000 members and
apprentices, represents the grassroots of the game. What became the
PGA Tour represents those who now play for big money.
</P>
<P>
   During the breakup, the pros were waiting for Arnold Palmer's
move. His father, Deacon, was a club pro and had taught him the
game, so what would Arnie do? After piloting his plane into
Worcester Airport on the eve of the Kemper Open that summer, Palmer
said he was siding with the play-for-pay guys. The split was now
the split.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to 1999, when the PGA Tour guys want to share the
Ryder Cup wealth, either through their bank books or designated
charities.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to note that David Duval is one of those who
has proposed that players get access to a sizable chunk of the
receipts that the PGA of America reaps and largely pours back into
the development of the game. Wasn't his father, Bob, a PGA of
America pro until he struck it big this year on the PGA Senior
Tour? Davis Love is also the son of a PGA of America pro, and he
has stood by the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The New England PGA, an organization of 711 members, recently
completed its sectional championship at Winchester CC and Kernwood
CC. These were the guys (and one woman) who have largely been
confined to their pro shops or the lesson tee, with little chance
to play. The New England Open is later this month (Sept. 15-17) at
The Woodlands and Portland CC in Maine; 167 pros and 10 amateurs
are already in the field. It is the second phase of their fall
festival, a fun time and a reunion for most.
</P>
<P>
   So these players could sit around and survey the
share-the-wealth approach to an event that drew only a few of the
curious when the Europeans joined the fray in 1979 at the
Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. ``There were no
spectators,'' said a reporter friend who covered that Ryder Cup for
the Richmond Times Dispatch. ``You could just walk in.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have certainly changed. There were 30,000 tickets sold for
the 33d Ryder Cup (Sept. 24-26) at The Country Club. The income
generated is expected to be $63 million, with the PGA of America
realizing a profit of about $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The club pros look at the situation with some bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing for your country is worth more than anything, and just
to be selected has no dollar value,'' said Paul Parajeckas of
Woburn, who has twice won the Wogan Award as the NEPGA's top
player. ``I'm from the old school. With everyone going on in life,
things have to change, but our association supports the Ryder Cup.
I think once that flag goes up, it doesn't matter what you're paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where does all the money go? No. 1 is PGA charities. To me it
doesn't matter, as long as you're always helping someone out. If
someone is getting better because of the money the PGA of America
is giving out, if you help one individual for life or to further a
life, that means a lot. I always feel the Ryder Cup should be for
charity, and I feel as a player it should be an honor to be on the
team and money should not be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just like to see the caddies be treated the same as
the players. They're part of the team. They should get expenses.
It's the greatest thing to ever hit New England, and the flag is
more important than anything else when it comes to competition
between countries. They should recognize what the PGA of America
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Carr of Bedrock GC, who played on the PGA Tour and continues
to play in European Senior Tour events, said, ``I feel, in this
case, the players are wrong. I've heard these guys wanted the money
for themselves when they first started. They never have to go in
their pocket. They get wined and dined. They get their families
brought in. I just think the guys are out of line asking to get
paid. The PGA used to foot the bill and nobody was making any
money. Greed's an awful thing, but what are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Senior circuit beckons
</P>
<P>
   Mike San Filippo's magical 9-iron second shot to within 3 feet
on the 18th hole earned him his second NEPGA Championship Thursday,
nine years after he won at Ocean Edge. ``I think I'm a better
player now than I was then,'' said San Filippo, 46, who has been a
teaching pro at Nashawtuc CC the past two summers before heading to
Florida, where he has been a dominant player on the PGA club pro
circuit. Is the PGA Senior Tour in his future? ``I don't know,''
said San Filippo. ``It depends on what I'm doing. I'm not going to
quit practicing. I still have three years. That's a long time, and
I'm in no hurry. It's nice that it's out there, but it depends on
how I feel and what I'm doing in a few years.'' The success of
players such as Dana Quigley of Barrington, R.I., and Allen Doyle
of Norwood makes it more tempting. ``We all know how they've been
doing,'' said San Filippo, ``and I have a feeling I'll give it a
go. It depends on a lot of things. It depends on health and my job
situation, but I think if there was an opportunity to go out there,
I'd give it a shot. There've been nine guys who've won for the
first time, so it goes to show you there's a lot of opportunity out
there.'' . . . In 2005, the Ryder Cup will be held in Ireland for
the first time. The announcement was made prior to the matches at
Valderrama two years ago to give Ireland the chance to promote the
event with the official use of the Ryder Cup identity and logo.
There was talk that the matches should set down at one of the
nation's great links courses stretched out from Portmarnock on the
Irish Sea to Ballybunion at the Mouth of the River Shannon. But it
was no great surprise when the man with the money bought them for
the K Club, a parksland course some 17 miles southwest of Dublin
owned and nurtured by Dr. Michael Smurfit, chairman of the Smurfit
Group conglomerate, who brought in Palmer and architectural partner
Ed Seay to create a suitable course for a luxury resort. The K Club
isn't linksland golf, since vast amounts of soil were moved and
lakes were created on the final four holes. It's sufficient for the
Irish to know that, finally, the matches are coming to the republic
. . . The first Cape Cod Senior Open will be contested Sept. 20-21
(Monday and Tuesday of Ryder Cup week) at Cape Cod CC and Hyannis
GC. This is an outgrowth of a suggestion by the venerable Fordie
Pitts, who co-owns Hyannis GC with Joe Keller and has been one of
New England's outstanding amateurs through the past five decades.
``It was his idea,'' said Jim Gaquin, who oversaw the growth of the
Cape Cod Pro-Am league with wife Lois and is helping with plans to
celebrate the league's 50th anniversary next year. The Cape Cod
Senior Open will offer $15,000 in prize money and is open to pros
and amateurs in three age groupings (50-59, 60-69, and 70-plus).
``I think we've got a winner,'' said Gaquin. ``I'd say the
tournament will draw between 100 and 125 players.'' Who knows?
Should the word get around, some Ryder Cup visitors might check in
early for a competitive introduction to New England golf, at a time
when getting access to a local course will be all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Pops to benefit Dad
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy opening day at the Ryder Cup, one way to unwind
Sept. 24 will be at a Boston Pops Ryder Cup concert, a musical
tribute to the game that will salute Palmer's contributions.
Proceeds will benefit the Deacon Palmer Scholarship, a permanently
endowed award distributed by the Francis Ouimet Scholarship Fund.
Tickets for the gala, with John Williams conducting, range from
$250 to $750 . . . The exclusive Carnegie Abbey course on
Narragansett Bay is under construction. The land of rolling hills
was the home of the Narragansett and Wampanoag tribes and site of
the Battle of Rhode Island in 1778 in the American Revolution. The
founder of the parent Carnegie Club, Peter de Savary, has developed
projects at Skibo Castle, Scotland, on the estate of Andrew
Carnegie, Stapleford Park, Leicestershire, England, and Cherokee
Plantation near Charleston, S.C. The course is due for completion
this fall and should be open for play next summer in exclusive and
very private surroundings . . . Parajeckas took note of the
professional manner in which superintendents Dan Higgins of
Winchester CC and the venerable Dean Robertson of Kernwood CC
prepared the courses for the NEPGA. ``These are Tour spec greens
and Tour spec courses,'' said Parajeckas, who oversees the
maintenance of Woburn CC, where he also is head pro. ``A Tour stop
could come in right away. I give credit to the superintendents.
Given the season we've had, with the extreme amount of hot weather,
they've done quite a job. It's been first class. They're the ones
behind the scenes.'' . . . Pairings are set for the NEPGA
Individual Match Play Championship Oct. 5-6 at The Kittansett Club,
in which 16 players tee it up for two full days of competition.
Mike Shoueiry of Bradford CC, who led the NEPGA entering the final
round, earned the No. 1 seed and will meet Mo Guttman of Portland
CC in the first match. Shoueiry, who left his family home in the
surburbs of Beirut so he could pursue university studies in this
country, took up golf at 27 . . . The NEPGA will have 48 members
serving as volunteer marshals at The Country Club's eighth hole for
the Ryder Cup. Is this what they term a necessary evil that goes
with membership in the organization?

MARTINEZ TAKES 20TH WIN FOR SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The philosophy remains unchanged, from Denton T.
``Cy'' Young, the first to win 20 games for the Olde Towne Team 98
years ago, to the skinny Dominican who Saturday became the Red Sox'
newest 20-game winner. This is what stoppers do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important for me to set the tone, to bring the
team back to life,'' Martinez said after he struck out 15, held
Seattle to two hits in eight innings, and combined with Rod Beck to
shut out the Mariners, 4-0, to become Boston's first 20-game winner
since Clemens went 21-6 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't willing to give up anything,'' he said. ``I'll do
anything to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out someone in every inning he pitched, fanned
the side in the seventh, and whiffed each Mariner at least once,
with nine of his last 12 outs coming on strikeouts. Jay Buhner, who
whiffed all three times he faced Martinez, then fanned against Beck
to end the game, has come to bat eight times against Martinez in
two seasons and has whiffed each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're worried about his shoulder?'' said Mariners manager
Lou Piniella, whose team had won five in a row before being shut
out for the seventh time this season, the fourth time in just 29
games at their new playground, Safeco Field. ``Send him over here
to pitch for me, and I'll worry about him.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it isn't as automatic as it looked, said Nomar
Garciaparra, whose leadoff home run in the fifth inning, his second
homer in two games and 20th of the season, jump-started a three-run
rally after the first 12 Sox went down in order against Seattle
starter Paul Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Petey's human,'' said Garciaparra, who had apologized
to Pat Rapp for his own mortality the night before, when his high
throw led to Seattle's first run in a wrenching 2-1 Sox loss. ``We
know he may not have it and that we still have to go out there and
play our game. We can't say, `Guess what, Petey's pitching and we
can sit back.' We've still got to go out there and score some runs.
And for a while there, it didn't look like anybody was going to
score.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was especially happy to get the ball rolling,
considering Friday night's tough loss. ``This game was important
because of the fact that we started our road trip with such an
emotional game, and losing it the way we did,'' said the shortstop.
``We didn't want to lose the next one, so it's a good feeling to
bounce back like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, held to three hits Friday night, doubled that total
Saturday, with five of their hits coming in the fifth inning. Troy
O'Leary singled after Garciaparra's home run and was on the move
when Jason Varitek doubled past first baseman Raul Ibanez to make
it 2-0. Trot Nixon then singled off Ibanez's glove to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Boston added its fourth run in the eighth, when Nixon singled,
stole second, advanced to third on a throwing error by catcher Tom
Lampkin, and scored on Jose Offerman's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit sweet,'' said Martinez, whose locker
contained a bottle of champagne sitting in a tub of ice normally
used to soak tired elbows, ``especially knowing Oakland won last
night. It's up to them to win. We got ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez spoke those words not knowing that the A's had just
pushed across a run in the bottom of the ninth to beat Detroit,
2-1, and remain just a game behind the Sox in an American League
wild-card race that may not end until the season does Oct. 3, four
weeks from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who has struck out 15 or more batters five times this
season (Nolan Ryan did it six times in 1974), was dismissed after
the eighth inning, having thrown 128 pitches. That's a total he has
exceeded just four times this season, the last time in an 133-pitch
outing against Tampa Bay just before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days later, after whiffing five batters in two innings in
the All-Star Game, he had the worst outing of his career against
the Florida Marlins and afterward revealed that his shoulder hurt.
So the Sox' precautions were understandable, especially with a
four-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Beck, making his second appearance since coming to the Sox in
Tuesday's trade with the Cubs, had no illusions about whether the
Mariners were happy to see Martinez depart. Especially when his
first pitch to Raul Ibanez went no more than 50 feet before
dribbling past catcher Jason Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught a spike on my way downhill and screwed up my whole
first hitter, because I worried about grabbing it again,'' said
Beck, who walked Ibanez with Ken Griffey, Alex Rodriguez, and Edgar
Martinez due.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pumped when I first got out there, because I said, `Man,
this is a nice hill,' and I end up screwing up and walking the
first hitter,'' said Beck. ``Fortunately, we had a four-run lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who has done nothing against the Sox this season (.219,
including one infield hit in eight at-bats this series), fouled out
to Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got him with a fastball,'' Beck said. ``Not a Pedro Martinez
fastball, but a Rod Beck fastball. They probably thought it was a
changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck then retired Rodriguez (0 for 8 in the series) on a ground
ball and, after Martinez singled, struck out the beleaguered
Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Beck's neat closing effort, the Mariners couldn't get
Martinez out of their minds. ``He just had one of his days, his
typical days,'' said Mariners third baseman Rafael Bournigal, who
came up with Martinez on the Dodgers and is one of his closest
friends. ``When he's throwing all his pitches like that, he's
almost impossible to hit him. MVP? He definitely should be in that
category. He and Garciaparra have been carrying that team.''

BRUINS ARE UP FRONT ABOUT CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON _ Everything hockey begins anew Sunday when all the
Bruins convene here once again, some 52 shooters and booters ready
to divvy up the 20 or so black-and-gold sweaters with the spoked B
on the front.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it began Saturday, with rookies skating, scouts
scribbling, coaches watching, equipment guys unloading, and the
ever-present autograph hounds working the Ristuccia Center parking
lot as if it were the last acre of the '49 Gold Rush.
</P>
<P>
   A sunny sky. A cold rink. Only the slightest hint of autumn in
the air, summer buckling at the knees as it nears the end of its
scorching three-month shift. In times like these, the Stanley Cup
seems but a mirage. Drop a 9-inch blanket of snow on that tableau,
and call in a 30-mile-per-hour northeast wind, and the dream comes
into much sharper, perhaps harsher focus.
</P>
<P>
   Can these Bruins of 1999-2000 realistically think about winning
the Cup? Assuming that Byron Dafoe gets here soon, yes, they can.
Without Dafoe, it's a decent bunch, but destined to collapse. With
Dafoe, the Bruins easily can win a couple of playoff rounds, would
be a decent bet to win a conference championship, and then it's on
to the finals and hourly updates from the trainers' room. All comes
together easily in one run-on sentence, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe and his dollars will consume far too much newsprint and
air time over the next few days. For now, let's assume he'll be
here soon (i.e. closer to Veterans Day than Labor Day).
</P>
<P>
   That said, if the net's OK, where do the fortunes of the '99-00
Bruins rest? The focus has to be up front, which is always where
the focus is at the back end of the season. It is ultimately up to
the scorers.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of three decades now, we've watched the
Bruins self-destruct in April, May, or June. The rare time they
have appeared to have more than a one-line attack, the second line
has disappeared or the power play has caved. The best of recent
times had Adam Oates setting up Cam Neely, or Craig Janney as
Neely's set-up guy before Oates, but there was never another
twosome that made the Boston offense complete, or at least complex
enough to defeat the likes of the once-mighty Oilers in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   This time around can be different, no matter how impaired the
offense might look now that Dmitri Khristich has been cashiered.
The talk-show callers keep asking about filling the Khristich void.
Who'll get his goals? The newly acquired Dave Andreychuk is part of
that answer, and there are a number of others who'll audition for
that spot on the wing.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get caught up in the patch and spackle of Khristich's
29 goals. The key to Boston's success this season will be the likes
of Jason Allison, Joe Thornton, and Sergei Samsonov, first and
foremost, and to a lesser extent, Anson Carter and _ I can't
believe this is rolling off my fingers _ Landon Wilson. If there is
a Cup to be embraced, the first here since the bell-bottom and
long-sideburn days of 1972, it will be handed over by the arms and
wrists of those four or five forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen that most of those guys can be .300 hitters,'' said
assistant general manager Mike O'Connell. ``Now we find out, are
they going to provide more than that? Are we going to see physical
play? Are we going to see strong corner work? Are we going to see
leadership?''
</P>
<P>
   In short, will that group develop en masse, or at least in
substantial part, as complete players? They are just the right age.
All are in their young 20s, precisely where a true contender wants
its core talent _ be it up front, on the blue line, or in net. For
the most part, they've had two full seasons, under the same coach,
wearing the same sweater, learning one another's strengths and
weaknesses, and now is the time for them to shoulder and shape this
team's success.
</P>
<P>
   In back, much the same can be said about Kyle McLaren, about to
enter his fifth season. He turned 22 this summer. This likely will
be Ray Bourque's last sashay. McLaren isn't going to be the
all-purpose Hall of Famer that Bourque has been for two decades,
but he can be the undisputed leader of the blue line for the next
10 years. It's time now, even with Bourque still here, for McLaren
to step forward and truly assert himself. In fact, it will be far
easier for him to do just that with Bourque still in the war room.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when it all fell apart here when the Bruins took up
their new digs on FleetStreet? The model was upside-down. They had
far too many old men wearing younger men's clothes. Some, like
Oates, remained highly valuable and proficient, but there was
virtually no younger cast to work around him and make the Bruins a
true contender. When Oates spoke that obvious truth to the media,
he won himself a trade to Washington. One more messenger shot.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the emphasis has been on the bright future, looking
forward to the day that young, talented players would define the
team and determine its success.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day is here now,'' agreed coach Pat Burns, standing
rinkside, moments before Samsonov was the first of the veterans to
join an informal skate, joined seconds later by Wilson. ``It is _
it's here.''
</P>
<P>
   No more talking about what this team will be. The waiting is
over. It is time for the work in progress to put up, step up, and
play.

   With John Elway retired, debates about the NFL's best
quarterback don't generate a heated argument anymore. Over the past
three years, Brett Favre always captured most of the votes, anyway,
and he remains the clear-cut choice for the top spot. But after
him, there is debate about how the quarterbacks rank, and there
also is a much-publicized crop of young pups who haven't even
played a regular-season game yet. Here are one reporter's rankings,
excluding the rookies:
</P>
<P>
   1. Brett Favre, Green Bay. Obviously, he has the credentials:
five Pro Bowl selections, two Super Bowl appearances, and an
excitement factor because of his mobility. The Packers have
declined slightly as they've gone through personnel changes, but
Favre, with a lighter frame and a new excitement for the game, may
elevate them again.
</P>
<P>
   2. Steve Young, San Francisco. The precision of this man is
incredible. He's like a throwing machine. He still has mobility,
though the 49ers probably wish he'd stay in the pocket. He also has
the Pro Bowls and Super Bowls to show for a Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   3. Drew Bledsoe, New England. In his seventh year, he's got
three Pro Bowls, one Super Bowl appearance, and better statistics
than anyone in history for six years. He settled the
leadership/guts issue last year when he played with the broken
finger and pulled out dramatic victories over AFC East rivals Miami
and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   4. Randall Cunningham, Minnesota. He's got the best receivers in
the game _ Randy Moss, Cris Carter, and Jake Reed _ but part of the
reason they're great is that he throws the ball deep as well as
anyone in the game. The first part of his career was erratic, but
there's no doubt about what he brings to the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   5. Troy Aikman, Dallas. Little by little, his stock drops as he
ages and the team around him erodes. The Cowboys are a star-struck
team, giving most of their money to a few guys while the rest of
the team _ including the receiving corps _ is average. Yet Aikman
is still dangerous and has a glorious past.
</P>
<P>
   6. Doug Flutie, Buffalo. The Flutie bashers will say this is too
high, but we're talking about a guy who has won everywhere he's
been. He is not a one-year wonder. He's a 36-year-old quarterback
who will still have a certain magic about him when he's out there
playing at 44.
</P>
<P>
   7. Mark Brunell, Jacksonville. He is an exciting, fun
quarterback who can run and throw it deep with the best of them.
Unlike Bledsoe, he hasn't gotten his team to the Super Bowl. If he
fails again, the steady buildup of Jacksonville fans who complain
about him so much will continue.
</P>
<P>
   8. Vinny Testaverde, NY Jets. Everyone waits for this guy to
turn into Tony Eason, but he was near-perfect last year, and in
exhibition games this summer, he still was directing the offense
with precision, using his All-Pro receivers deep, short, and
over-the-middle as well as anyone in the league.
</P>
<P>
   9. Dan Marino, Miami. No disrespect intended. He's the best pure
passer there ever was, and there's nobody I'd rather watch direct a
team down the field. The pressure is on Marino this year because he
will likely have a decent running game, a good offensive line, and
_ for the first time since the days of Clayton and Duper _ quality
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   10. Steve McNair, Tennessee. One of these years _ and this may
be the one _ he will be unstoppable. It's hard to find this
combination: strong arm, great runner, and tough.
</P>
<P>
   11. Jake Plummer, Arizona. There's something special about this
guy. He has great field presence, throws well on the run, and has
that Steve Grogan toughness about him.
</P>
<P>
   12. Peyton Manning, Indianapolis. A rookie quarterback hasn't
looked this poised since Bledsoe. The second year may be tougher,
because teams have seen him and scouted him and may understand his
weaknesses. But he also has a nice supporting cast and a team
that's rising.
</P>
<P>
   13. Kordell Stewart, Pittsburgh. Can we call last year an
aberration? After all, why would an offensive coordinator ask
Stewart to stay in the pocket? If he gets back to his old ways and
cuts down his mistakes, he could be very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   14. Chris Chandler, Atlanta. He wins.
</P>
<P>
   15. Jeff George, Minnesota. He has the arm of a No. 1
quarterback, but his head makes him a backup. Too bad, because he
throws a pretty ball and shoulda been a great one.
</P>
<P>
   16. Rob Johnson, Buffalo. Has played enough for everyone to
realize that he's not Doug, but what a future this guy has. He's
big, strong, and can run when he has to.
</P>
<P>
   17. Kerry Collins, NY Giants. We have him rated higher than Kent
Graham, the starter. Collins is one of the few Giant quarterbacks
since Phil Simms who can really throw the football. If he's over
the stupid stuff that got him into trouble in Carolina and New
Orleans, he may do well the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   18. Trent Dilfer, Tampa Bay. The Rodney Dangerfield of the NFL.
This guy gets no respect. He's a former Pro Bowler, and by the
looks of his exhibition performance against the Patriots, he's
capable of getting the ball to some very fast receivers.
</P>
<P>
   19. Brad Johnson, Redskins. He has so much upside if he can get
in a full season. For a tough guy, he is very injury-prone, but he
can move an offense.
</P>
<P>
   20. Jeff Blake, Cincinnati. What happened to this guy? He seemed
to be on his way to multiple Pro Bowls. It looks like he'll be a
decent player somewhere else, because the Bengals are looking to
Akili Smith as the QB of the future.
</P>
<P>
   21. Bubby Brister, Denver. Brian Griese may be better over the
long haul, but we don't know that for sure. Brister has been a good
soldier and won five games for the Broncos last season.
</P>
<P>
   22. Jim Harbaugh, San Diego. Anyone who would spend the year
teaching Ryan Leaf is a saint. Harbaugh used to be a good
quarterback until injuries started to chip away at his
effectiveness. But he's known as Captain Comeback for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   23. Scott Mitchell, Baltimore. Like Blake, another guy whose
brilliant rising career went south. With Brian Billick's help, he
may be perfect for the Raven offense and could jumpstart his
career.
</P>
<P>
   24. Steve Beuerlein, Carolina. A serviceable starter who gets
the Dilfer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   25. Rich Gannon, Oakland. Not bad in spurts, but a full year of
him?
</P>
<P>
   26. Elvis Grbac, Kansas City. He's one hell of a backup
quarterback but he has yet to prove he is special enough to lead a
team to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   27. Warren Moon, Kansas City. Moon, on the other side of 40,
still may be better than the guy he backs up. He can still be
exciting and strike with the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   28. Kent Graham, NY Giants. A real pro. He gets the job done
without much fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   29. Neil O'Donnell, Tennessee. If McNair gets hurt, he has the
experience to be a long-term quarterback. He never gets enough
credit for the things he does well.
</P>
<P>
   30. Charlie Batch, Detroit. He'll be heading into a new
dimension without Barry Sanders around. The kid has made a lot of
fans, showing poise beyond his years.
</P>
<P>
   Second chance
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders were busting old friend Ferric Collons because he
was a few pounds over his playing weight of 300, and as a result he
incurred a hamstring injury. Then they assigned him to the third
team, and Collons balked, telling his coaches they were wasting his
time. He's now with the second unit on what is a very deep
defensive line. As some Patriot players have wondered, why isn't
Collons still here? Though his salary was going from $575,000 to $2
million, the Patriots could have renegotiated and kept a very good
run stopper . . . Is the era of the two-way player returning?
Linebacker Junior Seau made his debut at tight end Friday, and
defensive end Ebeneezer Ekuban may be used as a short-yardage tight
end by the Cowboys. Add to that Deion Sanders and, likely, Champ
Bailey, Charles Woodson, and R.W McQuarters as guys playing both
sides. The Patriots must evaluate the Ty Law situation. They are
paying him above his market value and he wants to try other
positions. Afraid of injury? Listen, Ted Johnson got hurt reaching
out to make a tackle. You can't be afraid of what the media or the
fans will think if a player gets hurt. If you have great players,
use them, especially in this age of salary cap restrictions when
rosters are thin . . . It would not be shocking to find Damon
Denson on the Patriots' list of final cuts. Denson has been given
every opportunity to showcase himself, but he hasn't taken
advantage. The Patriots played Heath Irwin a lot at both guard
spots in the final exhibition game, and coach Pete Carroll said he
would do that (move Irwin around) in an effort to save a roster
spot. That means they may carry only eight or nine offensive
linemen _ the starters, plus Irwin, Jason Andersen, fifth-round
pick Derrick Fletcher, and possibly Ed Ellis . . . Don't be
surprised to see Jets defensive end Bobby Hamilton wind up with the
Patriots if he's cut. Hamilton played for defensive line coach Ray
Hamilton with the Jets a few years ago . . . The cast on Brandon
Mitchell's right hand is coming off soon, after a procedure on a
finger on his left hand that was largely cosmetic. When Mitchell is
set to go, he'll man the end opposite Willie McGinest . . . When
you win two Super Bowls, your career as a coach is made. You can do
and say anything. But Denver's Mike Shanahan may have done Brister
a great disservice, one that veteran players will note. Brister
bailed the Broncos out of five games that Elway missed with
injuries in 1998, but after a couple of bad exhibition games, he's
out? Griese probably will do very well, because he, like Manning,
has quarterbacking in his blood. He also has a great cast around
him, including the best running back and offensive line in the
business, so Shanahan's move is probably safe. But justified? . . .
The Broncos have another distraction in their camp concerning
linebacker Bill Romanowski, who along with his wife, Julie, and two
others has been accused of prescription fraud in illegally
obtaining an appetite suppressant. Romanowski's attorneys have
denied charges of fraud, conspiracy, and unlawful use of a
controlled substance, but if convicted Romanowski, 33, could face
up to three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   He liked Mike
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has loved Michael Bishop from the moment the quarterback
was drafted in the seventh round. In fact, in an interview on Aug.
20, Carroll said, ``I thought we should have drafted him in the
third round. I like this guy. Bobby (Grier) kept telling me, `We'll
have a shot at him. Hang with it.' I love the way this guy plays.
Incredible to me that we could get him. A lot of people paid a lot
of money for some quarterbacks this year and some were drafted way
up high and our guy can give you some problems. I'm excited about
him and he's a terrific draft pick.'' . . . Don't bet the house on
it, but do you think the Patriots are devising some plays for
Bishop? Whether or not they spring them in the opener against the
Jets, they need to get Bishop involved at some point. He's a great
weapon that shouldn't be wasted on the sidelines for 16 weeks . . .
Six more Dolphins were injured in their loss to Green Bay Thursday
night, to go along with running backs J.J. Johnson, Karim
Abdul-Jabbar, and Cecil Collins. Added to the list were safeties
Calvin Jackson (twisted knee), Brock Marion (ligament damage,
hand), Shawn Wooden (broken right thumb), cornerback Pat Surtain
(groin), quarterback Damon Huard (quad), and defensive tackle
Dimitrius Underwood (dislocated shoulder). Underwood is the ironic
one. Jimmy Johnson made a brilliant move to sign him off waivers
after the tug-of-war concerning his future in the ministry or
football got him booted out of Minnesota. Underwood, a good player
at Michigan State who skipped his senior season, has the reputation
of not playing hurt. But after the shoulder dislocation, he piped
up and said, ``I'll put a brace on it and play with it next week.''
Such injuries always lead to questions about whether the regular
season should be expanded to 18 games and the exhibition season
shortened to two. The players would love an 18-game schedule
because it ultimately would mean more money in their paychecks; the
owners wouldn't like it for the same reason. But some owners would
go for an 18/2 arrangement, figuring they've got the same amount of
dates at their home venues. The league would balk because there
aren't as many TV viewers before the kids go back to school.
There's a new theory in NFL circles that injuries are occuring
because of too much training, too much offseason conditioning, too
many two-a-days, and too much practice time . . . The preseason
MVP? Matt Hasselbeck. The former Boston College quarterback, now a
backup in Green Bay, tossed nine touchdown passes in helping the
Packers to a 4-0 record . . . While some assume that the Patriots
will stink based on their 1-3 exhibition record, remember that the
Cowboys were 0-5 last year and won the NFC East . . . The Colts'
Edgerrin James lit it up in preseason: 138 yards on 22 carries . .
. Another BC alum, Glenn Foley, keeps trying to forge a quarterback
controversy in Seattle, where Jon Kitna is the starter. In a 31-28
loss to Indianapolis, all Foley did was complete 19 of 27 passes
for 248 yards and put 19 of the team's 28 points on the board.
``I'm understanding the game plan and understanding what the
coaches want from me,'' said Foley. ``I've been playing this game
for a while and I've got confidence in myself.'' After releasing
Scott Zolak, Bill Parcells may wish he had Foley back in New York.
</P>
<P>
   No swan song yet
</P>
<P>
   Eric Swann, the Cardinals' excellent defensive tackle, told the
Arizona Republic that he bypassed the team's medical staff and had
surgery on his arthritic right knee last year just as the team was
making a playoff run. Swann said he was ``in extreme pain just
doing normal things like walking around.'' The two-time Pro Bowler
is still on the ``physically unable to perform/active'' list, but
it appears he will play this season, perhaps as soon as Sept. 27
vs. San Francisco . . . The Cardinals have other personnel
problems. No. 1 pick L.J. Shelton, an offensive tackle, is still
unsigned. His agent, Lamont Smith, has filed a grievance claiming
the team negotiated in bad faith. The Cardinals also have been slow
in coming to terms with wide receiver Rob Moore, the franchise
player, and defensive tackle Mark Smith, who was offered $325,000
but wants $1 million . . . Steelers coach Bill Cowher says he has
the best offensive line he's ever coached, mainly because of new
tackles Wayne Gandy and Chris Conrad. If Cowher is right, many
holes will be opened for Jerome Bettis and there will be lots of
protection for Stewart. Cowher, incidentally, said he will keep
four quarterbacks on his roster: Stewart, Mike Tomczak, Pete
Gonzalez, and rookie Anthony Wright. He also kept four in 1995:
Stewart, O'Donnell, Tomczak, and Jim Miller . . . Dick Jauron plans
to do something in Chicago that usually doesn't work: He'll use
both rookie sensation Cade McNown and Shane Matthews at
quarterback. The coach is hoping one takes the job, but evidently
the competition is too close to call right now.

US WOMEN TAKE IRELAND TO SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ It was a class reunion that turned into a tutorial.
The US women's soccer team hadn't been together on a soccer field
since the players were love-bombing Brandi Chastain on the floor of
the Rose Bowl. But they got back into celebratory mode quickly
Satuday afternoon, taking overmatched Ireland to school, 5-0,
before 30,564 at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffeny Milbrett scored two goals, and Julie Foudy, Kristine
Lilly, and Joy Fawcett each added one as the Americans breezed past
their green-clad visitors, who got an unaccustomed taste of life at
soccer's upper level.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Americans had played together since
they defeated China on penalty kicks in the Women's World Cup final
eight weeks ago, and their mood was decidedly more relaxed. ``It'll
be fun,'' Milbrett said. ``No restraints. The reins are off of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish, who hadn't even qualified to try to qualify for the
Cup, were happy just to be invited into the same playpen with the
world champions. ``Lambs to the slaughter,'' coach Mick Cooke
joked.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish had played only two international matches this year
and none since June. And they never had performed before 30,000
people. ``These girls have never played in front of more than
10,000,'' said forward Claire Scanlon. ``If we can get over that
initial culture shock, if we can overcome the mind game . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming the experience, skills, and depth of the Americans
was another issue. ``Their starting 11 is amazing,'' said
midfielder Holly Pierce, who used to play for the US under-20 team,
``and the people on the bench are amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Americans probably could have handled the Irish with
their second string, they brought the varsity. All but three of
their gold-medal team (keeper Briana Scurry, defender Lorrie Fair,
and midfielder Michelle Akers) were in uniform, and coach Tony
DiCicco started his regulars _ from defenders Carla Overbeck and
Fawcett to midfielders Foudy and Lilly and forwards Mia Hamm and
Milbrett.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it still took the Americans the better part of a half to
brush off two months' worth of rust and get their legs moving
again. Most of them hadn't arrived until Friday (and Chastain not
until Saturday morning), and they'd had only one practice session
together.
</P>
<P>
   Though the US quickly set up housekeeping in the Irish end, it
took a couple of dozen minutes to get on the board. Tiffany Roberts
put a header over the bar in the second minute. Foudy deflected
Hamm's free kick just wide in the 15th. And Cindy Parlow, alone to
the right of the penalty spot, had the ball taken off her foot by
sprawling keeper Emma Byrne in the 22d.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Milbrett dashed into the area, took a deft cross from
Parlow and lofted the ball over Byrne to put the United States up,
1-0, in the 25th minute. A dozen minutes after that, it was
Milbrett chasing down a loose ball and crossing to Foudy, who
finished easily from the doorstop.
</P>
<P>
   So it was 2-0 at intermission, but the American dominance was
far more pronounced than the score _ 15-2 in shots, 11-0 in corner
kicks. That gave DiCicco the green light to reach deep into his
bench when play resumed. Out came Overbeck, Foudy, defender
Christie Pearce, and keeper Saskia Webber. In went Chastain at
defender, Tisha Venturini in the midfield, Shannon MacMillan at
forward, and Tracy Ducar of North Andover in goal.
</P>
<P>
   There was little risk there. The Americans hadn't allowed a
second-half goal since they'd lost to the Chinese in added time at
the Meadowlands in April. And when play resumed, nothing changed.
The Americans still had the Irish backpedaling and gasping for air.
Natick-born Sara Whalen came in for Parlow in the 58th minute and
within seconds was sprinting down the right flank and feeding
Milbrett for her second goal.
</P>
<P>
   That was far more than enough against an Irish squad that had
made only brief forays into the US end. So the Americans put on an
impromptu clinic for their guests, with Chastain heading a corner
kick to Fawcett, who headed it in for a fourth goal in the 71st
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes later, after Hamm's bid was kicked out by a supine
Byrne, defender Dolores Deasley cleared the rebound straight to
Lilly, who roofed it to the far right corner, making it 5-0. So
much for the graduate-level course in Football 101. ``We're playing
the world champions,'' said Cooke. ``If you can't learn from that .
. . ''

CHICAGO FANS GET MORE OF SAME OLD BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you noticed what's going on with the team formerly known as
the Chicago Bulls? They made two big moves recently, bringing back
former stalwarts Will Perdue and B.J. Armstrong, two fine lads who
are, as they say, gettin' on.
</P>
<P>
   Unless I missed something, wasn't this supposed to be the summer
that the Bulls, who religiously, deliberately, almost haughtily got
well under the salary cap, were going to make their big, bold move
and become a real team again? They had a high draft pick, which
they used on Elton Brand. They had all this salary cap money, which
they used on, er, ah, hmm. But this was their plan and it was as
ill-disguised as it was foolproof. We could expect to see Penny
Hardaway, Ray Allen, Vin Baker, or some other free agent stud
swooping into town and picking up where Michael left off.
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course, none of it happened. The Bulls were boring and
bad last year, a lethal mix. It was so much fun, they are doing it
all over again. The Bulls are pushing the consumer fraud envelope
to the limit by asking season ticket-holders to stomach another
horrible team and another horrible season because next summer,
they'll have all this cap room and Tim Duncan, Maurice Taylor, and
Grant Hill may be there and, well . . .
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, you'll have Perdue, Armstrong, Brand, and other
Springfield-bound fellows.
</P>
<P>
   You already know this story. It didn't happen this time. It
won't happen next time, either. Duncan, to be sure, will be
coveted, but the Bulls can't pay him more than San Antonio no
matter how much cap room they have. And he has said he's amenable
to staying put if the city comes through with a new arena. The
Pistons similarly can outpay Chicago for Hill, who, by the way,
says he wants to stay where he is. Taylor is another matter. He's a
Clipper, so all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls even managed to unload the one player they did spend
for last year: Brent Barry. If I'm not mistaken, wasn't he going to
be one of the guys around whom the team built? (Gee, did Rick
Pitino take over Chicago while I was on vacation?)
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Bulls have the Duncan drums beating
already. They gave Perdue $5 million and the ex-Spur then said,
``Tim Duncan is not married to San Antonio by any means.'' That is
called being a grateful, loyal, marketing-savvy employee. There has
been nary a syllable from either Duncan or Hill or anyone, for that
matter expressing a desire to play in Chicago along the lines of
what Baker said about Boston this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls are again pointing ahead while asking and hoping
the fans ignore what's right in front of their eyes. That is, of
course, after the fans have shelled out the ransom money ahead of
time to see the sorry show.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on the Bulls, who quickly have lost whatever cachet they
thought they had by winning all those titles. But even worse, shame
on their fans, who, we thought, knew better. What are they both
going to say next summer when the well runs dry again?
</P>
<P>
   Magic touches
</P>
<P>
   Orlando is taking the same approach as Chicago, which doesn't
make the Magic any less culpable except that they are doing it for
the first time, they spent lavishly last year and got smoked in the
first round, their fans don't know any better, and they do have the
important inducements of weather and no state income tax to offer
free agents. Plus, it's closer to St. Croix . . . Last year, after
he got fired by the Nets, John Calipari was mentioned by Larry
Brown as a possible addition to the 76ers' staff. Then Brown ran it
by his boss, Pat Croce, who did a Dikembe Mutombo on the whole
thing. Croce was still steamed that Calipari stood him up at the
Chicago predraft camp in 1996 and said he wouldn't have anything to
do with the guy. Well, Cal got wind of Croce's wrath, put in a
call, said it was all a misunderstanding, and, Croce says now,
``Apology accepted.'' So Cal will be an assistant for the first
time in 11 years, passing up guaranteed TV work for a return to the
NBA. ``Coach Brown cornered me on the golf course at Pinehurst and
we talked and I got excited all over again,'' Cal said. ``I had the
TV stuff lined up, but I decided I wanted to do this.'' Calipari
said he thought he might even enjoy the work because he knows
there's no pressure or expectations. ``He's the coach, just like I
was the coach,'' Calipari said. ``I don't think he's going to be
looking over his shoulder.'' . . . We hear that plans are afoot to
get John Mellencamp to close Market Square Arena with a free
concert and have Bruce Springsteen open the new Conseco Fieldhouse
around the corner. They're negotiating dates in Indy with the Boss.
But on Saturday, Nov. 6, the Pacers will play their first home game
in the building, against the Celtics. ``That's always a tough game
for us,'' Pacers president Donnie Walsh said. But also that night,
the 50 greatest players in Indiana state history _ high school,
college, and pro _ will be honored. The 50 will be announced on a
daily basis beginning Sept. 17 after being chosen by a panel of
media members, players, and coaches chaired by the legendary John
Wooden, who, of course, is a native Hoosier. Among those on the
panel are George McInnis, who played at all three levels in
Indiana, former Pacers coach Slick Leonard, and Billy Keller, who
also played at all three levels in the state . . . Charles Oakley
said he had feelers from perhaps a dozen teams before taking the
money and reupping with Toronto. ``I'm not that young, but I do
have a lot of respect around the league.'' . . . Baker's new deal
with Seattle contains a weight clause, which, given last season, is
not a bad idea . . . Don't be surprised if the Celtics are off to
the Orient in the next year or two. Paul Pierce just came back from
a Nike tour of Taiwan, Japan, and Korea and, according to agent
Aaron Goodwin, was an unqualified smash. ``I've never seen him
interact with kids like he did in Japan,'' Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer case revisited
</P>
<P>
   Ron Mercer has been an ex-Celtic for more than a month and is
still unhappy about the way his exodus is being portrayed. Yes, it
was about the money. But no, it wasn't all about the money. Mercer
revealed that he was told before the end of the regular season, in
the back of the Celtics' locker room in Madison Square Garden, that
he probably would not be re-signed. According to Mercer, Pitino
told him he didn't think the team could meet his market value,
although Mercer said he didn't know what that figure was, nor was
one offered by Pitino. And for good reason. There wasn't any way
anyone could have known what that figure was. ``I knew then that I
wasn't going to be back,'' Mercer said. Then there was the brief
meeting in Boston, at which time the Celtics offered him $7 million
over four years. That's a decent wage. But Antoine Walker is making
$12 million a year. And Mercer thinks his market value is somewhere
in between. ``I know what I'm capable of doing,'' he said. ``I
don't think you understand how much motivation I have for this
season.'' So, based on one offer, and one counter from Mercer that
was not, as is being circulated, for the maximum $71 million, the
Celtics decided they couldn't re-sign one of their top players.
There were no more calls. There were no more offers. There was no
more negotiation. ``We wanted to make something happen,'' Mercer
said. ``I wanted to stay with the Celtics, but I also wanted to be
treated fairly. That's all. But it's being said that I was
money-hungry and that's not it at all.'' Mercer may indeed be
unrealistic about his market value. He'll get what he gets and it
will be a lot. It also may not be close to $7 million. But teams
traditionally overpay for players they want to keep, and Mercer had
every right to expect to be one of those guys, especially when he
sees teammates represented by his former agent, David Falk, signed
up quickly and without fanfare. And a disagreement over
compensation is hardly a novelty in pro sports. ``I don't know what
the reason was,'' Mercer said. ``All I know is that I was going to
be traded and it was that way the entire two years I was in Boston.
That's not good.'' And what kind of message does it send to Danny
Fortson, Tony Battie, and, in a couple years, Pierce? Will they,
too, be told their market value makes them unsignable and become
the latest departees in the Bare Rick Project?

BIRD BOOK DISPUTED BY PITINO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before leaving the Celtics in 1997, Larry Bird said he was
offered one final job opportunity with the only professional
organization he ever had known: assistant to head coach Rick
Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   Bird said ``no thanks'' and was soon on his way to Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never looked back,'' he says in a just-released book,
``Bird Watching: On Playing and Coaching the Game I Love,'' by
Sports Illustrated's Jackie MacMullan, a former Globe beat writer.
</P>
<P>
   That's his version, anyway. Pitino said no such offer ever was
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no way, shape, or form did I ever offer him an assistant's
job,'' Pitino said Saturday. ``I'm shocked to hear that. It's
totally false. I would have loved for him to be an assistant, but I
never thought he had any interest in coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird also says in the book that he never envisioned working for
_ or with _ Pitino, whom he initially sought out at the behest of
Celtics owner Paul Gaston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I did find unbelievable was how Pitino kept
telling the media the only way he'd take the job is if I stayed on
with the Celtics,'' Bird says. ``He knew that was never going to
happen, because I told him that. He made it sound like he wanted me
to be the general manager or something, which I never would have
agreed to anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pitino, ``I don't remember it being that way at all. It
wasn't between me and him. It was between him and Paul Gaston and
what he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Bird says that he talked to Pitino ``two or three
times'' during the 1996-97 season when he was asked by Gaston to
come up with some names to replace M.L. Carr as head coach. He said
each time he talked to Pitino, the former Kentucky coach said he
was not interested. But, Bird says, Pitino would ask Bird for
information about the organization. Bird says that his first choice
to replace Carr was Kansas coach Roy Williams, but Williams wanted
to stay in college.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bird's other observations about his last days in Boston:
</P>
<P>
   --He is uncertain about his present relationship with Red
Auerbach, going back to a Globe story in the spring of 1997 in
which he said, jokingly, that he and Auerbach never agree. ``I
don't understand what happened between me and Red, but I'm just as
stubborn as he is,'' Bird says. He said that if he had stayed in
Boston, ``I would have had Red there, right beside me. He would
have been president forever if I had any say in it.'' Auerbach had
to relinquish his title as president when Pitino took over.
</P>
<P>
   --Bird said Gaston never told Carr that he (Gaston) had assigned
Bird to inquire about a new coach. When Carr found out, he accused
Bird of trying to go behind his back. ``You better call up your
boss,'' Bird says, ``because Gaston told me you knew all about
this. He told me you knew everything. You're mad at the wrong
guy.'' He then said he and Carr talked to Gaston and Gaston
apologized to Carr, saying he forgot.
</P>
<P>
   --Bird said he never would work for the Celtics as currently
constituted. ``I can't ever see going back to the Celtics with the
owners they have now,'' he says. ``I always liked Paul Gaston _ I
still do _ and he treated me well. But he made a lot of bad
basketball decisions.'' He was particularly miffed at the way he
said Gaston left Larry Brown hanging. Brown had interviewed for the
Celtics job and then told Bird he thought he had it. That was fine
with Bird, who is a Brown fan. Pitino had said that he was staying
at Kentucky. Brown said he was told Gaston would get back to him,
but, instead, Pitino reentered the picture and eventually was
hired. (The story goes that Brown and Pitino met at a golf
tournament and Brown mentioned he thought he had the job. Pitino
then got back into the thick of things.) ``When I heard that
happened, I was sick,'' Bird says. ``It really ticked me off. It
was done all wrong. I had no problem with Rick Pitino being the
coach _ it was the way it was handled that bothered me. Larry Brown
should have been treated with far more respect throughout the
process and Paul Gaston should have been more straightforward with
me. But neither one of those things happened.''
</P>
<P>
   --While in Boston, Bird would complain about too many people
making decisions and that his input often was disregarded. ``I
mean, why ask my opinion if you don't really care what I think?''
he says. ``Paul Gaston always told me I could have any job I wanted
in the organization, but the truth was I had very little input.''
He said a classic case of that was his opposition to the signing of
Dana Barros. The Celtics already had Sherman Douglas and Bird was a
big Douglas fan, saying he had told ownership that Douglas was the
team's most valuable player. He also didn't think Barros was the
right fit, especially at the price (six years, $21 million). He
says that Carr and Gaston wanted Barros because Barros was local
and would be a fan favorite. ``That's when I realized the decision
didn't have much to do with basketball,'' he says. Douglas was
quickly traded to Milwaukee for Todd Day, whom Bird doesn't like,
and Alton Lister. Bird says that he was similarly opposed to the
signing of Dominique Wilkins, but was not kept abreast and found
out when he saw it on television. Gaston said Saturday he would not
comment, adding, ``I don't see anything worthy of responding to.''
</P>
<P>
   --It's going to be interesting to see if Bird moves into the
front office and has any dealings with the Cavaliers' new general
manager, Jim Paxson. Bird clearly does not like Paxson, whom he
still blames for fingering him as a disruptive force in the 1989-90
season. ``Right away, he was a guy I stayed away from because he
was your classic clubhouse lawyer, always talking behind people's
backs,'' Bird says. ``I never trusted people like that.'' Bird said
Paxson and Kevin McHale were the anonymous sources who ripped him
and that McHale since has admitted as much. ``I always thought the
world of Kevin McHale _ I still do _ but I was so hurt he would do
something cheap like that.'' As for Paxson, Bird says, ``I made up
my mind that he was a guy I wouldn't deal with anymore.'' He wrote
of an incident when he was working for a trading card company and
the company called him to say that it was sending a rep down to
drop off some memorabilia to sign. When Bird discovered that the
rep was Paxson, he told the company to get someone else. ``I won't
see that guy,'' he says. And when Paxson arrived, he turned around
and left.

BC GETS POINT IN OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The heat had grown stifling. So, too, had the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   As searing, Texas-type temperatures heated up the artificial
turf at Alumni Stadium, Boston College's football team withstood
the conditions and remained calm, cool, and collected when
Saturday's season opener against Baylor threatened to go into
double overtime.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bears answered an Eagles touchdown in overtime and
lined up for the extra-point attempt by Kyle Atteberry, nerves on
both sides _ and among the crowd of 39,756 _ seemed to reach a
boiling point.
</P>
<P>
   How much more could the Eagles give? How much more could they
withstand after being victimized by several bizarre plays and
miscues? How much farther could they go?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going all the way,'' said BC senior defensive tackle
Chris Hovan. ``Until we dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, BC didn't have to go that far.
</P>
<P>
   Atteberry saw to that when he missed a chip-shot PAT _ hooking
it wide left from the right hash _ that enabled the Eagles to sweat
out a 30-29 victory. BC's first-ever overtime triumph touched off a
delirious celebration on the sideline that spilled onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Cirino, who came crashing off the corner in an attempt to
block the kick, ripped off his helmet and flung it high in the air.
Defensive tackle Mike Willetts, who had plowed into the middle of
Baylor's line, exhaled a mighty sigh of relief. And Hovan, who said
his only view of the kick ``was a wall of white jerseys,'' knew BC
had won it when he saw his joyous teammates rush the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things finally happened to good people,'' said BC coach
Tom O'Brien. ``The kids hung in there and they played extremely
hard. We didn't play very smart and we didn't play very good. We
understand we have a long way to go, but you have to give Baylor a
lot of credit. That's a pretty good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like BC, the Bears were not without their flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor struggled to mount a rushing attack against BC's
senior-laden defense, which held the Bears to 110 yards on the
ground and 14 first downs. Behind an offensive line that plowed
huge holes into Baylor's defensive front, the Eagles amassed 451
yards total offense, almost rushing for as many yards (350) as the
Bears had total offense (354).
</P>
<P>
   Junior running back Cedric Washington did the bulk of the work,
carrying 32 times for 177 yards and scoring three touchdowns.
Washington, a 5-foot-11-inch, 200-pounder from Holyoke, scored in
regulation on runs of 4 and 6 yards and added a 1-yard plunge in
overtime. Senior John Matich, who made one of two field goal
attempts, converted the PAT following Washington's overtime TD that
proved the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Atteberry, though, had no such luck after Baylor quarterback
Jermaine Alfred (15 of 18, 244 yards, 2 TDs) scored on a 1-yard
plunge in OT.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred, Atteberry's regular holder, was dinged up on the scoring
drive and was on the sideline. There was no trouble with the snap
or the hold. But the kick was off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' said Baylor first-year coach Kevin Steele.
``I should've used a timeout there, that was my mistake and I take
full credit for that, but still (Ryan) Chapdelaine (the reserve
holder) is every bit as good as Jermaine in getting it down. He got
it down just perfect. It was a good snap and a good hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could base it on is what Kyle told me,'' he added, ``And
Kyle said that he mis-hit it, you know? He just mis-hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   It absolved the Eagles of an afternoon of sins.
</P>
<P>
   When BC's first possession stalled at its 42 after three plays,
Baylor took a 3-0 lead on Atteberry's 22-yard field goal after
Samir El-Amin blocked Kevin McMyler's punt. Carlton Rowe, who
rushed 10 times for 47 yards before departing with cramps in the
second half, gave BC a 7-3 lead on a 1-yard plunge that capped an
impressive 15-play, 80-yard drive with 2:33 left in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor then recorded its first TD on a bizarre play when Melvin
Barnett hauled in a flare pass at the BC 3 but fumbled the ball
after Jonathan Ordway's jarring hit. The ball squirted into the end
zone where Lanny O'Steen pounced on it, beating Adam Newman to the
ball for a 10-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Junior quarterback Tim Hasselbeck, who struggled in his first
career start by completing 13 of 29 passes for 101 yards (including
the first pass to himself for a 3-yard gain), was victimized by
McKinley Bowie's 83-yard interception return with 25 seconds left
before intermission. Hovan blocked Atteberry's PAT, but Baylor had
a 16-7 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   BC rallied with a strong second half, overcoming back-to-back
penalties (for delay of game) to get a 21-yard field goal by
Matich. Washington made it 16-10 on a 4-yard run in the third, but
an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty (for excessive celebration) led
to Matich's missed PAT from 35 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, though, made it 23-16 in the fourth when he scored
on a 6-yard run after Bryan Arndt salvaged the drive by pouncing on
a William Green fumble at the 6. However, Baylor came back and tied
it, 23-23, when Alfred beat Ramon Johnson with a 73-yard TD toss to
Andra Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough, but we fought through it,'' Cirino said of the
steamy conditions. ``Once again, we couldn't lay down and die. We
had a bunch of opportunities where this team in the past would have
done that and just rolled over. But we weren't having it _ this
game or this year _ because we realized this was a chance to win
our first home opener since we've been here and we wanted to make
it count.''
</P>
<P>
   And they did, by the slightest of margins.

open in two months. Workers are scrambling to finish. Few exhibits
are in place, though planners insist that the museum will still
open Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a just a few highlights people will see, along with the
most basic science lessons they will learn:
</P>
<P>
   - Theater district: Features a 440-seat theater with a 60-foot
screen playing Iwerks large-format films, a 150-seat domed theater
for planetarium and multimedia shows, a 200-seat theater for live
performances and an eight-seat computerized motion simulator,
which, depending on the software, re-creates motion experienced in
an Air Force jet, a roller coaster or a race car.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Science is an enjoyable experience involving body, mind
and emotions.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   - Mister E. Hotel: The rooms in the hotel contain optical
illusions. As you figure out how they work, you gather clues to the
mystery of where a missing fortune is hidden. Entering one room you
feel upright, but the room looks tilted. Lie on the bed, and
suddenly the room looks normal and you feel tilted. You see a gem
in a safe and try to grab it; it's not there. From one angle
objects in a safe look like gold bars, from a different angle they
look like pieces of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Understanding reflection, refraction and optics.
</P>
<P>
   - Crime lab: Given a file on a suspected criminal, you use
autopsy reports, fingerprints, comparative hair samples and other
forensic science techniques to prove guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Learn to gather, analyze, compare and interpret data.
</P>
<P>
   - Helicopter: Grab the controls of the chopper for a simulated
flight; see how difficult it really is.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Understanding the phenomenon of flight.
</P>
<P>
   - Storm Center: Determine the course of an approaching storm
using data from storm watchers, weather maps, satellite feeds and
other information.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Understanding weather phenomenon; gathering data and
making decisions based on your observations.
</P>
<P>

when, strapped into a counterbalanced bicycle, you ride it across a
high wire 23 feet in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Understanding balance, gravity and center of mass.
</P>
<P>
   - S.O.A.R. Lab: Enter the Scientific Opportunities in Applied
Research Lab as a research scientist with a specific job. Design a
robot to perform a particular task; engineer a car for style and
efficiency; check your design of a boat, a plane wing or an
automobile in a wind tunnel; go to the drop tower and, with a
high-speed camera, witness what occurs to your sample when dropped
from 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Understanding research and design, the process of trial
and error and what it takes to turn an idea into a workable
product.
</P>
<P>
   - Dr. Hugh Mann Torso's Body Tours: This pretend company has
developed body-imaging technology that lets visitors diagnose a
disease by taking a fantastic voyage through a pulsating blood
vessel. Images of blood cells whiz by as you make your way into the
lungs, the brain and on to an operating room, where you suddenly
become part of a surgical team.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Understanding anatomy and body-imaging technology.
</P>
<P>
   - City Golf: Learn the physics of motion as you putt balls on
this four-hole miniature golf course, where the hazards, including
spinning disks and blasts of air, have been designed by physicists.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Understanding how forces influence bodies in motion.
</P>
<P>
   - Farm Environment: Here in a barn you are given data and a
global positioning satellite map on how your crop did in the
previous year. Then you climb into the cab of a combine and on a
computer make decisions on the use of pesticides, fertilizers,
irrigation and plant strains to improve this year's yield. See
whether it works.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Understanding the high-tech nature of farming with its
use of genetic engineering, satellites, etc. Learning to make
decisions based on data collection.
</P>
<P>
   - Music Park: Everything is musical. The fence is a xylophone. A
giant synthesizer keyboard is embedded in the ground. Five
trash-can drums play 10 different tones. Infrared beams shoot
through the branches of a weeping willow ``harp tree.'' Stop the
beams with your hands, and the tree plays different notes.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Understanding acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   - Art Park: Features a 10-foot ball-bearing stream. Create
eddies and waterfalls, and change the course of the stream using
different levers and obstacles. A heat-sensitive liquid crystal
column changes color as you touch it. Using ultrasound, create a
cloud inside a 4-foot diameter bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Understanding the connections between art and science.
</P>
<P>
   - Secret City: Visitors take a trip beneath the streets of
Science City to dabble with electricity, pneumatics, water _ the
kind of systems that help a city operate. Manipulate breakers and
switches on three generators to guide a current and light an alley
sign; make whistles blow, wheels spin, etc., using compressed air;
direct balls to their destinations through a series of pneumatic
tubes; figure out the right pulley system to raise yourself while
sitting on an elevator seat.

FOR ONE FAN, THE MUSIC OF BARRY MANILOW MEANS LIFE ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For more than two decades, Rachel Cooke of
Louisburg, Kan., told almost no one the full story of her troubled
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   But now, on the day she will attend the Barry Manilow concert at
Sandstone Amphitheatre, she doesn't care who knows _ especially the
singer.
</P>
<P>
   After all, she said, his music saved her life.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1978 in LaVista, Neb., a suburb of Omaha. Cooke, then
Rachel Parker, was an energetic, creative 15-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   She also had decided to kill herself.
</P>
<P>
   At home after school, she put on a nightgown, pulled a
handkerchief-wrapped bundle from a dresser drawer and filled a
glass with water. Then she climbed onto her twin bed and prepared
to die.
</P>
<P>
   This was it, she thought: the end of her fears, the end of her
pain.
</P>
<P>
   She untied the handkerchief and let 27 red-and-white Dilantin
capsules tumble onto her bedspread. She didn't want to die, but
after years of sexual abuse by her father, she couldn't think of a
good reason to live.
</P>
<P>
   She scooped the heart pills into one hand and held the glass in
the other. Then she heard the music by Barry Manilow that would
change her life.
</P>
<P>
   All the time I thought there's only me
</P>
<P>
   Crazy in a way that no one else could be
</P>
<P>
   I would have given everything I own
</P>
<P>
   If someone would have said you're not alone
</P>
<P>
   The words stunned her. She dropped the glass and pills, grabbed
her pillow and began to sob.
</P>
<P>
   - - -
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than 20 years since Cooke, now 36, nearly took
her own life.
</P>
<P>
   With Manilow in town, Cooke wants to share her story to show
others who are suffering abuse that they are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father went blind when I was about 2 years old,'' she said.
``I learned that by touch, my father could see.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was 11, he started touching her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say, `Come here, so I can see how you are growing.'
Then he would disrobe me and touch me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The touching eventually turned to intercourse. She asked him to
stop. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   And he threatened to kill her, her siblings and her mother if
she told anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd repeatedly mention that he had bullets with our names on
them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By several accounts, Richard Parker was a talented but troubled
man with an iron will.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his blindness and health problems ranging from epilepsy
to heart disease, he carved out a living with Radio Talking Book in
Omaha, a service that provided information, ranging from books and
the weather to current events, for the visually impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside the home, my father was an incredible man,'' Cooke
said. ``Made a name for himself in the community, knew the chief of
police, worked with the media, even talked about running for
senator at one point.''
</P>
<P>
   At home he was far different.
</P>
<P>
   One night, when Rachel was 17, he burst into the bathroom, where
he tied her to the toilet and forced himself on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people ask, `Why didn't you run? He was blind,' &UR; ''
Cooke said. ``I could have run. But he would have found me.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, she feared, things would be worse. He might beat her.
Or turn his twisted affections to her sister or brother. Or kill
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   In speech class the next day, Cooke wasn't herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had this big neon sign flashing on my forehead
that said, You've had sex with your father!''
</P>
<P>
   When the teacher teased her about not wanting to give her
speech, Cooke bolted from the room, shattering the glass in the
door.
- - -
</P>
<P>
   In the office, she cried hysterically.
</P>
<P>
   The school called police. For the first time, she told someone
about the abuse. Instead of support, she got accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever walk in front of him naked to entice him?,'' one
officer asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's blind!,'' she shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Her father denied the charges. A juvenile court judge ordered
the family into counseling and then sent her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father beat the tar out of me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, the family went to counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' a therapist said. ``Your dad tells me this is all your
fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel stared daggers at the therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the problem,'' she said. ``I don't have the problem.
I don't need to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   She walked out. Her parents walked out. They never went back.
</P>
<P>
   Each time officers called to check on her, her father made her
hang up.
</P>
<P>
   Una Kohler, a former reserve officer for the LaVista Police
Department, remembers how hard Cooke struggled to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``To begin with, she was a pretty timid girl,'' she said. ``But
as time went on, she gained strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rachel,'' his father yelled after hearing that she had a new
bra. ``Come here so I can see your breast size.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flipped,'' she said. ``I started screaming....`As long as I
live you'll never touch me again!' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   That night she ran away.
</P>
<P>
   Scared, alone and broke, she lived out of her red Dodge Dart for
three weeks. She bathed in public rest rooms. Still in high school,
she got jobs as a telemarketer and at a bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   She saved enough to rent an apartment and graduated from high
school. She was 18. A year later, her father died of congestive
heart failure.
- - -
</P>
<P>
   His death brought back the hopelessness, the pain. And the
memories of the day she almost beat him to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty minutes till the pain is over,'' she thought as she
walked home from school on the day she planned to kill herself.
</P>
<P>
   Then something happened that she still doesn't completely
understand.
</P>
<P>
   She saw a garage sale and went in. With a quarter in her pocket,
she went from table to table, passing glassware, knickknacks, old
books.
</P>
<P>
   She stopped at a box of records. She was drawn to a single by
Barry Manilow called ``All the Time.'' She had never heard of Barry
Manilow.
</P>
<P>
   She bought the record for a nickel.
</P>
<P>
   Kneeling on her bed at home, with 27 Dilantin capsules spread
before her, she placed the record on the turntable. Seconds before
swallowing the pills, she heard the single _ from Manilow's album
``This One's For You.''
</P>
<P>
   All the time I thought there's only me....
</P>
<P>
   His lyrics were a revelation. Someone understood!
</P>
<P>
   Sobbing into her pillow, she resolved not to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me a reason to keep going, because I wasn't alone,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   From that day, more Manilow records followed. His gentle voice,
his upbeat tunes and positive messages moved her, inspired her.
</P>
<P>
   Saved her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming to hear a story like that,'' Manilow said.
``When I began making records I didn't know what I was doing. I
don't know if anyone really does. All I was getting was a critical
drubbing from the press. `Stop doing what you are doing. You stink
so bad.' I'd get up every morning and... say, `They're wrong.
There's somebody out there who is getting what I am trying to say.'
And there she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cooke has a small shrine to Manilow in a curio cabinet in
her dining room. There's Manilow on a book, on the cover of People
magazine, on playing cards, key chains, clocks, candy dishes.
</P>
<P>
   She has ``Manilow'' personalized license plates on her car. She
recently wrote a sermon about him.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's his music. She has it all. Every song. Every note.
- - -
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, her sister, Renelle, will go with her to Manilow's
concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister is my savior,'' Renelle Ferry said. ``Everything I
have ever wanted to be is related to my sister _ being a good
person, being good with children, being a Christian and a
volunteer....I think one of the greatest things she has done is
help other children through the same things she went through. She
worked with the court system and abused children in Sarpy County
(Neb.) for several years. She's turned it around. She took
something horribly negative and turned it into a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cooke is married and stays home with her boys, Weston, 6,
and Sawyer, 2. She watches children in her home and volunteers at
her church, Redeemer Lutheran in Shawnee, Kan. She and her husband,
Scott, a project manager at Sprint, recently built a large house in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   She credits her recovery to therapy and to friends who have
become a second family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rough,'' said her therapist, Sherry Briggs. ``It's been
a long haul for her. She's had a lot of past trauma, and she's
worked very hard to come through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooke plans to become an ordained youth minister.
</P>
<P>
   She met her idol for the first time last November at a taping of
the ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' show in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tongue-tied,'' she said, ``and I am never at a loss for
words. I even gave him a card, because I was afraid I wouldn't
speak articulately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this?'' she remembers him saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thank-you card,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   He reached out, took her hand, and said: ``No. I should be
thanking you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he kissed her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Manilow has added ``All the Time,'' to tonight's play list in
honor of Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shaking,'' she said when she heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   All the time
</P>
<P>
   All the wasted time
</P>
<P>
   All the years, waiting for a sign
</P>
<P>
   To think I had it all the time
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have it all the time,'' she said. ``I just had to find
it in myself that I was worth something.''

SCIENCE CITY WILL OFFER LEARNING BY DOING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC ADLER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Earlier this summer, the creators of Science
City got a phone call from a man so excited about Union Station's
new science museum that he offered a gift _ a reproduction of
Sputnik, the first satellite rocketed into outer space.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it, he said. Think how great the glimmering herald of
the Space Age would look dangling from the ceiling of the station's
Grand Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Officials didn't think long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' said spokesman Bill Musgrave. ``But it's not what
we have in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the prize had been Apollo 11 itself, a Tyrannosaurus
rex, Archimedes' bathtub or Einstein's brain, the answer would have
been the same: No thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the way the creators of Science City see it, the
best way to get excited and learn about science is not by looking,
it is by doing, by becoming immersed in an experience that, in the
case of Science City, has been shaped by extensive market research
and focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission,'' said Steve Snyder, Science City's director of
attraction development, ``is to ignite a passion for discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   So why gawk at Sputnik when you can pilot a helicopter?
</P>
<P>
   Why read about DNA fingerprinting, when you can solve a murder?
</P>
<P>
   Science City is not scheduled to open until Nov. 10. But museum
leaders aware of its concept _ a science world that is more theme
park than museum _ already are identifying it as an exotic species
in their field, although some may question how much science the
visitors will absorb.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, hands-on museums and interactive exhibits have
existed for decades. In Chicago, a Museum of Science and Industry
exhibit that simulates a 1,500-foot descent into a coal mine has
been around since 1933.
</P>
<P>
   And the idea of marketing ``experience'' also is decades old.
Today it is prominent throughout the retail world from Nike Town,
where customers can climb walls as well as buy sneakers, to
Rainforest Cafe, where diners eat amid the mist and sound effects
of a tropical jungle.
</P>
<P>
   But in museums, such thoroughly immersive experiences are still
as rare as a snowfall in the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``By its scale and approach, what Kansas City is planning takes
the idea of being immersed in an environment way out on the
continuum,'' said Bonnie VanDorn, executive director of the
Washington-based Association of Science-Technology Centers.
</P>
<P>
   So how much actual science knowledge will visitors take way from
Science City? The vast majority of educators agree that people
learn best from hands-on experiences. But by relying so heavily on
a theme-park approach, will Science City be exchanging fun for
facts? Theater for theorems?
</P>
<P>
   The response from Science City planners: It depends.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the science is there, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole premise,'' said David Ucko, president of Science
City at Union Station and the Kansas City Museum, ``is that science
underlies everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials proudly boast that Science City's exhibits contain
more than enough to help teachers fulfill nearly all the
kindergarten to 12th-grade goals spelled out in the Missouri,
Kansas and national science standards.
</P>
<P>
   But if visitors hope to come away knowing Bernoulli's Principle
or the standard model of quantum physics _ forget it, they say. And
while visitors will be able to dig fossils at an archaeological
site and walk on a movie set from the Cretaceous period, there will
be no mention of Darwin or the process of natural selection.
</P>
<P>
   Science City's mission is to beguile, to enchant, to inspire, to
make the process of science and scientific inquiry in this world so
delightful that, upon entering the real world, visitors not only
will begin to see science all around them but also hunger to know
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone comes out of Science City and you ask them to name
all the amino acids, they're not going to be able to do that,''
said Lauranne Hess, developer of Science City's educational
programs. ``But that's not what the experience is about.'' Born in
Paris
</P>
<P>
   Simply, when Science City is finished it will be exactly what
its name implies, a mock city under glass. It is a two-level
science theme park built beneath what looks like an enormous
greenhouse that rises the height of Union Station and runs along
the west side.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Science City concept did not come to the attention
of Kansas Citians until 1991, the inspiration goes back to 1987.
That is when Ucko, who was then at the California Museum of Science
and Industry in Los Angeles, attended a temporary film exhibit in
Paris called Cites-Cines.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of just watching movies, visitors to Cites-Cines wore
earphones and walked through a series of faux city facades _ a jail
cell, a rooftop. In moving from one environment to the next, famous
movie scenes related to each environment flashed on the walls.
Music and dialogue came through the earphones.
</P>
<P>
   For years Ucko had felt that science centers were not living up
to their potential. Science and industry museums did a great job
showing technology's dramatic progress. And hands-on museums, like
the Exploratorium in San Francisco, were dynamic laboratories. But
neither, he felt, were great at engaging visitors' emotions or
sense of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Cites-Cines did just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful,'' Ucko said. ``At that point I began to
think of how to take this kind of emotional engagement, which
science museums had not been creating, and translate it into
something educational.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ucko moved here in 1990, he came with the understanding
that he would corral support for a science museum. His idea was
Science City. When the museum opens as part of the $250 million
renovation of Union Station, the space beneath the glass ceiling
will feature $21 million worth of exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibits are housed among elaborate sets. People will see
stone, wood and brick buildings. There will be streetlamps,
sidewalks, bridges, curbs, sewers, parks, billboards, fountains, a
four-hole miniature golf course, a Missouri cave, a waterfall and a
tree-house canopy. There will be an eatery, a skyscraper
construction site, a crane, a barn, a combine, a helicopter, a
movie set, a historic neighborhood, an archaeological dig site, an
astronaut training facility, a robot design lab and more than 25
other environments, each designed to launch visitors on separate
scientific adventures.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's hospital, visitors will tour the human body by
walking through a reproduction of a pulsating blood vessel. At the
Mister E. Hotel (get it? ``mystery'') the mission will be to gather
clues to a lost fortune while wandering through rooms of different
optical illusions. Tornadoes are tracked at the severe storm
center. Bad guys are nabbed using forensic science at the crime
lab.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever explanatory text each exhibit requires will blend into
each environment. Instead of reading signs, visitors will find
information on blueprints, memos, wall posters, golf score cards,
Post-it Notes, medical charts, an archaeologist's notebook.
Throughout, as in Cites-Cines, there will be film and sound
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Science City will even have residents _ 23 costumed
``interactors'' meant to entertain and help visitors understand the
science behind their jobs, from a crime-lab worker (forensics) to a
make-up artist who changes the appearance of visitors using
filtered light (optics).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have an ice-cream vendor,'' said Steve Snyder, ``who at
the base of it deals with the science of hot and cold. One idea
we're playing with is to have him branch out; he's looking to
create a flower Popsicle.''
</P>
<P>
   By dipping a flower in liquid nitrogen, Snyder said, people will
see what happens at a very low temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The object, Snyder said, is not to give a science sermon, but to
help create ``a rich, exciting, emotionally engaging experience
that, at its heart, is educational.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, Ucko said, is exactly what people want.
</P>
<P>
   How is he sure?
</P>
<P>
   Focus groups. Focus groups. Focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   Like it, don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   Like other things served under glass, Science City has been
prepared to order. The effect of focus groups in helping guide the
facility's design has been enormous.
</P>
<P>
   When focus groups said they did not like the idea of a
science-of-arson exhibit because it brought up feelings of loss,
the idea was nixed.
</P>
<P>
   When focus groups said they liked the idea of a Secret City
exhibit, allowing visitors to explore underground systems like
power and water, the exhibit was added.
</P>
<P>
   And when focus groups clearly stated that their top four
interests were medicine, space, the history of Kansas City and
dinosaurs, Old Town became part of Science City. It is an area of
14 buildings modeled after well-known Kansas City businesses, from
an 1868 J.H. Adami Hardware, Cutlery store to a 1940s Jones Store
to a 1964 Jack Boring appliance shop.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, Ucko said, is how focus groups confirmed what
he and other museum officials have long known:
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to read lots of stuff,'' he said. ``They
want hands-on. They want to do things they don't normally do,
whether it's going up in a tree house or down in a cave. These are
places and experiences people don't normally have.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Internet, television, movies and theme parks,
``the public has just grown to expect a higher level of fun in the
museum experience,'' said Joe Shacter, director of exhibits at
Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry.
</P>
<P>
   If giving visitors what they ask for gets them excited about
science, so be it, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more people than ever are going to museums of all sorts:
art, science, natural history. Attendance is at a record high with
860 million visits a year _ more than 2 million a day. One big
reason, said Ed Able, president of the American Association of
Museums, is the hard work all sorts of museums have put into
shedding their elitist images and becoming more accommodating to
the people who walk through their doors. In short, making the
experience exciting or, at least, personal and easy to relate to.
Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   - At the Maryland Science Center in Baltimore, part of a recent
women's health exhibit used a life-size Barbie doll to show bizarre
and unrealistic that symbol of femininity is when compared to real
women.
</P>
<P>
   - In October, Chicago's science museum will mount an interactive
``Star Trek'' exhibit, with props and sets from the movies, to show
how fiction has come to pass in the form of new technology.
</P>
<P>
   - A traveling Whodunnit exhibit at the Fort Worth Museum of
Science and History, in Texas, plunges visitors into a murder at
Memory Diner, complete with police lights, crime tape, recorded
witness reports, film of a mannequin autopsy and 14 other clues,
allowing visitors to use ballistic, toxicology and other forensic
tools to solve the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it work,'' said Charlie Walter, vice president of
the Fort Worth museum, ``is that it provides a real context. It
engages you. If you've really experienced it, it's easier to
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   At Science City then, will visitors come away understanding
angular momentum or the laws of aerodynamics when they putt a ball
over spinning discs or blasts of air on the miniature golf course?
</P>
<P>
   On the Dinosaur Films Ltd. movie set, will visitors _ walking
through a tunnel beneath a projection of an animated mosasaur _
learn the distinction between Cretaceous, Triassic and Jurassic
dinosaurs?
</P>
<P>
   When visitors at Pop Wheelie's Delivery Service are strapped
onto a counterbalanced bicycle and ride it along a cable 23 feet in
the air, will they suddenly know how to calculate center of mass?
</P>
<P>
   No. But they will learn firsthand how bodies in motion act;
they'll see a type of underwater beast that scientists say swam
millions of years ago in the great inland sea that became Kansas;
they'll obtain a visceral understanding of center of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The hope, then, is that visitors will begin to ask questions:
</P>
<P>
   What kind of skin might the animal have had? Fur? Scales? How
would it have stood and moved? What evidence is there to make a
conclusion?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this thought out there,'' said Snyder of Science
City, ``that science is this big book somewhere, where you turn to
the right page and you find the right answer. But what it really
is, is this adventure, this process of investigation and discovery
that is the thrilling heart of science.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the stuff, he said, that fires the intellect.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what we're looking to do,'' said Ucko, ``is create the
spark.''

EVEN WITHOUT A 70-TON TANK, TOWN'S PARADE IS HEAVY WITH MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ALTON, Kan. _ Never mind that KDOT KO'd the M1A1 battle tank.
</P>
<P>
   The PRIDE Committee can be proud of its 1999 Jubilee Parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot we had to do this year,'' said Wilda Carswell,
a PRIDE member. ``We wanted this parade to be special.''
</P>
<P>
   That was because it celebrated veterans, especially those of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing them all the time,'' said Deanna Roach, a
committee member.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a good opportunity to finally say goodbye to one of
its sons who grew up here, found the wife who became the mother of
his two children, and then disappeared into the maelstrom of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Only to be found again.
</P>
<P>
   But first, more about that tank. In order to make last weekend's
parade even bigger than recent ones for Russell Stover, the candy
man who was born here, or the Alton football team, which won 51
consecutive games in the 1960s, the PRIDE Committee set its sights
on an M1A1 main battle tank, the kind that dominated the
battlefields in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those really big ones,'' said Carswell. ``It was all
set. We'd called the Army at Fort Riley. They were going to send
one over on a trailer. Then along came the darn KDOT.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been something. A low-slung Abrams tank sporting a
120-mm cannon rumbling down the main drag.
</P>
<P>
   But with the M1A1 weighing in at almost 70 tons and its
transport trailer and truck coming close to half that, it was the
Kansas Department of Transportation that trembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were worried about the highways and bridges,'' said
Carswell. ``I could see their point.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Riley did send over a cavalry troop with soldiers wearing
19th century uniforms. There was also a Humvee; a couple of old
jeeps were scrounged up locally, and the parade went off without a
hitch.
</P>
<P>
   How big a parade?
</P>
<P>
   Try 140 entries. Not bad on a hot August afternoon for a
100-plus town in Osborne County.
</P>
<P>
   The theme was ``The Troops March On.'' First, down Mill Street,
came the military vehicles, the blue-clad troopers on horseback,
jeeps carrying elderly veterans, the American Legion and a float
recalling the home front _ scrap metal, victory gardens, bundled
newspapers, tin foil, even Rosie the Riveter.
</P>
<P>
   Past the estimated 800 onlookers came the rest _ farm machinery,
antique cars, wagons, motorcycles, riding mowers, a milk truck,
18-wheelers, dune buggies, more horses, bicycles and just about
anything else that could be pushed or pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was a more poignant side.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it was the old photographs of Thomas Taylor and Floyd
Taylor, uncle and nephew and soldiers in the Philippines. They died
on or as a result of the Bataan Death March.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it was Clarence Gregory, 75, who landed at Normandy's
Utah Beach on D-Day, June 6, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to hit Omaha Beach,'' said Gregory. ``Lost a
whole company there. Our landing craft ended up at Utah. I
guarantee I wouldn't be standing here talking to you. I'd have been
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   There was Carl Nonamaker, 79, who went ashore at Normandy on
D-Day-plus-nine, fought in five major battles and never even got a
scratch. After all these years, though, Nonamaker still has a gripe
_ not about people trying to shoot him, the counterbattery fire or
the wretchedness of war itself.
</P>
<P>
   No, his complaint is that the Army allowed him only a 10-day
furlough for the 1943 Kansas wheat harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Took two days to get here on the train and two days back,''
Nonamaker said. ``That left me just six days, and my daddy didn't
have any help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go back. Back at the base all we did was piddle
around. Instead, I could have been in the fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally there were the three persons sitting under the awning of
the old Odd Fellows Hall, now boarded up: Violet Sparks Mertz of
Salina; her daughter, Karen Sparks Hendrickson of Rancho Mirage,
Calif.; and her son, Doug Sparks of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Violet's first husband and Karen and Doug's father was Edward
``Mack'' Sparks, an Alton boy who, from his photograph, was almost
movie-star handsome.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, five weeks after they met here, Violet and Mack were
married. The war came. Mack joined the Army Air Corps. He'd be
safer in the air than on the ground, he told Violet.
</P>
<P>
   Karen was born in 1942; Doug in 1944. When Doug was 3 days old,
Mack shipped out to the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Mack was the co-pilot of a B-24 nicknamed ``Cold Steel,'' which
did not return to base on March 5, 1944. The crew of 10 was first
declared missing and then presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 Violet married Lester Mertz, a friend of Mack's. Lester
died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In March, almost 55 years to the day since that first War
Department telegram came here, Violet was visiting Karen in
California. Doug had also gone west for the get-together.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone rang in Karen's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me if I was sitting down,'' said Karen, ``so I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The news was that the plane had been found in the
all-but-inaccessible interior of New Guinea. Among the wreckage
found on a mountainside were scattered bones and some dog tags. One
of the tags belonged to her father. Testing, through DNA, will take
another year, said Doug.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the remains can be separated, we'll bury him here,'' Doug
said. ``Mom bought a marker for him right after the war that's been
out in the cemetery all these years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not, they'll all be buried together, maybe in Arlington.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Doug looked north along Mill Street. The parade was
wrapping up. Still to come was the dedication of a new park, an
antique and stationary engine show, basketball, a pony pull, a
barbecue and a dance.
</P>
<P>
   The street was crowded. People were visiting each other,
smiling, having a good time. For a moment, Alton looked as it must
have 50 or 60 years ago, perhaps on the day Mack Sparks left for
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a real little kid, I remember, this town used to
fill up with people on Saturdays,'' said Doug. ``Just like today.''
</P>
<P>
   Alton used to be Bull City, named after its founder, Hiram C.
Bull, who put down roots here in 1870, then, unwisely, established
his own personal zoo. That decision proved fatal in 1879 when a
``pet'' elk gored him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was those were more genteel times, and a lot of
the town's ladies here thought Bull City was just a little racy,''
said Roach, a PRIDE Committee member. ``So in 1885 they changed the
name to Alton.''
</P>
<P>
   Bull City is beneath the word Alton on the sign out on U.S. 24.
The riding club, naturally, calls itself the Bull City Saddle Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name another town in Kansas,'' added Roach, ``that's had two
centennials. We had one in 1970, another in 1985. We're small, but
we think big. The tank, for instance.''

MANUFACTURERS TOUT LOWER-COST VERSION OF B-2 STEALTH BOMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE McGRAW  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Builders of the B-2 stealth bomber, which President
Clinton lauded for its performance in Kosovo, think they can
produce a lower-cost version of the $2 billion plane that some are
already calling ``B-2 Lite.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress, wary of the price tag for development and production
of the heavy long-range bomber, had earlier limited the fleet to
21, all of which will be based at Whiteman Air Force Base near Knob
Noster, Mo. Total cost so far has been $44.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Updated manufacturing methods and other savings could drive down
the price of each bomber to $500 million or less, defense industry
officials said last week. And some hope that could lead to
reopening the B-2 production line in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The newest version of the current B-2 Spirit stealth bomber is
referred to as the ``Block 30.'' The new lower-cost plane would be
referred to as a ``Block 50'' or B-2X. Some industry observers call
it ``B-2 Lite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking into it, but we have not yet begun a formal
study,'' said Jim Hart, a spokesman for the plane's manufacturer,
Northrop Grumman Corp. in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop said savings would result from enhanced and
computerized manufacturing methods. Some B-2 backers say builders
also would have to install lower-cost components, such as a cheaper
radar system, to achieve such significant savings.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force and Defense Department officials declined to comment
or did not respond to questions about whether a lower price would
prompt them to change their long-held perception that 21 B-2s were
enough. A recent Air Force study was based on assumptions that 184
bombers, including 21 B-2s, were sufficient to win ``two nearly
simultaneous major-theater wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ike Skelton, a Missouri Democrat who has spoken glowingly
of the plane and its performance in 30-hour Kosovo bombing missions
launched from Whiteman, was noncommittal about buying more planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see if we can afford it to begin with. Half a
billion dollars is a lot of money,'' Skelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton added that he was also a strong supporter of using
limited federal funds to build additional ``smart bombs,'' like
those dropped by the B-2 over Kosovo, only smaller. He said he also
was interested in reinstituting federal aid for the F-22 fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norman Dicks, a Washington state Democrat and longtime
backer of the B-2, ``would not in any way oppose'' more purchases
of the bomber, his spokesman said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The B-2 is partly made by Boeing Inc., based in Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks' spokesman, George Behan, said trying to buy more B-2s
would not be a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does have a chance,'' he said, ``especially with the Air
Force and the president saying how capable these planes really
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Loren Thompson, a longtime B-2 backer and defense industry
analyst: ``Norm Dicks is a tenacious advocate. If he wants money
for a study of more B-2s, he will get it, because no one will care
as much as he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are willing to say it or not, Thompson said, the
Air Force wants more B-2 bombers if it can get them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing is what they have to give up to get them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, however, anti-B-2 pressure in Congress is strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mere half-billion dollars for more B-2s?'' Winslow Wheeler,
senior defense analyst for the Senate Budget Committee, asked
mockingly. ``That remains a totally outrageous cost for any
airplane.''

KINGS START TRAINING CAMP TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For nearly three months Andy Murray has prepared
for this day, fine-tuning the highly organized theories that in
June convinced general manager Dave Taylor he was the right coach
to revive the moribund Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the start of training camp at the Iceoplex, the
theories _ and the players _ go onto the ice for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The regular season begins in 27 days in Nashville. It ends 31
weeks from today in Anaheim. And if Murray is successful, the Kings
will continue playing beyond that April 9 visit to the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are hoping to advance to the playoffs for just the
second time in seven years, and they are looking to win a playoff
game for the first time since taking a 1-0 series lead over
Montreal in the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's first training-camp move will be to start with three
days of practice, with no scrimmages scheduled until Wednesday
afternoon, when Team A (led by Ziggy Palffy and Luc Robitaille)
faces Team B (led by Donald Audette and Bryan Smolinski).
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes with a new coach, there's no time for him to put his
stamp on a team, and then you're into the exhibition games and
you're playing catch-up,'' said Murray, whose team begins
exhibition play Saturday against the Phoenix Coyotes at the MGM
Grand in Las Vegas. ``I want three solid practices before we
scrimmage to show them how hard we're going to work this year and
to give them a basis for tactical play.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a summer of change for the Kings, beginning with
Taylor's decision to replace Larry Robinson with Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said he plans to carry 22 players when the season begins
(13 forwards, seven defensemen and two goalies), and Taylor has
spent the summer signing new players who either are likely to make
the team, or who at least have a decent chance.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's signing this week of 22-year-old defenseman Aki Berg
completed a busy summer of acquisitions. The additions of Palffy
and Smolinski were the flashiest, but the Kings also sought to add
depth.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for this season, Taylor added defensemen Jere
Karalahti and Frantisek Kaberle, centers Jason Blake and Len
Barrie, and Finnish forward Marko Tuomainen, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti, Kaberle, Blake and Tuomainen have little or no NHL
experience, so it is unrealistic to expect all of them to have an
immediate impact, though any or all could make the opening-night
roster. The new players, however, definitely should increase the
competition for jobs at training camp, especially with a number of
returning Kings coming off extremely disappointing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some positions up for grabs,'' Murray said.
``We know right now certain guys are going to make the team. But
some guys could play themselves onto the team, and some could play
themselves off it. The biggest factor in the equation is that the
Kings weren't very good last year.''

YANKS BEAT ANGELS, 9-6  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ When Joe Torre arrived here early Saturday
morning, Bernie Williams already was in the trainer's room, shirt
off, his left shoulder under treatment, and Torre knew the news was
not going to be good.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was out of the starting lineup Saturday and may miss
more games on this road trip. Although Williams and Torre are
certain the Yankees' center fielder will play in the post-season,
his left shoulder _ his nonthrowing shoulder _ is gradually feeling
worse, weakening. ``This is just something I have to get through,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He contributed a pinch-hit single Saturday, in the midst of the
Yankees' ninth-inning rally. They blew a 6-3 lead over Anaheim in
the seventh inning, but Ricky Ledee smacked a two-run triple in the
ninth off the Angels' Troy Percival to break the tie. Williams
added a run-scoring single as the Yankees won, 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (83-52) reduced their number for clinching the
American League East to 19, and in that sense, this was just
another victory in their methodical journey through the regular
season. But when Don Zimmer, the Yankee bench coach, retires and
entertains friends with his megabyte memory, he will recall bizarre
episodes from Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led by three runs in the seventh inning; Hideki
Irabu was pitching effectively, finishing off hitters with the best
split-fingered fastball he had had in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There had been a strange moment in the first inning. With a
runner at first, catcher Jorge Posada returned a ball to Irabu
after Irabu had thrown a pitch and it went maybe a foot over
Irabu's head; it sailed into center field, and Darin Erstad took
second. ``I jumped for it, but I can only jump that high,'' said
Irabu, holding his forefinger and thumb about two inches apart.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu faded in the seventh, however, two walks quickly leading
to a pitching change and three game-tying runs. The rally was
capped by Mo Vaughn's two-run double off Mike Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had a chance to move ahead in the eighth when the
Angels' Jeff Huson singled off Allen Watson with one out and stole
second. Seeing Huson edging off second, Watson rapidly stepped off
the mound and turned to throw. He tried stopping when he thought
Chuck Knoblauch was not looking at him, but lofted the ball into
short center field, a soft throw to nobody. ``It was a screen
pass,'' Torre joked later. ``He had somebody in the flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Huson charged for third base while Ledee, playing center field
in Williams' absence, sprinted in to recover Watson's throw. He
heard the Edison Field crowd roaring and assumed that Larry Bowa,
Anaheim's third-base coach, was waving Huson home. He grabbed the
ball and instinctively hurled it homeward, without eyeing his
target.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting at the plate, Posada could see that Bowa was windmilling
his arm, and Huson, who represented the go-ahead run, was running
home. Ledee's throw bounced in front of home plate; Posada caught
and held the ball as Huson knocked him over. Out. Zimmer turned to
a fan behind the Yankees' dugout and said, ``We worked on that in
spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez walked to lead off the ninth against Juan Alvarez.
Chili Davis was waiting in the on-deck circle to pinch-hit for
Darryl Strawberry, but before Davis was officially inserted, Joe
Maddon, Anaheim's interim manager, called for Percival, a mistake
in timing. Strawberry batted instead and drew a walk, and Clay
Bellinger pinch-ran for Martinez at second. Nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Sheets, the Anaheim shortstop, then broke in behind
Bellinger on the pitch to cover second as part of the bunt defense.
Angels catcher Matt Walbeck burst from his crouch and threw to
second, and without hesitating, Bellinger sprinted for third and
was safe with a slide. If he had been thrown out, he admitted
later, Torre would have chewed him out.
</P>
<P>
   Posada popped out. Ledee was next, straining to see Percival's
dynamic fastball. In the shadows, he said later, it appeared as if
Percival was throwing 200 miles an hour. But Ledee fought back from
a two-strike count and ripped a triple off the right-field wall,
driving in two runs. Williams pinch-hit and singled through the
middle. ``Go figure,'' Williams said later, laughing at the
craziness of the game.
</P>
<P>
   He may play Monday. Or he may not. Williams, the switch-hitter
whose right-handed prowess has been the counterweight to the
left-handed batters in the middle of the Yankees' lineup, is
hurting _ the pain will wake him at night, he said _ and his
shoulder is affecting his hitting. ``It's definitely affecting my
swing,'' said Williams, before elaborating on how his approach at
the plate has been poor lately.
</P>
<P>
   Williams feels that in some ways the pain has forced him to
focus better at the plate. But the weakness in his shoulder is
evident in his production: Williams has just two doubles in his
last 27 games and just one home run in his last 20 games. He is
getting his hits, just not many extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who initially hurt his shoulder diving for a ball in
June, has been examined repeatedly and treated with
anti-inflammatory medication that has eased his pain. He will
probably be examined again in the off season, and he could undergo
surgery at that time, to explore possible rotator-cuff problems.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, he will try resting his shoulder and reducing
his batting practice, saving his swings for when they are needed.
Williams' .343 average ranks third in the league, and in the
context of the Yankees' deep and patient lineup, they do not
require home runs from him. They just need him to continue getting
on base, with singles and walks, if need be, through October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make it through,'' Torre said. ``It's just a matter of
how much he can endure.''

   NEW YORK _ There is a Bart Simpson doll hanging in the locker of
Edgardo Alfonzo, incongruous decoration for one of the most polite
men on the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Alfonzo has been a Bart-like pest to pitchers, who
seem to be, unwittingly, adorned with a ``Kick Me'' sign when
Alfonzo comes to the plate. Saturday night's victim was Colorado's
Brian Bohanon. Alfonzo drove him to distraction, launching a
two-run home run in the fifth inning that gave the steely and
superb Al Leiter a lead he would not relinquish in pitching eight
and two-thirds innings for the 4-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with Atlanta's loss to Arizona, the Mets picked up a
game in the National League East to trail the Braves by three and a
half games. The Mets remain four ahead of the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo's home run _ his 24th of the season _ gave the Mets a
3-2 lead in the fifth and Robin Ventura's 30th homer of the season
in the bottom of the eighth gave Leiter the comfort run he needed.
After Leiter allowed two two-out singles, the hard-throwing Armando
Benitez, pitching upwards of 94 miles an hour, struck out Terry
Shumpert on three pitches to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter and Bohanon were like two beginning dance students for
much of the night, holding the other at arm's length, tiptoeing
gently to avoid a pratfall. Leiter, at first, seemed more unsteady
on his feet. He gave up a single to the first batter he faced,
Neifi Perez, who later came around to score on Kurt Abbott's
single.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies had another opportunity to score in the third inning
when Bohanon hit a leadoff double. After getting the next two
batters to fly out, Abbott sent a grounder into shallow center
field. Charging to the ball, Shawon Dunston threw so hard to home
that he fell face first to the ground. But the ball made it to home
on one hop, and Mike Piazza grabbed it as he blocked home plate
with his left shin. The husky Bohanon came lumbering toward the
plate but Piazza's leg held and Leiter escaped.
</P>
<P>
   When he was on the mound, Bohanon seemed to be tap-dancing,
nibbling away at batters, using a fastball that was clocked at 85
miles an hour with one pitch only to follow it with a changeup at
65.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the first 10 batters he faced were retired on
groundouts, and he allowed only four hits in the first six innings.
But in the fourth inning, Bohanon slipped just slightly. He walked
Alfonzo to start the inning, then hit John Olerud just above the
right elbow. He threw a hanging first pitch up to Piazza, but
Piazza just missed hitting a home run and had to settle for a
warning-track out that sent Alfonzo to third. Ventura's first-pitch
single to right scored Alfonzo to tie the score at 1-1, but the
Mets, despite having only one out, could score no more in the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies then rallied after Leiter struck out the first two
batters in the fifth inning. Then Terry Shumpert stretched what
looked like a simple bloop into short left center into a double and
he came around to score when Vinny Castilla roped a single to left
to tie the score at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   In his last outing against Arizona, Leiter had struggled with
his control for the entire six and a third innings he lasted,
giving up seven hits and walking six while allowing six runs.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night Leiter allowed more hits _ there were nine by the
end of the seventh _ but there were just two walks and Leiter
seemed to get stronger as he went along, challenging the batters he
faced.
</P>
<P>
   He retired the side in the sixth and, after allowing a leadoff
single to Bohanon in the seventh, induced the next eight batters to
fly out or pop out. But with two out in the ninth, Leiter allowed a
pinch hit single to Larry Walker and another single to Neifi Perez.

SOUTHWEST DRIVERS HOPE TO STAY ON COURSE IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Greg Pursley sat on the pole for the NASCAR
Featherlite Southwest Series race in last year's Ford L.A. Street
Race, but that accomplishment is now little more than a happy
memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course is entirely different,'' Pursley said Saturday.
``The fact that I won the pole last year was pretty cool, but it
really isn't going to help me at all this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two drivers will have to contend with the new course in
Monday's race, the featured event in the three-day L.A. Street Race
at Exposition Park. Saturday was practice day for drivers in the
three other divisions, the American IndyCars, the Ultra Wheel SPEC
trucks and the PRO racing series, and most Southwest Series drivers
won't get their first look at the track until this morning's
practice and 1:15 p.m. qualifying runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That course is really tight,'' said Pursley, who tested in a
SPEC truck Saturday to get a feel for the course. ``Passing is
going to be really difficult, and you're just going to have to pick
your spots. I'm just going to try to drive smart and stay out of
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The new course features two hairpin turns just before the
start-finish line to the south of the Sports Arena. The 1-mile
track has eight turns total, leaving drivers few opportunities to
get up to speed before making passing attempts in the straightaways
during the 125-lap race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's track had a lot more straightaways, so I'm sure
the speeds will be a lot slower this year,'' said Nick Joanides of
Woodland Hills, one of the top candidates for Rookie of the Year on
the Southwest Series. ``But since it's a brand new track, everybody
will be on equal ground. Nobody will have an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes Pursley, who led part of the race last season but
crashed late, giving the victory to Steve Portenga. Pursley says
patience on the track will be most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track is very green, very slick, because it doesn't have
any rubber down on it now. But it will once cars practice more and
run more laps,'' Pursley said. ``Winning the pole is going to be
big, because if you get out ahead and run good, it's going to be
hard for anybody to get past you.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no clear-cut favorite to win today's pole or Monday's
race. The series' 12 races this season have been won by 11
different drivers. The points leader, Kurt Busch, is the only
driver to win twice this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great series, very competitive,'' Joanides said.
``Out of the 20 drivers who are out here regularly, 15 of them
always have a shot at winning.''

MU GRINDS OUT VICTORY OVER UAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE DeARMOND  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ When all the
laughter threatened to turn to sorrow, Missouri did what Missouri
has done best since rediscovering the game of winning football. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Just shoving it down their throats,'' said quarterback Kirk
Farmer, who capped an 80-yard, 12-play drive that featured 10
rushes by tailback DeVaughn Black with a 12-yard scoring pass to
fullback Joe Chirumbolo with 2 minutes, 12 seconds to play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Alabama-Birmingham roared back, going 80 yards in two
shots to the gut of Missouri's defense. But that late touchdown,
with 98 seconds to play, only made it close. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri won its 1999 season opener 31-28 on Saturday because
the Tigers _ who threw a little, played a little defense, blocked a
punt for a touchdown and saw two of its own punts blocked for
touchdowns _ ran and ran and ran some more when it counted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Up just 24-21 with 7:57 to play, Missouri set up shop at its 20.
Ten times Farmer turned and put the ball in the gut of his
tailback. And in those 10 carries Black gained 69 of his 140
rushing yards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the ninth straight run by Black, a 4-yard dive play that
gave MU a first down at the UAB 16, the Blazers called a timeout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie,'' Black said, grateful for the brief
rest. ``I was tired.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next play, Black ripped off left tackle for 7 more yards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Farmer was dumped for a 3-yard loss trying to get out on the
option on the next play, leaving Missouri with a third and 6 from
the UAB 12. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Farmer _ a redshirt freshman who played the
entire second half because of starter Jim Dougherty's dinged-up
knee _ rolled left and hit Chirumbolo, a freshman fullback, with
the first TD reception of Chirumbolo's career. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Missouri's defense let down at that point. UAB running
back Percy Coleman took the first handoff from scrimmage after the
MU kickoff and roared 69 yards on a draw play from his 20 to the MU
11. On the next play, tailback Carl Fair ripped through three
would-be tackles and into the end zone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That pulled UAB within the final score. But the Blazer's onside
kick then sailed out of bounds at the UAB 44. And quite naturally,
MU killed the clock on two more runs for a combined 20 yards by
Black and two kneel downs by Farmer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Black, playing in the shadow of All-American Devin West a year
ago, rushed for just 115 yards all last season. But center Rob
Riti, who once blocked for Black at Hazelwood West High, didn't see
Black's big game as the emergence of an unknown quantity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Missouri football,'' Riti said of an offensive strategy
that produced 245 yards in 56 rushes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done that a dozen times since I've been here. You need
to do it in key moments in certain games.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the path MU followed to victory last December in the
Insight.com Bowl, when West gained 46 yards on a critical late-game
drive that put away West Virginia in a 34-31 MU triumph. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That was certainly a key, critical moment,'' Riti said of the
Black-driven drive on Saturday in front of 50,356 at Faurot Field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive line and wide receivers and tight ends had to
block. The quarterback had to hand the ball off. And the running
back had to run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a system here. It's not like the tailbacks are
dramatically different personalities from year to year. They're all
coached to be north and south runners, to be powerful runners. And
I think that's what we had here today.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't pretty, certainly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brad Hammerich's 40-yard field goal and Justin Smith's punt
block and John McPherson's 9-yard return put Missouri up 10-0
midway through the first quarter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But UAB's Chris Brown returned the favor with a 16-yard scoring
return off a block of a Jared Gilpin punt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farmer hit Dwayne Blakley with a 4-yard scoring pass, putting MU
up 17-7. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Coleman answered with a 15-yard run that capped an 11-play,
73-yard drive in which UAB used screen passes and draw plays to
take advantage of MU's defensive aggressiveness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zain Gilmore made it 24-14 with a 1-yard plunge. But Adrian
Abrams returned the second UAB punt block 18 yards, pulling UAB
within 24-21. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys think you get 10 points ahead and the other guy is
going to fold,'' MU coach Larry Smith said. ``They didn't.'' &QL;

<P>
   Ed Dougherty leads the TD Waterhouse Championship, but nothing
more than a smattering of spectators stayed around to see him
finish Saturday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two inches of rain, accompanied by lightning, soaked Tiffany
Greens Golf Club, causing a delay that lasted 4 hours, 3 minutes.
The majority of the announced crowd of 31,271 was long gone by the
time Dougherty completed his round. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty shot 6-under-par 30 on the front side on his way to a
6-under 66 and a two-round total of 12-under 132. He led Gil Morgan
and Allen Doyle by 1 stroke entering today's final round. Forty-two
players broke par Saturday. That's two fewer than in the first
round. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's the good news for those who held on to their ticket stubs
and want to see the final 18: They can bring them back today and
enter for free. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to the severity of the storms and the parking problems we
had getting people out of the lot, we'll make this exception,''
said tournament director Jerald Andrews, who also noted refunds
won't be given. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several vehicles got stuck as they tried to exit the grass
fields that are being used for parking. Even one of the wreckers
that was brought in to pull cars out of the mess got stuck. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The entire ESPN telecast was canceled because the delay began 18
minutes before the cable network was scheduled to begin its 90
minutes of coverage. That was a downer for TD Waterhouse executive
vice president Randy Miller. TD Waterhouse is making its first
major pitch nationally to a sports audience, and losing an entire
telecast hurt its momentum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate,'' Miller said, ``but that's the chance you
take with an outdoor event. All in all, though, this has helped our
name. We're delighted. We just hope it doesn't rain (today).'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unless you were one of the brave few who endured the delay,
here's what you missed: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Morgan eagled the par-5 11th and moved to just 1 stroke behind
Dougherty when play was interrupted. But Morgan bogeyed No. 13. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Graham Marsh was within 4 strokes of Dougherty until he
triple-bogeyed the par-3 15th. That was his first hole after the
delay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it in the water,'' said Marsh, whose only PGA Tour
victory came in 1977 when he edged Tom Watson by 1 stroke at the
Heritage Classic. ``You try to stay loose physically during a
delay, and a lot of guys got a massage, and I got that. Sometimes
the delay hurts you, like it did to me today.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Mahaffey eagled the par-4 18th from 182 yards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a 4-iron as high as I could. It hit right in front of
the pin and rolled in,'' said Mahaffey, who shot 72 and was at
4-under 140. ``I had to hit it high to make it land soft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of going south. This brings things into a little
better perspective.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was on No. 11 when the delay hit. He played the
remainder of the round 1-over and sounded thrilled to get done
without any more damage. He bogeyed No. 18 after he popped up his
tee shot, then hit his second shot from 220 yards into a
collection-area pin high left of the green. He had to take a drop
and eventually missed an 8-footer for par. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard seeing the ball. I have a hard time with depth
perception,'' Dougherty said. ``I wish the rain had never come
because I was on a roll.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Dougherty birdied Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6. On the 210-yard,
par-3 No. 6, he hit a 6-iron shot to 20 feet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty, who made his senior tour debut here a year ago, has
fond memories of Kansas City because of that. But he's not
completely happy with the city. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mad at the Chiefs because Rich Gannon is my cousin,''
Dougherty said, referring to the former Chiefs quarterback now with
Oakland. ``So I'm not a Chiefs fan anymore.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty likes the spot he's in starting today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be where I'm at,'' he said. ``Let it rain. I just
want to play good golf.'' &QL;

VOTE EARLY AND OFTEN FOR BRETT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POSNANSKI  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ OK, folks, we've all worked too hard to let
this happen. Let's face it, we've named half the town after George
Brett. George Brett Bridge. George Brett Highway. George Brett
International Airport. Bonner George. Excelsior Brett. On Thursday,
I went to a local Brettbuster to rent a movie, passing Westgeorge,
the Pine Tar Liberty Memorial, and The Number Five Plaza. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, all summer long, we've gone way overboard for George _ even
George is sick of himself _ and yet now we're all about to sit
back, relax and let Brooks Robinson get named to the major-league
baseball All-Century Team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yep, they are taking two third basemen to the team. Mike
Schimidt is a lock. And right now, Robinson leads Brett by more
than 50,000 votes for second place. The deadline approaches. This
is ridiculous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's not a knock on Brooks Robinson. He was a great player. A
brilliant defensive third baseman. A clutch hitter. A class act. I
would have voted him first ballot into the Hall of Fame. I wish the
guy was my uncle. I might name my first son after him. But I'm
going to tell you right now there is no way on George Toma's green
earth that Brooks Robinson was a better third baseman than George
Brett. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These All-Century teams are ridiculous, of course. There's no
reasonable way to judge whether Greg Maddux is better than Carl
Hubbell, no legitimate way to tell if Wee Willie Keeler was a
better hitter than Not So Wee Tony Gwynn or if Three Finger Brown
would be able to strike out Luis Aparicio. Times change, people
change, the game changes. In the end, the whole thing is a lot like
arguing who is stronger, Superman or Tarzan (by the way, Superman
is stronger). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this Brett-Robinson thing is easy to figure out. They
played, more or less, in the same era. They played about the same
number of games _ Robinson played 189 more games than Brett, a
little more than one full season. They both played for winning
teams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And it's no contest. Robinson was a better defensive third
baseman than Brett, we'll give you that. The guy won 16 Gold
Gloves. Robinson had the knack of playing his best defense when the
cameras were on _ everyone remembers that he was sensational in the
1970 World Series _ but day-in, day-out, he was tough, dependable,
he charged bunts well and he often made great plays. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fine. You can have that. Truth is, though, Brett was a pretty
good defensive third baseman himself. His arm was erratic,
especially in his early years, but he also made more than his share
of great plays. And, as former Royals pitcher Al Fitzmorris said:
``He got to more balls than almost anyone else in the league,
including Brooks Robinson, because, you've got to remember, George
was an athlete.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hitting is no contest. Period. Brett has many, many more hits,
runs, doubles, triples, homers, RBIs and walks than Robinson. His
batting average is 38 points higher. His slugging percentage is 86
points higher. Hey, pay attention, this took actual research. He
struck out less, stole 173 more bases, and over his career hit
better in the clutch. Robinson had that glorious 1970 World Series
where he hit .429 and slugged two home runs, but Brett pounded the
ball in the postseason every year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   See, this is the dirty little secret of Brooks Robinson; he
really wasn't much of a hitter. Offensively, Gary Gaetti was
better. Ken Boyer. Ron Cey. Tim Wallach. Robinson had one fine
year, 1964, where he hit .317 with 28 homers, 118 RBI and won the
Most Valuable Player award. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, his average year was: .264, 13 homers, 69 RBI. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would somebody please take this calculator away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The point is, there's no way he should be knocking George Brett
off the All-Century Team. Not a chance. And yet, there he is on
top, thanks to those loyal, intense, Camden-Yards loving,
crabcake-eating, ``Diner''-watching, Art-Modell-sheltering
Baltimore fans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Something has to be done. Go to the ballpark and vote. If not,
go on the Internet (www.majorleaguebaseball.com). This is an
emergency, people. If Brett doesn't make the team, we'll have to
name more stuff after him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your neighborhood might be next. &QL;

BROWN HAS SHOT AT 20 WITH SIX STARTS LEFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Kevin Brown would have preferred to win his 20th game
during a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   But with six starts remaining he could reach 20 anyway,
especially after Brown limited the Chicago Cubs to two Jeff Reed
singles in Saturday's 6-0 Los Angeles Dodgers victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't have much meaning,'' said Brown, who now has
won seven straight decisions. ``It is much better when doing
something like that gets you to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who last won 20 in 1992 with Texas, has been to the
Series the past two seasons, with Florida and San Diego. But he
seldom has pitched better than this.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first shutout with the Dodgers and it came after
taking one into the ninth inning in his last start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today he threw strikes on the first pitch,'' pitching coach
Claude Osteen said. ``That forces hitters to become more aggressive
and swing at pitches out of the strike zone. Earlier this year it
seemed like every batter was a 2-2 count. That hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, in the first year of a seven-year, $105 million contract,
was flopped in the rotation Saturday to give him a better chance of
reaching 20. Some think it is a publicity stunt to make the
disappointing Dodgers look good after making a huge free-agent
signing.
</P>
<P>
   By flopping him from today's start, Brown will be able to pitch
every fifth day with his final start on the last day of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Happens every year: Before the game, manager Davey Johnson met
with outfielder Devon White and later with the club to discuss
White's remarks that there is a communication problem between
players and the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who met with the players for 15 minutes, said he was
surprised that White, critical about his lack of playing time
during a 6-for-56 slump, would pop off.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added that the frustration of a disappointing season is
bound to bubble over at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had four managers since I've been here,'' Eric Karros
said. ``It is the job of the player to learn the manager's style.
That is the way it's always going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy hitters: With his fourth-inning homer, Karros reached 30
for the fourth time in his career. That tied him for third with Roy
Campanella and Mike Piazza on the all-time Dodgers list. Duke
Snider and Gil Hodges each did it six times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can control your preparation and the way you react to
things,'' said Karros, who now has 94 RBI. ``You can't control the
results. I prepare myself and if I'm healthy I've proven I can be
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: White had two singles and a run Saturday.... An MRI
on Carlos Perez's right shin showed only a contusion. It is
uncertain when Perez, who was struck by a line drive at Triple-A
Albuqerque, will pitch again.... After hitting homers in the first
two games, Sammy Sosa went 0 for 3.

FUGITIVE FINANCIER CAPTURED IN GERMANY AFTER LONG HUNT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for new top; new details, rewriting throughout)   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Martin R. Frankel, the Connecticut money manager suspected of
defrauding insurance companies of hundreds of millions of dollars
before fleeing overseas, was captured in his hotel room in Germany
Saturday, federal law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   German police officers accompanied by an agent of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation entered Frankel's room at the Hotel Prem in
Hamburg and seized the fugitive financier and a female companion,
exactly four months after he fled his Connecticut mansion. They
also found a computer, documents and an undetermined quantity of
diamonds and cash, Michael J. Wolf, an FBI special agent, said
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got me,'' Frankel said when they entered the room,
according to Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Suspected of siphoning as much as $350 million from Southern
insurance companies, Frankel was charged with money laundering and
wire fraud. He is in custody in Germany awaiting extradition to the
United States, a process that could take several months even if
Frankel does not fight to avoid repatriation, Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   The German authorities also took into custody Cynthia Allison, a
35-year-old American citizen using the alias Susan Kelly. Friends
and associates of the suspect have said that Ms. Allison, who
worked as an office assistant for Frankel, flew to Italy to join
him on the run in late June. She has been detained for questioning
but has not been charged with any crime, Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   The capture ended what the FBI acknowledges was a long and at
times frustrating manhunt for Frankel, whose brazen and at times
bizarre activities captured headlines in the United States for
several months. In exile, Frankel, whom associates traveling with
him described as having no evident talent for international
intrigue, lived in apartments and hotels arranged by contacts in
Rome. He was accompanied by several female companions and at times
seemed to live large, dining in outdoor cafes and phoning friends
and business partners in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, just as the FBI felt it had come close to
tracking his whereabouts in Italy, Frankel disappeared. The law
enforcement agency followed numerous tips that put Frankel in
France and Brazil as well as Germany, but Wolf said Saturday that
the trail went cold for many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators' luck changed Saturday. Acting on a tip, the
authorities tracked him to Hamburg. A team of local and federal
German police officers found Frankel in his hotel room shortly
before 9 p.m. German time.
</P>
<P>
   Though the last tip proved good, the search was hampered by a
stream of misinformation, said Wolf, who spoke at a news conference
Saturday night in New Haven, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We responded to various tips, and a lot of them were
fruitless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI agent also lamented limited help from international law
enforcement authorities, though he praised German officials for
their efforts Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the trail went cold, and without the cooperation of other
law enforcement agencies, it's very difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's lawyer, Hugh F. Keefe, was unaware that his client had
been apprehended when he was reached for comment Saturday evening.
The Connecticut-based lawyer added that he had spoken to a federal
prosecutor in the case as recently as Saturday morning. ``He asked
me if Frankel was still alive,'' Keefe said. ``I have a feeling he
knew more than he was letting on.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have described the case as one of America's
largest and most bizarre incidents of insurance fraud.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For eight years, Frankel lived a sybaritic life on the money he
claimed to be managing for a string of Southern insurance
companies, federal law enforcement officials and prosecutors
charged.
</P>
<P>
   His operation grew to depend on scores of other people,
including prominent lawyers, insurance industry executives, private
detectives, a coterie of women, and priests with ties to the
Vatican, all of whom say that they were innocent dupes of a man
that they thought was a brilliant speculator in stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   If official accounts are accurate, Frankel, 44, also had
remarkable success in fooling state insurance regulators. His
strategy was to buy small, troubled insurance companies through
intermediaries, then manage the sometimes considerable investment
assets those companies held against future policy claims.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Frankel claimed to be earning returns that were well
above industry norms, but he was not exposed as a fraud until after
he fled the country, leaving behind smoldering documents in one of
his several houses in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Toledo, Ohio, Frankel first ran afoul of financial
regulators in the early 1990s, when a small investment fund he ran
generated steep losses for retirees who entrusted their savings to
Frankel. After an investigation, the Securities and Exchange
Commission reached an out-of-court settlement with him in early
1992. He agreed to a lifetime ban from the securities business.
</P>
<P>
   Even before that agreement was final, however, Frankel had begun
a new operation in Tennessee. Using the names of several friends
and acquaintances in Ohio, Frankel set up a Tennessee trust and
began buying insurance companies, first in Tennessee and later in
Mississippi, Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   He also moved his base of operations to Greenwich. He rented and
later bought a multimillion-dollar, four-acre estate on Lake
Avenue, surrounding the area with elaborate security. He later
rented other upscale homes in the area, using one as his office and
another to house some of the women he recruited through the
Internet and help-wanted ads as personal assistants and full-time
companions.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1998, Frankel began to fear that insurance regulators
would sooner or later catch on, he told friends and associates. It
was then that he apparently decided to rapidly expand his insurance
holdings in hope of growing big enough and involving enough
well-known people that the authorities would consider his business
unassailable.
</P>
<P>
   He hired many insurance consultants and retained several
prominent law firms, including Robert Strauss and his well-known
firm, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld. Frankel persuaded a
high-level retired priest at the Vatican to back a charity that
Frankel used as a holding company for his insurance assets.
</P>
<P>
   The gangly and unkempt Frankel persuaded people that he was a
genius in stock picking. He had walls of computers and trading
equipment installed in his home, though associates say he rarely
executed trades.
</P>
<P>
   By spring of this year, insurance regulators were asking pointed
questions. By late April, Frankel prepared to flee the country.
Like his operation, his flight to safety abroad was highly
disorganized. A last-minute purchase of diamonds turned into a
fiasco when Frankel decided to leave early and security officers
fought over control of some diamonds that remained behind.
</P>
<P>
   While he eluded a dragnet, the authorities were gradually
confiscating assets he stashed in numerous bank accounts, forcing
him to live on valuables and cash that he carried on his person.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we were limiting assets in various accounts and following
leads, I think that we expected sooner or later that he would be
apprehended,'' Wolf said.

MICHIGAN MAKES BIG STOP AT THE BIG HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ Tommy Hendricks gets asked about it when he
returns home to Houston. People want to know how it feels to play
for Michigan against Notre Dame in Michigan Stadium, with an
NCAA-record crowd of 111,523 making The Big House a crowded house.
``It's hard to put into words,'' said Hendricks, a senior safety
who had a team-high 10 tackles and an interception for the
Wolverines. ``It's a game that you put all your emotion and effort
into. It's one of the biggest rivalries in college football. We
both left it all out there on the field.'' It's hard to describe it
even when you make the big tackle that seals the victory. Hendricks
stuffed Notre Dame receiver Raki Nelson a yard short of a
game-extending first down that sealed No. 7 Michigan's 26-22
victory against the 16th-ranked Fighting Irish. This is a
blue-blooded rivalry. Michigan has the most Division I-A victories;
Notre Dame is tops in best winning percentage. Even though most of
America might hate both teams equally, this is a game the nation
watches. It's rarely disappointing. Seven of the past 10 games have
been decided by five or fewer points. Three of the past four games
have been decided in the final two minutes. Not that it was
necessary, but the pregame fires were stoked by Michigan coach
Lloyd Carr. He was angry that Notre Dame scheduled Kansas in the
Eddie Robinson Classic last week. That, Carr said, gave the Irish
the advantage of five to six more days of practice. ``You want to
call me a whiner, good,'' Carr said. ``Call me anything you want.''
But it was Notre Dame that played like it was opening the season.
The Irish lost three fumbles and committed 10 penalties for 81
yards. A celebration penalty on Notre Dame's Bobby Brown after a
two-point conversion that put the Irish ahead 22-19 gave Michigan
good field position. And a late-hit penalty on the Wolverines'
second play moved the ball to the Notre Dame 28. ``We didn't play
smart,'' Notre Dame coach Bob Davie said.''You don't come up here
and beat Michigan with silly mistakes.'' Michigan's Anthony Thomas
scored on a 1-yard touchdown run with 1:38 remaining for the
winning points. The 225-pound Thomas ran through 233-pound Anthony
Denman to nudge the ball over the goal line. Thomas, who carried a
career-high 32 times, did not meet with the media. He was in the
training room with an IV stuck in his arm. ``That game took its
toll on a lot of guys,'' Carr said. ``That's the hardest-hitting
game I've ever been involved in.'' Notre Dame quarterback Jarious
Jackson, who passed for 302 yards, tried to pull a Joe Montana. The
Irish drive ended with his pass to Nelson, who gained 19 of the 20
yards needed for a first down that would have stopped the clock and
let Notre Dame try one more play. ``The most disappointing thing is
seeing the clock wind down, knowing we were about to score,'' said
Jackson, who was 18-of-29 and was sacked four times. Michigan,
which started defense of its 1997 national championship with a
half-hearted second-half effort in a 36-20 loss to the Irish last
year, had a sweet season-opening victory. The Wolverines defenders
wanted the chance to win the game. ``We kept 'em out. That's all
that matters. It's real emotional, man,'' Hendricks said, minutes
after his hit had won the game. ``I knew it would come down to the
last play. It always does.'' Notre Dame's Brown, a senior whose
bunny ears celebation signal had turned into goat horns, was
face-down flat on the ground. Michigan's Grady Brooks and DeWayne
Patmon were prostrate. Hendricks was on his knees, sobbing. Just a
glance at the postgame carnage and you wondered who had won.
Michigan linebacker Dhani Jones celebrated the game by screaming
and jumping like a little kid and screaming like a baby _ his
words. ``I was just letting my body vent its emotions,'' Jones
said. ``You had to interpret what I was feeling by looking at me.
But that's what the feeling is like, like being on the playground.
Today's game was like a soap opera, big plays, back and forth,
mistakes. ``This is a game you're going to tell everybody about
when you're old and gray and slow. There are some things in life
where the only way you'll feel the entire emotion of it is to be
involved in it.''
\Nsubheds:Extra points The announced attendance of 111,523 at
Michigan Stadium broke the NCAA single-game record of 111,238 set
at last year's Michigan State-Michigan game. ... These teams take a
break in their series for two years; they'll play again in 2002.
Notre Dame opens with Texas A&AMP;M and Nebraska in South Bend next
season. ... Michigan running back Anthony Thompson finished with
142 yards; Michigan rushed for 124. In his last three games, he has
nine touchdowns. ... Notre Dame's first touchdown was scored by
junior flanker Joey Getherall on a reverse. It was his first points
for the Irish. ... Michigan's Jeff Del Verne, a former walk-on,
converted four of five field-goal attempts. ... Michigan had eight
drives that penetrated the Notre Dame 35, but only converted two
drives into touchdowns. ... Sophomore David Terrell, who committed
to Notre Dame before signing with Michigan, led the Wolverines with
eight receptions for 115 yards. ... Notre Dame has lost its first
road game each of its three seasons under coach Bob Davie.

STARS HAVE MADE CHANGES, BUT ARE THEY GOOD ONES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ignore the sobs. It's just Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff, still
shedding tears.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that persistent whine, please observe a moment of
silence in honor of Pat Verbeek and Dave Reid and Craig Ludwig. Win
a war, lose some good soldiers. Life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Starting today, a short and sweet off-season ends for the Dallas
Stars. The summer-long kissing of Stanley Cup silver gives way to
the first training camp practice in Vail, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like only last week when Brett Hull stuck both a toe in
the crease and the puck past ... .
</P>
<P>
   Well, you know all about the endless local celebration. And the
river of tears from the Buffalosers.
</P>
<P>
   But with this ultimate NHL success, what came next for the Stars
was change. And because change followed success, that leads to
questions for this new season.
</P>
<P>
   Did general manager Bob Gainey tinker too much? Or did owner Tom
Hicks go totally out of character and suggest budget trimming to
his GM?
</P>
<P>
   On the team depth-chart, the Stars will be only somewhat
different from the championship class. It is a younger, faster and,
yes, financially-cheaper club that coach Ken Hitchcock calls to
order today in Vail.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen on the ice is one thing. But without the
veteran locker-room presence of a Verbeek, a Reid, and particularly
a Ludwig, how are the tough and turbulent times dealt with
internally?
</P>
<P>
   Gainey doesn't claim to have definite answers. ``Any of those
players who are no longer with us, there will come a time this
season when all of us will be talking about how we miss them,'' he
said Friday, preparing to depart for Vail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a risk or gamble in the decisions we made,''
Gainey added, ``then the reward has to be in keeping the nucleus of
a championship caliber team together for a long period of time. In
the league's financial climate, that is the challenge for
management. You've got to beat the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey noted that Hicks didn't stress with him the necessity for
budget cuts, ``although costs were obviously discussed,'' he said.
Plus, it's not like the Stars will be dealing with a reduced
payroll for 1999-2000. The $3 million of Verbeek salary, for
instance, will be absorbed in contractual raises due other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the issues Bob faced in putting the team together were
budgetary,'' said Hicks. ``But it was also his desire to go with
fresh blood _ that means a cheaper player, of course. But it does
keep the resources flowing for the bigger stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the off-season moves, the one most haunting to the Stars
_ both now and for an expected eternity _ is the giveaway of backup
goalie Roman Turek. The St. Louis Blues stole Turek for a
third-round draft pick because the Stars were caught in an
expansion-draft deadline 24 hours after the Stanley Cup Finals had
ended. Worst still, the Blues are in the same conference.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Gainey carefully charted his off-season course, and
stuck to it. Asked Friday what would happen if the still-unsigned
Verbeek would agree to a $1 million Stars' contract for this
season, Gainey had a ready answer. ``We would go ahead with the
plans that were put in place, and the decisions that were made,''
he said. In other words, no deal.
</P>
<P>
   Compare Gainey's approach, however, with the
season-after-a-championship-season strategy of Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones. Hindsight now has Jones being criticized heavily for
sticking too long with his veteran cast. The Cowboys had a true
dynasty going in the NFL, but when the end came, and high-priced
veterans were liabilities, the thud was loud.
</P>
<P>
   One Stanley Cup doesn't make the Stars an NHL dynasty, but it's
a team that has had the league's best regular-season record two
consecutive seasons, and the second-best record three seasons ago.
It could be a dynasty in the making.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thought is that younger guys trying to elbow their way into
the mix, along with the increased speed factor, enhances our
team,'' said Gainey. ``How it all works out, remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Reaugh was once an Edmonton prospect, although he's more
famous now as a Stars broadcaster than his days of backup
goaltending with the Oilers. This was a franchise, however, that
was winning four Stanley Cups in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Edmonton theory was no matter what, change out 15 percent
of the team for each season,'' said Reaugh. ``And that was an era
when it was very easy to keep a team together forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Change has come to the Stars. With change comes questions. But
first comes training camp, starting today in Vail.

BROWN, KARROS LIFT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Does playing well when you're playing out the string
do more harm than good?
</P>
<P>
   For the Los Angeles Dodgers, it's a question that goes well
beyond Kevin Brown, who pitched a brilliant two-hit, 6-0 shutout
against the Chicago Cubs on Saturday in front of 39,048 at Wrigley
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is having a Brown-like season, winning his seventh
straight and 16th overall. He has six more starts to reach 20.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't about Eric Karros, whose fourth-inning home run
marked the fourth time in his career he has reached 30 in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Those guys always seem to hit their marks.
</P>
<P>
   It's others, such as Todd Hundley and Mark Grudzielanek, who
have played better in the second half of a lost season. Both hit
home runs Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers have now won 11 of 15, momentum remains
elusive. Five times in the second half they have won the first two
games of a series and lost the finale.
</P>
<P>
   This season is now about evaluating players for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Dodgers were mesmerized by Carlos Perez's four
straight complete games in September.
</P>
<P>
   Perez hasn't pitched well since signing a four-year,
$15.5million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Both Grudzielanek and Hundley figure to be part of the Dodgers
next season. Karros, who may or may not be, said the two are part
of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are playing the way they are capable, not some
two-week thing,'' Karros said. ``People talk a lot about breaking
up this team in the winter. I think the best thing that could
happen is keep most of it intact. You don't want to go through that
transition again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley homered for a second straight day and now has 21 this
season. His average is just .223 and he still has trouble throwing
out runners behind the plate. But it was not a problem Saturday,
since Brown allowed just two singles _ both by catcher Jeff Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who raised his average to .321 with three more
hits, is convincing manager Davey Johnson that he might be a
capable No.2 hitter in an offense that has stumbled at the top of
the order.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek has hit safely in 11 straight games (.449, 22 for
49) and 21 of his past 22 (.371, 36 for 97). It is no coincidence
that No.3 Gary Sheffield has 22 RBI in his last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I feel I've been capable of all along,'' said
Grudzielanek, the former Expo who had 201 hits in 1994 and 54
doubles the next year. ``I think these games are important because
they can answer questions. How you perform when things aren't going
well can be harder than the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek also has committed just nine errors at short after
making 92 in his previous three seasons. But it's his improved
offense that will earn him a sizeable raise from this year's
$1.9million salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has such great hand-eye coordination,'' Johnson said. ``He
might never be as patient as you'd like, but right now he is as hot
as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Hundley, who always has hit well in Wrigley Field. His
home run off Kyle Farnsworth (3-8), who defeated the Dodgers last
Sunday, was his 10th in his adopted home. His father Randy played
10 years with the Cubs and is now a part-time broadcaster with the
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been an easy season by any means,'' said Hundley,
who is still recovering from reconstructive elbow surgery that was
performed two years ago. ``But I think we are building something
here for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Others agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at what he has done and he has only played half a
season,'' said Raul Mondesi, who also hit a home run. ``He is
getting better every day.''

ANGELS' BIG RALLY FALLS FLAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Even when things go well for the Anaheim
Angels, eventually they start to go bad.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels rallied from a 5-0 deficit against the New York
Yankees, tying the game at 6 on Mo Vaughn's two-run double in the
seventh inning. But Ricky Ledee's two-run triple in the ninth off
Troy Percival broke the tie and sent the Angels to a 9-6 loss
before 30,589 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Percival began this season having never given up an earned run
to the Yankees in 181/3 innings. That streak ended earlier this
season when he gave up one run, but still he had four saves in four
appearances this year and a lifetime ERA of 0.40 (one run in 221/3
innings) against New York going into Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   But in a season such as this for the Angels, that trend was
bound to change. Percival was charged with two of the Yankees'
three ninth-inning runs. Juan Alvarez (0-1), who began the ninth by
walking Tino Martinez, got the loss.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter which team Percival is facing these days,
though. In his previous nine appearances, he was 1-2 with an 11.05
ERA, one save and four blown saves.

   His problems came to a head last week in Cleveland when the
Angels blew an eight-run lead to the Indians, and Percival was on
the mound for seven of the 10 runs the Indians scored in their
eight-inning comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really struggling with the ball running on me,'' he said.
``I try to throw the ball in and it comes back over the plate.... I
try to throw the ball down and away and it goes up and in. I'm four
feet off on some occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I have to fight through. Everybody comes to a
point in their career when you have problems, and you can either
fight or give in. I'm going to fight through it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game had twists and turns before Percival lost it. The
Angels trailed 5-0 in the second but battled back. Down 6-3 in the
seventh, Tim Salmon drove in one run with a single and Vaughn's
double scored two more to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Jeff Huson walked and stole second with one out.
And when Yankees reliever Alan Watson's pickoff attempt sailed into
center field, Huson headed to third. Third-base coach Larry Bowa
waved Huson home, but Ledee's throw from center nailed him at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Angels catcher Matt Walbeck had Yankees
pinch-runner Clayton Bellinger picked off second base. But
Bellinger was caught so far off the bag after a missed bunt attempt
that he broke for third and made it.
</P>
<P>
   Percival walked Darryl Strawberry, struck out Jorge Posada and
yielded Ledee's two-run triple. Bernie Williams followed with an
RBI single to make it 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our guy, he's our man,'' Angels interim manager Joe
Maddon said. ``Everyone in this game struggles at some point
regardless if you're a hitter or pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Ramon Ortiz struggled in his fourth start, going
only four innings and giving up six runs and six hits. But Ortiz
said his problems Saturday had nothing to do with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it was the Yankees, the only thing that hurt me
was my location of pitches,'' Ortiz said. ``The Yankees are the
Yankees but I didn't pitch the way I usually pitch.''

 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt _ Surrounded by a panoply of Middle East
leaders and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Prime Minister
Ehud Barak of Israeli and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
signed a broad agreement early on Sunday that the Clinton
administration hopes will quickly usher in a new era of peace
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, held in a beach hotel aired by cool breezes from
the nearby Red Sea, represented an early victory for the apparently
growing trust between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and
crowned a busy day of diplomacy for Albright.
</P>
<P>
   On a closely watched trip on Saturday to Damascus to meet
President Hafez Assad of Syria, Albright won no immediate signal
that Israeli-Syrian peace talks can open soon. But an
administration official said the meeting nonetheless laid what he
termed an encouraging basis for future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Albright then became the first secretary of state in 16 years to
land in Beirut, Lebanon, on an official American government plane,
and held talks with Lebanese leaders on a previously unannounced
stop. Her aides said the negotiations were intended to underline
the administration's desire to include Lebanon in the search for
regional peace.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the principals necessary to achieving that tantalizing
goal were on hand for the late-night ceremony, essentially the
signing of a revision of an accord reached last year with the
previous Israeli government, but redolent with hope for a final
settlement. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of
Jordan applauded as Barak and Arafat, seated side by side on gilt
chairs, signed the latest agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli and the Palestinian, who do not know each other well
but appear to have forged a certain understanding since Barak took
office in July, sat before a backdrop of Egyptian, Israeli,
Jordanian, Palestinian and American flags symbolic of the shared
effort needed for regional peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we are paving the way toward the end of a century-old
conflict between us and the Palestinians,'' Barak said. ``I am
committed to Israel's security. I also want the Palestinians to
feel secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat referred to Barak as ``my new partner in the peace
process'' and pledged to carry out the accords swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Barak, 57, injected energy into a quest for
peace that had been on hold for much of three years and has now
resumed at a time of transition in the Middle East. Arafat is 70
and Assad is 68; both are in frail health. Barak is new to power
and comparatively young, while Abdullah, at 37, is taking over from
his late father, King Hussein, who made crucial contributions to
Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ceremony, which began late Saturday night and ended
early Sunday morning, Israeli, Palestinian and American officials
mingled and chatted easily with one another.
</P>
<P>
   At President Clinton's Camp David, Md., mountain retreat, where
the 1978 framework Middle East peace accords were signed, the
president said the breakthrough ``represents a wonderful
opportunity to move the peace process forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement envisions the end of conflict between the
Palestinians and Israelis a year from now, with the emotional
issues of the boundaries of Israel and the Palestinian lands and
the disputed status of Jerusalem solved by then. Other longstanding
differences over the return of Palestinian refugees now scattered
through the Middle East and the use of water would also be resolved
under this bold strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In the shorter term, the agreement stipulates how to carry out a
land-for-security deal signed by the Israelis and Palestinians at
Wye River, Md., last fall.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Sept. 13, the Israelis will transfer 7 percent of
the West Bank from its total control to partial control for the
Palestinians. On Nov. 15, 5 percent more of the West Bank will be
transferred to the Palestinians. And on Jan. 20, a third transfer
should be completed, meaning that 40 percent of the West Bank will
then be under partial or full control of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The longer-term goal of a final-status agreement between the
Palestinians and the Israelis _ which Barak would like to see
concluded alongside talks with the Syrians _ is now the toughest
business at hand.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the ceremony, Albright noted that ``the obstacles
that permanent status negotiators will face are daunting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are tough, laden with emotion, and deeply rooted in
the region's troubled past,'' she added. ``They involve life and
death issues for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The final-status negotiations, due by mid-February, will help
determine Israel's size and its role in the Middle East. The new
agreement does not specifically mention the emergence of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials have acknowledged that in essence the
final-status negotiations mean that the Israelis and Palestinians
will sit down for the first time to discuss the terms of that
possibility, and tackle such vital issues as contiguity of
Palestinian territory and ways of entering and leaving Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Feb. 15 date for a framework agreement was too
ambitious, a senior American official said: ``Maybe. But if you set
sights too low, you won't reach that. If you set sights high,
that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the new agreement was finally stitched together boded
reasonably well for the broader negotiations, the American official
said. In the end, Arafat wanted some assurances on specific
concerns _ including that the final transfer of land would be
completed before the framework agreement was drawn up.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat reportedly had been concerned that Barak would not follow
through on his pledge to deliver the final segment of land if it
was not transferred before the framework agreement was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Going back over key moments in three days of shuttle diplomacy,
the official recalled that when Albright and other top American
officials arrived at Gaza City on Friday night, it was unclear
whether Arafat had signed off on the complete document. But Arafat
was relaxed when the Americans walked in and ``optimistic about the
future,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Americans placed a call to Barak from Arafat's office
for the two leaders to talk, Arafat opened the conversation with
the Israeli by saying, ``Shabat, Shalom,'' one of the Americans
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at the late-night ceremony was in a totally
celebratory mood. ``This marks moving from a frozen process to a
working process,'' said Nabil Shaath, one of the Palestinian
negotiators.``It promises a happy future, but it will be really
happy when it is implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaath said he was delighted that the United States was back in
the process of trying to agree on peace.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have been anxious to play down their role. One
official said that in contrast to the Wye document last fall and an
earlier agreement in 1997 dealing with Hebron, the Palestinians and
Israelis drafted and wrote this document themselves. The other two
had been drafted by the Americans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had made a dozen phone calls during the last few weeks
urging both sides on, the official said. And Dennis Ross, the
administration's senior Middle East negotiator, was on the phone
daily with them. But this was a qualitatively different role
compared to pushing the two sides together as was necessary under
the previous Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the
American official said.
</P>
<P>
   The official cited as an indication of the trust built in recent
months what he said was a remark by Saeb Erekat, the senior
Palestinian negotiator. He quoted Erekat as saying he could now
understand, if not always agree with, the Israeli point of view.
``I am finally able to put myself in their shoes,'' Erekat was
quoted as saying.

JIM COLBERT STILL HAS LOTS TO OFFER KC AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JASON WHITLOCK  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You talk to Jim Colbert long enough, and you get the feeling
he'd rather be playing football than golf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lightning struck the TD Waterhouse Championship at Tiffany
Greens Golf Club, causing a four-hour suspension of play. Colbert,
the former Bishop Miege High quarterback and Kansas State F.O.B.
(friend of Bill Snyder), went straight into the clubhouse and
caught up on the college football scores. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the delay, Colbert was in the process of
scorching the course. He was 5 under par with two holes to play. He
was tied for seventh and positioning himself for a run today at the
leaders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With his 16-year-old grandson as his caddie, Colbert was playing
his best round of golf this season. He was throwing darts at the
flags. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have shot 30 on the front nine,'' Colbert said. ``I
missed an 8-foot and a 5-foot birdie putt.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what did Colbert want to talk about when he strolled into the
press tent? Football, of course. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Come here,'' Colbert said waving me a little closer. ``What's
going to happen to the Chiefs? It looks to me like Warren Moon
should be the quarterback.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Grbac skeptic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, Colbert brought up the subject, so I went straight for his
purple jugular. How bad did Kansas State's loss to Texas A&AMP;M in the
Big 12 championship game hurt? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad. Real bad,'' Colbert said with a frown. ``I was shocked. I
spent the whole night with Snyder. It was a terrible, terrible
thing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You know Snyder asked for the score not to be announced,''
Colbert continued, referring to the score of the critical
UCLA-Miami contest that concluded in the middle of K-State's
eventual loss to the Aggies. ``If you watch the game _ before the
score was announced _ we were supposed to beat A&AMP;M 42-17.It started
with the guys calling the defensive plays. (Defensive coordinator
Mike) Stoops had never coached in a big game.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colbert held court in the press tent for close to 30 minutes. He
told stories about Snyder's golf game. He said the Wildcats have a
300-pound Samoan defensive tackle who will destroy everybody. He
updated us on the progress of all the K-Staters on NFL rosters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chiefs need to play Kevin Lockett,'' Colbert said. ``He
only dropped two passes in five years at Kansas State.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'd bet anything that Colbert would give up golf to coach the
Wildcats or the Chiefs. Well, maybe not. Life is good on the Senior
PGA Tour. Colbert has won more than $8 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He puts his money and celebrity to good use in this area. He's
building golf courses in Spring Hill, Kan., and Manhattan, Kan. And
beginning next year, ``Colbert Hills'' in Manhattan will be the
first national golf academy for the First Tee Program, which
promotes golf mostly among inner-city kids. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually 1,000 kids will come there each summer to learn
everything there is to learn about golf,'' Colbert said. ``I'm very
excited about this. I'm building a townhome right on the course, so
I can be there to help.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's why Colbert is so popular around here. He keeps giving
back to this area. Whenever Colbert comes to Kansas City, Mo., you
can just about bet he'll be close to the top of the leader board.
The large, boisterous galleries inspire his play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here is my one weekend a year to be like Arnold
Palmer,'' said Colbert, a winner twice in Kansas City. ``If I'm in
contention, the fans cheer and kind of go crazy when I walk up
18.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, weather permitting, the fans will get an opportunity to
go crazy. Ed Dougherty is 13 under _ 7 strokes ahead of Colbert,
who bogeyed 18 after the weather delay and finished with a 68 for
the day and a 6-under 138 for the tournament. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything within 10 strokes is reasonable,'' Colbert said. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE EVOLUTION OF JANE &LR;  By Cathleen Schine. Plume, $12.95. This
clever novel uses the principles of natural selection to illuminate
the life of its heroine, a young American woman visiting the
Galapagos Islands. ``The book is a beautifully descriptive
travelogue ... loaded with mini-lectures on natural history,
evolutionary theory and Darwiniana, wrapped around a rollicking
family saga,'' Barbara Kingsolver wrote last year in The New York
Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WE WISH TO INFORM YOU THAT TOMORROW WE WILL BE KILLED WITH OUR
FAMILIES: Stories From Rwanda &LR;  By Philip Gourevitch. Picador USA,
$15. A New Yorker writer chronicles the massacre of as many as
800,000 Tutsis by the Hutu majority in Rwanda in 1994, examining
both the roots and the consequences of a genocidal crime carried
out not by soldiers but by neighbors, co-workers and relatives. His
ghastly account, selected as one of the best books of 1998 by the
editors of The New York Times Book Review, is filled with the
testimony of survivors, participants and witnesses. ``A grim book
this, and a burden on world conscience,'' Wole Soyinka wrote. ``It
closes the habitual avenue of escape _ anonymity _ for collective
atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFRICA: A BIOGRAPHY OF THE CONTINENT &LR; , by John Reader (Vintage,
$17), digs deep into prehistory to track the emergence of Homo
sapiens and Africa's extraordinary diversity of life and terrain,
as well as the modern woes of the sub-Saharan region. Last year the
reviewer Thomas Pakenham called this ``a masterly synthesis of the
geological, climatological and paleontological discoveries of the
last decades.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOLDEN CHILD &LR;  By Penelope Fitzgerald. Mariner/Houghton
Mifflin, $12. In the author's first novel, a stodgy London museum
is thrown into disarray when a wildly popular exhibit of an ancient
African king is found to be possibly fraudulent. The result is ``a
classically plotted British mystery ... leavened with a wicked
sense of rapierlike humor,'' Newgate Callendar wrote in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued another of Fitzgerald's novels,
 &UR; AT FREDDIE'S &LR;  ($12), which takes place at a famous school for
child actors run by a formidable old woman renowned in the London
theatrical world. In 1985 the reviewer Roxana Robinson was
generally unimpressed but called this a ``well-mannered,
well-written'' novel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BASQUIAT: A Quick Killing in Art &LR;  By Phoebe Hoban. Penguin,
$15.95. A magazine journalist traces the hype-saturated rise and
fall of the charismatic painter who went from graffiti artist to
Warhol collaborator and art-world phenom before burning out on
drugs at the age of 27. Last year Patricia Bosworth called this a
``compulsively readable'' biography.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AT THE OWL WOMAN SALOON: Stories &LR;  By Tess Gallagher. Scribner,
$12. The poet's second prose collection is grounded in blue-collar
realism, often involving characters struggling to make do in the
logging camps and faded beauty parlors of the Pacific Northwest. In
1997 the reviewer Sarah Ferguson called these tales ``a bittersweet
mixture of deflated New Age wisdom and tired wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HONOR'S VOICE: The Transformation of Abraham Lincoln &LR;  By
Douglas L. Wilson. Vintage, $15. This understated portrait starts
not with Lincoln's greatness as president but with the sources of
that greatness when he was between the ages of 22 and 33, searching
for identity and finding his way into law and politics. The book
``establishes Wilson as the leading historian of the young and
private Lincoln,'' Gabor Boritt wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONE HAND CLAPPING &LR;  By Anthony Burgess. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $11.95.
Janet Shirley is a mild-mannered British housewife who is vaulted
into a world of luxury, courtesy of a loving husband with a
photographic memory who parlays his winnings on a television quiz
show into a fortune. Needless to say, it's a mixed blessing. ``Read
this witty and shrewdly joyful novel,'' Richard P. Brickner wrote
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A WORLD TRANSFORMED &LR;  By George Bush and Brent Scowcroft.
Vintage, $16. The former president and his national security
adviser recount the Bush administration's major foreign-policy
challenges, including the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
Persian Gulf war. Their ``remarkably frank, intelligent'' account
is ``the most important book yet written about the end of the Cold
War,'' Fareed Zakaria wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RIVER WARREN &LR;  By Kent Meyers. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13.
This first novel borrows from ``Our Town'' and ``Rashomon'' in
exploring how the fatal crash of a trucker and his wife shatters
the tranquillity of a Midwestern farming town. The author ``moves
cleanly from the event itself to an insightful inspection of local
life and its discontents,'' James Polk wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST OF MYLES &LR;  By Flann O'Brien (Myles na Gopaleen). Dalkey
Archive, $13.95. This selection of newspaper columns published in
The Irish Times from 1939 until the author's death in 1966 pokes
fun at everything from Gaelic revivalists to plumbers, and displays
a finely tuned ear for common Dublin speech. In 1968 the reviewer
Benedict Kiely praised the ``humorous, satirical, learned,
grave-faced, crazy writing.''
