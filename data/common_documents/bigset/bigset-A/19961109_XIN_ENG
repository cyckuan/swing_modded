PARIS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda today asked France and
Belgium to "abstain from contributing" to an international
military force to be deployed in eastern Zaire, the Agence France
Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu told the United Nations
mediator for the Great Lakes crisis, Canadian diplomat Raymond
Chretien, in Kigali that the international force to be deployed in
the Great Lakes region must be "neutral."
</P>
<P>
"We have signed the communique of Nairobi. This communique
recommended a neutral force, which means that the men who have
their interests (in the region) should abstain from providing the
troops," AFP quoted Bizimungu as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chretien arrived in Kigali, Rwanda, today to negotiate with
Rwandan leaders what he called the "very, very urgent question of
refugees."
</P>
<P>
"France, Belgium, Rwanda and some other countries should
abstain from providing the troops," added the Rwandan president.
</P>
<P>
At their summit held in Nairobi Tuesday, eight heads of state
or government in the Great Lakes region of central Africa called
for the deployment of a neutral force to establish humanitarian
corridors in eastern Zaire to guarantee access of international
aid to the 1.2 million refugees there.
</P>
<P>
"All the world is watching Rwanda," AFP quoted Chrestien as
saying when he arrived at Kigali, the first stop of his peace
mission in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
"The only very, very urgent question is the need to bring food,
medicines and aid to the refugees as early as possible. Not in the
weeks to come, but in hours and days to come," said the U.N.
mediator who was Canada's ambassador in the Great Lakes region in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Before going to Rwanda, Chretien met with Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko in the latter's private villa in southeastern
France.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said that Mobutu was very "informed" about what was
going on in his country, as well as about the declaration of the
Nairobi summit.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu promised to do his best to help maintain calmness in the
field so as to let the international community to bring aid to the
refugees "today or in the days to come."
</P>
<P>
Chretien will fly to Kinshasa this evening or Saturday to
discuss the refugee crisis with leaders of the Zairean government.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Cabinet Still Not Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian presidency met
today for its sixth session, with the dispute on the Council of
Ministers still unresolved.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued after the meeting, Alija
Izetbegovic, the presidency's chairman and Muslim member, and
Kresimir Zubak, the Croat member, agreed on a "one plus five"
formula of organizing the Council of Ministers, meaning one prime
minister and five ministers.
</P>
<P>
But Serb member Momcilo Krajisnik insisted that to begin with,
the Council of Ministers should consist of only one prime minister
and two ministers -- foreign minister and foreign trade minister,
with more ministries to be added in future.
</P>
<P>
It has been almost two months since the September elections in
Bosnia in which members of the country's joint institutions were
elected. But besides twice-a-week meetings of the presidency, no
other institutions have been established.
</P>
<P>
John Kornblum, a U.S. assistant secretary of state charged to
tackle the Bosnian problems, would reportedly come to Sarajevo
again in the next few days to push parties concerned to move
faster on the issue of joint institutions.
</P>
<P>
The presidential meeting also discussed a draft platform the
joint body would present to an international conference next week
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic said that some important points were missing and
should be included in the document, the statement said, without
elaborating them in detail.
</P>
<P>
The presidency gave instructions to a task group headed by
Foreign Minister Jadranko Prlic to continue its work on the text
of the platform, the statement said.

<P>
HARARE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe today
donated 5,000 U. S. Dollars to the capital account of the first
ever bank launched by local women.
</P>
<P>
The president challenged the women to work hard to accomplish
the goal of establishing the Oma (women) Bank by December, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Oma capital account project, represented by 13 local
women's organizations, aims to raise a capital of five million U.
S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "this project is indeed a landmark in the history
of women's development in Zimbabwe as it lays the foundation for
the establishment of Zimbabwe's first women's bank."
</P>
<P>
"That is the kind of courage, bravery and determination that
we need. That is the kind of affirmative action we want to see,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
stake holders are expected to deposit a minimum 70 Zimbabwe
Dollars (seven U. S. Dollars) with the Post Office Savings Bank
for 12 months as fixed deposit to facilitate the project.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Seek Stronger Ties With China: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda
today expressed Japan's readiness to promote relations with China
despite a territorial dispute between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, bilateral relations with China are as important as
those with the United States. They involve one of the most
important tasks that could affect the existence of our country,"
Ikeda said in an interview with the Kyodo news service.
</P>
<P>
On the two countries' conflicting claims to the Diaoyu islands
in the East China Sea, known in Japan as Senkaku, Ikeda reiterated
that Japan's position on the matter remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
But he hastened to note the importance of pursuing sound
bilateral ties with China even if bickering over ownership of the
isles continues, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
"You must be fully aware of our position on the Senkaku
Islands. You must also understand that China's stance is different
from ours," said Ikeda, who was retained as foreign minister in
the cabinet of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto inaugurated on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto was re-elected to a second term following last
month's general elections.
</P>
<P>
"But we believe we must prevent our important relations from
being poisoned over this problem, and China shares this view,"
Kyodo quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Tokyo's economic assistance to Beijing, the foreign minister
said Japan will continue to support China's economic reform
efforts, regarding its economic assistance as vital to such a
drive.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to extend economic cooperation to China in
view of our basic stance on relations with the country, including
our policy of supporting Chinese efforts to introduce a
market-oriented economy and open itself to the outside world,"
Ikeda said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Hashimoto also called for stronger ties with
China.
</P>
<P>
"We will honestly tackle various issues between Japan and China
and make efforts toward further strengthening cooperative
relations between the two countries on the occasion of the 25th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties," the prime
minister told a news conference televised nationwide, referring to
commemorations slated for next year.

<P>
NICOSIA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides said here today that his government has protested to the
U.N. over the violation of its air space by Turkish F-16 fighters
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have protested the violation by Turkish aircraft and we
shall make representations every time when this occurs,"
President Clerides told reporters at a ceremony of the patron
saint of the air force at Lakatamia airfield, outside Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus' Defense Ministry, four Turkish F-16
fighters flew Thursday over the Turkish controlled northern part
of Cyprus on two separate occasions and launched mock attacks.
</P>
<P>
Two of the planes returned to their base in Turkey and another
two landed at an airport in northern Cyprus, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The planes were reportedly taking part in the Turkish and
Turkish Cypriot joint military exercise code-named "Toros 2/96",
which covers the northeastern Mediterranean and the
Turkish-controlled northern part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which started on November 5, will end today.

<HEADLINE> Extreme Right Ideology, Racism on Rise in Europe: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The extreme right ideology and
racist acts in Europe are on the rise, especially in Central and
Eastern Europe, said an annual report of the Center of Anti-Racist
Research, Information and Documentation out today.
</P>
<P>
"In several Eastern European states, notably for the reason of
a persistent economic crisis, the acts and activities with a
racist charateristic have increased in 1996," said the Paris-based
center, which is made up of researchers, journalists and human
rights workers.
</P>
<P>
Rene Monzat, one of the authors of the report entitled "Racism,
Extreme Right and Anti-Semitism in Europe" made available for the
local press today, said that things are particularly bad in the
countries of former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The racist parties have the wind on their sails (in these
countries)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Gypsies are being subjected to victimization and
persecution in several Central and Eastern European countries,
including those so-called newly democratized countries such as the
Czech Republic, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In Western Europe, extreme right ideology and racism don't seem
to be overspilling this year, but have shown no sign of a global
abating, especially in France, Italy and Austria, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The extreme right parties are not only parties of demagogues,
they are the parties capable of dramatizing political and social
problems," said the report, while criticizing some governments for
yielding to extreme right forces in such fields as immigration.
</P>
<P>
Philippe Lamy, one of the authors of the report, said that the
National Front party of France is now continuously raising its
voice while remaining a small party, and there is no left party
which can counter it in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 300-page republic, due to be published later this month,
said that many regionalist and separatist right-wing groups in
both Eastern and Western Europe are hardening their stand by
following the logic of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
"The ground is sliding down," said the report.

<HEADLINE> Quality Standard Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Industry and Commerce Minister
Nathan Shamuyarira today encouraged small and indigenous
companies in Zimbabwe to get ISO 9000 certification and improve
their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Addressing about 120 business people at the launching of the
National Quality Awareness Campaign here, the minister said a key
factor in improving competitiveness in both domestic and export
markets is through the adoption of sound quality management
systems based on international standards.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic reform program with its trade
liberalization and other open policies has exposed Zimbabwean
manufacturers and traders to increased international competition.
</P>
<P>
"This competition has pushed some of our companies to the
wall. Quite a number of our companies have been forced to close
down and many more have been threatened with closure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shamuyarira said current experience in the country's economy
has shown that Zimbabweans could not continue to ignore the
crucial role played by quality management systems in enhancing
product competitiveness on the market.
</P>
<P>
The consumers everywhere have become quality conscious, buying
nothing but excellence, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have no choice but to move with the times. We have to
accept the rules of the game and play accordingly," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He told the business people that the government will treat the
issue of high quality standards as one of national economic
priorities.
</P>
<P>
Indications in Zimbabwe and in the region showed that there is
a movement and action toward establishing quality management
institutions, Shamuyarira said.
</P>
<P>
A national quality association is being established in
Zimbabwe, he said, while a Southern African Development Community
(SADC) quality conference will be held in the country from
November 18 to 22.

<HEADLINE> Report: White House Panel Calls for Independent Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A special White House panel
has called for an independent investigation into whether U.S.
troops were exposed to chemical weapons during the Gulf War, The
New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans'
Illnesses said in a draft report that the Defense Department's
investigation has "lacked vigor, fallen short on investigative
grounds and stretched credibility."
</P>
<P>
The panel's final report, expected to be delivered to President
Bill Clinton next month, said that the Pentagon had lost so much
credibility on the issue that the new inquiries should be taken
away from the Defense Department and given to outside
investigators, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The panel worked out the draft after an investigation into the
actions of the Pentagon in dealing with American Gulf War veterans
who claim they have suffered a variety of unexplained illnesses
including memory problems, fatigue, diarrhea, and insomnia after
being exposed to Iraqi chemical and biological weapons during the
1991 war.
</P>
<P>
About 80,000 of the 700,000 American troops who served in the
Gulf have requested special medical examinations to determine
whether they were made sick by their service.
</P>
<P>
The committee is trying to resolve questions about possible
causes of the illnesses, but its report fails to determine a cause
for the illnesses, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Until June, the Defense Department maintained there was no
evidence that U.S. troops were exposed to chemical or biological
weapons during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
But the Pentagon said recently that up to 15,000 people could
have been exposed when an Iraqi ammunition depot containing stores
of sarin, a deadly nerve gas, was blown up by the American troops
in March 1991.

<P>
BRUSSELS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has proposed to the Council of Ministers an agreement between the
European Union and New Zealand on sanitary measures affecting
trade in live animals and animal products in the two regions.
</P>
<P>
The EC put forward the proposal after long and detailed
negotiations with New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The proposed agreement, at the same time, has taken into
account the necessity of ensuring a high level of human and animal
health protection within the EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the agreement is to facilitate trade procedures and
to create a solid framework for trade in this sensitive area,
based on mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the EU launched an initiative for the negotiation of
bilateral agreements on trade of live animals and animal products
with its main trading partners, including New Zealand, on the
basis of the Agreement on Application of Sanitary and
Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures adopted in the GATT Uruguay round.
</P>
<P>
The proposed accord is the first broad bilateral agreement to
put into practical effect the SPS agreement on trade in live
animals and animal products. The EU says that it will set a
precedent for other agreements of this kind.

<HEADLINE> Colon Cancer Could Be Eradicated: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Colon cancer could be wiped
out with the aid of internal examinations and removal of polyps,
small growths in the intestines, at an early stage, according to a
recent report from Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian senior medical officer Geir Hoff, who has headed a
team of researchers in Norway, made this assertion after carrying
out a comprehensive study which has so far covered a 13-year
period.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the results at a recent international meeting of
cancer experts in Oslo, the Norwegian researchers cited a study
they began in 1983, when 324 people, aged 50 to 59, were examined.
</P>
<P>
Polyps were found and removed from the colons of one third of
these people. This year, the 324 were again examined and none of
them had developed colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
In a control group of 400 people who were not examined in 1983,
nine had developed colon cancer by early this year.
</P>
<P>
Polyps are common and affect half the population by the age of
70. Ninety-five percent of the growths are benign, but 5 percent
can develop into malignancies.
</P>
<P>
Graeme Young, an internationally-renowned cancer researcher of
the Adelaide University in Australia, said that the results of the
Oslo study had attracted attention throughout the world.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Holds Talks With Brazilian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that Sino-Brazilian relations have entered the stage of
mature development and China wishes to advance the long-term,
stable and mutually beneficial and cooperative relations between
the two countries to a new height.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng made the remarks in his talks with Brazilean President
Fernando Enrique Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute talks started with Premier Li Peng conveying
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's regards to President Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso thanked the Chinese leader for the regards, said he
welcomes Premier Li's second trip to Brazil, and expressed his
belief that the trip will help deepen the friendship between the
two countries. He was deeply impressed by China' economic
achievements during his China trip last December, Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Brazilean relations have been developing smoothly since
the two countries forged diplomatic ties 22 years ago, Li Peng
said.
</P>
<P>
He cited a series of facts to prove his statement, including
the frequent exchange of visits by senior leaders of the two
countries, the regular political consultations between the foreign
ministries, the good cooperation and coordination in international
institutions, the increasing cooperation in the economic,
scientific, technological and cultural fields, and the close
contacts between the armies of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Brazil in 1993.
</P>
<P>
All this shows, Li Peng said, that the Sino-Brazilean friendly
and cooperative relations "have entered the stage of mature
development."
</P>
<P>
"China appreciates President Cardoso's proposal to establish an
all-faceted strategic partner relationship between the two
countries when he visited China last December," Li Peng said.
"China wishes to advance the long-term, stable, mutually
beneficial and cooperative bilateral relationship into a new
stage, through joint efforts by the two countries."
</P>
<P>
China and Brazil are the biggest developing countries in their
respective areas and they share or have similar views on many
major international issues, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
The good consultation and cooperation between the two countries
in the United Nations and other international institutions, he
said, have reflected their common concern about peace and
development of mankind and about the establishment of new and just
international political and economic orders.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with all this, and coordination between the
two countries in international affairs should be further
strengthened," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
China thanked the Brazilian government for its understanding
and support of China's entering of the World Trade Organization
and the American Development Bank, and of China becoming an
observer of the the Association of Latin-American Integration, Li
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Holds Talks With Brazilian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Li and President Cardoso shared the view that all
countries in the world have their own conditions and the people of
all countries have the right to choose their own road of
development.
</P>
<P>
In international relations, they said, it is necessary to
advocate cooperation, to oppose power politics, to respect each
other in handling country-to-country relations, to seek common
ground while putting aside differences on the principles of
peaceful coexistence, to oppose foreign interference and to oppose
imposition of pressure on any other countries by using the issue
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Highly valuing Brazil-China relations, President Cardoso said
his government is happy that there has been fruitful progress in
terms of bilateral cooperation in various fields in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have had extensive common acknowledgement on
many issues, and the leaders of the two countries have had a
series of important talks during the exchange of visits, which
have played an important role in enhancing mutual understanding
and trust and in reinforcing the bilateral relations, Cardoso
said.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li and President Cardoso were also of the view that
great potential in economic links and trade is yet to be tapped
despite a rapid increase of two-way trade in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The two governments should provide conveniences for the
commodities of one country to enter the markets of the other so as
to bring the two-way trade onto a new stage through joint efforts
by the government enterprises, based on the principles of equality
and mutual benefit and helping supply each other's needs, they
said.
</P>
<P>
In economic cooperation, Li Peng said that China and Brazil
have their respective advantages in cooperation in iron ore,
hydro-power, forestry, aeronautics and environmental protection,
thus facing a bright future. "Their cooperation in these sectors
could well be termed as an example of South-South cooperation," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng hoped that businesspeople and entrepreneurs will
strengthen direct contacts to expand and probe more ways of
cooperation, including two-way investment. "The Chinese government
will try its best to offer assistance in this regard," he noted.
</P>
<P>
President Cardoso shared Li's view on strengthening bilateral
economic links. Entrepreneurs of the two countries should effect
substantial contacts and reach agreements in specific areas. He is
confident that Brazilian-Chinese economic ties will enter a more
effective cooperative stage and the two countries will become good
partners.
</P>
<P>
After hearing President Cardoso's briefing on the Latin America
situation, Li Peng highly valued the role of Brazil in the cause
of peace and development in the region. China will continue to
keep close consultation and cooperation with all Latin American
countries and to contribute its share to global peace and
stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two countries also exchanged views on other
regional and international issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Wipe out Water Hyacinth in L. Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- President Daniel arap Moi
today announced that his government will introduce agents early
next year to destroy the water hyacinth in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at this year's Nyanza Province Jua Kali Exhibition in
Kisumu, west Kenya, Moi said he will send Environment and Natural
Resources Minister Henry Kosgei to the lake area to assess the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader stressed that the government is committed to
wiping out the water weed completely since Africa's largest fresh
water lake is the economic lifeline of the local people.
</P>
<P>
Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the
world, is threatened with a number of ecological problems,
particularly the fast-spreading weed of water hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
The killer water weed is spreading rapidly and has cast a
strangle hold that is steadily choking the fresh water lake to
death.
</P>
<P>
The ecological problems haunting Lake Victoria include major
changes in food chain, species of extinction, oxygen depletion,
algal bloom, pollution, overfishing and rapid colonization by
water hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Kenyan Marine and Fisheries Research
Institute said that at least 300 species of the small indigenous
and rare fish have been extinct because of the introduction of
the voracious Nile Perch in 1962/63.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of Nile Perch was in line with the United
Nations intention to increase productivity of natural resources
to provide food for an increasingly hungry world through the
application of western technology.
</P>
<P>
However, the Nile Perch has devoured most of the smaller
fishes in Lake Victoria while others have migrated into the
deeper waters where they are not adapted to, leading to death of
most of them.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive report on the current status of the lake by
the Intermediate Technology Development Group revealed that the
lake's resources are being squandered and unless preventive
action is taken now, the livelihood of close to 30 million people
in the region of three East African countries -- Uganda, Kenya
and Tanzania -- would hang in the balance.

<HEADLINE> 2 Million Children Killed in War Over Last Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 2 million children
were killed in armed conflicts over the past decade, while over 4
million others were maimed, said a report of the U.N. Children's
Fund (UNICEF) today, which called for action to protect children
from war.
</P>
<P>
The death toll included an estimated 500,000
under-five-year-olds in 1992 alone, according to the report, which
noted that civilian fatalities in wartime have increased from 65
percent by the end of World War II to top 90 percent in the 1990s,
and half of the civilian victims were children.
</P>
<P>
This is because the armed conflicts nowadays have mostly been
civil wars instead of between states, according to the UNICEF. In
addition, children in poor countries who are already vulnerable to
malnutrition and disease are 24 times more likely to die during
armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF said that at least half of the about 57.4 million
people displaced by war around the world are children, and
millions of them unaccompanied. During the past decade, more than
1 million children have been made orphans or separated from their
families.
</P>
<P>
In Rwanda alone, by the end of 1994, a record more than 100,000
children had been separated from their families. In the Great
Lakes region of Africa, only over 33,000 of the children
registered as unaccompanied had been reunited with their families
by last May.
</P>
<P>
The unaccompanied children are the likeliest to die, to be
tortured, raped, robbed and recruited as child soldiers, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The report revealed an increase in the number of child soldiers
and their full involvement in the 30 or so armed conflicts
globally. Some 200,000 child soldiers under 16 were involved in
fightings in 1988. Children as young as seven have been found in
combat in Liberia. Girl soldiers are also found forced into sex
slavery.
</P>
<P>
Generally, child soldiers are statistically invisible with
their role being denied or downplayed. They are more obedient, and
the use of them as combatants has been made easier by the
proliferation of light weapons such as assault rifles, which can
be as cheap as chicken and so simple and light that they can be
handled by a child of 10, said the UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF urged the international community to raise the
minimum recruitment age to 18 years and to include this in the
draft Optional Protocol to the Convention of the Rights of the
Child.
</P>
<P>
In this report based on two years' survey, the UNICEF also
stressed sexual abuses of both girls and boys, along with
experiencing or witnessing violence and loss of family, as among
the war evils that cause lasting physical or psychological impacts
on children, whose health conditions and education are meanwhile
severely affected by war.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF reported that more than 20,000 women and girls had
been raped during the war in Bosnia, and more than 15,700 raped in
Rwanda between April 1994 and April 1995, calling for prosecuting
wartime rape and other sexual torture as war crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to it, more than 60 percent of the Rwandan children
interviewed in the survey said they did not care whether they ever
grew up.
</P>
<P>
A nine-year-old Liberian girl was quoted in the report as
saying, "I saw 10 to 20 people shot, mostly old people who
couldn't walk fast. They shot my uncle in the head and killed him.
Then they made my father undress and have an affair with a
decaying body. Then they raped my cousin who was a little girl of
nine years old."

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Arafat's Popularity Heightened After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat won more popularity among Palestinians
after the bloody clashes between Palestine and Israel in
September, according to a latest poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted by JMCC, a Palestinian press service based
in East Jerusalem, showed that about 89.2 percent of those
surveyed gave their approval of Arafat's performance as head of
the PA, a considerable increase compared to some months ago.
</P>
<P>
The approval level of PA performance has also increased. The
number of Palestinians believing the performance of the PA rose
from 31.1 percent in August to 44 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
The case is true with the PA apparatuses, especially the
security establishment, whose popularity rose from 37.2 percent
in August to 44 percent in October. The approval ratings of the
Voice of Palestine also rose from 48.8 percent to 61.9 percent as
the radio played a key role in broadcasting news of the clashes,
which left over 60 dead and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 77.2 percent of those surveyed believe
the acts of violence are beneficial to the Palestinian cause and
56.5 percent say the PA used these events in a positive manner to
promote the Palestinian cause. Some 90 percent approve the
involvement of the security forces in the violence.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of the Palestinians supporting the peace
process as a whole remains stable, but there is a decrease in
support of the Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,199 people over the age of 18 were interviewed
face-to-face at random throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip on
October 24-25.

<HEADLINE> US Navy Denies Shooting Down of Airliner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Navy said today it
could not have shot down a TWA airliner that crashed over the
Atlantic off New York in July as it had no weapons in the area.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Susan Haeg, a Navy spokeswoman, said the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) would have to comment directly on
allegations by former White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger
that a Navy missile might have accidentally shot down the jet.
</P>
<P>
She said, "We've tracked any Navy assets in the area and
there's nothing different. There was nothing in the area that
could have done that."
</P>
<P>
Salinger, who was press spokesman for the late President John
F. Kennedy and later Paris bureau chief for ABC television, said
in France Thursday that he had obtained a document alleging that
the crash of the Boeing 747 near New York on July 17 was caused
by a missile test.
</P>
<P>
The TWA 800 crash killed all 230 people on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
"The FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board have
found the allegation to be without merit and they have moved on,"
Haeg said.

<P>
LAGOS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A battalion of Nigerian peace-keepers
have arrived in Monrovia on Thursday to replace another battalion of
their compatriots which has completed its mission in Liberia, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Victor Malu, the Commander of the West Africa
Peace-Keeping Force known as ECOMOG, urged the Nigerian soldiers to
work hard to help end the Liberian civil war by next year.
</P>
<P>
He instructed the peace-keepers to brace up for the disarmament of
liberian faction fighters, which he noted, is the most crutical
assignment before the ECOMOG and expected to start later this month.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG currently has about 12,000 soldiers from six countries,
namely, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Mali and Nigeria. Another
2,000 soldiers are expected to join the peace-keepers soon.

<HEADLINE> US Teenage Smokers on Rapid Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Out of some 70 million
Americans under the age of 18, about 16 million have become
cigarette smokers, and more than 5 million teenage smokers will
die prematurely from smoking.
</P>
<P>
The projections were given by the Office of Smoking and Health
at the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention which
published the research in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report.
</P>
<P>
Health officials said the center's estimate of 5 million
premature death was a conservative one based on current smoking
rate. It included an allowance for people who will stop smoking
after the age of 35 and thus have a reduced risk of early death
from tobacco-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
"These studies show the potential for prevention. The 5 million
deaths is a projection that does't have to become reality. This is
a wake-up call," said Michael D. Eriksen, director of the Office
of Smoking and Health.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated the cost of treating such illness in
today's young smokers at 200 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report underscored the need for the Food and Drug
Administration's recently adopted regulations to curtail tobacco
marketing that appeals to young smokers and to reduce their access
to cigarettes.

GENEVA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Sub-Saharan African (SSA)
countries owe between 245 billion and 300 billion U.S. dollars to
non-OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development)
creditors.
</P>
<P>
This represent 25 percent of the total developing country debt,

developing countries and transition economies. They combined
account for 83 percent of the SSA debt to non-OECD countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Groundwater Sampler Helps Assess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A Weizman Institute of
science groundwater sampling system tracks down microscopic
particles that act as vehicles for the spread of groundwater
pollutants, according to the latest issue of Environmental
Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
It said that the system was recently recognized by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as useful sampling
technology.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent announcement issued by the institute,
the system, known as the multilayer sampler or MLS, has also
been recently used to identify contaminated groundwater layers
that can be effectively cleaned up by bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in an application that may be significant for
Israel's water supply, MLS is now being employed to study salty
fluxes in the fabled Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
While many other water samplers are based on pumping, which
distorts the natural flow and layering of the water, the MLS
leaves the national conditions in the water intact.
</P>
<P>
"This makes MLS particularly suitable for mapping the precise
distribution and flow of pollutants and other substances in the
water," says Dr. Daniel Ranen of the Environmental Sciences and
Energy Research Department, who invented the sampler together
with the late Prof. Mordechai Magaritz.
</P>
<P>
One of the system's first applications was to provide early
warning of contaminants trickling down into the groundwater
surface, before they sink to deeper levels of the aquifer where
they become much harder to eliminate.

<P>
GENEVA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) today called on the U.N.
Security Council to take urgent action to stop the tragedy in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
ICRC President Cornelio Sommaruga told a news conference today
that the conditions are ripe for the Security Council to decide on
a military intervention to stop the human tragedy in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
According to Sommaruga, the humanitarian situation in eastern
Zaire is "extremely urgent" because refugees and displaced people
have been cut off from outside help for a whole week in northern
Kivu and nearly two weeks in southern Kivu.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community should first take steps to
open humanitarian corridors to provide assistance to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The second step he envisaged is creation of protection zones by
outside forces as a provisional solution before the finding of a
final solution.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the purpose of the protection zones is to
restore law and order in the conflicting area.

<HEADLINE> Athens Stock Exchange Suspends Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Athens Stock Exchange (ASE)
suspended trading today for the first time in its history
following a decision of the Union of Stock Exchange Members
(SMEXA) to abstain.
</P>
<P>
The brokers have called on the National Economy Ministry to
guarantee correct operation of the system of clearance of
transactions, claiming that the titles depository, which is
responsible for clearing transactions, owes 2.6 billion drachmas
(about 11.3 million U.S. dollars) to brokerage companies, and
therefore the brokers lack cash to meet the demands of their
clients.
</P>
<P>
The SMEXA move was prompted by the inability of the Delta S.A.
Brokerage firm to cover cash obligations to the depository of 2.6
billion drachmas.
</P>
<P>
Dimitris Karagounis, president of the Union of Shareholders,
told the press that the present conditions prevailing on the ASE
were the result of bad operation of the depository which, "by
delaying delivery of shares, nurtured devaluatory speculation."
</P>
<P>
He said the full extent of the problem was disclosed after
in-depth checks were made following the intervention of the union.
</P>
<P>
Athens public prosecutor George Koliokostas later initiated
proceedings against the representatives of Delta S.A. Brokerage
after conducting an urgent preliminary investigation.
</P>
<P>
At the the same time, the prosecutor ordered a main
investigation into the affair and prohibited the president of
Delta, Dimitris Argyriadis, its vice president Ioanna Gelestathi
and board member Theofanis Gravanis from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas declared that there was
"no problem with the country's economy, nor any problem which
might cause concern for the stock exchange."

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges Immediate Action in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged here today the international community
to "act immediately" to assist refugees in eastern Zaire because
the refugees there are confronted with a "genocide of starvation."
</P>
<P>
After briefing the Security Council this morning, Boutros-Ghali
told the press that the refugees there could not receive food,
medicine or clean water.
</P>
<P>
As every passing day literally costs thousands of lives, the
secretary-general suggested that the Security Council decide to
establish a multinational force under the authority of the
council, which will protect refugees in the camps and the
humanitarian workers there.
</P>
<P>
Silvana Foa, spokeswoman for the secretary-general, said in a
statement that Boutros-Ghali addressed the fourth letter since
mid-October to the president of the Security Council bringing out
the dramatic deterioration in the situation in eastern Zaire in
recent days and the very real threat to the lives of tens of
thousands of men, women and children in the Zairian provinces of
North Kivu and South Kivu.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in eastern Zaire has caused massive displacement
of more than 1.2 million Burundian and Rwandan refugees as well as
tens of thousands of Zairians, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
"About 400,000 refugees are now moving towards the northwestern
tip of Lake Kivu. More than 115,000 refugees who fled their camp
last week are believed to be still on the move south. There is no
information on 500,000 refugees in Bakavu and Uvira," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"At least 1 million Rwandan and Burundian refugees remain in
Zaire west of Goma. It seems that the fleeing refugees are moving
in search of water rather than a planned displacement inside
Zaire," the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
Reports of returnees to Rwanda indicate that people are dying
of thirst. Most of these victims of the armed conflict have been
forced to abandon their camps and homes and move westwards towards
some fo the most inhospitable and inaccessible areas in Zaire
whereas many others have fled to Tanzania and Uganda, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general noted that the Security Council already
has under active consideration a proposal whereby it would
authorize member states to make necessary arrangements to ensure
the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance to the needy
population, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general strongly appealed to members states,
which are in a position to do so, to contribute to it in whatever
way possible.

<HEADLINE> ILO Chief Warns of Globalization Backlash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the International
Labor Organization (ILO) today urged government, labor and
business leaders to link economic progress to job creation and
poverty reduction to avoid jeopardizing worldwide economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first ILO Enterprise Forum opened here today,
ILO Director-General Michel Hansenne said that despite rapid
advances fostered by the globalization of the world economy, the
advent of unprecedented unemployment and the alarming growth of
poverty, inequality and social exclusion threatened to spark
tensions in both developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"If economic progress is not translated into an equal amount of
social progress, especially in terms of jobs, there is a real risk
that a backlash could result which would seriously jeopardize the
very opportunities for growth afforded by the opening up of the
market in the last few years," Hansenne said.
</P>
<P>
The forum, organized with the theme of "Promoting Social
Progress and Enterprise Competitiveness in a Global Economy," is
taking place on November 8 to 9 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the two days of talks would seek new ways of
creating jobs, developing human resources and improving working
conditions and labor-management relations.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Feared as Sales Grow at 8-Year High in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's shops are enjoying a
widespread increase in business, with all retailing sectors
reporting improved sales for the first time since January 1990,
the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said.
</P>
<P>
In its latest distributive trades survey, covering 15,000
outlets in retailing, wholesaling and motor trades, the CBI
said that annual retail sales volumes picked up in October after
slower growth in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
At a net figure of 55 percent, the balance of retailers
reporting higher annual sales volumes was both greater than had
been expected and the largest since August 1988.
</P>
<P>
A net balance of 31 percent also said that business was above
average for the time of year -- more so than at any time since
November 1988.
</P>
<P>
At a net figure of 43 percent of outlets, orders placed with
suppliers are rising at their sharpest since January 1988.
</P>
<P>
The sharpest rise, reversing a dip in business in September, is
likely to add to mounting pressure on Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, to tighten monetary policy again ahead of the election
expected next spring, to limit the danger of rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
But the CBI said it sees no immediate need for another rise. It
urged the chancellor instead to set a tough budget this month to
keep consumer spending in check.
</P>
<P>
Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economic
analysis, said retailers are still reporting fierce competition,
restricting their ability to pass on price rises to consumers.
</P>
<P>
Business analysts also believe that in spite of the strength of
high street sales, business leaders do not yet need further marked
policy changes to dampen any inflationary pressures.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Govt Cuts Red Tape to Attract Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma today announced a government plan to cut red tape
to facilitate foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at closing session of the four-day international
investment and technology forum in Dar es Salaam today, he said
the present Investment Promotion Center (IPC) would be made into
a one-stop body in 1997 to simplify various procedures for
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
"The measure is aimed at making an authority out of IPC to
cut short the trips made by investors to different ministries and
offices," said the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Measures including simplify the immigration procedures are
also under legislative review in a bid to facilitate
decision-making and investment process, according to Juma.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-president admitted there are currently structural and
administrative problems such as the incompatibility of some of
the laws, including labour law, which he said have to be updated
for the market economy.
</P>
<P>
During the trade forum attended by 264 foreign investors and
200 local entrepreneurs, four contracts of joint venture and 75
investment projects worth 786 million U.S. Dollars were signed.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Adopt Gradual Abolition of Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the South
African Reserve Bank, Chris Stals, today reiterated the Bank's
resolve to abolish exchange controls on a step by step basis
a turnaround of the earlier "big bang approach".
</P>
<P>
Addressing an economic research conference in Cape Town, Stals
said the fight against inflation was still a priority of the
Bank, adding the decision to lift exchange controls was a
"political" one.
</P>
<P>
"Let us have a debate about why controls must go gradually,"
said the governor, adding that a cautious, practical approach had
to be adopted though no one disagreed about the disadvantages of
having exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
"This is because the removal of exchange controls without some
harmonisation of domestic macro-economic policies, for example on
inflation, would lead to an unstable economic environment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the abolition of remaining exchange controls has
been one of the major factors leading to the volatility of the
local currency Rand which has lost more than 28 percent of its
values since mid-February this year.

President Nelson Mandela is contacting western and regional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Although the president is reluctant to engage South African
forces outside the country, he will respond positively to any
request by the Organisation of African Unity or the United
Nations," presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said here
today.

the 1.2 million Hutu refugees driven by the fighting between
Zairean troops and the Tutsi rebels.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls For Protecting Children from Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. report released
here today called for actions to protect children from armed
conflicts which have killed around 2 million children in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
The report resulted from a two-year research and consultation
undertaken by Graca Machel, U.N. secretary general's expert on
impact of armed conflict on children and former Minister of
Education in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that in addition to the 2 million killed,
three times as many have been forced to witness or even to take
part in horrifying acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
As all of today's wars are being fought not between states but
within them and battles are fought from village to village and
from street to street, the proportion of civilian victims has
leapt in recent decades from 5 percent to over 90 percent, and at
least half of these are children, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, children are being deliberately recruited as
combatants.
</P>
<P>
The report offered 10 key recommendations:
</P>
<P>
-- the needs of children and women must be at the heart of all
actions to resolve conflicts and implement peace agreements,
including those mandated by U.N. agencies;
</P>
<P>
-- children in armed-conflict situations must be treated as a
distinct and priority concern in all monitoring and reporting
activities;
</P>
<P>
-- health, psychosocial well-being and education should be the
pillars of all humanitarian assistance for children im
emergencies;
</P>
<P>
-- child educational, training and health care needs should be
given priority and they should be prevented from participation in
armed conflict, prostitution and drug abuse;
</P>
<P>
-- all incidents of wartime rape and other sexual torture must
be prosecuted as war crimes;
</P>
<P>
-- in each emergency, a lead organization should be assigned
overall responsibility for the protection and assistance of
internally displaced and unaccompanied children;
</P>
<P>
-- a global campaign should be launched to stop the recruitment
of children under age 18 into armed forces;
</P>
<P>
-- the report supports the international campaign for a
complete ban on the use, production, trade and stockpiling of
landmines; and programs to instruct children in mine-contaminated
areas about the dangers of mines;
</P>
<P>
-- the international community should closely monitor arms
transfers and impose a total ban on arms shipments to conflict
zones. Governments and civil society must address the root causes
of conflict and support the social infrastructure that protects
children; and
</P>
<P>
-- a special representative of the secretary-general should be
named to monitor implementation of this report and ensure that
issues of children and war are kept high on the international
human rights, peace, security and development agendas.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Canada Cuts Key Rate Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada cut its key
bank rate by another quarter of a percentage point to 3.25 percent
today.
</P>
<P>
The rate cut came shortly after Statistics Canada said the
October jobless rate rose to 10 percent from September's 9.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Canada's major chartered banks responded immediately by
announcing cuts to their prime rates.
</P>
<P>
The prime rates, charged by these banks to their preferred
clients, will fall to 4.75 percent from the current 5.00 percent,
effective Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The key rate of the Bank of Canada stands now at its lowest
point since 1956. And the prime rates are at their lowest levels
in more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in less than two weeks that the Bank of
Canada dropped its key rate.
</P>
<P>
The bank hopes that the rate cuts, the 11th this year, will
help to stimulate a sluggish domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
Although Canada's interests rates are close to bottoming out,
there could be more cuts by the end of this year, analysts here
said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Interim Gov't Announces Major Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's interim government
today announced measures to bail out the fragile economy, provide
relief to the poor and prevent successive governments to
"introduce slippage".
</P>
<P>
Shahid Jawed Burki, the newly appointed advisor to the prime
minister on finance and economic affairs announced that a National
Renewal Fund is being set up to produce a social safety net for
the poorest segment of the society.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a crowded press conference here, he also announced
the decision to abolish and consolidate various financial
institutions including the Pakistan Banking Council, Industrial
Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP), Regional Development Finance
Corporation (RDFC) and PICIC, etc..
</P>
<P>
"These abused massive funds in the past, putting an enormous
amount of bad debts and therefore have to be dealt with very very
quickly," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Flanked by the Commerce Minister Mohammad Zubair Khan, governor
of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Mohammad Yaqub and designate
Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, Hafiz Pasha, he
undertook to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory authority
of SBP.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time we want to build a fire wall between the
monetary management part of the SBP responsibility and its
supervisory functions," he vowed.
</P>
<P>
Shahid Burki also announced the setting up of a number of task
forces to have more information about the economic data. These
would submit their reports positively by the end of this month, he
added.
</P>
<P>
These task forces would make recommendations in the areas
including fiscal reforms, review of the public expenditure,
acceleration of privatization, trade and tariff reforms and
developing of pension fund in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
He said while accelerating the process of privatization they
also tend to include in the list of privatization some
infrastructure projects such as airports.
</P>
<P>
A task force was also set up for recommendation on "fiscal
federalism" in the context of National Finance Commission (NFC),
he added.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to reform the "extremely weak banking sector," a
"Resolution Trust Corporation" (RTC) will be set up to deal with
bad loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
As most problems come from bad management, the caretaker
government will look for experts with high capability and
integrity to eliminate corruption, inefficiency and poor
management in banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The interim government will also address issues in capital
market and agriculture tax system in the country.
</P>
<P>
Burki, a senior World Bank official who arrived here on Friday,
believed that Pakistan had the potential to reach much higher
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said he was optimistic that the caretaker government, unlike
previous caretaker governments, would achieve its targets within
90 days.
</P>
<P>
President Farooq Leghari asked Burki in Washington to take the
job and set the country's economy on track after he dismissed the
government of Benazir Bhutto on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Demands DPRK Apology for Submarine Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam said today that his country will not supply light-water
nuclear reactors to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) unless Pyongyang apologizes for the recent submarine
incursion, and promises to prevent a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
Kim said it was difficult for South Korea to support the
nuclear reactor project under circumstances in which the DPRK
"continues military provocations".
</P>
<P>
Financial support and the dispatch of technicians for the
project would be suspended indefinitely, he added.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean president was quoted by the Washington Post as
saying that without a DPRK apology, inter-Korean dialogue would
not be pushed ahead, nor aid offered to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has said that a total of 26 armed DPRK people
"infiltrated" into the country's Kangwon Province from a grounded
submarine in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) on September 18.
</P>
<P>
Of the 26 "intruders", one is still at large, while 13 were
shot dead by South Korean troops, 11 were found killed by their
colleagues and one was captured alive in a massive manhunt in the
rugged mountains.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK argued that the submarine, while on a training
mission, drifted after having engine trouble and hitting a rock.
</P>
<P>
However, Seoul claimed that the intrusion was not an
"inadvertent incident that occurred during routine training" as
Pyongyang said, but was a "carefully premediated act of
provocation".
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has threatened to take retaliatory steps against South
Korea for the killing of DPRK people who "landed ashore in South
Korea due to the engine trouble of the submarine".
</P>
<P>
Under the Washington-Pyongyang framework agreement signed in
Geneva in October 1994, two 1,000-megawatt light-water nuclear
reactors were to be provided to the DPRK in return for freezing
its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO),
which is a multinational consortium led by the U.S., South Korea
and Japan, is responsible for supplying the two reactors to the
DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The KEDO has selected South Korea as the prime supplier of the
light-water reactors. Seoul will finance a lion's share of the
5-billion-U.S.-dollar reactor project.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Delays While Refugees Face Death in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today delayed
the launching of a military intervention in Zaire as thousands of
Rwandan refugees are reportedly dying of hunger, thirst, disease
and exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
Despite an emergency call by U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali for "an action of urgency" in eastern Zaire, the
U.N. member countries are still pondering over ways to launch such
an intervention.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoting witnesses among 1 million refugees trapped in
the small bay of Sake, beside Lake Kivu, as saying that thousands
of refugee children were dying.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted officials of the humanitarian
organization, Medecins sans Frontiere, as saying that each day of
delay cost thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
They said at least 13,600 refugees had died in the past few
days and thousands were on the verge of dying.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross said a cholera
epidemic was breaking out among the refugees, and it could kill
100,000 to 150,000 people very quickly.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted officials of the U.N. High Commission for Refugees
as saying that rescue workers were repelled by the odor of corpses
in a forest which used to be the site of a large refugee camp in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sporadic fighting is continuing between Zairean
troops and Banyamulenge Tutsis in eastern Zaire's Kivu region. The
region was taken by the Tutsi rebels but still shelters resistance
pockets of the Zairean army, joined by former Rwandan Hutu
military men and militias.
</P>
<P>
Hutu extremists fired mortars toward Goma today from the hills
west of the city, where some 400,000 refugees are still staying
and are being constantly intimidated by Hutu extremists who fled
to Zaire after committing genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda in
1994.

<HEADLINE> New System of Foreign Exchange Primarily Set Up in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China has set up a new system
of foreign exchange which comports with the socialist market
economy and is in accordance with international conventions,
according to a senior exchange official.
</P>
<P>
Significant changes have taken place in China's foreign
exchange administrative system since 1994, said Xu Bin, deputy
head of the State Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC), who
spoke at today's closing ceremony of a symposium on the system of
foreign exchange and related policies.
</P>
<P>
The six-day meeting in south China's city of Shenzhen was
jointly sponsored by the SAEC and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). It was held as part of a project sponsored by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) to assist China's foreign
exchange system reform.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that some problems which occurred during the reform
process need to be studied further, using successful experiences
from throughout the world as reference.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 participants from across the country discussed
theories, methods and the formation of a system of exchange rates,
as well as the foreign exchange market, policy coordination
between domestic and foreign exchanges, management of capital
projects, and Article VIII of Article of Agreement of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Six foreign financial experts from IMF, Chili, the Republic of
Korea and France attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> WFP Airlifts Food to Refugees in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
will start airlifting high protein biscuits from Uganda to
refugees in eastern Zaire, a WFP news release available here
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 100 tons of food will be flown to Entebbe, Uganda
under the assistance of the governments of Belgium and the
Netherlands, and it is enough to feed 100,000 refugees for about
one week, said the release.
</P>
<P>
The first consignment was carried out by four Belgian airforce
Hercules aircraft today, each carrying 15 tons of supplies. On
Sunday, a DC-10 jetliner of the Netherlands airforce will deliver
an additional 40 tons, and additional flights could follow.
</P>
<P>
The move comes as WFP Executive Director Catherine Bertini
warned that more than 80,000 children below the age of three
could die by the end of November if they receive no food and
medical suplies.
</P>
<P>
"They'll die because of the lack of food, the lack of
sanitation and the lack of water and of the diseases that have
quickly moved through these populations," Bertini said, noting
that the children represented the most vulnerable sector of the
refugee population.
</P>
<P>
About 1.2 million refugees are caught in the fighting between
Tutsi rebels and Zairean troops in eastern Zaire in the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Bertini urged governments to seek a political solution to the
humanitarian crisis which is gripping the region.

<HEADLINE> Drug Smuggler Swallows 390 Grams of Heroin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian drug smuggler who
had swallowed 390 grams of heroin packed in 79 bags was arrested
by anti-narcotics agents, a press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian-language daily Ettella't reported that the
smuggler, who came from Iranshahr in Sistan-Baluchestan province,
was arrested at Tehran's railway station in southern Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the smuggler was initially suspected by
anti-narcotics agents of carrying the contraband, and then was
transferred to police station for body search and questions.
</P>
<P>
The smuggler confessed to having swallowed the drug after he
began to suffer from pain in the stomach. The man was only
identified as Taher. His age and family name were not revealed by
the report.
</P>
<P>
The drug issue is regarded as one of the main social problems
 of Iran since it is one of the best transit for drug to Europe
and is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the border area between
Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest drug-producing
centers in the world.
</P>
<P>
In its border with Afghanistan and Pakistan, Iran has built
1,400 kilometers of roads and 150 kilometers of canals in order
to prevent drug smugglers from entering the country.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Promises Israel Equal Treatment at Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that Egypt would not marginalize Israel as a
special case at the forthcoming Cairo economic conference, which
highlights regional cooperation in parallel with the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Israel would be just another normal country as any other
participant at the conference... The message we try to put through
is no country underlined," Moussa said at a press conference on
the imminent third Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian top diplomat also dismissed a question about
personal security for the Israeli delegates in Cairo, with a quip
"What do you think?" to loud laughter.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating his point, Moussa said Egypt is not trying to hide
its criticism of Israeli attitudes to the peace process and
insists on a just and balanced peace based on the Madrid, Oslo
principles and relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said "peace process is a collective effort... There are
so many countries in the region and so many interests involved, so
we should include Israel as just a normal state to talk to in
order to allow the continuation of regional cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Israeli ties have deteriorated since Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu took power in June. The recent
setbacks in the peace process once even threatened convocation of
the economic conference itself.
</P>
<P>
After all, Israel is a part of the Middle East region and
beyond. "All the countries invited are equal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possible outcome of the Cairo conference, the
foreign minister said despite the "gloom" above the meeting, he
stressed the possibility that peace would prevail. "At least I
don't think it would throw peace away."
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the same vein, the Egyptian minister dismissed the
two previous MENA conferences in Casablanca and Amman as wrongly
oriented and misnamed even from its birthday.
</P>
<P>
Cairo conference has adopted a correct approach, he said in a
sense of "letting businessmen do business."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Israeli economic ties remain limited in scope after
Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, in terms of
agriculture, tourism and Egyptian oil exports to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between Egypt and Israel has been
limited. Trade with Arab countries accounts for about only 10
percent of Israel's total trade.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo conference will follow the 200 or so Israeli
projects, mainly on cooperation in tourism, agriculture and
infrastructure. All of them were discussed at Casablanca and
Amman but left unattended so far.
</P>
<P>
As a result of Netanyahu's hardline policy and the stalemate in
the peace process, some Egyptian businessmen have decided to stay
away from the Cairo conference. Many Israeli businessmen and
several cabinet ministers responded with a boycott as well.
</P>
<P>
Only 50 businessmen representing Israel governmental
institutions and an equal number from the private sector are
expected to show up.

<HEADLINE> Italian Cyclists Urges Blood Testing Against Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian cyclists urged to use
blood tests against banned substances in the sport, newspapers
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hein Verbruggen, head of the World Cycling Union (UCI),
applauded the riders' initiative and said the UCI was ready to
meet their request.
</P>
<P>
La Gazzetta dello Sport, Italy's leading sports daily, said
the Italian riders' association ACCPI met in Milan on Friday and
issued a statement saying the riders were willing to undergo blood
tests provided the UCI set up coherent procedures for carrying
them out.
</P>
<P>
Under current regulations, the winner and two riders picked at
random undergo urine tests after each race. But some substances do
not always show up in urine tests and blood checks are considered
more thorough.
</P>
<P>
The use of banned substances in cycling hit the headlines last
month when former world record holder Graeme Obree of Scotland
alleged it was widespread among riders.

<HEADLINE> France Faces Veto by Rwandan, Zairean Tutsis in Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- France, fighting for the staging
of an international intervention in eastern Zaire, is facing a
veto by Rwandan and Zairean Tutsis from joining such an
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda accused France of having a second thought in calling for
such an intervention, and blamed it for helping the former Hutu
regime of Rwanda and rescuing many Hutu extremists in the
"Turquoise" operation in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Zaire's Banyamulenge Tutsis also suspect that France is trying
to keep Mobutu Sese Seko in power, considering the special
relationship between France and Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu said Friday that France and
Belgium, two European neo-colonial powers which he said have
interests in the Great Lakes region, should "abstain from
contributing" to a multinational force.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana said in Bonn, Germany,
on Friday that Rwanda approved of the deployment of a Euro-African
force in the Great Lakes region, on the condition that the force
be strictly neutral.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want another adventure such as those which we once
knew in Rwanda," said Gasana, referring to the "Turquoise"
operation launched by 2,500 French troops in southwest Rwanda to
save more than 1 million refugees from epidemics in July and
August of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The operation set up a security zone along the Rwandan-Zairean
border and stopped the advance of the Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Army.
</P>
<P>
It also saved tens of thousands of the feared Interahamwe Hutu
militias and the Rwandan Armed Forces of the former Hutu regime,
held responsible for the death of half a million Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Laurent-Desire Kabila, leader of the Banyamulenge Tutsis, said
that France wanted to save the regime of Mobutu, which is on the
verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
This view is shared by Etienne Tshisekedi, the opposition
leader of Zaire, who condemned the "Turquoise" operation and
accused Mobutu of "selling Zaire's national sovereignty" to France.
</P>
<P>
France, which has staged more than 20 military interventions in
Africa since the independence of the black continent in the 1960s,
launched three military interventions in Zaire in 1977, 1978 and
1991, all of which resulted in the maintenance of the government
of Mobutu.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds Divorce Rate On Rise in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Divorce is on the rise in the
Chinese capital of Beijing, with ten out of every 1,000 couples
splitting up -- nearly three percent more than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the Beijing Statistics
Bureau, the divorce rate increased most rapidly among people under
50. The age group most vulnerable to marriage failure is 30-39
year-olds; five years ago, 40-49 year-olds were most susceptible.
</P>
<P>
However, the rate dropped by 0.04 percent among people over 50,
according to the report, which was carried in today's "People's
Daily."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the national divorce rate was reported as 7.1 per
thousand.
</P>
<P>
The report revealed that the institute of marriage has changed
a lot in recent years in Beijing, which has 12 million
residents. The unmarried population there has decreased, and young
people are getting married later in life than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that among people older than 15, unmarried
people accounted for 18.9 percent, dropping by 3.23 percentage
points compared with 1991.
</P>
<P>
"This is mainly because the aging population has kept
increasing in Beijing," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of single men in the capital is higher than that
of single women, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found more and more middle-aged and old people
who lost their spouses have remarried. From that group, people
older than 50 accounted for 50.72 percent of the total population
who lost their spouses but married again, the report said.

out- and in-patients registered in hospitals are TB cases with
the highest death toll resulting from the same aliment.
</P>
<P>
She said lack of immediate medical treatment for patients,
malnutrition, diabetics, cancer and aids which greatly reduce
bodily resistance are some of the major causes for the fast
spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
With proper treatment and follow-up, the ailment is curable,
she said, adding that sanitation, vaccination of children against
the disease, treatment of patients will help control the
incidence of the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Meaza, the controlling program has succeeded
in giving coverage to about 50 percent of the total area of the
country and 80 percent of the patients have been totally cured of
the ailment in the past five years.

MOSCOW, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
who was transferred Friday to Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital,
is undergoing a normal recovery from the quintuple heart bypass
operation, the Kremlin press service said today.

The new hospital, with tighter security in comparison with the
Cardiology Research Center where the operation was done Tuesday,
can better protect Yeltsin from disturbance by reporters.
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old president, who has been able to walk by his
bed, can do some mental work including talking, reading and
issuing orders.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Continue Protest near Ledra Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of Greek Cypriots
today continued their anti-occupation protest near the Ledra
Palace checkpoint in Nicosia for the fourth weekend.
</P>
<P>
The group, led by MP Marios Matsakis, comprises mothers of
people missing since the 1974 Turkish invasion and relatives of men
killed recently by the Turkish troops and extremists.
</P>
<P>
The protesters tried to dissuade foreign tourists from
visiting the Turkish-controlled northern part of the island and
spending money there.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus police have taken security measures to protect
free movement through the U.N.-controlled checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government and the U.N. have expressed
disagreement with the Ledra Palace protest.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Turkish Cypriot side closed the Ledra
Palace checkpoint in retaliation for the Greek Cypriots' protest,
barring the enclaved Greek Cypriots from returning to their
homes in the north.
</P>
<P>
The closure cuts the only link some 500 enclaved Greek
Cypriots and 200 Maronites living in the north have with their
relatives in the south.
</P>
<P>
Matsakis turned down what he called the blackmail of the
Turkish Cypriot regime and vowed to continue the protest on a
daily basis instead of every weekend.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Turkish Cypriot side opened Friday
the checkpoint under the U.N. pressure allowing enclaved Greek
Cypriots and Maronites to cross to the government-controlled
southern areas.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot regime, however, warned that if the
Ledra Palace campaign to stop tourists continues on a daily
basis from this weekend, as promised by organizers, tougher
retaliatory measures will be imposed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following
an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
A 180-kilometer-long buffer zone across the island was created
separating Cyprus into two parts.
</P>
<P>
The Ledra Palace checkpoint in Nicosia is the only place
through which people can cross into and from the
Turkish-controlled northern part of the island.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Italy Sign 561 Million Dollar Steel Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Italy today signed a 561
million dollar steel contract with Iran despite U.S. sanction
against the Islamic Republic, local media reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that the contract signed
by the Iranian steel authorities and the Italian Danieli
Company will help Iran boost its steel output from 10 million
tons to 12.5 million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
The contract stipulates that Italy will help Iran build a
steel plant in the northeastern province of Khorassan as well as
a steel plant in the northwestern province of East Azarbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Italian company will also help Iran expand
steel production capacity in two plants -- one in Isfahan
and the other in Khouzestan.
</P>
<P>
A source at the Iranian Ministry of Mines and Metals said
that the total cost of the projects was estimated at 3,200 billion
rials (about one billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The source said that Medio Creditoi, an Italian governmental
financing company, will cooperate with banks from Italy, France,
Japan, Germany, Holland, Britain and Belgium to finance the
steel project in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The payment of the loan will start from the year 2000
from revenues earned from exportation of steel products, it
added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh's Jute Spinning Industry Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's jute spinning
industry is facing a decline and the mills in the export-oriented
sector may become sick unless the government takes remedial steps
to increase the industry's competitiveness in the world export
market.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bangladesh Jute Spinners Association (BJSA),
export volume of the sector declined by 7.08 percent while the
earnings fell by 10.55 percent during the July-September period of
the current 1996-1997 fiscal year compared to the corresponding
period of 1995-1996, the year the industry earned over tk 2.84
billion (about 67.6 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
While the sector's exports declined from 103,872 tons in
1994-1995 to 97,250 tons in 1995-1996, the country's share of the
world jute yarn and twine market also declined from 51.94 percent
to 48.62 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The BJSA attributed the decline to an uneven competition it is
facing from India, the other major jute exporter in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Because of its competitive advantage resulting from effective
exchange rate management and upgraded export incentives like
external market assistance at the rate of 10 percent on export of
jute yarn, India is expected to capture the share of the export
market of Thailand, which is closing its mills due to a shortfall
in kenaf production, as well as a significant portion of
Bangladesh's share of the market, BJSA officials explained.
</P>
<P>
Currently, of the global annual demand for jute yarn of 200,000
tons, Bangladesh's share of the market is 48.62 percent while
India commands 35.05 percent and Thailand 16.36 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the Indian government has also taken up a massive
jute sector diversification program with the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) assistance and is planning to export
80,000 tons of jute yarn and twine in 1996-1997, up from only
17,841 tons in 1990-1991," the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the production costs of the Bangladeshi jute sector
have also gone up due to the recent increase in power tariff and
wage hike of workers which was prompted by the government step to
increase the wages of the public sector. The jute spinning mills
also have to pay a higher interest rate on bank loans compared to
the traditional jute mills.
</P>
<P>
In order to solve the problems of the jute yarn and twine
sector, the BJSA has already asked the government to provide it
with similar export incentives based on the FOB (free on board)
price for 3 years starting from July this year and also for
initiating a more competitive exchange rate management to
effectively meet the competition in the global market.
</P>
<P>
As the largest jute producer in the world, the Bangladeshi jute
industry has been one of the pillar sectors in the country's
economy. During the last 17 years, exports of BJSA mills,
comprising 34 member mills, grew by 655 percent in volume while
the production capacity expanded by 1,168 percent. The export
earnings from the sector contributed 30 percent to the total
export earnings from the jute manufacturing sector during the
previous fiscal year of 1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the government comes forward to solve the problems
immediately, this important export sector will suffer huge losses
and the mills will turn into sick industries," cautioned the BJSA
Chairman Shabbir Yusuf, adding that "if the sector is given
adequate incentives, then Bangladesh will be able to capture 70
percent of the world market. But if we lose the market share it
will be very difficult to regain it."

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Children Refugees Face Death in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan children, among the 1.2
million refugees in eastern Zaire, are dying of hunger, thirst,
disease and malnutrition, Agence France Presse (AFP) quotes
witnesses who visited the refugees as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is very hard. There is no water, no latrines. People have
nothing to eat," a witness said.
</P>
<P>
The displaced civilians of Zaire are also suffering from
diarrhea and vomiting. They fear an uncontrollable outbreak of
epidemic diseases among about 1 million refugees and civilians in
Sake, a small bay beside Lake Kivu, 27 kilometers from Goma.
</P>
<P>
These children were extremely weak after walking hundreds of
kilometers from the refugee camps from which they were driven out
by fightings in the past several weeks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the refugee camp of Mugunga, near Goma, which was once
described by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees as
the largest refugee camp in the world, with about 400,000 people,
some refugees were still staying on -- together with some Hutu
extremists were preparing to attack Goma, the agency quoted
Banyamulenge Tutsis as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 1 million refugees blocked in Sake were unable to move to
Goma because they would have to pass Mugunga, which was
infiltrated by armed Hutu extremists.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Navy Introduces More High Technology to Simulate Battle Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese navy has been using
hi-tech virtual reality systems to help improve combat
capabilities and simulate actual battle conditions.
</P>
<P>
A just-closed military exhibition revealed that the navy has
entered the comprehensive computer era, with crews using some 200
hi-tech machines to create realistic images of fighting.
</P>
<P>
Complicated multi-media technology and computer networks
displayed at the exhibition can be used for an electronic war, and
are capable of carrying out anti-aircraft strikes,
surface-to-surface missile launches, helicopter-submarine
confrontations, submarine control and other navy operations,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The systems were developed by the navy over the last five
years, according to an officer responsible for the research.
</P>
<P>
He said that the navy holds few combat exercises that use live
ammunition each year, as they require extensive cooperation among
related departments and large amounts of material resources.
</P>
<P>
The simulated training machines allow the navy to carry out
high quality exercises at any time, he explained.

General of the MBLPA Hau-Wah Ho said that the association is to
take special measures as well as traditional methods to promote
the law so as to ensure a stable transition in the coming years
and a proper implementation of the policy of "one country, two
systems" after 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the traditional comprehensive programs to promote
the law among the broad masses of populace, we will hold
activities to promote the law among specialized groups such as the
youngsters and the civil servants," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1993 when the basic law was promulgated,
the association has been holding symposiums, lectures, tea
parties, specialized study courses, contests, grand gatherings and
composition of songs featuring the law to make the law familiar
with more citizens in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"More and more people in Macao have become aware of the law,"
Ho said, adding "that has helped increase their confidence in the
future of Macao."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, promotion of the law in the Chinese mainland will be
conducted at a wider sphere, he said, adding that "the more people
know about the law, the better will the law be implemented."
</P>
<P>
Chui Tak Kei, president of the MBLPA, announced that to gather
more fund for the promotion campaign, a song and dance troupe from
Guangzhou, capital of neighboring Guangdong province, will give
out a performance early next month in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Although we cannot expect how much we will collect by that
event, we estimate that we will need some five million Patacas
(642,000 US dollars) for the promotion campaign in the coming
three years," said Chui.

<HEADLINE> Macao Launches Airport Expansion Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The expansion of the parking
apron of the Macao International Airport and the construction of a
ground maintenance center started today, exactly one year after
the airport's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the parking apron, which will cost 55 million
patacas (about 6.96 million U.S. dollars), will be finished in
about seven months, according to airport authorities.
</P>
<P>
The new apron will be able to park 19 planes instead of the
current 16.
</P>
<P>
With a total cost of 50 million patacas (about 6.33 million
dollars), the ground maintenance center will be able to handle
such large aircraft as Boeing 747 upon its completion in about
seven months.
</P>
<P>
"We are running a good business," said Joao Manuel de Sousa
Moreira, president of the Macao International Airport Company.
</P>
<P>
"We expect a better business in the coming years and it is
necessary to add the new facilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 air companies have so far opened air routes to
the Macao airport, which is expected to handle 1.2 million
passengers by the end of the year. Cargo shipment via the airport
has been increasing rapidly over the past several months.
</P>
<P>
The construction of a four-star airport hotel also started
today. The 21-story building facing the main building of the
airport will be built at a cost of 400 million patacas (about 50.6
million dollars) and be completed in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the hotel will have 320 guest rooms and
several bridges linking to the departure hall of the airport. It
will be the only hotel located near the airport.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Politics, of High Cost, Vicious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- With Thailand's general
election set to take place in a week's time, defects in Thai
politics have manifested themselves more glaringly as politicians
are trying to get themselves elected by hook or crook.
</P>
<P>
Although Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa's call for a
general election was largely welcomed in the country as the people
hoped for a change for a better government, the people, on the
other hand, were also clearly dissatisfied with the state of Thai
politics and wanted a change for better politics.
</P>
<P>
However, Thai politics has not yet escaped from the "same old
vicious circle," as caretaker Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra
has put it. The communications tycoon-turned politician decided
not to contest the November 17 election.
</P>
<P>
The vicious circle begins with the dissolution of Parliament.
When a new election has to be held, it is done at the taxpayers'
expense.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the dissolution, many MPs start switching
parties or "selling" themselves to other parties, at prices
ranging from 20 million to 50 million baht (800,000-2 million US
dollars), depending on their chances of re-election.
</P>
<P>
During the election, candidates for the new house win their
seats through, among other things, widespread vote-buying,
although under law it is illegal.
</P>
<P>
A voter could be paid between 120 to 200 baht (4.8 to 8
dollars), depending on the degree of bitterness of contest in the
constituency.
</P>
<P>
The Farmers Bank Research Center predicted that for the
November 17 poll, at least 20 billion baht (800 million dollars)
will be spent on election-related activities, including MP-buying,
vote-buying, advertisements and campaigning.
</P>
<P>
The figure for the July 2 poll of last year was 17 billion baht
(680 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the "human cost" is inestimable. During the
past three weeks of campaigning, about a dozen election-related
attempts of murders have been reported.
</P>
<P>
Upon entering Parliament, the MPs' priorities will be repaying
their financiers and supporters, through, for example, granting
special favors or government contracts to them.
</P>
<P>
When this has been done, they will then look for ways to obtain
money for next elections.
</P>
<P>
The government, in most cases a coalition, focuses on
preserving its stability and prolonging its period in office,
rather than working in earnest to solve any burning issues the
country faces.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to dealing with national issues, they tend to
focus on immediate ones and those that will bring about benefits
to either themselves or to their benefactors.
</P>
<P>
A Thai businessman told Xinhua, "we shall have to bleed anyway.
But we also expect some kind of return, if the candidates I have
financially backed, win a seat."
</P>
<P>
When a coalition government is formed (as no party has ever
achieved a majority in the last few elections), the government is
bound to be faction-ridden and rift-ridden, especially over
cabinet portfolios, which are often filled on the basis of quotas,
not qualifications.
</P>
<P>
With money politics dominating the political system, ministers
are especially open to charges of corruption, which, when raised
at a censure debate, could lead to the collapse of the government
and dissolution of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the next cycle of Thai politics begins.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll conducted by Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat
Institute between October 22 and November 6 sheds light on the
feelings of the 2,038 respondents:
</P>
<P>
All believed that vote-buying exists in the country; 96 percent
believed some politicians receive kickbacks from big projects; 94
percent hoped that political reform should begin immediately; 85
percent were sure that most of the "undesirable" MPs will be
re-elected; and that 84 percent believed that some members of the
"dream teams" for salvaging the economy may be tainted by
corruption.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Claim Victory in 2 Battlefields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
said today that it had given heavy blows to the anti-Taliban
alliance on two fronts in the country.
</P>
<P>
A report from Kabul said that the Taliban forces launched a
massive attack Thursday on the ousted government troops led by
Ahmad Shah Masood and Uzbek Militia led by Rashid Dostum north of
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
During the attack, the Taliban killed 16 fighters of the
Masood-Dostum alliance and captured a large stock of ammunition
and two hilltops near the strategic Bagram Airbase, about 50
kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban also repulsed an attack launched by
Dostum in Badgis province in northwestern Afghanistan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Besides forces loyal to Masood and Dostum, the six-party
anti-Taliban alliance which was set up last month also includes
Hezb-i-Wahdat (Khalili group), Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar group),
Inqilab-i-Islami led by Sayed Ahmed Gailani, and forces loyal to
former Herat governor Iamael Khan.
</P>
<P>
Dostum and Masood, who have strong military forces
respectively, are the two backbones of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Taliban were still locked in fighting with the
joint forces of Dostum and Masood near Kabul and in western
Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government will make
a positive assessment on the country's economy, citing higher
consumer spending and increased industrial production.
</P>
<P>
In the draft report for the November economy, the Economic
Planning Agency (EPA) will upgrade its overall assessment, stating
"the economy is continuing to move on recovery track, albeit
modestly. Private demand is increasing its firmness," reported an
economic daily here today.
</P>
<P>
EPA issues economic report every month. The November report
will be published next Tuesday, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
According to EPA, private demand is now leading the economy,
citing an example that brisk sales of new model vehicles in
September and October posted a rise of some eight percent from a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The report will better the assessment for capital investment,
with the total investment for the current fiscal year ending in
March put at seven to eight percent, backed in part by an upturn
in such investment by the nonmanufacturing sector, and small and
midsize businesses.
</P>
<P>
While stating that capital investment is heading for recovery,
the government also noticed the downward pace of exports, or
overseas demand, which is slowing down mainly because a weakening
of the yen has taken hold, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Shimpei Nukaya, vice minister of the EPA, says the economy is
still on a moderate recovery track, according to the newspaper.

<P>
URUMQI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur

million tons this year, 100,000 tons more than the record harvest
of last year.

<P>
Zhang said that 17,500-ha of cotton has been damaged by such
natural adversities as low temperature, hailstone and floods this

"However, the region still reached a good cotton harvest thanks
to the efforts made by the autonomous regional government to sent

develop cotton production," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Adopts Resolution to End Zaire Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Security Council
early this morning adopted a resolution urging member states to
make arrangement for resumption of humanitarian aid to more than
one million displaced persons and refugees in Eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It requests member states concerned to report to the Council as
soon as possible such arrangement so as to enable it to authorize
the deployment of a multinational humanitarian task force.
</P>
<P>
The cost of this operation will be borne by participating
nations and other contributions.
</P>
<P>
It also requests the Secretary-General to draw up a plan for
the initiative and report to the Council with recommendations no
later than 20 November.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Eastern Zaire deteriorated recently and U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had wrote four letters to
the president of Security Council, asking for urgent action.
</P>
<P>
Council members devoted several sessions Friday to consider the
draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
The document urges all states in the great lakes region to make
favorable conditions for a speedy and peaceful resolution of the
crisis, respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
states and facilitate the delivery of international humanitarian
assistance to the suffering people there.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the meeting, China expressed the
view in the process of consultations that formation of any
multinational force must obtain consent from Zaire and other
nations concerned. It should confine itself to humanitarian
purpose.
</P>
<P>
These views have found their expressions in the resolution.

KAMPALA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Spraying chemicals to wipe out
water hyacinth on Lake Victoria has been put on hold, and the

complete, the Parliament Committee on Natural Resources learned.
</P>
<P>
"The New Vision" paper today quoted Professor John Okedi,
Executive Director of the National Environment Management
Authority, as telling the committee yesterday that an EIA report

Disagreement crops up when it comes to the use of chemicals
to eradicate the killer weed which has blocked traffic,
suffocated the fishes and affected the livelihood of people
around the lake.

The 17-member parliament committee is now on a study tour to
assess priority environmental concern in the eastern cities of
Jinja and Tororo.
</P>
<P>
At the electric power plant of Owen Falls Dam in eastern

chemicals would kill the weed which would later sink and block
the turbines and stop electricity generation.

municipal construction and economic development, the special
meterological consultancy services have been playing a more
important role in China's leading industrial city of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1984, the Shanghai Meterological Center
has been providing major urban development projects with
meterological information, climate appraisals and weather
forecasts for their site selection and structure designing, and

for the site selection of the construction projects, but offer
scientific parameters for their structure designing, selection of
material, and safety guarantee for the engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Shanghai departments in charge of electric
power and tap water departments, and companies producing
refrigerators, air-conditioners, drinks, food, and garments also

<HEADLINE> Supervision System Introduced in Resettlement Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The system of supervision and
management, previously used soly in capital construction, has been
introduced in the resettlement of people at construction sites of
large projects for the first time in China.
</P>
<P>
The practice has been proved successful in relocating people
living in the construction and reservoir areas of Xiaolangdi
Water-control Project, 40 km north of Luoyang City in central
China's Henan Province and the largest multi-purpose dam project
on the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The system helped to guarantee the smooth proceeding of the
project, lower investment and raise efficiency, said Xi Meihua,
director of the Xiaolangdi Resettlement Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Resettlement of population at Xiaolangdi construction site
is a project involving loans provided the International
Development Association (IDA). To date, 110 million US dollars
have been used to build housing and auxiliary projects for the
resettlement population.
</P>
<P>
The supervisory body has overseen the use of funds for
the resettlement purpose for three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Supervision on environment protection included regular
monitoring of gas, noise and dust pollution, water quality and
garbage disposal.
</P>
<P>
It also conducted administrative supervision which included the
progress in resettling people, engineering quality, performance of
regulations and rules and job training for emigrants.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement project at Xiaolangdi set an example for the
cooperation between the World Bank and China and opened a new path
for other countries in using World Bank loans in building large
water control projects and resettling emigrants, said Gautam Kaji,
managing director of WB's operation sector, after an inspection
tour to Xiaolangdi.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi Project will affect 200,000 local residents living
in eight counties in the Shanxi and Henan provinces. It contained
two parts, namely, construction area and reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
The first part, which involved 10,000 residents in construction
site, has completed. The resettled people's annual income has
increased by 15 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The second part, includes the relocation of 190,000 people in
the reservoir area. Some 46,000 people will be moved into 34
newly-built villages before the end of June in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Brain Drain Affects Development in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Africa loses to developed
countries at least 20,000 trained professionals each year,
including doctors, engineers and university lecturers, the East
African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a recent report by the African-Caribbean-
Pacific-European Union as saying that the African continent is
suffering from a serious shortage of trained professionals.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Africa had lost more than 60,000
professionals between 1985 and 1990 and the figure continues to
rise at alarming proportions.
</P>
<P>
The report said that over 21,000 Nigerian doctors were
practising in the United States alone, whereas Nigeria was short
of enough medical practitioners.
</P>
<P>
In Ghana, 60 percent of doctors trained locally in the 1980s
have left the country, according to the United Nations
Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper noted that Kenya was among the nations
which had lost a substantial number of professionals to developed
countries, notably the United States, Canada and Europe, and
lately to Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress Research has said that the U.S. government
gains at least 20,000 U.S. Dollars annually on its skilled
migrants from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
By the rather conservative calculation, the paper said, the
African continent had lost more than 1.2 billion U.S. Dollars of
investment on the 60,000 African professionals migrating from
1985 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
Today there are more than a million and a half skilled
professionals from developing countries working in European
countries, the United States, Japan and Canada.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that developing countries are losing colossal
amounts of investment annually to the developed countries, it
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Air Crash Kills 141 on Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- No survivors have been found
after a Nigerian Boeing 727 airliner crashed near Lagos Thursday,
a Nigerian aviation ministry official said today.
</P>
<P>
"All the 141 people that were on board the plane died," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
An aviation ministry official said that search teams found the
wreckage of the plane in a lagoon at Egbin, outside Lagos, Friday
after losing contact with the plane for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
"The air craft plunged into a lagoon," said Aviation Minister
Ita Udoh Umeh, who toured the crash site about 65 kilometers from
Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Aviation officials here said no one could have survived because
of the long time it took to locate the wreckage in the
swamps. Rescuers only saw a wing stuck out of the water and shoes
floating about
</P>
<P>
Flight ADC086, operated by the private Aviation Development
Company (ADC), lost contact with the control tower in Lagos on
Thursday evening just minutes before it was due to land.
</P>
<P>
The plane was flying from the southeastern oil city of Port
Harcourt to Lagos carrying 132 passengers and nine crew members.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims were at least five Britons, one German,
Italian, Israeli and American, but they were not immediately
identified, pending contact with their family members or relatives.
</P>
<P>
News reports here said the captain reported engine trouble and
requested emergency landing before the plane disappeared from the
radar and lost contact with air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Aviation Development Company has declined further
comments on the crash, referring all enquiries to the Nigerian
Federal Airports Authority.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst air crash in Nigeria in four years after a
C-130 transport plane crashed near Lagos in September 1992,
killing 173 people aboard.

</P>
<P>
The daily in its report mentioned Hiroko Matsuo at the
Japanese Embassy and James Polhemus at the U.S. Embassy in
Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the two embassy officials have held a
series of secret meetings with local monitoring groups, asking
them to take a tough stance against the government.
</P>
<P>
However, Matsuo reportedly said it was not true she had
promised monitors that they ''would swim in money'' if they
forced the government to postpone the elections to early next
year.
</P>
<P>
She admitted meeting and giving operation funds to some local
monitoring groups. Despite the funding, she said, ''we never told
anyone to stand for or against the government.''
</P>
<P>
Afred Zulu, Chairman of the Zambia Independent Monitoring
Team, admitted receiving funding from the Japanese and U.S.
governments and meeting the two officials but said, ''we do not

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang to Accelerate Resources Prospecting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, northwest China, will be turned into China's oil and
petrochemical industrial base as well as reserve bases for the
country's non-ferrous, gold and building materials.
</P>
<P>
This plan, mapped out by the autonomous region, is aimed to
help support China's sustained economic development in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Geological workers have planned to further verify oil and
natural gas resource potentials and find more large oilfields in
Tarim, Junggar and Hami-Turpan basins Basin in the coming five
years.
</P>
<P>
They will also work hard to prove mineral resource deposits in
the autonomous region's mountainous areas and provide scientific
and geological basis for the country to start new ore-finding
schemes.
</P>
<P>
At the end of this century, Xinjiang is expected to discover
oil and gas, and minerals in 100 sites, make preparations for
mineral prospecting in five to 10 leading places, and form two
important new bases for developing mineral resources, according to
Wang Futong, chief engineer of the Autonomous Geology and Mineral
Resources Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The chief engineer was confident for the future of resources
prospecting in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Xinjiang will be added with proven
deposits of a host of mineral resources in the coming five
years. They include 1.5 billion tons of petroleum and 370 billion
cu m of natural gas, four billion tons of coal and 120 tons of
gold.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Xinjiang will produce 25 million tons of
crude oil, 33 million tons of coal, 250,000 ounces of gold and
turn out 70,000 tons of major metals.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wang emphasized the importance of prospecting of
water resources.
</P>
<P>
"We will strive to discover major water sources in 15 places so
that we are able to cope with the growing demand for building the
region's major agricultural development zones, oil development
zones and petrochemical industrial bases, and to guarantee
Xinjiang's position in the whole country's agriculture and oil
industry," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is also the country's largest cotton producing base
and a leading grain production center.
</P>
<P>
Wang believed that if this plan is implemented smoothly, the
country's shortage of resources in early next century will be
greatly alleviated, especially gold, copper and other precious
minerals.
</P>
<P>
Located in the hinterland of Eurasian Continent, Xinjiang,
which has one sixth of China's territory, has so far discovered
138 kinds of ores, found minerals in over 4,000 sites and 100
important mineral belts.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the remote autonomous region boasts 27
percent of China's petroleum and natural gas resources and 40
percent of the country's coal reserves.

<HEADLINE> India's Finance Ministry Plans to Cut Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Union Finance
Ministry is working on a comprehensive action plan to reduce the
level of subsidies provided by the center and state governments, a
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The government, apart from placing a paper on subsidies in the
winter session of Parliament later this month, would also convene
a conference of the chief ministers to work out a common strategy
to reduce subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The strategy to be placed before the conference envisaged
phased reduction in subsidies -- both direct and hidden -- as a
proportion of GDP (gross domestic product) along with initiating
concrete measures to improve recovery rates in the provision of
public services, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to some recent estimates, India's total subsidies on
social and economic services provided by the center and state
governments more than doubled between 1987-88 and 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
The action plan would also involve complete removal of
subsidies on certain services that are deemed non-essential.
</P>
<P>
Most of the cutbacks will be in economic services such as
irrigation and power supply, the same source said.
</P>
<P>
Since more than 60 percent of the subsidies were provided by
state governments, the final outcome would depend on the
willingness of the state governments, he added.

<HEADLINE> Elderly People in Difficulty Get Bottom-line Living Expenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Elderly people in Hangzhou
City, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, no longer worry
about how to make their ends meet, because local city government
has assured them a bottom-line of living expenses.
</P>
<P>
According to a new social welfare method which was adopted
recently, local urban residents who are in need, and particularly
senior citizens, will be guaranteed at least 150 yuan of living
expenses every month.
</P>
<P>
A group of old people who are in financial difficulty received
blue cards Wednesday, which guaranteed that the sum of their
living expenses will meet the bottom-line set by the city
government.
</P>
<P>
Almost all those residents are in their seventies or eighties,
and they substituted on subsidies or meager incomes by
themselves. And the monthly income for most of them is less than
50 yuan.
</P>
<P>
This represents part of the efforts the city has made to
improve its social security system. Hangzhou has made overall
plans to ensure old-age pension and child-bearing allowances for
female workers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, workers of the enterprises in the red and those
laid-off are also guaranteed to get bottom-line living expenses.

HANOI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 8,000 rare animals have
been released from Vietnam's major national parks and zoos since
1995, the Vietnamese News Agency (VNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rare animals such as red-shanked douc langurs, wild cats,
common otters, assam macaques, binturongs and lesser slow loris
were confiscated from animal smugglers.
</P>

It said Vietnam is now developing a project to protect wild
animals as a part of its program to preserve the natural resources
of forest and protect the country's ecological environment.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cities May Have Power to Hire Foreigners: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's newly-appointed Home
Affairs Minister Katsuhiko Shirakawa said Friday that local
municipalities might be allowed to decide on their own whether to
hire foreign nationals for public service jobs, the Kyodo News
Service reported.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of whether to hire foreign nationals is in the
end one to be made by the elected local leader," said the
minister, who was given the present post in the new cabinet
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to issue guidance that gives priority to a
local leader's decision. I have instructed my staff to discuss
this matter with the Cabinet Legislation Bureau," he added.
</P>
<P>
If the move could go through, it would reverse the central
government's stance declared in 1953 that "public servants
involved in wielding administrative authority or creating the will
of the general public must be Japanese nationals."
</P>
<P>
Certain types of jobs such as nurses had been exceptions to the
rule. Last week Shirakawa's predecessor, Hiroyuki Kurata, had
confirmed the 43-year-old basic policy line, but had opened
several more jobs to foreigners, including nutritionist and
clinical inspector.
</P>
<P>
Shirakawa said he wonders why the hiring of foreigners on the
municipal level should have any adverse effect on the exertion of
administrative authority, but he noted that administrative
authority was directly concerned in the case of central government
service.
</P>
<P>
The minister's remarks must be seen against the backdrop of
increasing demands from local governments that foreigners be
allowed to become public servants.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Gurkhas Expect Benefits from PM's Britain Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Ex-gurkha soldiers in Nepal,
who had retired from the British army, expect that Prime Minister
Sher Bahadur Deuba's upcoming visit to Britain would help realize
their long-sought welfare demands to the British government, the
local press said today.
</P>
<P>
They hope that during his visit starting from Sunday the prime
minister would be able to "right the historical wrong" meted out
on the Nepalese for nearly two centuries, according to a leader of
ex-gurkha soldiers in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Ex-gurkha Association Padam Gurung told local
reporters Friday that Deuba is the first elected prime minister in
Nepal who has pledged to take up the gurkhas' welfare issue to the
British government.
</P>
<P>
Deuba is to leave for London Sunday on a four-day official
visit at the invitation of his British counterpart John Major. He
will go to Rome, Italy directly to attend the World Food Summit
after the conclusion of his Britain visit.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Britain Deuba and his party are also
expected to hold talks on bilateral trade ties especially the
growing trade imbalance between the two countries, sources here
said.
</P>
<P>
Deuba earlier has promised that he would do his best to resolve
the problem of the ex-gurkha soldiers in Nepal, who had submitted
a four-point demands to the British prime minister.
</P>
<P>
They demanded pension facilities equal to those of retired
British soldiers, employment opportunities for their children and
their rights to live in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Ex-gurkha soldiers here plan to file a lawsuit against the
British government in Britain if the bilateral talks on their
welfare demands fail, a newspaper report said today.
</P>
<P>
They also asked the Nepali delegation to tell the British
government not to terminate the 183-year-old legacy of gurkha
soldier recruitment without a prior notice, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There had been some 4,000 gurkha soldiers in the British army
stationed in Britain and its overseas bases in recent years but
the number was reduced to 2,500 last year, the Ex-gurkha
Association here said.
</P>
<P>
Every year Nepal receives considerable remittance from the
British gurkha soldiers, mostly recruited from poverty-stricken
villages in the country's northern mountainous areas.

BONN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe and his Polish counterpart, Stanislaw Dobrzanski, met and
shook hands today on a "friendship bridge" just constructed over
the Oder river delineating their borders.
</P>
<P>
The pontoon bridge, deemed as a token of the consolidating
friendship between the two peoples and the strengthening
partnership between the two militaries, was built by military
engineers from both countries.
</P>
<P>
A result of an ongoing military exercise jointly launched by
the two countries along their borders, the bridge was said to link
for a few hours the Polish city of Kostrzyn and its German
neighbor Kustrin.
</P>
<P>
The military cooperation between Germany and Poland in recent
years has been much more closer than before. In 1996 alone, they
agreed to implement some 100 programs of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Poland is one of the pioneers in eastern Europe to apply to

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports to US Increase 0.35 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai exports to the US
increased by just 0.35 percent in the first seven months of this
year, compared with the same period last year, the Bangkok Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The value of exports to the US in the period totaled 6.29
billion US dollars, making Thailand the eleventh-largest exporter
to the US with a market share of 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's share of the US market had fallen because
competitiveness had dropped off. Exporters from Mexico, China,
Singapore and Malaysia all increased their share of the US market,
a report from the Thai Commercial Counselor Office in Washington
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The key items that lost ground were: frozen shrimps, gems and
jewelry, natural rubber, telephones, facsimile machines, sport
shoes, television sets, canned tuna and leather bags.
</P>

Meanwhile, Thailand's imports from the US soared 20.79 percent
to 4.206 billion dollars, leaving the US with a deficit of 2.08
billion dollars in trade with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The report said imports from the US had jumped so dramatically
because Thailand had bought airplanes worth 417 million dollars in
the first seven months of this year. Those purchases accounted for
10 percent of total imports from the US.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-Year ESAF Credit for Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year credit equivalent to about
234 million U.S. dollars for Tanzania under the enhanced
structural adjustment facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The credit is provided to support the Tanzanian government's
economic reform program for 1996-1999.
</P>
<P>
The first annual loan, equivalent to about 74 million dollars,
will be disbursed in two equal semi-annual installments, the first
of which will be available on November 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
The overall macro-economic objectives of this eastern African
country's three-year program include a real GDP growth rate of 6
percent, an average rate of inflation of 5 percent and an external
current account deficit, excluding grants, of 13.3 percent of the
GDP as compared with 20.6 percent in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the gross official reserves will be increased to the
equivalent of three months of imports by the end of June 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the medium-term strategy, the program for 1996-1997
fiscal year is targeted to accelerate the real GDP growth to 5
percent, lowering the average inflation rate to 15 percent and
reducing the external current account deficit to about 15 percent
of the GDP, while increasing gross international reserves to the
equivalent of almost 10 weeks of imports.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania joined the IMF in September 1962. Its quota is about
213 million dollars equivalent and its outstanding use of the IMF
credit currently totals about 175 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Tourism to Become Top Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 9 Xinhua -- The Indonesian government is
committed to making tourism the country's top foreign exchange
earner by the end of the seventh five year development plan
(1999-2004), President Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
"We plan that by the year 2005, the tourism sector can provide
foreign exchange amounting to 15 billion US dollars," the
president told officials of the Tourism, Post and
Telecommunications Department (TPTD) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto predicted tourist arrivals in 1999 will
reach 6.5 million, TPTD officials said today.

Indonesia's total number of foreign visitors increased from
4.01 million in 1994 to 4.3 million in 1995, while revenues from
those visitors grew from 4.7 billion dollars to 5.2 billion
dollars, the fourth largest foreign exchange earner after oil and

<HEADLINE> DPRK Raps U.S.-Japan Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing military
exercises between the United States and Japan constitute a
provocation against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK), the newspaper Rodong Sinmun said today.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale joint drills, dubbed "Keen Sword 97," in the
Tongchoson-man and around Japan, also pose a threat to peace and
security in Asia, the newspaper said in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces command in Japan claimed that the exercises
were aimed at "strengthening the integration in combat readiness
and joint operations of forces of the U.S. and Japan." This
clearly demonstrates the criminal and provocative nature of the
drills, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
The joint war games and the ongoing U.S.-South Korea military
maneuvers, code-named "Foal Eagle," are evidence that the three
countries are enhancing their "tripartite military alliance," with
the aim to jointly strangle the DPRK and fulfill their aggressive
ambitions in Asia, it said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Japan military drills, which deteriorate the situation
in Asia, is a flagrant challenge to the wishes for peace of the
Asian people, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It urged the U.S. and Japan to stop the war games immediately.

<HEADLINE> Former Indian PM's Widow Invited to Join Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Congress party's new chief
Sitaram Kesri is reported to have invited Sonia Gandhi, widow of
former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, to join the Congress Working
Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body of the party.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with her here Thursday, Kesri communicated to
her the sentiments expressed by some members at the CWC meeting
earlier this week about the need for her participation in the
party affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The Congress president has repeatedly said that he would
pursue Sonia to play a more active role in the party. For us the
Nehru-Gandhi family is an important symbol and therefore at a time
when the party has suffered its worst-ever electoral reverses she
can be a source of inspiration for party workers," Congress
president's political secretary Tariq Anwar said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991, Sonia Gandhi
was asked by the Congress to succeed her husband as the party
president, but she refused. Since then she has not played an
active role in the party activities.
</P>
<P>
Sonia was reported to have developed differences with former
Congress president P.V. Narasimha Rao. She openly charged the Rao
government with delaying the probe in the assassination of her
husband.
</P>
<P>
Kesri can score a major political point if he succeeds in
persuading Sonia to accept the CWC berth or any other position.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government, MILF to Postpone Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The peace negotiations between
the Philippine government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) may not start as scheduled on Sunday, a government
delegate to the talks said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Dequina, a member of the government panel in charge of
talks with the MILF, said the failure to agree on the talking
points was one major factor delaying the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Another major obstacle was the continued hostilities between
the government forces and the MILF rebels in Tipo-Tipo in northern
Basilan Province, Dequina said.
</P>
<P>
"The problem can be solved only if both parties first forge a
ceasefire agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no peace talks unless the technical committees
meet to discuss the ground rules for the cessation of
hostilities," said Muhammad Al-Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for
military affairs.
</P>
<P>
Murad added that both sides can only stop fighting if the 13
areas the MILF claims to control will be declared off-limits to
the military.
</P>
<P>
The technical committee's meeting is considered very important
because the MILF "wants to be clarified on the scope of the
ceasefire and its violation," Murad said.
</P>
<P>
The government agreed to open separate peace negotiations with
the MILF, a breakaway group of the mainstream Muslim rebel group
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), after it refused to
recognize a peace deal signed between Manila and the MNLF in
September.
</P>
<P>
But sporadic clashes have continued between the government
forces and the MILF, now the biggest anti-government group, for
the past two weeks in Tipo-Tipo area.
</P>
<P>
The two weeks of skirmishes have killed 17 government soldiers
and wounded 40 others, the military said. The casualties on the
MILF side remained unclear.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China and Brazil should join efforts to make
greater contribution to the establishment of a new and just
international political and economic order based on peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet hosted by Brazilian President Fernando
Enrique Cardoso in his honor, Li said China and Brazil, both large
developing countries, should carry out a historic mission to
safeguard world peace and promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the two countries should work together to
build their long-standing and stable relations of mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sino-Brazilian ties have enjoyed smooth development
in various fields since the establishment of diplomatic relations
22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The visits by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Brazil in 1993
and by Cardoso to China in 1995 have accelerated the overall
development of such ties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said his current visit to Brazil was aimed at promoting
Sino-Brazilian relations, especially bilateral economic and trade
cooperation. The documents of cooperation on aerospace,
environmental protection and consular affairs signed between the
two countries earlier today demonstrate the new progress made in
the development of the relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also expressed appreciation over the
contribution made by Brazil to safeguarding world peace, promoting
economic development and pushing forward the process of
integration in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the Sino-Brazilian cooperation
will reach a new level so long as the two countries see and handle
their relations from a long-term strategic point of view.
</P>
<P>
Li and his entourage flew in from Chile Thursday on the second
leg of his Latin American tour. He will leave Brazil for Venezuela
next Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Should Accept Slower Growth: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The new Thai government should
accept an annual economic growth rate of five-to-six percent for
the next five years after nearly a decade of eight-percent growth,
caretaker Finance Minister Chaiyawat Wibulswasadi said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The local press quoted Chaiyawat as saying that his ministry
would be satisfied with a seven-percent growth rate this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the pace of past growth had put pressure on the
country's services, including the capital market which lacked
qualified staff.
</P>
<P>
A failure to acknowledge this fact would result in
slower-than-expected economic growth, Chaiyawat warned.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the current five-percent inflation rate and the
national current account deficit at five percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) should be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat said that the new administration should focus on
producing qualified staff and technology for various sectors, as
well as encouraging public saving.
</P>
<P>
The new Thai government will be formed after the country's
general elections on November 17.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Treats China as Partner, Friend: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Enrique Cardoso said today that Brazil sees China as its partner
of priority importance and a friend.
</P>
<P>
In his toast at a banquet hosted in honor of Chinese Premier Li
Peng, Cardoso used the phrase "making friends" to describe
Brazil's partnership with China, saying such a phrase is rarely
used to describe his country's ties with its partners.
</P>
<P>
He said "making friends" between Brazil and China means to link
a young country with a country which has a long history of
civilization.
</P>
<P>
"This is an ambitious plan," he said, but added that "we both
are good at building our friendship on a solid basis of decisive
importance."
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said the visit by Premier Li Peng to Brazil clearly
demonstrates that China cares for his country and the partnership
between them.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier arrived here Thursday on the second leg of
his three-nation tour of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
President Cardoso said Brazil and China differ in many
respects, which he said should be respected. But the challenges
facing the two countries are similar to a large extent.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have many things to do with joint
efforts, such as a common agenda on environmental protection and
joint development of global resources satellites.
</P>
<P>
Brazil fully supports China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), adding that China's WTO membership will
benefit the bilateral relations between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries should proceed from their friendship
built over 22 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties and
bring about a great leap forward in their relations to keep pace
with the achievements made in each other's countries and the rapid
changes in the world.

<HEADLINE> Thai Oil Depot Blast Death Toll Rises to 19 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of a powerful
explosion at an illegal petroleum depot in eastern Thailand has
risen to 19, according to reports from Rayong province today.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers dug out from charred debris the bodies of a
three-year-old girl and her mother who clung tight together, a
pregnant woman and four others on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At least 16 other people are reported to be wounded in the
blast which took place on Thursday, believed to be triggered by
sparks of welding work near the storage pit, which measured 16
meters on each side and four meters deep.
</P>
<P>
The cement storage pit had eight big tanks containing about
300,000 liters of highly inflammable solvent, which was for
retails to various companies.
</P>
<P>
The blast blew the roof of the pit off its steel supports,
ripped through 10 nearby workers' housing units and set off a
massive fire, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum depot, owned by Rungmeesap Petroleum Co. in
Rayong, has no operational permit although it began operating
almost a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials said that they could not see what was
inside as the hectare-size depot area was surrounded by
two-meter-high walls.
</P>
<P>
The owner of the company, Pramote Tansuthiwong, Friday reported
to police for questioning and promised to take responsibility for
the casualties and damage.
</P>
<P>
He put the damage at 15 million baht (600,000 US dollars).

JAKARTA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) countries should pursue "high quality" growth in
order to face external shocks and other challenges, an economic
conference recommended Friday.
</P>
<P>
speaking at the end of a two-day conference on macro-economic
problems of ASEAN, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Deputy
Director for
Southeast Asia and Pacific Anoop Singh said high-quality growth
means "strong economic fundamentals."
</P>
<P>
he described the "strong economic fundamentals" as high savings
rates, high investment rates and the preservation of
macro-economic stability.
</P>
<P>
The challenges to the ASEAN countries in the near future come
from new trends in globalization -- capital flows.
</P>
<P>
"This has put pressure on the banking system everywhere. The
challenge is that the world has become more complex and there is
more capital flow coming into the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
A strong banking system is the key ingredient when it comes to
facing the flow of money so that "when there is a challenge, the
system is quick to adapt," he added.
</P>
<P>
The conference, co-sponsored by the IMF and Bank Indonesia,
ended with consensus that significant misalignment of regional
exchange rates must be avoided.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by 249 people, including finance
ministers, governors of central banks from the ASEAN countries,
IMF representatives and economic scholars.

<HEADLINE> Great Chances for China's Environmental Protection Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China's environmental
protection industry has great potential for growth, as the country
has implemented the strategy of sustained development and is
increasing efforts to treat pollution, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
China will need 450 billion yuan for pollution treatment over
the next five years, according to the State Bureau for
Environmental Protection (SBEP).
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the environmental protection goals for this
period are realized, the country will carry out two major
measures, namely, controlling the discharge of pollutants and
adopting a trans-century green project, SBEP officials said.
</P>
<P>
These efforts require that clean production technology be used
in the construction projects. The first phase of the Trans-century
Green Project consists of more than 1,500 sub-projects, involving
a total investment of 180 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A solution to the environmental problems depends on progress in
science and technology, as well as the improvement of industrial
technology, according to Jiang Xiaoyu, deputy secretary-general of
the Chinese Association of Environmental Protection Industry.
</P>
<P>
In addition, tighter legislation and management are required to
lay the foundation for a huge environmental protection industry,
she added.
</P>
<P>
According to SBEP Director Xie Zhenhua, the global
environmental protection industry reports an output value of 300
billion US dollars, and the figure is expected to grow to 600
billion US dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection industry in the Asia-Pacific
Region lists an output value of 30 billion US dollars, while China
has an output value of only 4 million yuan for its sector.
</P>
<P>
In general, China's environmental protection industry is
developing rapidly and some techniques have already reached world
standards and entered the international market, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
However, she noted, China still lags behind globally in terms
of craftsmanship, quality and automation level.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers from around the world who are associated with the
environmental protection industry, especially those that use
advanced technology, will have good opportunities for development
in China, she said.
</P>
<P>
China has funneled 2.7 billion US dollars worth of foreign
funds for environmental protection in the last five years, and is
planning to inject another four billion US dollars into the field
in the coming five years, Xie said.

southern city to help local police crack down on rampant
kidnappers there.
</P>
<P>
The marines will form the nucleus of an elite anti-kidnapping
task force in Cotabato city in Mindanao Island as proposed earlier
by Interior and Local Government Secretary Robert Barbers.
</P>
<P>
The task force will be made up of elite units of the Army, the
Philippine National Police, civilian officials, and the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) which has been at peace with the
government since September.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of agreement among these parties is being prepared
to formalize the creation of the anti-kidnapping task force and
outline its operations.
</P>
<P>
Cotabato, a trading center with a population of more than
15,000, has been hit by a spate of kidnappings during the past few
weeks. At least 30 residents in the city, mainly Filipino-Chinese
businessmen, fell victim to the kidnappers this year.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said that kidnap gangs in Mindanao,
particularly those operating in Cotabato and the neighboring
provinces, consist of former members of the MNLF and the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, an anti-government armed group.
</P>
<P>
After the Ramos administration struck a peace deal in September
with the MNLF ending 24 years of war in the southern Philippines,
kidnappings emerged as a major headache of the government and a
new obstacle to the region's war-battered economy.

<HEADLINE> Germany Not to Join International Force for Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
today ruled out sending German troops as part of an international
force in eastern Zaire but pledged support for efforts to aid
refugees and to establish lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"German participation (in any international force) is not
possible," Kinkel said at a meeting with visiting Rwandan Foreign
Minister Anastase Gasana.
</P>
<P>
"A political solution must be found," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gasana told reporters after the meeting that Rwanda would agree
to "an African intervention force ... or even a mixed European and
African force" as long as it was "a neutral one."
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's support for an intervention force is vital as the
easiest supply routes pass through its territory.
</P>
<P>
He promised to make Rwanda's airports and routes available for
humanitarian relief, and called on the international community,
Germany in particular, to persuade Zaire to take similar steps to
open its airports and routes.
</P>
<P>
He called for the return of all Rwandan refugees in Zaire,
including many Tutsis, saying that their safety at home would be
guaranteed. Many Tutsis fled home for fear of revenge after the
slaughter in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Gasana arrived here earlier today for talks with Kinkel on a
peaceful settlement of the conflict in Zaire and the possible
outbreak of a refugee exodus.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds Mixed Feelings About Tight Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Entrepreneurs expressed mixed
fellings about government policies of reining in credit, according
to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
They are satisfied with shrinking inflation but believe the
government should ease up on the brakes on economic growth,
according to the results of a natinal survey released in Beijing
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
A majority -- 54.6 percent of the entrepreneurs interviewed --
approved of government efforts to control inflation, which have
helped cut production costs. But 52.3 percent said the level of
economic growth is too slow.
</P>
<P>
The scale of fixed assets investment was too small, according
to 45.5 percent of the entrepreneurs. Only 29.9 percent judged the
scale to be "reasonable".
</P>
<P>
The survey also reported that 76.7 percent of the
entrepreneurs favored loosening credit controls, arguing that the
credit scale was too small.
</P>
<P>
The annual survey was cosponsored by the China Entrepreneurs
Survey System created in 1993 by the Development and Research
Center of the State Council and 14 ministries and central
government administrations.
</P>
<P>
The national economic situation is steady and promising, which
indicates that the government does not need to keep the control on
credit too tight, Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist of the State
Statistics Bureau, said yesterday at a one-day symposium on the
survey results.
</P>
<P>
However, a reasonable growth rate is a must if China wants its
economy to maintain sustained growth, he added.

Since Macedonia broke away from the former Yugoslavia in 1991,
the control of its air had been in the hands of the Federal

<HEADLINE> Oasis Boasts More Than Cave Art </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Dunhuang, a city in remote
Gansu Province, northwest China, has long been renowned for its
Mogao Grottoes, housing one of the world's leading collections of
medieval cave art.
</P>
<P>
But the city offers far more than its famous Buddhist caves.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by the Gobi Desert, Dunhuang holds a unique
beauty. The sands are dotted with yellow grass swaying in the
blazing sun. The sky, set off by the golden sand, is deep
blue. There are countless sand dunes, rising and falling like the
centuries of tumultuous history in this area.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang is a huge oasis, irrigated by the Danghe River, which
flows from Qilian Mountain in south Gansu Corridor.
</P>
<P>
Along the south edge of Dunhuang lies a desert area known as
Mingsha Hill. The sands stretch eastward for 20 kilometers and are
formed by quicksand. The dunes are 250 meters high and 1,650
meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The oasis takes its name, Mingsha, or Singing Sands, from the
sounds made when someone climbs the hill or when high winds whip
around the dunes. The sands have been a famous tourist attraction
for centuries because of the eerie noise.
</P>
<P>
At the foot of the Singing Sands is a tiny, crescent-shaped
spring about 2,500 km wide. It is called Yueya Spring.
</P>
<P>
The spring is lined with lush trees and its water mirrors the
green reeds on the waterside. This may be a common scene in the
south, but is a great delight to visitors in the desert. More
surprisingly, the spring has never been buried by the quicksand
around it, nor evaporated from the lack of precipitation in the
area.
</P>
<P>
In ancient times, the locals considered it pleasurable to climb
the Singing Sands and enjoy the Yueya Spring during the Dragon
Boat Festival (the fifth day of the fifth lunar month).
</P>
<P>
In southwest Dunhuang, another lake called Huangshuiba draws
herds of wild horses, mules and goats. Flocks of freshwater ducks
play on the lake, which abounds in fish.
</P>
<P>
Today, visitors can still see the vestiges of two great passes
linked by the part of the Great Wall built in the Han Dynasty. One
is Yumenguan (Jade Gate Pass); the other is Yangguan (Southern
Pass). They are important gateways to the west, and the famous
Silk Road runs through them.
</P>
<P>
There are broken beacon towers, dilapidated walls, reed and
poplars on the swamp, and Chinese tamarisk shrubs in the vast
desert. the landscape may contradict preconceived ideas of
armoured soldiers guarding the frontier and merchants traveling
the Silk Road in ancient times.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from
Spain, Portugal and 19 Latin American countries will meet in
Santiago, Chile, Saturday to prepare documents for the
Ibero-American summit scheduled for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The summit to be held from November 10 to 11 will discuss the
official theme "Governability in an Efficient and Participative
Democracy."
</P>
<P>
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina said on his way to
Santiago, "we are going to an Ibero-American summit that will have
to decide on some of the outlines for the new millennium."
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol said, "we have to
take advantage of this forum to secure the development of Central
America, promote investments in the region and the opening of the
market and the integration of America and Ibero-America."
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the only
woman president to be present at the summit, will present in the
forum a theme related to women's role in governability.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and
Nicaragua flew together Friday to Santiago in a Chilean air force
plane.
</P>
<P>
The summit was said to discuss the U.S. Helms-Burton law which
penalizes foreign companies doing business with Cuba. The U.S. law
has drawn wide condemnation for encroaching up the sovereignty of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
"The rejection of Helms-Burton is unanimous. It has not even
been an issue for debate," a diplomat at the summit said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Shougang Transformed into Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Shougang Group (Capital
Iron and Steel Group) has been officially created on the basis of
Capital Iron and Steel Corp, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the group symbolizes that the corporation
has entered a new era in its market economy reforms, bidding a
farewell to the old practice of the contract responsibility
system, Luo Bingsheng, general manager of the group, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The group, approved by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry
and the Beijing Municipal Government, will operate in accordance
with the modern corporate management system to give full rein to
the development of its subsidiary companies.
</P>
<P>
"The group has been formed at a time when China is
strengthening its reform of State-owned enterprises by
restructuring them according to the demands of a market economy,"
said Xu Daquan, vice-minister of the Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
Shougang, a company with a history of over 70 years, developed
itself into one of the major steel producers in China in recent
years by working on a contract responsibility system. But that
system is no longer successful and many of Shougang's branch
companies are making less profit or, in some instances, even
running in the red.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the group, based on a parent-subsidiary
corporate system, has drawn a clear line for property rights,
responsibility and management between the parent company and its
subsidiary companies.
</P>
<P>
"To help ensure the success of the company, we will provide
financial support for out subsidiaries for a few years, helping
them in investment, finance and discharge of their debts based on
an appraisal of their fixed assets. Once that is done, the
subsidiary companies will develop strategies to stop losing money
and begin to make profits," said Bi Qun, general secretary of the
Party committee of the group.
</P>
<P>
After changes are completed, the parent company will have
58,000 employees, accounting for one fourth of the group's total
staff.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Coca-Cola Co. transferred the
trademark ownership of its first China style fruit juice brand
recently to a local joint venture. This move signals the company's
determination to further localize its product in the fast-growing
market.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement signed on November 7, Tianjin
Jinmei Beverage Company Ltd, a producer of concentrate which
contains the basic ingredients for making soft drinks, has become
the new owner of Tian Yu Di, a brand launched earlier this year by
Coca-Cola China Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The transfer also included a detailed formula for the product,
which hit Beijing and Shanghai markets on a trial basis earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
"This contribution reflects Coca-Cola's considerable efforts to
help build the local soft drink industry through the free transfer
of intellectual property rights," said Pan Beilei, vice-chairman
of China National Council of Light Industry.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Jinmei Beverage Company is a 50-50 equity joint venture
established in 1987 between Tianjin Beverage Factory and a
subsidiary of Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first free transfer of a brand name to a local
company in Coca-Cola's history," said Steve Chan, vice-president
of Coca-Cola China operations, adding that the company could again
transfer a brand name if there existed considerable market demand
in the future.
</P>
<P>
He added that "we will both share the costs and benefits of
promoting the brand since Coca-Cola is also an equity holder in
this joint venture."
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola Co and its 18 bottlers operate as a local business in
China, By 1997, there will be 23 Coca-Cola bottling plants
representing an investment of more than 500 million dollars in
China.

<HEADLINE> Water Loss Brings Down Power Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Low water level along the
Yellow River may decrease by a big margin the hydroelectric power
output of the Northwest China power grid, reported today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The output might be reduced by 6.6 percent between October and
next May as compared to the corresponding period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"That will further aggravate power shortages in areas covered
by the grid," a report from the information office of the Ministry
of Power Industry noted.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the situation, the grid's power supply during the
October to May period will decrease by 660 million kilowatt/hours,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The current capacity of the grid leaves an annual shortage of
10 billion kilowatt/hour, or 40 million kilowatt/hours every day.
</P>
<P>
Hydroelectric power contributes more than 40 percent of the
grid's power supply, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, water levels along the upper-reaches of the
Yellow River have remained low for the last three years and have
fallen even lower this year.
</P>
<P>
In the Longyangxia Reservoir, a major one of its kind along the
upper reaches of the Yellow River, water shortage during the
flooding season between July and September of this year was only
half the size of the average level in previous years.
</P>
<P>
In the Longyangxia and nearby Liujiaxia Reservoirs where a
number of cascade power plants were built, water levels at the end
of October were down by 2.84 meters and 4.99 meters respectively
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Water discharge from the two reservoirs for generating power
decreased by 1.2 billion cubic meters from that of a year ago and
the power output capacity of the cascade power plants was reduced
by 630 million kilowatt/hours.
</P>
<P>
The power ministry report said managers of the Northwest China
Power Grid have adopted a policy to tie power output to changes in
water level while taking into full account the irrigation needs of
Gansu Province, the Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolia autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
These areas depend on water from that part of the Yellow River
to irrigate their farmlands in winter and spring.

ROME, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian Striker Gianfranco Zola,
leaving for England's Chelsea from Parma, said he was moving for
"tactical reasons".
</P>
<P>
"I'm emigrating for tactical reasons," Zola told a news
conference in Parma, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Zola said one of the reasons that prompted his move to the
English premier league club was Parma coach Carlo Ancelotti
planned to transform him to a midfielder from a striker.
</P>
<P>
"After our early elimination from the Italian and UEFA Cups,
the situation only got worse. I was asked to change my style,
which was difficult for me to accept because I know I can
contribute more in another position," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zola said he was enthusiastic about playing in England and
would fly to London on Monday to meet the media.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Nine volcanos in southern Peru
could reactivate, posing a potential threat to residents in the
region, Civil Defense National Institute authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
Of the nine volcanos, three are located in the Arequipa
department, four in the departments of Moquegua and Tacna, and one
each in the departments of Arequipa and Moquegua.
</P>
<P>
The institute made the forecast after the Geophysical Institute
of Peru submitted to it documents describing the volcanos as
"potentially active" after preliminary studies of data provided by
satellite.
</P>
<P>
The behavior of the volcanos in recent centuries have shown
certain degrees of risk, which leads experts to think of an
eventual reactivation.
</P>
<P>
There are 200 volcanos in Peru.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Mideast Peace Hinges on Israeli Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Friday that the pullout of the Israeli troops from the
West Bank city of Hebron is the first and most important thing for
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I think the first and most important thing we can do is to
nail the agreement on Hebron," Clinton said at his first press
conference at the White House east room since his re-election in
Tuesday's poll.
</P>
<P>
"If we can clear the Hebron hurdle -- it has such emotional
significance to both sides, as well as such practical significance
-- I believe that will open the door to go on and fulfill all the
other challenges that are there before us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been working for a
month to secure a deal on the long-delayed redeployment of the
Israeli troops in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached an agreements on civilian affairs issues
last week, but differences remained over security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli pull-out from Hebron, which was agreed on between
the former Israeli labour government and the Palestinians should
have taken place last spring, but was delayed by Israel's May
election which saw Benjamin Netanyahu, the hard-line Likud leader,
take over the power and pursue uncompromising policies over the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The current negotiations on implementing the
Israeli-Palestinian agreements were initiated following an
emergency summit in Washington in September, which was aimed at
salvaging the Middle East peace process in the wake of bloody
clashes provoked by Israel's opening a controversial tunnel near
an Islamic holy place, leading to more than 50 deaths of
Palestinian demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also showed the firm stand of the United States
regarding to the situation in the Gulf, warning the Iraqis that it
should know the consequence by threatening its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"I think that they can be under no illusion that any aggressive
action could be taken without... a stern response by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
the United States launched two cruise missile strikes early in
October against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for his sending
troops into northern Iraq, a safe haven for the Kurds designed by
U.S. and its allies to prevent Iraqi troops from entering, at the
invitation of a Kurdish factions in an attempt to take control of
the area.
</P>
<P>
Before the election, U.S. F-16 pilots patrolling over the
enlarged no-fly zone in southern Iraq fired two missiles on Iraqi
radar sites on the allegations that they were "locked on" by Iraqi
missiles.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Pentagon for Examining Gulf Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that the Pentagon is doing better in its search for
evidence about chemical weapons exposure at the end of the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
In his first news conference after the election, Clinton also
praised the work of his own presidentially appointed advisory
committee, which has criticized the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"Let me just say I think the commission I appointed on Gulf War
illnesses has done an exemplary job," Clinton said. "And I believe
that the Pentagon, in fairness, has also done much better
recently."
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans'
Illnesses has prepared a draft report to Clinton that recommends
an independent investigation, charging that the Pentagon has
"stretched credibility" on the issue, The New York Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We've given free medical exams to tens of
thousands of people. We've qualified 26,000 people for disability,
and we have a lot of various medical tests going on."
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon has said the military has the
technical expertise to dig into the detailed aspects of postwar
ground operations, including the demolition of an Iraqi bunker in
March 1991 that contained shells filled with the nerve agent
sarin.

UNITED NATIONS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Friday lost its seat in a key U.N. financial committee, the first
time that the U.S. was voted out of the committee.
</P>
<P>
There were three candidates for two vacancies allocated for the
Western European and Other States Group in the 16-member Advisory
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ), which
is the first legislative step in examing the U.N. budget.

votes followed by New Zealand with 116 votes and the U.S.
candidate Melinda Kimble 103 votes.
</P>
<P>
The American diplomats involved in the election admitted that
it was a reflection of countries' anger at U.S.' huge debt to the

The United States owes to the United Nations 1.4 billion U.S.
dollars for dues and peacekeeping operations, more than half the
U.N.'s total debt.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names New White House Chief of Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Friday named North Carolina businessman Erskine Bowles to replace
Leon Pannetta as his chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called Bowles a great manager and leader at a news
conference in the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spoke highly of Panetta, who is reportedly returning
home and planning to run for governor of California.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said six members of Clinton's 14-member Cabinet
plan to leave.
</P>
<P>
Bowles, 51, a merchant banker, served as Small Business
Administration director and deputy chief of staff at the White
House before leaving in December 1995 to spend more time with his
family and start a new business.
</P>
<P>
Bowles, who met Clinton during the 1992 campaign, later became
a close friend of Clinton's. Most recently he headed the team
preparing Clinton for his debate with Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
At his first news conference since he won re-election Tuesday,
Clinton also announced he had invited congressional leaders to the
White House next week for early discussions about balancing the
budget, advancing targeted tax cuts to help pay for higher
education, and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
"The American people will be watching to see if our deeds match
our words," Clinton said in his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not rule out having a Republican or two in senior
administration positions in his second term.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the results of the election -- his re-election and
the voters' decision to leave Congress in Republican hands --
proved the country wanted a bipartisan approach to government.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it was time "to find a bipartisan
framework" to look at slowing the growth of spending in Medicare
and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions, Clinton said questionable
contributions to the Democratic Party from foreign interests
proved the need for campaign reform but that administration policy
toward relevant nations was "absolutely not" influenced by the
gifts.
</P>
<P>
The White House has denied that the donations were improper or
illegal, but the Democratic Party has returned more than 750,000
dollars in questionable contributions. U.S. campaign finance law
allows donations from foreigners who are residents of the United
States or by U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "there is a difference" between his campaign
fund-raising and the party's, though he also said, "I am not
trying to disclaim responsibility."
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton admitted the need for significant campaign
finance reform and said the issue would be high on his list when
Congress returns in January.
</P>
<P>
"This has shown us once again that our campaigns cost too much,
they take too much time and they raise too many questions,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He endorsed a bipartisan proposal sponsored by Senators John
McCain of Arizona and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin and said it
should be amended to include a ban on contributions by
foreign-nationals living in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Fresh U.S. Troops in Bosnia Considered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that the United States would consider to send fresh
American troops to Bosnia next year if the risks were minimal.
</P>
<P>
At a White House news conference, Clinton said the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is likely to consider a
smaller force in Bosnia with a more limited mission than the
current peace Implementation Force.
</P>
<P>
He said since the economic reconstruction has not taken hold as
fast as expected and there was still some hard feelings there
between the parties, NATO has been asked to consider a follow up
mission in the country.
</P>
<P>
But before deciding, Clinton said, "we would like to see the
proposed mission, we would like to see what our contribution would
be."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said that he would assess the risks and the
possible benefits to "guarantee the maximum possibility for
success and the minimum possibility of danger to our force."
</P>
<P>
A plan to send American and allied troops to Bosnia for further
peacekeeping duty next year will be discussed when NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana comes here next Friday for
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Solana will meet with Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
They will continue the discussions at the NATO winter meeting in
Brussels next month.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns also said today a new
military force for Bosnia, including U.S. troops, was under
"active consideration."
</P>
<P>
The United States has a force of 16,000 troops in Bosnia as
part of the NATO force to reenforce the implementation of the
Dayton peace accord reached between the parties in Bosnia last
december.
</P>
<P>
The mission is due to finish by the end of the year. The U.S.
has announced that the current force in Bosnia would be back home
before mid-March next year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Liquor Industry Votes for TV Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. liquor industry's
voluntary ban on television and radio advertising would be lifted
by the industry itself as it just passed a new decision on it.
</P>
<P>
The decision made by the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S.,
the liquor industry's most powerful lobbying group and policy arm,
may arouse a noisy debate over responsible advertising, according
to U.S. newspapers.
</P>
<P>
It has drawn an instant rebuke from the Federal Communications
Commission Chairman (FCC) Reed Hundt, who called the move
"disappointing for parents and dangerous for our kids."
</P>
<P>
Consumer advocacy groups also lost not time to show their
concern. Some decided to meet with the FCC to complain about it
and would support legislation limiting alcohol advertising.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Broadcasters released a brief
statement saying it was "disappointed" with the distillers'
decision despite its "staunch support of the First Amendment
rights of broadcasters to advertise legal products." Some private
broadcasters worry that a government crackdown on liquor
advertising could lead to curbs on lucrative beer commercials.
</P>
<P>
Spokespeople for the three major broadcast networks said
they would continue the policies that liquor marketers will have
to turn to local TV and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
The spirits council said its move was to "end discrimination
against distilled spirits products", according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Currently, beer companies spend more than 600 million U.S.
dollars on radio and television advertising, plus another 90
million U.S. dollars on print ads, each year. According to the
spirits council, spirits makers spend about 230 million U.S.
dollars on print advertising a year.

NEW YORK, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 13.78 to 6,219.82 Friday, which marked its new high
and the third straight winning session for the blue-chip average.
</P>
<P>
Dow added 197.89 points for the whole week.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with the volume down to 402.32
million shares from 500.74 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Other market measures went further into record territory.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.17 to 730.82, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 1.41 to 386.32, both setting new
highs for the fourth consecutive session.
</P>
<P>
The technology-rich Nasdaq composite index rose 3.36 to
1,257.50, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index
rose 1.14 to 580.39, within a point of its first record close
since mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were pressured most of the session by a weak bond
market, which provided an excuse for investors to secure some
profits on the big advance spurred by Tuesday's election results.
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell after new wholesale trade data from the
government showed declining inventories for the third straight
month. Analysts said some people interpreted this as an indication
of faster economic growth, which could spur inflation and higher
interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Economic Development Key to Stability of Eastern Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Administrator for Eastern
Slavonia region Jacques Klein said here Friday the key to the
region's stability was economic development, considering
unemployment was higher than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Klein
told reporters the U.N. administration had done a great deal to
stabilize the situation in the region, which contributed to
normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia, bordering northeastern Yugoslavia, is the
only region in Croatia still under the Serb control. The other
Serb-held areas were overrun by the government troops in May and
August last year.
</P>
<P>
Serbs in the region and Croatian government signed a peace
accord in November last year placing the region under one-year
U.N. administration with a possibility of extending the
transitional period for another year.
</P>
<P>
Klein said there had been proposals for an extension of the
mandate, which Milosevic supported, but added that the U.N.
Security Council would be making that decision.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Croatian government opposes the extension of
the mandate for six months or a year, but agreed to extend the
period on a three-month basis.
</P>
<P>
Klein, who arrived here Friday morning for a one-day visit,
said he had informed Milosevic on a plan for holding a donors'
conference in Vukovar in December, in order to collect funds for
rebuilding the infrastructure in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said it was necessary that several countries took part in
financing the project and stressed that Milosevic had promised to
supply part of the funds.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said Klein and Milosevic had focused their
meeting on issues over promoting conditions for normal life and
the development of the region, in which U.N. peacekeepers, headed
by Klein, play an important role.
</P>
<P>
The two parties agreed that U.N. presence encourages
cooperation and discussions on all issues of vital importance for
the local population, the reports said.
