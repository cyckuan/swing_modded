JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad met a senior Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) official on Sunday in disputed East Jerusalem,
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Pahad's meeting with PLO executive committee member Faisal
Husseini took place at Orient House in the territory occupied by
Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
This was seen as a signal that South Africa recognized that
Palestine has a legitimate interest in the area, SAPA quoted
diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed Pahad's discussions with Palestine's
Planning and International Cooperation Minister Nabil Sha'ath and
Legislative Assembly Speaker Hanan Ashrawi, who is to visit South
Africa in September.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the visit to Palestine, Pahad has gone to Jordan and
Israel during his six-day Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
During these visits, Pahad held extensive discussions with
Israeli Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on the bilateral relationships between the two
countries and on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Pahad is due to fly to Cairo, Egypt, for discussions with
officials of Egyptian government involved in the Middle East
Peace Process.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Rejects U.S. Overture as "Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei Sunday rejected the recent U.S. overture as a "normal
political hypocritical ploy."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the remarks in a speech to mark the birthday of
Islam's Prophet Mohammad, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madelaine
Albright said last month that Washington is ready to end 20-year
hostility with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said Washington's overture was based on its
miscalculated analysis of Iran's domestic political situation.
</P>
<P>
Washington's overture came at a time when the hard-line faction
was locked in a mounting power struggle with moderates clustered
around President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has taken measures to lessen hostility with Washington,
including non-official exchange between the two countries, since
his inauguration last year.
</P>
<P>
But Khamenei said in the speech that as long as Iran kept its
Muslim identity and remained committed to Palestinians in their
struggle against Israel, Washington would not give up its "harsh
and rude enmity toward Iran."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that despite all the endeavors of some elements to
generate dissension among the people, the Iranian nation, the
government, the officials and the people of all strata are united
in their ideals for making the Islamic revolution successful.
</P>
<P>
Iran has always been and will remain an ardent follower of
Islamic ideals, protector of its values, and dispenser of its
teachings while maintaining its strong support for the Palestinian
cause and Islamic unity, he said.

STOCKHOLM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson
captured a record fourth Swedish Open title by winning the final
in straight set in Baastad of Sweden on Sunday.

The 31-year old top seed won an undramatic victory over Andrei

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
Al-Sharaa called for closer Arab-European cooperation Sunday,
noting that such cooperation is more urgent now than any other
time.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa made the call when addressing the 16th session of the
Arab-European parliamentary dialog between the European Union (EU)
and Egypt, Algeria, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting starting Saturday focuses on partnership
talks between the EU and the four Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa said the Arab-European cooperation is the real touch
stone for peace that can end Israeli occupation of Arab lands and
ensure security and prosperity for all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
A closer cooperation will ensure the common interests, and
strengthen the security and stability of Europe and the Arab
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on the EU to play a bigger role in the
Mideast peace process, saying "We strongly stress today the
European role in view of the stalled peace process resulted from
Israel's anti-peace policies."
</P>
<P>
He said an effective European role will prevent the peace
process from collapsing instead of running against the efforts of
the U.S., Russia, the official mediators in the Mideast peace
process.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Winnie Madikikizela-Mandela,
ex-wife of South African President Nelson Mandela Sunday
categorically denied the reports that she intended
to quit the ruling African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
"I am the ANC and I will die as the ANC," she said in a
statement sent to South African Press Association (SAPA) office
in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the Sunday Times reported that Madikikizela-Mandela,
current leader of the ANC Women's League, had sent a letter to
the party's leadership, threatening to quit the National
Executive Committee, citing bad treatment at the hands of top ANC
members.
</P>
<P>
Among the leaders mentioned were Sports Minister Steve Tshwete
who last year wrote an article calling her a "liar" and "a
wayward charlatan."
</P>
<P>
This was after she publicly criticized the ANC for failing to
address crimes, land redistribution and the shortage of housing.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will start
consultations t7is week with the Magistrates and Judges
Association of Zambia to resolve the on-going strike by
magistrates.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Sunday quoted Vincent Malambo, legal affairs
minister, as saying in an interview here Saturday that he will
meet leaders of the association for consultations on ways of
ending the strike which entered its 10th day.
</P>
<P>
Malambo retreated from his earlier statement that the
government will not condone the strike because it is illegal and
that the association is merely an association and has nothing to
do with the conditions of services.
</P>
<P>
He said he is busy working toward getting the magistrates back
to work. However, he did not elaborate but said that he is
positive that the problem will be resolved.
</P>
<P>
"I am saying that the problem will be solved. We can't have an
indefinite strike and allow cases to pile up in courts, work has
to go on," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, magistrates in the capital of Lusaka, the
country's tourist capital of Livingstone and Copperbelt Province
began to strike to press for better conditions of service.
</P>
<P>
They hihe warned the government that the strike will go on
indefinitely until their requirements are met.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko and a delegation from the International Monetary Fund
have "agreed on all key issues" on a multi-billion-U.S.-dollar
financial bailout for Russia, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko's meeting with the delegation led by John
Odling-Smee, head of the IMF department responsible for the former
Soviet Union ended later Sunday, Itar-Tass said quoting a
government source.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's top negotiator with international financial
organizations Anatoly Chubais, head of the Central Bank Sergei
Dubinin and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko and Odling-Smee agreed that details of the agreement
reached during Sunday's talks will be disclosed on Monday,
Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported Sunday that the IMF had told
Russian officials that it was ready to lend Moscow 11 billion U.S.
dollars, nearly double the 5.6 billion dollars initially
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Chubais has said that his country, beset by poor tax
collections, low world oil prices and financial market
turbulences, need 10-15 billion dollars in urgent loans.
</P>
<P>
In May, foreign investors fled Russian financial markets and
the stock market fell about 50 percent of its value since the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Russia hopes that the loans will help it tide over the current
difficulties and prop up the ruble, which is under increasing
pressure to devaluate, though the government insists that no
devaluation would be allowed.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Not to Renegotiate on U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat stressed Sunday that the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) will never re-negotiate the 13 percent Israeli
troops withdrawal proposed by the U.S., Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a political seminar here, Erekat said that 99
percent of the American initiative, which calls for a 13 percent
Israeli redeployment in the West Bank, is in fact "(Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu's initiative."
</P>
<P>
The PNA has accepted the American initiative, although it falls
far short of the minimum Palestinian demands, in what Palestinian
officials say is an effort to rescue the moribund peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Netanyahu must hear me very clearly ... the figure (13
percent) would never be re-negotiated. This is Saeb Erekat
speaking on behalf of (PNA President Yasser) Arafat, Abu Mazen
(PNA deputy head), (Palestinian General Security Commander
Mohammed) Dahlan, (and) everyone (else)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat was actually reacting to an American call for direct
Israeli-Palestinian talks over the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials believe that the U.S., frustrated by its
failure to resolve disputes with Israel over the 13 percent
initiative, urged the direct talks to be renewed in a bid to allow
the two sides to directly discuss Israel's proposals concerning
the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
After the direct talks broke down 16 months ago when Israel
began to build a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, Israel
and the U.S. have been engaged in a lengthy bargain over the
American initiative but it was reported that disputes over the
pullback scope remain.
</P>
<P>
A latest report said that the recent discussions between
U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross and Israeli negotiator Yitzhak
Molcho in New York have failed. Israel demanded that 3 percent of
the 13 percent go with special construction and zoning
restrictions for the Palestinians, but the U.S. rejected the idea
under Palestinian protests, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It was under this circumstance, among other things, that
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright last week called on
Israel and the Palestinians to resume direct contact, saying
progress is impossible without it.
</P>
<P>
Israel has expressed satisfaction that the U.S. backed a key
Israeli demand for direct talks as a mechanism to resolve the
existing problems. Its suggestion that direct talks be renewed has
been rejected more than once by the PNA, which says what Israel
needs to do is to accept the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
Erekat stressed at the seminar that the PNA would not agree to
any change to the U.S. initiative, warning the U.S. that if it
wants the direct talks to be resumed in order to allow the
initiative renegotiated, then the PNA would make its own new
demands.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the U.S. to make public its views over who should
be blamed for the current impasse in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Reopen Land Tribunals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
decided to reopen land tribunals so as to end land disputes in
the northern region of Arusha, President Benjamin Mkapa said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During a tour to Arusha Region, Mkapa said he wants to see the
end of the land conflicts before the next farming season.
</P>
<P>
The decision to reactivate the tribunals has been prompted by
the prevailing land conflicts and pileup of land cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the cash-strapped tribunals will be financed by the
State Emergency Fund, according to a news dispatch reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president urged the judiciary to speed up the
hearing of land cases.
</P>
<P>
Violent incidences resulted from land disputes have persisted
for a long time in Arusha. There are 200 outstanding land cases
in the region at present.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, the president also gave green light to native
livestock keepers to engage in farming in the Ngorongoro
Conservation Area so as to maintain their basic life.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that non-natives and farmers bent solely on
profit are not allowed to undertake agricultural activities in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Any people who ignore the ban will be punished by the law, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the government allowed subsistence farming in the
area. However, the privilege was abused by commercial farmers
coming from other places.

<HEADLINE> Arab League: Israeli Intransigence Can Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) warned Sunday
that the Middle East will be dragged into instability and tension
by the current Israeli intransigent policies towards the peace
process, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"If the Israeli government headed by Benjamin Netanyahu
continues to adopt unilateral steps and evade the implementation
of the signed agreements, this will certainly lead to a new wave
of instability and tension," the AL Assistant Secretary General
for Palestinian Affairs Saeed Kamal said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting of the Arab countries hosting
Palestinian communities which opened in Cairo Sunday, Kamal
especially warned of the risks of Israel's Jerusalem expansion
decision adopted on June 21.
</P>
<P>
Kamal said the recent public polls have shown that the majority
of the Palestinians do not believe that a lasting settlement,
accepted by both the Palestinians and Israelis, would be reached.
</P>
<P>
The polls also revealed an increasing support for violence
against Israelis, reflecting the frustration and despair among the
Palestinians, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are looking forward to a more effective role
to be played by the U.S. to force Israel to abide by the basis of
peace," Kamal said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the AL
attended the week-long meeting to garner support for the
Palestinians in the long-running deadlock in the Mideast
peace-making.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled for 16
months after Israel began to build a new settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem which the Palestinians want as their future capital.

<HEADLINE> France Upset Brazil to Win World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAINT-DENIS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- France pulled off the biggest
upset in the last match of France'98 by beating four-time title holders
Brazil 3-0 for the World Cup title.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time ever that France win the World Cup title.
</P>
<P>
Zinedine Zidane headed home two corner kicks and Emmanuel Petit
added one to give France the most coverted title in football world.
</P>
<P>
The host team played a defensive game in the first half and were
contented with launching some counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
Their tactics were quite effective and their ability of grasping
chances is superb.
</P>
<P>
At the 28th minute, the host team got a corner. Zidane headed
home the corner kick by Emmanuel Petit to give France a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian team went all out for attack and that gave the French
team enough space to have their counter-attacks. In the injury time
of the first half, Zidane again headed home a corner kick by Youri
Djorkaeff to wrap up the first half 2-0 in favor of the host team.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian team replaced Leonardo with Denilson at the
beginning of the second half.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo began to pose greater threat to the French goal but his
shots within the penalty area were all blocked by the brave French
goal-keeper Fabien Barthez.
</P>
<P>
French defender Marcel Desailly got his second yellow card in
the game and was sent off at the 63rd minute. The Brazilian team
took the chance to dominated the match completely.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian team substituted Cesar Sampaio with Edmundo at the
74th minutes and played the remaining time of the second half with
three forwards.
</P>
<P>
But they just could not tear off the host team's defence line
which has been tipped as the most solid one in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian team became more and more nervous and could not
organise effective attacks. The French team took another chance to
make it 3-0 in the injury time of the second half as Petit beat
Brazilian goal-keeper Tarrarel after a quick counter-attack.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Tries to Curb Dumping of Goods From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government decided to
set up an anti-dumping committee to curb the dumping of
foreign goods into the country.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM),
Mark O'donnel, told the Zambia News Agency Sunday that the
manufacturing sector welcomes the government's intention to set
up the anti-dumping committee to protect local manufacturers from
the adverse effect of the dumping.
</P>
<P>
O'donnel said that the local manufacturers have for sometime
now been facing stiff competition from low quality imported
commodities sold on Zambian markets at very low prices.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to focus on the adverse effect of
subsidized goods because many local companies are closing down as
a result of the presence of the competing commodities.
</P>
<P>
The patent and copyright laws should be strengthened in order
to effectively deal with rampant forgery and imitations of
products by unscrupulous businessmen, said O'donnel.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed legislation aimed at dealing with the
dumping of foreign products will not serve its purpose if law
enforcement agents do not implement the laws.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers should be part of the composition of the
anti-dumping committee so that they can advise the government on
the best way to deal with the scourge, O'donnel added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ackim Nkole, the Zambian Deputy Minister of
Commerce, Trade and Industry, said that the government was in the
process of establishing an anti-dumping committee that would
consider making changes to legislation to effectively deal with
the dumping of foreign goods in the country.
</P>
<P>
Also last week, President Frederick Chiluba said that his
government will sign trade agreements with neighboring countries
so as to protect its local industries threatened by imported
subsidized goods.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Mayor Put Under House Arrest Before Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Nasser Sebaggala, Mayor of
Uganda's Kampala city, was put under house arrest by a federal
judge in Boston, the United States, pending trial on bank fraud
charges on a date yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
This decision dashed hopes that he would be allowed to return
home before trial.
</P>
<P>
During a detention hearing on Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge
Marianne Bowler placed Sebaggala under the custody of Edmund
Narine, a Boston resident, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The judge said the mayor will have to remain at Narine's house
until his trial. He can only leave the premises under "911
(emergency) situation."
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala was also made to deposit a cash bond of 50,000 U.S.
Dollars and an unsecured bond of 950,000 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
His defense lawyers said they plan to appeal the judge's
decision.
</P>
<P>
Paul Kelly, one of the two defense attorneys, told journalists
outside the court: "I am neither satisfied nor pleased with the
verdict...nevertheless, I respect the judge's decision. We will
definitely appeal the judge's decision and we will ask the
district judge to review the conditions and allow Mr. Sebaggala
to return to Kampala and perform his duties as Mayor."
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala, however, told his Kampala supporters in a call
Thursday that he is innocent and is confident that he will return
home any time.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala was arrested on June 13 in New York for allegedly
making false customs declaration and depositing altered checks in
a U.S. bank.

KAMPALA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- At least one was killed and
several others wounded when two separate bomb blasts shocked
Kampala Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The blasts, which occurred at 10:45 p.m. and 11:20 p.m.

<P>
The Slow Boat bomb was suspected to have been planted under a
pool table.
</P>
<P>
Recently there are some letters of threat from rebels active
in the north and west of Uganda. But neither group claimed
responsibility for the two blasts. Investigation into the motive
of the blasts are still under way.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Awarded 1998 Hunger Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 Africa prize for
Leadership for the Sustainable End of Hunger has gone to Ugandan
President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni and Mrs. Celina Cossa of
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The two prize winners were announced at a special announcement
ceremony held in Blantyre, Malawi, Saturday by former United
Nations Secretary-General Dr. Perez De Cuellar who is chair of
the Award's international jury in a recorded message. The
ceremony was presided over by Malawian President Dr. Bakili
Muluzi, the Malawi News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Award carries a prize-money of 100,000 U.S. Dollars. The
Africa prize for Leadership for Sustainable End of Hunger is
under the New York based "hunger project".
</P>
<P>
De Cuellar said Museveni, apart from establishing peace and
democracy in his country, has also put in place sound economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
"These policies, together with his commitment to the
well-being of his people, have created the enabling environment
which has made Uganda one of the best performers in Africa in
terms of economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cossa was chosen due to her struggle and hard work in creating
cooperatives in Mozambique which have played a critical role in
reducing hunger and malnutrition in Mozambique, particularly in
Maputo area through increased food production.
</P>
<P>
"She is leader of the General Union of Agriculture
Cooperatives (GUAC), an organisation that has got 10,000 peasants
of whom 95 percent are women," said De Cuellar. There are 200
cooperatives under the GUAC.
</P>
<P>
Last year's prize of 100,000 Dollars was shared between
Malawi's Joyce Banda, founder and chief executive of National
Association of Business Women of Malawi (NABW), and Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the function, President Muluzi said, for Africa to
eradicate hunger, it needs to enhance food production and
increase the purchasing power among the people.
</P>
<P>
"Intensifying research on high yielding varieties that are
suitable for tropical African conditions and developing
inexpensive irrigation systems that can be replicate throughout
the country could be other ways of achieving food security on the
continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Above all, since hunger is primarily a consequence of
poverty, we need to promote rapid, broad-based economic
development, with rapid job creation and rising productivity,"
Muluzi noted.
</P>
<P>
The Africa prize, said the president, is refreshingly unique
in that it puts the spotlight for change on the positive
achievements and breakthroughs that are happening throughout
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The hunger project is a welcome catalyst to Africa's on-going
national efforts aimed at empowering and developing her
citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malawian president added that his government is striving
to eradicate hunger through the poverty alleviation program, the
country's centerpiece of economic development which aims at
reducing poverty and at the same time empowering people
economically.

<HEADLINE> Greece Unhappy Over Turkish Warplanes' Training in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Monday expressed its
unwillingness to reports of an exercise involving Turkish
warplanes at an Israeli base designed to destroy the S-300
anti-aircraft missiles which will be delivered by Russia to Cyprus
later this year.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reports of the exercise, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that if the press reports were
correct, it would be an example of offering bad services to
relations between the countries of the region and in general, to
peace and security in the southeast Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed that Greece supported multilateral
cooperation in the region and against the creation of axes.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli embassy in Athens Monday denied reports on the
exercise, saying that the reports had no basis in reality.
</P>
<P>
Israel's cooperation with countries in the region was not
directed against third parties and certainly not against Greece or
Cyprus, a press release from the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island following a Greek-Cypriot coup in
Nicosia seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Tensions on the island have risen markedly as the planned
deployment date for the Russian-made missiles approaches.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has warned that it will use force to prevent deployment
of the missiles because they threaten the security in both Turkey
and northern Cyprus, which declared independence in 1983 but
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Chief of Staff General Ismail Karadayi visited
northern Cyprus at the weekend and met with Turkish-Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash for talks reportedly on possible counter-measures to
any deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides is now in Moscow
for talks with the Russian leadership, including President Boris
Yeltsin, on issues concerning the deployment of the missiles, but
he has made it clear that delivery of the missiles could be
delayed if Turkish Cypriots resumed negotiations and progress was
made on the issue that have kept the island republic divided.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto, Kiriyenko Agree to Boost Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and his Russian counterpart Sergei Kiriyenko agreed
Monday to further strengthen bilateral ties with an expansion of
economic cooperation despite domestic political turmoil in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during an hour-long meeting between
Hashimoto and Kiriyenko after Hashimoto announced his resignation
as prime minister Monday afternoon to take responsibility for his
Liberal Democratic Party's major setback in Sunday's House of
Councillors election.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that (bilateral relations) will not change whatever
changes occur in Japan's political situation and Russia's domestic
politics," Kiriyenko told a news conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the ongoing bilateral negotiations for the conclusion of a
peace treaty by the year 2000 through the resolution of a
decades-old territorial row over Russian-held islands, Hashimoto
said he and Kiriyenko reaffirmed the importance of accelerating
the diplomatic process.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto reassured Kiriyenko that bilateral ties would be
strengthened no matter who succeeds him as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In his separate talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi, Kiriyenko sought further Japanese economic assistance by
expanding the cooperation programs as part of efforts to overcome
Russia's financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to step up bilateral cooperation,
especially in trade and economic areas, Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
After their talks, the two countries signed an unofficial
memorandum on a new agreement to protect and promote Japanese
private-sector investment in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko arrived here earlier in the day for a two-day visit
to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Sends Message to AL Chief on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid Monday received a message from
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat on
the long freeze of negotiations on the Palestinian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid was handed the message during a meeting with Asaad
Abdel-Rahman, PLO Executive Committee member in charge of the
refugees file, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The message, whose content is not available, also dealt with
the conditions of Palestinian refugees in Arab countries and in
Shaafat refugee camp, the only one in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians in Shaafat refugee camp have been over the
past 12 days the "butt of ethnic cleansing, arrests, shootings and
other intimidating practices" by Israeli forces, Abdel-Rahman told
reporters following his meeting with the AL chief.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official said the AL chief promised to make
intensive contacts at the highest level with the parties
concerned in order to press the Israeli government to stop such
practices in the interest of the future of the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Rahman asked the U.S. to persuade Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government to reconsider its intransigent
policy.
</P>
<P>
He said Palestinians have only "reluctantly" agreed to the 13
percent Israeli pullback from the West Bank as prescribed in the
latest U.S. initiative. In any fresh Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations, he said, the Palestinian side will ask Israel to
withdraw from 40 percent of West Bank territory in line with the
agreements signed with Israel.

LONDON -- The traditional march of Northern Ireland's
Protestant residents in Belfast, known as the Orange Parade,
passed off peacefully Monday morning amid tensions created by a
bomb alert and a murder one day ago.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 marchers walked in silence along the Ormeau Road,
which passes through Belfast's Catholic neighborhood, while
hundreds of other Protestants watched along the route, reported
BBC TV news.
</P>
<P>
The planed parade had caused violence and tensions lately
between Belfast's Protestant and Catholic residents, with the
Catholics regarding it as a provocative move.
</P>
<P>
The march finally took place after local Catholic residents
agreed to stage only a "dignified" silent protest to the parade.

"I hope that (bilateral relations) will not change whatever
changes occur in Japan's political situation and Russia's domestic
politics," Kiriyenko told a news conference after the meeting.

JERUSALEM -- The Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) Monday
granted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat two more weeks to form a
new Cabinet, the PLC Information Office told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
At a semimonthly session held in the West Bank city of
Ramallah, PLC Speaker Abu Ala read out a letter written to the
council by Arafat, who asked for another extension of time for him
to complete the reshuffle of the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA).
</P>
<P>
The PLC agreed to accept Arafat's request and demanded that he
announce the new lineup of the cabinet by July 25.
</P>
<P>
The PNA Cabinet resigned on June 24 after the PLC threatened to
hold a no-confidence vote against it over charges of corruption
and improper allocation of the 1998 budget.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Reaffirms Commitment to One-China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada here
Monday reaffirmed the Philippine government's commitment to the
one-China policy and assured Beijing that his administration will
not support Taiwan's bid for independence.
</P>
<P>
After a courtesy call on the President, Chinese ambassador Guan
Dengming said President Estrada was "very positive and supportive
of the one-China policy."
</P>
<P>
And this is in line with the "Three-No" policies expressed
earlier by U.S. President Bill Clinton in China -- no to Taiwan
independence, no to one-China, one-Taiwan or two-China policy, and
no to Taiwan's membership to any international organization where
"sovereignty is required," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has been bound by the one-China
policy which recognizes the People's Republic of China as the only
Chinese sovereign state and treats Taiwan only as a province of
the People's Republic of China, the Philippine News Agency
reported on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Guan also said that during the call, President
Estrada and he focused their talk on "how to develop a good
neighborly partnership" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"President Estrada expressed his wish to continue to develop a
friendly relationship with China. I also expressed our long
standing policy to further strengthen our direct relationship,"
Guan said, adding that it has been the long-standing policy of the
Chinese government to further develop its diplomatic ties with its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said China will be the first country he will
visit.
</P>
<P>
Guan, on behalf of the Chinese government, expressed his
welcome and invited Estrada to visit China at his convenient
time.

<P>
Arafat briefed Jiang on the latest developments in talks
between Palestine and Israel, as well as the Middle East peace
process. He stressed that the Palestinian side hopes that the
Israeli government will abide by existing peace agreements,
abandon its hard-line policy, and join the international community
in breaking the current deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Palestine sincerely hopes that Israel's peace talks with all
parties, including Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon, will achieve
progress, and a lasting peace will be finally achieved in the
Middle East, said Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Palestinian issue is the core of the Middle
East issue centering on the world's longest pending hot
spot. China has always been closely concerned with the Middle East
peace process, especially peace talks between Palestine and
Israel, and greatly appreciates Palestine's principled stance for
a solution through peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to support the efforts of Palestinian
people to regain their legitimate rights, including the
establishment of an independent state, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The just cause of Palestinian people will win even greater
sympathy and support from the world community during continuing
peace talks, said Jiang, adding that China, a permanent member of
the UN Security Council, will join the rest of the world in
pushing forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also briefed Arafat on China's resumption of sovereignty
over Hong Kong and the nation's foreign policy. Arafat said the
smooth transfer of Hong Kong fully demonstrates the wisdom and
success of the "one country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang presided over a welcoming ceremony for Arafat earlier in
the day, and the talks concluded with the two governments signing
an agreement on economic and technological cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Abkhazia Condemns Terrorist Attack on Russian Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The breakaway republic of Abkhazia
Monday denounced a terrorist attack on Sunday night, in which five
Russian peacekeeping soldiers died and three more injured.
</P>
<P>
According to Interfax news agency, Abkhazian Foreign Minister
Sergei Shamba condemned the attack as an attempt to thwart peace
talks between Abkhazia and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia, seeking independence from Georgia, has been in armed
conflicts with the Georgian government since 1991.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, a truck packed with CIS peacekeepers exploded
on a remote-controlled land mine near the settlement of Pichora.
</P>
<P>
Shamba said it was Georgian commandos who carried out the
attack, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Despite a protocol on ceasefire reached in Gagra on May 25,
Georgian commandos are continuing their activities inside Abkhazia
in an attempt to destabilize the situation again, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shamba noted that certain forces in the Georgian leadership are
trying to thwart the planned meeting between the Georgian and
Abkhazian heads of state Eduard Shevardnadze and Vladislav
Ardzinba.
</P>
<P>
Several important documents are expected to be signed during
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
About 1,600 peacekeepers have been separating Georgian and
Abkhazian forces since June 1992 and are scheduled to leave on
July 31.
</P>
<P>
About 200 peacekeepers died and about 100 injured during their
stay in the troubled area.

<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin reaffirmed
today that Middle East peace talks should be based on relevant UN
resolutions, and guided by the "Land for Peace" principle defined
at the Madrid peace meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks today during talks with Yasser Arafat,
President of the State of Palestine, who arrived in Beijing
earlier today for a three-day official visit. Jiang also urged
Palestine and Israel to engage in the practical implementation of
all agreements.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China and Palestine have enjoyed friendly
relations for more than three decades, and both sides cherish
their friendship which has weathered the test of time despite the
great changes which have taken place in the international
arena. Maintaining frequent contacts and exchanging views on
issues of common concern will be extremely helpful, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
China was in the first group of countries to support the just
cause of the Palestinian people, and recognize Palestine, the
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and the State of
Palestinian, said Jiang. He also reaffirmed the friendly feelings
Chinese people have for Palestinians and their support for
Palestine's struggle to restore its legitimate rights.

China is happy to note that the Palestinian National Authority
under the leadership of Arafat has engaged in unremitting efforts
and achieved satisfactory results in economic construction in the
self-rule area, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his conviction that further development
of the self-rule area and the concerted efforts of both sides with

The Chinese government and people have attached great
importance to the reconstruction and development in the
Palestinian self-rule area and have rendered relevant support,
said Jiang, adding China is fully optimistic about the further
expansion of bilateral trade, and willing to engage in joint
efforts to accelerate trade links.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the belief that bilateral trade will enjoy
great prospects as the process of Palestine's self-rule deepens
and the economy continues to grow. China not only welcomes
Palestinian businesspeople to participate in commodities fairs and
seek more trade opportunities with China, but will also encourage
more strong Chinese companies to participate in industrial
construction in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people will never forget China's support
which has greatly helped the State, said Arafat, adding
that Palestine is proud to see that bilateral ties have been

<HEADLINE> EU to Extend Directive to Fight Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission announced
on Monday it will extend and expand its directive on combating
money laundering in the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation union, is
considering amending the current anti-money laundering directive
to cover a wider prohibition, extending the directive to certain
non-financial activities and professions, improving cooperation
between financial intelligence units, an official of the
commission briefed the press Monday.
</P>
<P>
The commission hoped that it would come forward with a new
directive proposal late this year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
The current commission directive only obliges EU member states
to combat the laundering of the proceeds of drugs trafficking,
although nearly all the member states have already extended their
own legislation to cover the proceeds of crimes such as terrorism,
prostitution, fraud and illegal gaming.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that the move to extend and expand
the existing EU directive is designed to make anti-money
laundering more effective by extending the directive's obligations
to cover the activities and professions outside the financial
services sector such as auditors, legal professions, real estate
agents and casinos.
</P>
<P>
Such an extension will bring the EU rules in line with the
latest international recommendations and the Amsterdam European
Council's Action Plan to combat organized crimes, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
The commission admitted in a report that the number of
suspicious money laundering transaction reports rose in most EU
member states from 1994 to 1997.

<P>
The agreement calls for the French-based Compagnie Generale Des
Eaux-New World Consortium to build the waterworks in line with
the BOT (build-operate-transfer). The project will be the first
urban public utility BOT project approved by the central
government.
</P>
<P>
The facility will consist of a water supply system with a daily
capacity of 400,000 tons, a water treatment plant with the same
capacity and a 27-km pipeline.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Set Up Committee for Restructuring Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian deputy prime
minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim Monday announced plans
to set up a joint public and private sector steering committee to
kick-start and expedite the restructuring of corporate debts.
</P>
<P>
"This committee will work with various groups of creditors
within an agreed framework to secure orderly and well-informed
decisions on whether, and on what terms a company, is worth
supporting," he told parliament while announcing a fiscal stimulus
and additional measures to restore economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to Anwar, since the second half of 1997, the
performance of the corporate sector in Malaysia has deteriorated
significantly due to the regional economic and financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of corporations, including large companies,
were facing serious financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of debts is necessary to improve the
liquidity position of businesses that are still viable but
burdened by huge debts, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the objectives of restructuring corporate debts are to
minimize losses to creditors, shareholders and other stakeholders
and to prevent companies from facing liquidity problems.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the details of corporate debt restructuring, Anwar
said it would encompass four basic principles, which among others,
stipulate that creditor banks, despite their financial
difficulties, should continue to provide credit to companies.
</P>
<P>
"It is inappropriate for creditor banks to stop credit lines
and appoint receivers in haste," he said.
</P>
<P>
Losses should be jointly borne in a fair manner by creditors
according to specified categories, and decisions about a company's
future must be based on comprehensive information shared among all
parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to accelerate debt restructuring, specific tax
incentives were being considered to encourage creditors to
participate in corporate debt restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"The government may also review the procedures related to the
foreign ownership and participation in some of the large
corporations to facilitate the restructuring process," he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Banks Urged to Reschedule Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian deputy prime
minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim Monday urged banks to
reschedule their debts and not to put too much pressure on
companies to pay up.
</P>
<P>
"The government does not want creditor banks to put too much
pressure on companies to pay up," he told reporters after
announcing a fiscal stimulus and additional measures to restore
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"What is to be done is to get them (banks) together with the
private sector when encountering difficulty due to the decline in
share prices and the depreciation of the ringgit to reschedule
debts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar announced in Parliament that Bank Negara (central bank)
will establish a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) to spearhead the
recapitalization of the banking sector, and the central bank would
 provide the initial capital and invite various multilateral
agencies to play an active role in the special agency.
</P>
<P>
He also announced plans to set up a joint public and private
sector steering committee to kick-start and expedite the
restructuring of corporate debts.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the restructuring of corporate debts is
necessary to ensure continued credit extension to generate
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Debt restructuring will complement the role of Pengurusan
Danaharta Nasional Bhd, an asset management company established to
revive the non-performing loans (NPLs) of banking institutions,
and the SPV.
</P>
<P>
"We have now decided on the SPV for recapitalization of the
banking sector to ensure that all banks will be much more solid
and strong financially," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said banks have to take responsibility to carry on with
their business of lending and to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is not proper for the government to take all measures to
assist and recapitalize the banking sector and not ask the banks
to continue with their (lending) programs to productive sectors,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The recapitalization of the banking sector for 1998 and 1999
has been projected to be 16 billion ringgit (3.77 billion U.S.
dollars) to maintain the risk-weighted capital ratio at 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the government will consider applications for
foreign equity participation in any Malaysian company, without
prejudice, including telecommunications companies, and the
applications will be dealt with in accordance with set guidelines
and procedures.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also announced the revision of the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) growth to a negative rate of 1.0 percent to
2.0 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's annual real GDP growth in the first quarter of the
year contracted by 1.8 percent, a negative GDP growth for the
first time in 13 years.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Mayor Put Under House Arrest Before Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Nasser Sebaggala, Mayor of
Uganda's Kampala city, was put under house arrest by a federal
judge in Boston, the United States, pending trial on bank fraud
charges on a date yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
This decision dashed hopes that he would be allowed to return
home before trial.
</P>
<P>
During a detention hearing on Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge
Marianne Bowler placed Sebaggala under the custody of Edmund
Narine, a Boston resident, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The judge said the mayor will have to remain at Narine's house
until his trial. He can only leave the premises under "911
(emergency) situation."
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala was also made to deposit a cash bond of 50,000 U.S.
Dollars and an unsecured bond of 950,000 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
His defense lawyers said they plan to appeal the judge's
decision.
</P>
<P>
Paul Kelly, one of the two defense attorneys, told journalists
outside the court: "I am neither satisfied nor pleased with the
verdict...nevertheless, I respect the judge's decision. We will
definitely appeal the judge's decision and we will ask the
district judge to review the conditions and allow Mr. Sebaggala
to return to Kampala and perform his duties as Mayor."
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala, however, told his Kampala supporters in a call
Thursday that he is innocent and is confident that he will return
home any time.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala was arrested on June 13 in New York for allegedly
making false customs declaration and depositing altered checks in
a U.S. bank.

<HEADLINE> 1stlead: Palestinian Injured in East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded Monday outside
the Orient House, the unofficial headquarters of Palestine
Liberation Organization in East Jerusalem, injuring a palestinian.
</P>
<P>
Quickly in response to the bomb explosion, the press office of
the Orient House issued a statement, saying the explosion against
Palestinians in East Jerusalem is "aimed at promoting violence,
shedding blood and motivating counter acts by Israeli extremists."
</P>
<P>
Strongly condemning the bomb explosion, the statement said "it
comes amidst atmospheres of continuous incitements by the right
wing of Israeli extremists and official and non-official parties
against the Orient House in particular and the Palestinian
organizations in Jerusalem in general."
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old East Jerusalem resident suffered cuts in the
head and legs when he touched a plastic bag containing the bomb,
which was placed near a trash can some 30 meters outside the
building, Israeli police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said.
</P>
<P>
Shmuel did not give the name of the injured, but said the
Israeli police are investigating the incident. The injured has
been sent to a nearby hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Orient House has been described as a future government office
of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in the Arab East
Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as their future
capital. Now it is the office of the Ministry in Charge of
Jerusalem Affairs of the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Right-wing Israelis have repeatedly held protests outside the
building, calling for its closure.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has accused the PNA of violating the
Oslo accords by operating offices in East Jerusalem, but has
stopped short of shutting down the Orient House to avoid possible
violent confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Mideast War
and declared the whole Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible
capital.
</P>
<P>
Under the autonomy accords, the status of Jerusalem is to be
determined in the final status talks between Israel and the PNA
which have been suspended since early 1996.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Firm On Shrimp Farming Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
has refused to budge over a ban on inland shrimp farming in
freshwater areas nationwide despite protests by farm operators.
</P>
<P>
The government will go ahead with the resolution of the
National Environment Board (NEB), which has been under scrutiny
for the last three months, a TV report Monday quoted Chuan as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Chuan was commenting on a plan by inland shrimp farmers in 13
provinces, who form the Black Tiger Shrimp Farmers' Club, to rally
near the parliament Tuesday to force the government to rescind the
ban.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet last week endorsed the NEB's resolution to
impose the ban, to be enforced 120 days after the prime minister
issues a decree to implement the ban. It is not clear when Chuan
will issue the decree.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said that although he had sympathy for inland shrimp
farmers, he would not allow shrimp farming to harm the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say inland shrimp farming occupies large
amounts of limited arable land and erodes the soil with salt water
carried over from the sea.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said he would ask the Science Ministry to explain to the
public the need to ban inland shrimp farming.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to ban inland shrimp farming has
prompted an outcry from shrimp farmers nationwide. Several rallies
have been held in protest against the decision. The farmers' club
said the farmers would continue to hold rallies until the
government rescinds the ban or extends the 120-day grace period to
a year or 18 months.
</P>
<P>
But the ban has won the support of many non-governmental
organizations and people who insist that the environment should
not be sacrificed for economic benefits.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior lawmaker in north China's
Hebei Province has been dismissed from his post and incarcerated
for gambling and accepting bribes.
</P>
<P>
The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) issued a circular today stating
that Jiang Dianwu, former deputy director of the Hebei People's
Congress Standing Committee, was also expelled from the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was found guilty of authorizing the establishment of a
Hebei gambling house known as "Bocai", and accepting bribes of
40,000 Hong Kong dollars in cash and goods valued at 11,000 yuan
during the process. The circular points out that gambling in China
is prohibited by law.
</P>
<P>
The former official also solicited 150,000 yuan of bribes from
a shareholder in the Yanzhao Woolen Mill in Hebei.
</P>
<P>
In a related case, a state-run enterprise complied with Jiang's
request to allocate 25,000 yuan in public funds for his wife,
daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law and unnamed individuals to
travel to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The circular urged all Party members, especially officials, to
learn from Jiang's case.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's misdeeds resulted from his "lack of political concepts
and discipline," according to the circular.

<P>
LAGOS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian companies, especially
those in the manufacturing sector, are now paying dearly for the
economic crises that have been rocking most Southeast Asian
countries in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The Business Concord Monday quoted a leading retail company
chairman as saying all manner of goods from that region were now
being dumped in Nigeria and sold at ridiculous prices.
</P>
<P>
Bassey Ndiokho, chairman and chief executive of UAC of Nigeria
Plc, noted that the situation had brought intense competition
against locally made goods whose prices are not quite
competitive.
</P>
<P>
He did not go further on how the financial crises in Southeast
Asia have affected the Nigerian economy.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that as a matter of fact, the first half of
this year had turned out to be worse than last year for almost
all sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a number of factors had combined to make the
first half year a tough and rough period for Nigerian
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
These included the significant fall of oil prices in the world
market, the energy crises within the country and the image
problems of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he believed strongly that the second half of this
year would be much better as the steps which are being taken by
the present administration and are opening the way for some world
leaders to hold talks with Nigeria would go a long way in
improving the situation.

<HEADLINE> Ex-IMF Official to Govern Tanzania's Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Daudi Ballali, a veteran
Tanzanian official assigned to work at the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) for 21 years has been appointed the new Governor of
the Bank of Tanzania (BOT), an official statement said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with an order by President Benjamin Mkapa,
Ballali, now personnel assistant to the President on Economic
Affairs, will replace Idris Rashid, whose contract expires
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ballali, 56, has been in financial institutions since late
1960s when he joined the BOT as an economist, and rose to the
position of Director of Research and Secretary to the Board
before leaving in 1976 to work for the IMF.
</P>
<P>
In his 21-year experience at the IMF, Ballali rose through the
ranks to become Deputy Division Chief in 1986, a position he held
until last year when he become an assistant to President Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
While at IMF, Ballali helped African countries such as Ghana
and Lesotho develop and implement successful economic reform
programs supported by the fund.
</P>
<P>
Between 1986 and 1997 he headed many IMF missions to Africa
such as Swaziland, Botswana, Kenya, Ethiopia, South Africa,
Sierra Leone and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
He also supervised and monitored the implementation of
economic reform programs in some of those countries on behalf of
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Born on August 17, 1942 at Mufindi, Iringa Region and married
with two children, Ballali was educated at Tosamaganga Secondary
School before going to the United States where he received his
university education, earning a Bachelor in Economics from Howard
University in 1965 and a Master in Economics in 1967 from the

<HEADLINE> Swazi Currency to Keep Its Link with South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Martin Dlamini, governor of
the Central Bank of Swaziland, has pledged to maintain the links
between the Swazi currency Emalengeni and its South African
counterpart Rand.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland had no plan to decouple the Emalengeni from the Rand
despite the latter's dramatic depreciation in recent weeks,
Dlamini was quoted by local daily Business Day Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini was reacting to calls from the public and political
leaders to de-link the Swazi monetary unit from the Rand in view
of the latter's declining value.
</P>
<P>
Some Swazi parliament members said the linking of Emalengeni
to the Rand has left the Swazi economy vulnerable to currency
speculators targeting the Rand.
</P>
<P>
The Swazi currency should not be an "innocent bystander"
caught up in South Africa's currency crisis, they said.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Rand has slipped from less than five to
about 6.4 against the U.S. Dollar and 10.63 against the British
Pound.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of Rand and Emalengeni has been one to one.
South Africa is the most important trading partner of Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini acknowledged that the most likely effect of the Rand's
depreciation would be a rise in the price of commodities.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland imports all its petrol and most of its consumer
goods from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, with a cheaper Rand, Swazi products and services
would be more competitive internationally, Dlamini said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the effect of the currency crisis on Swazi
interest rates, Dlamini said the Swazi Central Bank was
monitoring market activities in Swaziland and South Africa to
determine its interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's central bank would strive to minimize the interest
rate differentials with South Africa so as to reduce the risk of
substantial capital outflows to South Africa, he said.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Students Face Restriction in Studying in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Swaziland Ministry of
Education has announced it will not grant scholarships for Swazi
students to enroll in South African universities if the courses
they want are available at the schools of higher learning in
Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association Monday quoted Swazi
sources as reporting that the decision had shocked scores of
Swazi students who were due to leave this week to start their
first year of study at various South African universities.
</P>
<P>
The ruling will only affect first year students. Swazi
students doing their second year or above will continue to
receive their scholarship funds until the completion of their
courses in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The move is said to have been prompted by the large numbers of
Swazis failing to return home after completing their studies in
South Africa, not using their skills in Swaziland, or not
repaying scholarship money to government in accordance with the
agreement they signed.

<HEADLINE> China to Step up Crack Down on Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
announced today that a national police force will be established
to intensify the crack down on rampant smuggling in China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the announcement while meeting delegates to a
national anti-smuggling work conference that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The special force will operate under the joint guidance of
customs administrations and public security departments.
</P>
<P>
Reforming and improving the anti-smuggling system will provide
a "timely and highly effective" means for the crack down on
smuggling, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that resolute determination, prompt response,
effective measures and severe punishment will help deliver a
telling blow against rampant smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that concentrated efforts will be devoted to
solving major smuggling cases "regardless of institutions or
individuals involved."
</P>
<P>
He instructed all Party and governmental offices,
law-enforcement agencies and judiciary departments to carefully
investigate affiliated companies for the existence of smuggling
activities.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's remarks came in response to the fact that certain
officials from government departments have further complicated the
problem by directly participating in or shielding smuggling
activities.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers directly participating in or shielding
criminal acts will be investigated and punished severely, said
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Also meeting the delegates were Premier Zhu Rongji, Wei
Jianxing, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and secretary
of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing.

<HEADLINE> Protestant Parade Go Ahead Amid Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The traditional march of Northern
Ireland's Protestant residents in Belfast, known as the Orange
Parade, passed off peacefully Monday morning amid tensions created
by a bomb alert and a murder one day ago.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 marchers walked in silence along the Ormeau Road,
which passes through Belfast's Catholic neighborhood, while
hundreds of other Protestants watched along the route, reported
BBC TV news.
</P>
<P>
The planed parade had caused violence and tensions lately
between Belfast's Protestant and Catholic residents, with the
Catholics regarding it as a provocative move.
</P>
<P>
The march finally took place after local Catholic residents
agreed to stage only a "dignified" silent protest to the parade.
</P>
<P>
The march went ahead only 24 hours after a horrorable attack in
which three Catholic children in deep sleep were burnt to death.
</P>
<P>
The killings sent shock waves through both communities in the
bitterly divided British-ruled province and cast a shadow over
hopes of stability in the wake of a peace deal hammered out by
rival politicians in April.

same period last year, the Arabic-language Alshark Alawsat
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In April alone, 52,279 tourists visited the country, nearly

of 14.2 percent, according to the latest figures from Trade
Ministry.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Trade Deficit Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's total foreign trade
dropped slightly in the first nine months of the 1997/98 fiscal
year ending mid-July, but the deficit narrowed by 10.5 percent,
the Finance Ministry says.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade during the period dropped by 0.3
compared with the year-ago level, and amounted to 85.638 billion
rupees (1.3 billion U.S. dollars), the ministry says in its latest
Economic Survey.
</P>
<P>
But the total trade deficit declined by 10.5 percent to 46.727
billion rupees (700 million dollars) with export up 15.7 percent
and import down 4.1 percent, the survey notes.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the decline in trade deficit, it seems that the
country's external trade is gradually orienting toward
improvement," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's trade with India rose by 9.1 percent to 25.62 billion
rupees (400 million dollars) while the deficit with that country
fell by 13.2 percent to 13.294 billion rupees (200 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nepal's trade with other countries dropped by 3.8 percent to
60.018 billion rupees (900 million dollars) and the deficit fell
by 9.4 percent. Of the exports to them, woolen carpets accounted
for 48.4 percent, ready-made garments 41.6 percent and pulses 6.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the same period last year, export of ready-made
garments and pulses was growing as usual but that of woolen
carpets was declining, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The report says that at the end of the 1996/97 fiscal year,
Nepal's foreign currency reserves stood at 48.541 billion rupees
(700 million dollars) and rose by 25.1 percent by mid-April 1998
to 60.721 billion rupees (920 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ministry in its report also urges efforts to promote the
export-oriented industries so as to reduce the huge trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
In view of the wide ratio of the current account deficit to
gross domestic product (GDP), foreign savings has to be increased
to cover the gap, it says. "Therefore, it is imperative to control
increasing budget deficit in order to improve current account
deficit by increasing the ratio of internal savings over the
investment."
</P>
<P>
And "in order to make balance of payments surplus sustainable,
a strong need has arisen to take firm measures to attract maximum
amount of direct foreign investment in the economy which will
positively contribute to the economic development of the country,"
the report says.
</P>
<P>
"It is all the more important in the context of the declining
trade in the official capital flow in the future," it says.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets ROK Foreign Trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said today
that China has worked diligently and played its due role in
maintaining peace and stability on the neighboring Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is fully prepared to work with the
government of the Republic of Korea (ROK) to establish a friendly
and cooperative bilateral relationship oriented to the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during a meeting with ROK Foreign and
Trade Minister Park Chung-soo, who arrived in Beijing last
Saturday on a four-day visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President stressed that Sino-ROK relations have
witnessed great progress and remarkable achievements since the two
nations forged diplomatic ties some six years ago. The rapid
growth of bilateral economic and trade ties has greatly benefited
the people of the two countries, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said he is extremely pleased with the fact that the
financial situation in ROK has reached a major turning point in
its most difficult period and attributed the success to the
efforts of the ROK government and people. He expressed hope that
ROK will overcome current difficulties and regain economic
vitality at the earliest possible date.
</P>

China will continue to contribute to relieving regional
economic difficulties, according to the president.

hosted the recent visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton, said Park,
adding that the visit not only served the best interests of China
and United States, but the whole of Asia as well.

JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,
ex-wife of South African President Nelson Mandela, Sunday denied
categorically the reports that she intended to quit the ruling

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenyan Banks Woo Customers with New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Major banks in Kenya have
responded to the volatile money market by introducing innovative
products to increase the number of account holders and expand
their lending business.
</P>
<P>
Standard Chartered Bank, in partnership with Microsoft, is
offering its account holders an opportunity to own a home
computer system on easy credit terms.
</P>
<P>
The package includes access to the Internet at subsidized
rates, as well as computer training.
</P>
<P>
"We are providing finance to enable those interested in access
to computer technology to do so," the bank's product manager
Lerionoka Tiampati was quoted by Monday's East African weekly as
saying.
</P>
<P>
With an initial deposit of 20 percent of the value of the
package (about 40,000 Shillings or some 667 U.S. Dollars), the
bank provides instant unsecured credit repayable in 24 months at
instalments of less than 10,000 Shillings (167 Dollars) monthly.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank of Kenya has launched an aggressive media
campaign to promote its Barclayloan scheme, which offers account
holders quick access to funds with a flexible repayment schedule.
</P>
<P>
It enables account holders to obtain unsecured funds of
between 10,000 Shillings and 500,000 Shillings (8,333 Dollars) to
the purchase of specific items including motor vehicles, home
furnishings and appliances, payment of medical, holiday and
travel expense, purchase of shares or payment of taxes.
</P>
<P>
The maximum repayment period for a Barclayloan to purchase a
car is 60 months, while loans for buying furniture and home
appliances can be repaid in 24 months.
</P>
<P>
However, to qualify for a Barclayloan, proof of ownership of a
home, telephone and a credit card is required, in addition to a
loanee having been an account holder with the bank for at least
six months.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank managing director Gareth George recently said
the bank is reviewing its lending policies to allow more
applicants access to this Barclayloan scheme.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of unsecured credit facilities by commercial
banks in Kenya is in keeping with a worldwide trend in which
financial bodies are gradually moving from collateral-based
lending to loans based on availability of project or a borrower's
ability to pay, experts say.
</P>
<P>
A number of other Kenyan banks, like the Cooperation Bank,
Kenya Commercial Bank and National Bank of Kenya, also run
specialized credit schemes.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) has a University Graduate Loan
Scheme, credit schemes targeting women groups and the informal
sector and concessionary credit lines for coffee and tea farmers
for the purchase of farm machinery and inputs.
</P>
<P>
KCB's Public Relations Officer Kefa Bosire said the
non-collateral credit schemes have enabled the bank to expand its
revenue base and diversify its product line.
</P>
<P>
Customers have been shunning conventional bank loans due to
the prevailing high interest rates, currently pegged at between
25-30 percent, and most savers do not meet collateral demanded by
banks.
</P>
<P>
There are 53 commercial banks and 16 non-bank financial
institutions in the east African country, according to the
Central Bank of Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Insurers Issue Warning on Bank Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's insurance industry has
warned that it might cease covering some areas of banking if
immediate measures were not taken to stern the recent wave of
armed raids on banks in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Bank robberies have been rampant in Kenya recently with four
banks in Nairobi and Mombasa, the largest two cities in Kenya,
having been raided since last month.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Kenya Insurers (AKI) said that if the
robberies continued, the insurance companies may be forced to
avoid high risk aspects of banking.
</P>
<P>
"Our concern stems from the fact that since all banks are
insured for cash in transit and money on the premises, it is the
insurers who absorb the losses in case of robberies," Monday's
East African weekly quoted an AKI statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This means an unnecessary diversion of resources from
productive sectors to non-productive activities," said the
statement issued last week.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Bankers Association (KBA), in response, said the
banks were equally concerned about the robberies and had set up a
committee which works closely with the Central Bank of Kenya's
Anti-Fraud Squad.
</P>
<P>
"This is not an issue for the banking industry alone but a
reflection of the general rate of crime and insecurity in the
country," said KBA.
</P>
<P>
Among immediate measures the insurance industry has
recommended for banks is reduction of cash held by tellers at any
given time, as well as the total amount held in bank's vaults.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to minimize the amounts of money stolen in
the event of a robbery," said Tom Aciando, a senior official with
American Life Insurance Company.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources said the requirement had already been
implemented, with tellers not holding more than 1.2 million
Shillings (20,000 U.S. Dollars) at any one time.
</P>
<P>
Requirements that banks step up their internal security and
surveillance system are also said to have been effected by most
banks, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said the surveillance cameras video-taped the
entire robbery at the Mashareq Bank early this month in which
500,000 Shillings (8,333 Dollars) was stolen, providing vital
clues to police.
</P>
<P>
However, the KBA said banks cannot adequately control the
amount of cash in their vaults due to the daily needs by
supermarkets and others doing cash withdrawals for purpose of
stock purchases or customers change.
</P>
<P>
Insurers are also considering increasing premiums and excess
charges in case of a theft or loss. The premiums rates vary from
0.01 percent to three percent of the annual cash carriage.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources hinted last week that a hike in premiums will
be passed on to customers and could further inflate the already
high banking service charges.
</P>
<P>
The new demands by the insurance industry are likely to
adversely affect small banks, which lack enough resources to
effect the recommended security measures.
</P>
<P>
There are 53 registered banking institutions in Kenya, 47 of
which are small banks.

He pledged that in his five-year term as the chairperson, the
Movement would continue to stress decentralization, Universal
Primary Education (UPE) as it had done.
</P>
<P>
To receive education is the best way to empower youths and
women in rural areas, he said. It is education which can improve
the quality of Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
The NRM would continue to commit itself to bringing more
democracy to Uganda, modernizing the society, liberalizing the
economy, stabilizing the foreign exchange rate, eliminating
poverty and reconciliating with those against the government, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would use all his energy for the progress of the
Movement.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's conference, Moses Kigongo from the Buganda Region
was elected the vice chairperson of the NRM.
</P>
<P>
The national congress of the NRM convenes every five years. It
is mainly participated by NRM's local council leaders, members of
parliament, representatives from some interest groups.
</P>
<P>
The NRM was formed in June 1981 and has been Uganda's ruling
party since it took power in January 1986.

<HEADLINE> EU Concerned About Hashimoto's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC), the
executive body of the 15-nation European Union, voiced concern
over the announced resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A commission spokesman said the EC was concerned about the
future of economic reforms the Japanese government had pledged.
</P>
<P>
The election results showed the Japanese people wanted further
measures to tackle its economic slump, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the EC would closely follow the development around
Hashimoto's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto resigned on Monday as president of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) and hence Japanese prime minister after the
party suffered a devastating setback in the upper house poll on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
LDP won only 44 seats in the 126-seat upper house, falling far
short of the 69 seats they needed to regain a majority in the
chamber, which it lost in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto led the LDP since September 1995 and became prime
minister from January 1996.

<HEADLINE> HK Promotes Adoption of Corporate Environmental Reporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A series of seminars will be
held in Hong Kong for business executives and environment managers
to promote the adoption of Corporate Environmental Reporting, a
business strategy for firms to win community support by making
public their environmental performance.
</P>
<P>
The seminars, which will start Tuesday through Thursday, are
organized by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) in
collaboration with the Planning, Environment and Lands Bureau, the
Center of Environmental Technology Limited, the Hong Kong General
Chamber of Commerce and the Hong Kong Productivity Council.
</P>
<P>
Shirley Lee, a principal environmental protection officer of
EPD, said that many large corporations worldwide have embraced
Corporate Environmental Reporting as a smart business move to
engage their stockholders, investors, legislators, neighbors and
green groups in regular dialogue to gain widespread rapport on
their environmental related business decisions.
</P>
<P>
"Businesses in Hong Kong will need to catch up with the rest of
the world," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
According to an international survey in 1996, nearly 75 percent
of corporations in Europe and North America are now disclosing
environmental information in their annual reports.
</P>
<P>
"However, a local survey on 500 public-listed companies in 1995
revealed that only 11 percent of Hong Kong's firms attempted to
make some mention on the environment in their annual financial
reports; and only two companies ever published their stand-alone
environmental reports," she added.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day seminars, speakers from Britain and Hong
Kong will brief management personnel of the public and private
sectors on the benefits of Corporate Environmental Reporting and
how to achieve them.

<HEADLINE> China Expresses Opposition to U.S. Anti-China Resolutions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Tang
Guoqiang said today that China strongly resents and is resolutely
opposed to recent anti-China resolutions adopted by the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remark in response to a question concerning two
recent resolutions passed by the U.S. senate.
</P>
<P>
On July 10, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution tabled by
Senator Trent Lott, Republican majority leader of the Senate,
requiring the Clinton administration to continue arms sales to
Taiwan and urging the U.S. government to press China not to use
force in the reunification effort.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Senate also passed a resolution
U.S. Senator Jesse Holms tabled supporting Taiwan's entry into the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Tang reiterated that the Taiwan issue is the most important and
sensative aspect in Sino-U.S. relations. "The key to ensuring the
healthy and stable growth of Sino-U.S. ties lies in properly
handling the Taiwan issue in accordance with the principle set
forth in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the U.S. government clearly committed itself to
observing the "One China Policy", as well as the principles
outlined in the three communiques.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government has clearly pledged it will not
support the concepts of 'Two Chinas' or 'One China, One Taiwan,"
as well as Taiwan independence and Taiwan's entry into any
international organizations composed by sovereign countries,"
according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side has also promised to resolve issues related to
arms sales to Taiwan in accordance with the August 17 Sino-U.S.
Communique.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe the U.S. side should strictly observe all
the above principles and implement all related commitments," he
stressed.

<P>
The basic policy of the Chinese government on the Taiwan issue
is to peacefully reunify China and observe the concept of "one
country, two systems", according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
"The reunification of China's is purely China's internal affair
and no foreign interference will be allowed."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that only sovereign states can join the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, both of which
operate under the auspices of the United Nations. "Taiwan is an
integral part of and as such is not qualified to join the two
organizations," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that the development of the
Sino-U.S. relationship is in the fundamental interests of the two
countries and represents the common aspirations of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The joint efforts of the two sides led to the recent highly
successful visit to China by President Clinton, said Tang, adding
that the momentum for improving and developing bilateral relations
resulted from extensive efforts which are well worth cherishing.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that attempts by some U.S. congressmen to promote
anti-China resolutions are "doomed to failure". He stressed that
such attempts will simply obstruct continuing improvements and the
development of Sino-U.S. relations and thus run counter to
historic trends.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope the U.S. Congress will proceed in the
fundamental interests of the two countries and their people and
will play a positive rather than a negative role in the bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope the U.S. government will adopt effective measures
to remove obstacles and prevent the Congress from adopting
related resolutions in order to ensure the bilateral relationship
remains undamaged," said Tang.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Deport 109 Boat People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Interior Minister Dinos
Michaelides announced Monday that Cyprus has decided to deport 109
illegal Arab and African immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides told reporters here that the deportation procedures
would be soon completed for these immigrants, who illegally
entered Cyprus by a boat last month.
</P>
<P>
He said the boat people would be returned to their home
countries despite their wish to remain in Cyprus. He added that
the domestic and international laws should be implemented.
</P>
<P>
These illegal immigrants camed from countries including the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya,
Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly left Tripoli of Lebanon on June 18 on a small
Syrian-flagged fishing boat after paying as much as 5,000 U.S.
dollars each to go to either Greece or Italy.
</P>
<P>
Without food or fresh water, the immigrants were found 11 days
later by a Ukrainian-flagged commercial vessel, which towed it to
Cyprus on June 29.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government accommodated the immigrants at a hotel
in the southern coastal town of Limassol. About 20 policemen have
been assigned to guard them while the authority conducted an
investigation and issued new travel documents for them.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Indian former chief of naval
staff Admiral L. Ramdas said Monday that the BJP-led government
had committed a blunder by exploding five nuclear bombs in
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a seminar on India's nuclear tests and aftermath
in Thiruvananthapuram city 2,780 km southwest of New Delhi, Ramdas
said that India should explore the possibility of involving an
internationally respected leader of Gandhi mold like Nelson
Mandela as a mediator between India and Pakistan for settlement of
bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, tit-for-tat, conducted six nuclear tests on May 28
and 30 following the five nuclear tests conducted by India on May
11 and 13 this year aggravating the tense situation between the
two countries as well as in the region.
</P>
<P>
India should work with China and Pakistan to force a total ban
on all nuclear weapons in the world and resurrect former prime
minister Rajiv Gandhi formula to compel the nuclear weapon states
to destroy their weapons based on a fixed timetable, Ramdas said.
</P>
<P>
Both India and Pakistan should announce a ban on any further
development of nuclear weapons and delivery systems and sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), he further said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenyan Banks Woo Customers with New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Major banks in Kenya have
responded to the volatile money market by introducing innovative
products to increase the number of account holders and expand
their lending business.
</P>
<P>
Standard Chartered Bank, in partnership with Microsoft, is
offering its account holders an opportunity to own a home
computer system on easy credit terms.
</P>
<P>
The package includes access to the Internet at subsidized
rates, as well as computer training.
</P>
<P>
"We are providing finance to enable those interested in access
to computer technology to do so," the bank's product manager
Lerionoka Tiampati was quoted by Monday's East African weekly as
saying.
</P>
<P>
With an initial deposit of 20 percent of the value of the
package (about 40,000 Shillings or some 667 U.S. Dollars), the
bank provides instant unsecured credit repayable in 24 months at
instalments of less than 10,000 Shillings (167 Dollars) monthly.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank of Kenya has launched an aggressive media
campaign to promote its Barclayloan scheme, which offers account
holders quick access to funds with a flexible repayment schedule.
</P>
<P>
It enables account holders to obtain unsecured funds of
between 10,000 Shillings and 500,000 Shillings (8,333 Dollars) to
the purchase of specific items including motor vehicles, home
furnishings and appliances, payment of medical, holiday and
travel expense, purchase of shares or payment of taxes.
</P>
<P>
The maximum repayment period for a Barclayloan to purchase a
car is 60 months, while loans for buying furniture and home
appliances can be repaid in 24 months.
</P>
<P>
However, to qualify for a Barclayloan, proof of ownership of a
home, telephone and a credit card is required, in addition to a
loanee having been an account holder with the bank for at least
six months.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank managing director Gareth George recently said
the bank is reviewing its lending policies to allow more
applicants access to this Barclayloan scheme.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of unsecured credit facilities by commercial
banks in Kenya is in keeping with a worldwide trend in which
financial bodies are gradually moving from collateral-based
lending to loans based on availability of project or a borrower's
ability to pay, experts say.
</P>
<P>
A number of other Kenyan banks, like the Cooperation Bank,
Kenya Commercial Bank and National Bank of Kenya, also run
specialized credit schemes.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) has a University Graduate Loan
Scheme, credit schemes targeting women groups and the informal
sector and concessionary credit lines for coffee and tea farmers
for the purchase of farm machinery and inputs.
</P>
<P>
KCB's Public Relations Officer Kefa Bosire said the
non-collateral credit schemes have enabled the bank to expand its
revenue base and diversify its product line.
</P>
<P>
Customers have been shunning conventional bank loans due to
the prevailing high interest rates, currently pegged at between
25-30 percent, and most savers do not meet collateral demanded by
banks.
</P>
<P>
There are 53 commercial banks and 16 non-bank financial
institutions in the east African country, according to the
Central Bank of Kenya.

PARIS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Eighty people were injured in an
accident caused by a madly driven car on the Champs-Elysee
broadway in central Paris early Monday morning at the peak of the
celebration for the host World Cup victory.
</P>
<P>
Firemen said that all the injured, 10 of them seriously, were
dispatched to the Pitie-Salpetriere hospitals and two other
smaller hospitals in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred rescuers, including doctors and workers of the Red
Cross, fire department, the SAMU emergency rescue operation and
the Protection Civile organization joined the rescue operation in
the field.
</P>
<P>
The magnificent 3-0 victory of France over Brazil in the World
Cup final plunged Paris into a complete drunkenness of
celebrations and the smell of carnival was thick in the air over
the city's major spots, such as Champs-Elysee, the Bastille Square
and along the Seine River.
</P>
<P>
Police said about one million people gathered at Champs-Elysee
and 10,000 gathered at Bastille Square until early this morning.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the most emotional nights of Paris since the
end of World War II and could be the last of such in the 20th
century.

<HEADLINE> UN Organ to Help Jordan in WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has adopted a U.N. technical
assistance project that will help the country in the accession
talks with the World Trade Organization (WTO), a press release
issued here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the release issued by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), the 300,000 U.S. dollar UNDP project
was approved by Jordan's Ministry of Planning.
</P>
<P>
The project was aimed at increasing Jordan's competitiveness in
its gradual integration into the global market, especially in its
preparation for the upcoming WTO accession negotiations later this
month.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, experts from the Geneva-based
U.N. Conference on Trade and Development will help Jordan's
negotiators develop technical and mediation skills in talks with
WTO representatives. This will prepare the ground for Jordan's
final integration into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Officials at Jordan's Ministry of Trade, Commerce and Supply
who will be directly involved in the entry talks, will receive
training on bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations and on
function of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
A team of high-level international consultants will also be
recruited to assist in the preparation for the negotiations, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of the UNDP's efforts to boost Jordan
capacity to integrate itself into the global economy and increase
its performance in a highly competitive environment, especially in
the fields of investment and trade, the release added.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP believed that the stringent rules in the WTO
agreements on trade of goods and services and the enforcement of
intellectual property rights will pose grave challenges for Jordan
on its bid to join the 132-member WTO.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Trade, Commerce and Supply Hani Mulqi said in May
that Jordan expected to join the WTO by mid-1999 after it
introduces a new package of economic regulations.
</P>
<P>
Jordan used to rely on regional trade, and intellectual
property rights are reportedly not well respected in the country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indian Population Clock Ticking Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- India's population reached
979,860,411 at 7 a.m. Sunday, moving close to the 1 billion mark
and signalizing that the South Asian country might relegate China
to second place as the most populous country in the world just in
a few decades.
</P>
<P>
With some 30 people born every minute and 43,000 each day on an
average, the population in India is projected to reach 1,264
million by 2016, thus surpassing China's present population of 1.2
billion, the Press Trust of India said Sunday, quoting Executive
Director of the Population Foundation of India K. Srinivasan.
</P>
<P>
With only 2.4 percent of the land area but 16 percent of the
population in the world, this mass of humanity in India has kept
putting increasing pressure on its infrastructure, economy,
environment, education, primary health care and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that India formulated an official population
policy as early as in 1952, its population went up to 846 million
in 1991 from 345 million at the time of independence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
The latest 100 million were added in less than six years while
it took 42 years for the population to add 100 million before
independence.
</P>
<P>
India's population is not only large but has also been
maintaining unacceptably high rates of growth.
</P>
<P>
The main reason is that the family planning programs are not
implemented qualitatively and, secondly, it is because there are
no programs for educating women in many states.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, there is no political commitment in many states,
resulting in the disparity in the success of the schemes,
Srinivasan said.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported about the failure in program
implementation and about what is called "plans without planning."
</P>
<P>
The Indian Express daily reported Sunday that a high-profile
group of eminent scientists and demographers headed by noted
scientist M. S. Swaminathan chalked out five years ago what was to
be the "definitive" population policy for the next few decades.
</P>
<P>
Four successive governments have mulled over the draft,
moderated and modified it, yet it is still a long way to go for a
comprehensive population policy to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
The National Agenda for Governance announced last March by the
ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) speaks of a "suitable and
judicious mix of incentives and disincentives for population
control."
</P>
<P>
However, the experience of health professionals in the field is
that any scheme involving disincentives runs into a slew of
problems, primarily because the line dividing what is termed a
"disincentive" and outright coercion is often blurred.
</P>
<P>
The major obstacle to the successful implementation of family
planning and welfare schemes is the lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
In the 8th five-year plan from 1992 to 1997, the Department of
Family Welfare received some 70 billion rupees (1.85 billion U.S.
dollars) as against 65 billion rupees (1.76 billion dollars) in
the 7th five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
Because the resources have been not able to cover even the
costs of maintaining the current programs, the department has not
been able to increase the range of contraceptive use in the
programs, or to strengthen the supporting reproductive and child
health systems, according to a latest government report on family
welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
However, the programs have attracted more external assistance
and last Saturday the United Nations Population Fund announced 100
million U.S. dollars in support of India's population and
development programs.
</P>
<P>
The government has made some progress in family and welfare
programs, the report said. Infant mortality rate was brought down
from 146 in 1951-61 to 72 in 1996 per 1,000 live births and crude
death rate fell from 22.8 to nine per 1,000 in the same period.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) Monday granted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat two
more weeks to form a new Cabinet, the PLC Information Office told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
At a semimonthly session held in the West Bank city of
Ramallah, PLC Speaker Abu Ala read out a letter written to the
council by Arafat, who asked for another extension of time for him
to complete the reshuffle of the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA).
</P>
<P>
The PLC agreed to accept Arafat's request and demanded that he
announce the new lineup of the cabinet by July 25.
</P>
<P>
The PNA Cabinet resigned on June 24 after the PLC threatened to
hold a no-confidence vote against it over charges of corruption
and improper allocation of the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
In another letter to the council on June 24, Arafat said that
he accepted the resignation of the cabinet,but the formation of a
new Cabinet would take time due to his ongoing consulations with
different political parties.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has started consultations with various opposition
parties since June 16 over the cabinet reshuffle.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia believes Tokyo's policy
toward Moscow will not change with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's resignation, a Russian official said.
</P>
<P>
The ranking official with the Russian Foreign Ministry was
quoted by an Itar-Tass news agency report as saying Monday that
Moscow regards Hashimoto's step down as Japan's internal affair.
</P>
<P>
The decision to resign is his personal step made in keeping
with traditions of Japanese politics, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese premier officially announced his decision earlier
in the day, and his resignation had already been approved at a
meeting of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership.
</P>
<P>
As the LDP remains in power, the Russian diplomat said, Russia
wants to see its relations with Japan further developed along the
same line which the Hashimoto administration has been following.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko arrived Monday in Tokyo on a two-day official visit
designed to help boost bilateral trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The visit immediately followed the Japanese ruling party's
crushing defeat in the Sunday election of the House of
Councillors, or the upper house of parliament.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
here Monday urged the people to continue practicing birth control
as the country's population is expected to reach 318 million by
the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
"We need to sustain the success of our family planning program
because failing to do so will result in impacts that will be felt
in the future," the president told a gathering during the
observance of World Population Day.
</P>
<P>
Habibie pledged that the government will continue to give
priority to the family planning program, which encourages each
couple to have only two children.

<P>
The Indonesian government introduced the family planning
program in the early 1970s to check population growth and help the
people increase their prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia now has more than 200 million people, making it the
fourth most populous nation in the world" after India, India and
the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that if the country successfully carries out
its birth control program, Indonesia would lower its rank to sixth
by 2050.

By then, India would be the most populous country with about
1.53 billion people, followed by China (1.51 billion), Pakistan
(357 million), the United States (348 million), Nigeria (339
million) and Indonesia (318 million).
</P>
<P>
"Our success in the family planning program must also be
followed by successes in improving the people's quality of life
and in distributing the population more evenly," Habibie added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces Budget Deficit for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim Monday announced that there would be a
budget deficit of about 10.0 billion ringgit (2.358 billion U.S.
dollars) for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in the Federal Government budget is a result of an
additional allocation of about 7.0 billion ringgit (1.65 billion
dollars) for development expenditure in 1998, Anwar, who is also
finance minister, said when unveiling fiscal stimulus and
additional measures to revive the economy in Parliament here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the bulk of the additional allocation would be
distributed to various projects involving agriculture, housing,
education, infrastructure and public facilities, industrial
development, rural development, health, and poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
In outlining the criteria for projects to qualify for the
additional allocation, Anwar said they include projects that will
not cause a decline in reserves or outflow of liquidity, enable
import substitution and increase exports of goods and services and
are capable of generating demand for domestic goods and services.
</P>
<P>
They should also increase efficiency and national
competitiveness, result in the output of goods and services with a
short gestation period, and ensure that the social safety net is
in place, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the budget deficit would be financed from domestic
sources, international institutions as well as through
international market loans,
</P>
<P>
He said the international institutions from which funds would
be tapped include the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and
Islamic Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also said that non-performing loans in the banking
system, on a net basis, has risen to 8.5 percent at the end of May
compared with 4.7 percent at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"If the conditions under the worst case scenario materializes,
the projected recapitalization required for the banking system for
1998 and 1999 will be 16.0 billion ringgit (3.773 billion dollars)
in order to maintain the risk-weighted capital ratio of nine
percent," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and the South African
Customs Union (SACU) will sign a trade agreement Monday in South
Africa, opening the latter's market to many Zambian commodities
on favorable conditions.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving here on Sunday for Pretoria, capital of South
Africa, to sign the agreement, Zambian Commerce, Trade and
Industry Minister Enock Kavindele said the occasion is important
for Zambia because it will boost its export to the SACU member
countries, to South Africa in particular, which has maintained a
strict import code, according to Zambia Daily Mail Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement to be signed, Zambian beef, wooden doors,
window frames, cement, metal cables, jewellery, clothes, sugar,
milk, soap, beer and vegetables will enjoy zero duty on the SACU
market.
</P>
<P>
Kavindele said the agreement, reached after protracted
negotiations, has challenged Zambian farmers and business
community to meet the quotas to be given under it.
</P>
<P>
"There has been an outcry from the Zambian business community
for us to level the playing field with their South African
compatriots, here is an opportunity for them to prove their worth
and I do not think they will fail to measure up to the
challenge," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement will allow most goods to enter South
African market duty free although some of them will attract
customs but at a reduced rate.
</P>
<P>
The highest rate will be at 20 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to push for larger quotas for our sugar and milk and
hope Zambian entrepreneurs will be able to maintain export
standards so that our products can compete favorably," Kavindele
said.
</P>
<P>
In the past Zambian business sector complained about
unbalanced trade with SACU which comprises South Africa,
Botswana, Swaziland, Namibia and Lesotho.

<HEADLINE> Heroin Worth 26M U.S. Dollars Seized in Auckland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Customs officers
seized a heroin shipment worth a record 26 million U.S. dollars at
Auckland International Airport last Thursday, the Customs Service
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The heroin came from Thailand and was believed to have been
headed for Australia.
</P>
<P>
Customs Service investigations manager Phil Chitty said Monday
that it was the highest value ever drugs haul in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
He said that the previous highest was 10.4 million U.S. dollars
worth of cocaine seized from a ship in Auckland about 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Chitty said the heroin arrived on an aircraft from Bangkok late
 Thursday morning and Customs officers were waiting to pounce.
</P>
<P>
"Customs and police drug investigators conducted a controlled
delivery of the consignment, and this resulted in the arrest of
two Vietnamese males late Friday afternoon, after an attempt had
been made to send the consignment on to Australia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chitty disclosed that the operation was a "direct outcome of
information" provided by New Zealand Customs and police officers
based permanently at the New Zealand Embassy in Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Revenue Registers 8 Pct Shortfall in 97-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's revenue earnings stood
at 155.8 billion taka (3.32 billion U.S. dollars), about eight
percent less than the target fixed for the 1997-98 fiscal year
which ended June 30 this year, The Financial Express daily
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Though the country's revenue earnings registered 8 percent
shortfall, it was still 12.97 billion taka (2.76 billion dollars)
more or 10.37 percent higher than the amount earned in the
previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Tax revenue during the 1997-98 fiscal year amounted to 138
billion taka (2.94 billion dollars) against the target of 150
billion taka (3.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The overall shortfall in revenue earnings forced the government
to cut the size of the annual development program by 6 billion
taka (128 million dollars) in the revised 1997-98 fiscal year
budget from the original size of 128 billion taka (2.72 billion
dollars) program.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the shortfall in the revenue earnings were
attributed to a big fall in imports, congestion at Chittagong port
and large scale smuggling of foreign goods into the country,
officials concerned were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Revenue collected from imports stood at 80.5 billion taka (1.71
billion dollars), 6.6 billion taka (140 million dollars) less than
the target, due to the import declined substantially.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the industrial production also affected the
revenue income in domestic sector, from which the revenue
collected stood at only 36 billion taka (766 million dollars)
against the target of 39.4 billion taka (838 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Earnings from income tax also declined by two billion taka
(42.6 million dollars) in the last fiscal year against the target
of 21.5 billion (45.7 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> WHO Strives to Eradicate Polio by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
vowed Monday to focus on remaining polio-endemic countries in its
efforts to eradicate the disease on time by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The countdown for the year 2000 goal of poliomyelitis (polio)
eradication has begun in earnest," said Bjorn Melgaard, Chief of
the WHO Expanded Program on Immunization.
</P>
<P>
"Failure in one country is global failure," Melgaard warned his
audience at the end of a week-long session at the United Nations
specialized agency's headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
"We must focus our efforts on the remaining polio-endemic
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The polio virus is still circulating widely in densely
populated countries in three areas: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and
Pakistan in South Asia; the Democratic Republic of Congo and
Nigeria in West and Central Africa; and Ethiopia, Somalia and
Sudan in the horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the just concluded WHO meeting said a deadly
combination of a shortfall in funds and an overdose of complacency
can jeopardize the global campaign in the final stages.
</P>
<P>
"We are virtually on the home-stretch and we badly need the
second wind to finish on time," said Bruce Aylward, in charge of
the WHO Global Polio Eradication Initiative.
</P>
<P>
"The program is already fully functioning even in Afghanistan
and Somalia," Aylward said.
</P>
<P>
But unless all countries are certified polio-free, he said, "we
can not stop routine polio immunization nor can we start enjoying
the benefits of polio eradication to the tune of 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars which will be saved each year."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,
ex-wife of South African President Nelson Mandela, Sunday denied
categorically the reports that she intended to quit the ruling
African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
"I am the ANC and I will die as the ANC," she said in a
statement sent to South African Press Association (SAPA) office
in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times reported that Madikizela-Mandela, currently
leader of the ANC Women's League, had sent a letter to the
party's leadership, threatening to quit the National Executive
Committee, citing bad treatment at the hands of top ANC members.
</P>
<P>
Among the leaders mentioned were Sports Minister Steve Tshwete
who wrote an article last year calling her a "liar" and "a
wayward charlatan".
</P>
<P>
This was after she publicly criticized the ANC for failing to
address crime, land redistribution and the shortage of housing.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Import Raw Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
decided to import 46,200 metric tons of raw sugar from Thailand
this month, using minimum access volume in-quota process, a senior
agriculture official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary William Dar said that the volume, to be
levied with 50 percent tariff, is part of the 200,000 metric tons
of raw sugar imports recommended by former agriculture secretary
Salvador Escudero last year.
</P>
<P>
Dar said that President Joseph Estrada will be issuing an order
for the National Food Authority (NFA) to push through with the
importation sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
Industry officials, however, have still to conduct
consultations on the approval for the importation of 153,800
metric tons more of raw sugar, according to Dar.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said the resumption of sugar imports signaled
the balance between the demand and the supply of the commodity in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines suffered a serious sugar glut in 1997 because
of the over-importation of sugar in late 1996 and in early 1997.
The glut forced the domestic sugar industry to slash sugar prices,
plunging the industry into a crisis.

CANBERRA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Political uncertainty in Japan
took its toll on Australian shares Monday with the market losing
more than one percent amid choppy trade.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index fell 29.3 points, or 1.07
percent, to 2,718.6. The index reached a low for the day of
2,710.8 and a high of 2,747.9.
</P>
<P>
Volatility was inspired by trade in Japan. Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto offered to resign Monday after support
for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party dropped from 61 seats to
44 in the upper house elections on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index finished down 14.3 points, or 1.34
percent, to 1,051.7 while the all industrials index finished down
48.4 points, or one percent, to 4,782.5.
</P>
<P>
Australian resources giant BHP ended the day down 15.3 cents to
14.057 Australian dollars and global miner Rio Tinto lost 30 cents
to 18.35 Australian dollars as copper prices continued to plumb
lows not seen for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
The banking index lost 58.7 points, or 0.97 percent, to 5,970.6
against a background of weaker bond prices.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Falls on Japanese PM's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar tumbled
Monday in response to political uncertainty in Japan.
</P>
<P>
In its first local trading session following a shock weekend
election result in which Japan's Liberal Democratic Party won just
44 seats, well below the 69 it needed to gain a majority, the
Australian dollar shed over one U.S. cent in short time to bottom
at 60.29 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The move followed the U.S. dollar's surge to over 144 yen.
</P>
<P>
However, stabilization in the yen later the day supported the
local dollar to its close in Sydney of 60.74 U.S. cents, from
61.38 U.S. cents last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto Monday shouldered the
blame for the election result, announcing his resignation but no
successor has yet been chosen.
</P>
<P>
That leaves a caretaker government in charge which puts Japan's
much needed economic reforms on hold at least in the near term.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 86.57 Japanese yen, from
Friday's close of 86.84, and at 1.0979 German marks from 1.1221.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Gunggy Cering, a Tibetan driver in
Gongbogyamda County of the Tibet Autonomous Region, has become a
topic among his fellow villagers for his recent spending 190,000
yuan purchasing a new Dongfeng truck.
</P>
<P>
It is the 44-year-old man's ninth updating of his trucks in the
past 12 years since he started a long-distance transport business.
</P>
<P>
Gunggy Cering is one of the millionaires emerging in Tibet with
the rapid economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
His family now owns a two-story building equipped with modern
domestic electrical appliances including a colored TV and a video
recorder.
</P>
<P>
In one of his large and bright rooms with auspicious designs on
the walls, Gunggy Cering said pridely,"My parents say that our
life is better than that of the serf owners at the time when I
was born."
</P>
<P>
In the middle of this century, 95 percent of the social wealth
in Tibet was controlled by serf owners who accounted for only 5
percent of Tibet's population then.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, it was a fairy tale for ordinary Tibetans to
earn a million yuan a year," Gunggy Cering said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Democratic Reform was carried out in Tibet 40 years
ago, the living standard of overwhelming majority of Tibetans has
been improved.
</P>
<P>
China's Central Government has spent more than 40 billion yuan
in the infrastructural projects in Tibet, involving
transportation, energy, farming and animal husbandry, and
tourism.

The projects in transportation, energy, livestock breeding,
agriculture and tourism have laid a solid foundation for the
Tibetans to do their business and become prosperous.
</P>
<P>
Wangjug, another Tibetan millionaire at Bainang County of Xigaze
Prefecture, said, "Depending on the favorable policies of the
state and my diligence, I am becoming well off."
</P>
<P>
Wangjug, who started his business on a small sum of funds in
the late 1980s, bought a computer to help manage his business.
</P>
<P>
He has a dozen trucks for transportation and he was also a
contractor for building projects. His fixed assets exceeded 4
million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds Boosts China's Hydropower Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China has 23 hydropower projects
in operation or under construction by utilizing foreign funds
worth nearly 3.7 billion US dollars, with a total generating
capacity over 18.84 million kw.
</P>
<P>
"China has the richest hydro-electric power resources in the
world, with exploitable water energy resources estimated at 376
million kw, ranking first in the world," said a senior official
with the State Power Corporation of China.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China has completed 13 hydropower
projects with a combined generating capacity of 5.62 million kw by
using 1.44 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Five others, with a total capacity of 8.1 million kw, are being
built with 1.4 billion US dollars worth of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
China has been developing its hydro-electric power industry for
four decades, but especially since the reforms and opening-up
drive began in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Total generating capacity and annual electricity output have
risen from 163,000 kw and 710 million kwh. This makes China third
in generating capacity and production in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said, there is still a lot that needs to
be done to make use of China's enormous resources. Its total
generating capacity accounts for only 13.8 percent of what is
possible.
</P>
<P>
According to China's medium-and long-range development plans,
it will have a capacity of 70 million kw by the year 2000, and by
2010, that will rise to 125 million kw, or 33.1 percent of the
country's exploitable hydro-electric power resources.
</P>
<P>
The official said that 3.5 million kw will be added annually,
on average, in the remaining years of the century, and from 2000
to 2010, hydro-electric power capacity will increase by five
million kw annually.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministerial Meeting to Focus on Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting and its related meetings will put focus on the current
economic situation and its implications on the countries within
Asia, as well as those beyond the region.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon made this
announcement at a press briefing on the 31st ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) Ministerial Meeting (AMM) and its related
meetings -- the Post Ministerial Meeting (PMC) and the 5th ASEAN
Regional Forum -- to be held from July 20 to 29.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said the prolonged financial crisis, combined with the
economic slowdown and the problems of structural reforms in Japan,
has led many to "believe that the region's optimism for continued
economic prosperity over the next two to three years has become
ambiguous at best."
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing what might be the most defining moment for
the post-cold war world -- a re-evaluation of current economic and
financial architectures; a new perspective on the role of major
economic powerhouses and emerging economies; and the swift
judgment of markets in the electronic global markets," Siazon
said.
</P>
<P>
At such a moment, Siazon said, the AMM and its related meetings
are an incomparable opportunity to put focus on the current
economic situation and consider its implications on the countries
within Asia, as well as those beyond the region.
</P>
<P>
The AMM and PMC will provide the opportunity for ASEAN
economies directly affected to consider the causes of the
financial crisis and the crisis' implications with the ASEAN
dialogue partner countries, particularly the major players -- the
United States, Japan, China and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Another issue of concern that becomes relevant in the AMM and
PMC, among ASEAN and its dialogue partners, is the financial
turmoil's concurrent effects on the social system of ASEAN, Siazon
said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the regional currency crisis and its effect, the AMM
and PMC will also tackle Cambodia, nuclear proliferation in South
Asia, and transnational crime, according to Siazon.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said Cambodia, whose admission by ASEAN was deferred in
July 1997 due to its political instability, is a key to the
realization of the dream of ASEAN 10.
</P>
<P>
Siazon promised to push the earlier acceptance of Cambodia by
ASEAN if the country conducts free, fair and peaceful general
elections.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN presently groups the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos,
Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Myanmar. The
Philippines holds the current rotating ASEAN chairmanship.

<HEADLINE> Australia Urged to Be Integrated With Asian Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Now is not the time for Australia
to withdraw from the Southeast Asian region, "we have been
integrated, it cannot be reversed," according to Thai Foreign
Minister Surin Pitsuwan.
</P>
<P>
Surin, who is paying an official visit in Sydney, told
reporters Monday that "no country is an island," engagement,
integration and cooperation were the answers to the problems in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Surin said he was in Australia to familiarize himself with the
nation's current views on the Asian financial crisis, "and to try
and convince Australian business that there is an opportunity up
there (in Asia)," he was quoted by the Australian Associated Press
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to turn the crisis into an opportunity and I think
we have been quite successful. The message that I would like to
impart to the businessmen down here in Australia is to stay
engaged, because the fundamentals in the economies of Southeast
Asia, particularly in the ASEAN, are still very, very strong," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The manufacturing base is still very much sound, it's the
confidence and the lack of capital, liquidity, that we are
suffering from and we think we will be able, through various

Australia was one leg of the tripod of Southeast Asian
prosperity, the other two being Japan and Thailand, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Australia has convinced all of us in Southeast Asia and
Thailand that you belong to the region and this is not the time to
withdraw or to shrink back because if there is a vacuum there will
be others who will want to fill the vacuum," Surin said.
</P>
<P>
Surin said he would meet with Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
Tuesday to discuss a number of issues, including the political
situation in Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Hainan to Become Intelligent Island (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, known as the largest area
open to the outside world in China, is planning to become an
"intelligent island" that vanguards the country's transfer into
knowledge economy in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The island, matching Taiwan in size, boosts the largest number
of mobile telephones owned by every hundred urban residents among
all cities in the country. An on-line booking system that the
island first adopted has now been widely used in the country for
tourism services.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest plan of the south-most island province
of China, it will draw one-fifth of its GDP from information
industry by 2010. In that year, 80 percent of the households in
the island will be hooked with a wide-band network that combines
functions of telephone, computer and television in one. The whole
island will be covered with an intelligent network that extends to
all aspects of economy, social management and public life.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Changzhi, director of the information economy office of
Hainan province, said that this is not an unattainable target
because China has embarked on an irreversible course to a
knowledge economy.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of the next century, China will become the
second largest market of personal computers and the largest user
of telephone lines in the world.
</P>
<P>
Hainan and other coastal areas have taken the lead in turning
China into a information economy. Since the beginning of the
1990s, Hainan has invested more than four billion yuan (482
million US dollars) in laying two optical fiber cables between the
island and the mainland, building a satellite station and
developing a circuit of wide-band cables around the island.
</P>
<P>
In the end of 1996, the island opened the Hainan Public
Information Network, an Internet-based network connecting
governmental institutions, enterprises and individual users.
</P>
<P>
Huo Yiwei, a key developer of the network, said that it was
designed to multiply efficiency of resources by facilitating
smooth flow of information.
</P>
<P>
The governmental administration system and statistics system,
which are part of the network, have played an important role in
rationalizing the decision-making process. The systems give
government officials access to accurate and prompt information of
the society and economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
The information network has made life more convenient for
island residents and greatly facilitated the operation of local
enterprises. Citizens of Haikou city, capital of Hainan, use IC
card instead of cash to pay their medical bills. Island residents
can open an account at a bank and make settlement through any one
of the five major commercial banks in the island.
</P>
<P>
Local township enterprises have successfully found business
partners in the other semisphere on Internet.
</P>
<P>
Xing Ming, manager of the Hainan Agricultural Information
Network, said that the on-line service provider enrolls a dozen of
users every day among local enterprises that are eager to
advertise their products on internet.
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial government said that
development of an information economy is more than building
infrastructures and networks. He said that the most important
thing is to reform the mode of management.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government set up the Information Economy Office
to push forward this reform last year. As part of cross-province
education program, all civil servants under the age of 45 and
applicants for becoming civil servants must have training in
computer application.
</P>
<P>
Zhan said that Hainan attracts talents with beautiful
environment, open policies and flexible systems.
</P>
<P>
"We will be able to catch up with and surpass advanced
economies as long as we have adequate talents," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Hainan has become a newly rising information
industrial center in China, following Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
In March, China's largest software sales company announced to
move its headquarters to Hainan. Many international IT companies
such as Microsoft, IBM, Compaq, NEC and Lotus are discussing with
Hainan on cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
As the largest special economic zone in China, Hainan is
building a model of information society of the 21st century for
China. It plans to invest ten billion yuan (1.2 billion US
dollars) in building a information economy in the last five years
of this century.
</P>
<P>
Hainan will focus on the development of IT equipment
manufacturing and software and system integration.
</P>
<P>
Zhan said that Hainan has set a target of becoming a "software
island." A software production base has already start operation in
March and undertaken a 2-million-US-dollar contract for a Japanese
company.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Revises GDP Growth to Negative for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced Monday the
revision of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) growth to a
negative rate of 1.0 percent to 2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the current domestic and external economic
developments, the government has reviewed estimates for GDP
growth for the whole of this year," he said while announcing
fiscal stimulus and additional measures to restore economic growth
in Parliament here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Given the economic performance in the first quarter
and the latest economic indicators, it is highly likely that the
contraction in real GDP will increase if there is no action or new
measures introduced to stimulate economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said based on the country's economic performance to date
and given that regional financial markets have yet to recover,
the estimated 1998 GDP growth rate estimated at between 2 percent
and 3 percent was now clearly difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's annualized real GDP growth in the first quarter of
the year has contracted by 1.8 percent, a negative GDP growth for
the first time in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the Malaysian manufacturing sector, the engine of
the country's economy, had registered a decrease of 5 percent in
the first five months of this year due to the reduced quantity of
exports to the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, Malaysian exports
dropped by 10.3 percent in U.S. dollars mainly because exports
from the country to other ASEAN countries and Japan fell by 22.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
"All these developments have forced the government to take
immediate and direct action to revive the country's economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the current balance of payments account is expected to
strengthen as the country had registered a trade surplus of 16.2
billion ringgit (3.82 billion U.S. dollars) for the first five
months of this year compared with 48.5 million ringgit (11.438
million dollars) achieved in the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
He said exports increased from January to May this year at a
rate of 40.5 percent in terms of ringgit value, which is higher
than the increase of 20.8 percent in imports.
</P>
<P>
He said for the whole of 1998 trade account is expected to
register a surplus of 30 billion ringgit (7.075 billion dollars),
which is more than enough to balance the deficit in the service
account by 25 billion ringgit (5.896 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
This will make it possible for the current balance of payments
to register a surplus of 2 billion ringgit (471.698 million
dollars) or one percent of the GDP, which would be the first
surplus in trade since the last 10 years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also said that the inflation rate for 1998 is projected
at between 7.0 percent and 8.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> New Fund Manager Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China has set up a new fund
management company, the fifth so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The Boshi Fund Management Co. Ltd., approved by the China
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), has been jointly
sponsored by the China Greatwall Trust and Investment Company, Jinhua
City Trust and Investment Co. Ltd., Guoxin Securities Co. Ltd
and Everbright Securities Co. Ltd. It has a registered capital
of 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) has been
designated by the CSRC and the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, as qualified for the trusteeship of securities investment
funds.
</P>
<P>
To meet the new need, the bank has set up a new department in
charge of fund trusteeship business.
</P>
<P>
ABC, one of China's big-four state-owned commercial banks, had
total assets valued at 1.57 trillion yuan at the end of 1997. It
currently has more than 65,000 subsidiaries across China.
</P>
<P>
China has issued and listed four securities investment funds
to date, all closed-end and at two billion yuan each. The fifth
is expected to be issued soon.
</P>
<P>
The second group of five securities investment funds are also
scheduled to be issued in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of investment funds indicates China's
determination to develop institutional investors to ensure the
stable development of the securities market, analysts say.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Making Efforts to Bring Levy Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai has met former Foreign Minister David Levy to ask him to
rejoin the cabinet, Israel Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The radio said Mordechai held several-hour talks with Levy
Sunday and expected him to resume his previous post as foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
But it did not say if Levy had accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
The Mordechai-Levy meeting was part of the efforts made by
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prepare for a decision over
the next redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
As a deal seems near on the U.S. proposal for a 13.1 percent
Israeli withdrawal, Netanyahu is trying to secure its passing in
future parliamentary vote.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Netanyahu, whose right-wing coalition
partners have threatened to topple his government if he adopts the
U.S. proposal, will strengthen his position on a pullback if Levy
returns to the government.
</P>
<P>
The Levy-led Gesher Party is owning five seats in the
120-member Knesset (Parliament), without which the Likud coalition
has only the slim 61-seat majority.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli law, the government will step down if 61
lawmakers vote against it.
</P>
<P>
Levy, a leading moderate who supports an Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank, resigned in January over a dispute with
Netanyahu on the 1998 budget.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise in Tokyo Despite LDP's Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed sharply higher
in Tokyo Monday despite the devastating setback of Japan's Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) in Sunday's House of Councillors election.
</P>
<P>
Stocks plunged across the board in the opening minutes of
trading, but it later rebounded on buybacks by foreign brokerages
and bargain-hunting by Japanese institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended at 16,360.39, up 270.33
points, or 1.68 percent, from last Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 14.94 points or 1.20 percent to
1,256.44.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the First Section came at an estimated 390 million
shares, down from 597.78 million shares Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
While traders admitted surprise at the LDP's poor election
performance, some said it could turn out to be a blessing as the
government may be forced to come up with more effective policies
to spur the sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
Some traders said buying was spurred by the fact that the
Nikkei index had already taken a large fall of 356.89 points last
Friday, partly due to apprehension over Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,332 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
outpaced losers 710 to 447, with 119 issues remaining unchanged.
</P>

three yen on profit-taking at one point after having hit as high
as 144.50 yen on the LDP's election defeat.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 142.40-43 yen at 5 p.m. (local
time), down from 144.05-07 yen at 9 a.m. in Tokyo, but up from
141.30-40 yen late Friday in New York.
</P>

Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto offered to step down on Monday
afternoon.

TOKYO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko arrived here Monday to seek more economic aid needed for
helping Russia tide over the current financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Open Bid for Lucrative Arms Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is to invite 17 foreign arms
companies to bid for a lucrative deal to produce the unmanned
aerial surveillance systems, which will cost 350 million
U.S. dollars, a newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News said the list of foreign bidders being prepared
by the Undersecretariat for Defense Industries, which oversees
Turkey's weaponry production, includes some leading arms producers
from Belgium, Britain, France, Israel, Spain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The report did not disclose when the bid would be opened for
the tenders.
</P>
<P>
But it said that among the 17 companies, the Israeli and
U.S. contenders have higher chances of winning the bid. It added
that the Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) and U.S. General
Dynamics Corporation were likely to join hands in defeating other
rivals.
</P>
<P>
Israel has forged a close relationship with Turkey since the
two sides signed a defense cooperation deal in early 1996. The
IAI, armed with advanced electronic and technical expertise, has
been upgrading dozens of Turkish fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Turkey is expected to buy a total of 23
unmanned aerial surveillance systems, including 15 long-range and
eight medium-range ones, to increase the early-warning ability of
its army.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Turkish army bought one such system from the
General Dynamics at the cost of 14 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Injured in East Jerusalem Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded Monday outside
the Orient House, the unofficial headquarters of Palestine
Liberation Organization in East Jerusalem, injuring a palestinian,
Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old East Jerusalem resident suffered cuts in the
head and legs when he touched a plastic bag containing the bomb,
which was placed near a trash can some 30 meters outside the
building, Israeli police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said.
</P>
<P>
Shmuel did not give the name of the injured, but said the
Israeli police were investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
Orient House has been described as a future government office
of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in the Arab East
Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government has accused the PNA of violating the Oslo
accords by operating offices in East Jerusalem, but has stopped
short of shutting down the Orient House to avoid possible violent
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Right-wing Israelis have repeatedly held protests outside the
building, calling for its closure.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied the East Jerusalem since the 1967 Mideast
War and declared the whole Jerusalem as its eternal and
indivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
Under the autonomy accords, the status of Jerusalem is to be
determined in the final status talks between Israel and the PNA
which have been suspended since early 1996.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia: Production Up, Foreign Trade Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The first half of the year saw
minor output increases in Mongolia's industrial and agricultural
sectors, but a major downturn in the country's export volume.
</P>
<P>
Pushed up by hikes in the mining, leather and garment
industries, said the State Bureau of Statistics, industrial output
was up 2.1 percent over the first six months of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with 9.7 million new born lambs already in the herd
by July 1, 527,000 more than the same period last year, the total
is expected to be a record high of 10 million for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
However, as shown by the bureau's latest report available
Monday, the foreign trade volume from January through June was
down 2.2 percent to an equivalent of 371.6 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The most noticeable was a 29.4 percent plunge in exports, to
140.9 million dollars, in the six-month period, as results of deep
cuts in prices for copper and cashmere at the international market.
</P>
<P>
Also in the year's first half, there was a 28.1 percent jump in
the country's imports, to 230.7 million dollars, leaving a
half-year unfavorable trade imbalance worth 89.9 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In June, the consumer index climbed 9.2 percent over that at
the end of December, the first time below 10 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
And on the government side, budget deficit rose by 3.2 million
dollars, to 32.4 million dollars, in the first six months of the
year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Shift Domestic Debt from Short to Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
will launch two Treasury Bonds on August 3 to raise six billion
Shillings (96 million U.S. Dollars) a month and shift government
domestic borrowing from short to long term.
</P>
<P>
The stock of domestic debt held in 91-day Treasury Bills stood
at 26.4 billion Shillings (425 million Dollars) in May, according
to a report from the East African weekly newspaper on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The low denomination Treasury Bearer Bond will start at 10,000
Shillings (166 Dollars ) and go up to 50,000 Shillings (833
Dollars ) and 100,000 Shillings (1,666 Dollars).
</P>
<P>
It would be sold monthly from August and will attract an
interest rate above that offered by commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The bond is expected to mature after one year but can be
rediscounted at the CBK or traded in the Nairobi Stock Exchange,
making it a very liquid instrument.
</P>
<P>
The other one is a floating rate two-year Treasury Bond and is
similar to the existing one-year bond. It will be in
denominations of 100,000 Shillings and will also be traded at the
Nairobi Stock Exchange as existing bonds.
</P>
<P>
The interest paid will be 0.5 percent above the 12 weeks
moving average of the 91-days T-Bills at the previous quarter.
This means the interest will be paid quarterly.
</P>
<P>
The need to shift from short to long term was announced by
Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae in his budget speech at
parliament on June 11.
</P>
<P>
At the time, he said, the government would begin the difficult
task of fiscal adjustment that seeks to "lengthen maturity of
domestic debt by encouraging conversion of the bulk of Treasury
Bills to Treasury Bonds."
</P>
<P>
The target is to tap long-term investment funds from the
insurance industry in accordance with the recent amendments to
the Insurance Act requiring companies to hold at least 20 percent
of their long-term investments in government securities.
</P>
<P>
The bond will also qualify for use as an amnesty bond for tax
evaders as set out in Nyachae's budget.

<HEADLINE> French Press Celebrates World Cup Victory by France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- All the major newspapers in Paris
Monday celebrated the historic victory by France in the World Cup
on Sunday, with all their front-pages carrying colored photos of
the French national soccer team carrying the Victory golden cup.
</P>
<P>
"La France Champiooooonne du Moooooonde!" said the daily
Liberation which deliberately deformed the words "championne"
and "monde" in order to emphasize the feeling of happiness.
</P>
<P>
The daily praised coach Aime Jacquet for "forging this team
into a tank of conquerors," and said that the victory of France
would increase French people's hope of tapping their chronical
problem of unemployment and escaping the monotonousness of daily
routines.
</P>
<P>
"The mystery of victory is this: in the achievement, the
champion represents all the others. His victory is a communion,"
said the daily.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Figaro said that even before the final whistle was
blown, France had already won something more precious than the
World Cup -- a beautiful and strong image of itself.
</P>
<P>
"In this festival of nations, the French soccer team had a
secret mission, that was to give a lesson of confidence, ambition
and unity to the French people," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It also praised the French men for showing enthusiasm and
French women for staying before the television screens to see the
matches throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
The Communist daily l'Humanite said that France has been
recognized by all this serious and brotherly band of players of
soccer of all colors from around the world.
</P>
<P>
The sports daily l'Equipe said that things would never be like
before, because France entered on Sunday the most exclusive circle
of the world, which was the club of nations that had ever won the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The daily Aujourd'hui said that France's victory over Brazil
was a surrealistic victory.
</P>
<P>
"The immense festival, the enormous elan, the formidable
solidarity which have united all the categories of the French
population over the past one week should not evaporate with the
great heat of the summer," said the paper.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Offers to Resign After Election Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto offered to step down Monday for the Liberal Democratic
Party's (LDP) defeat in the House of Councillors election.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto announced his decision to quit as LDP president, and
hence Japanese prime minister, at an extraordinary meeting of the
ruling party's executives in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I conveyed my intention to resign as party president (and
prime minister) at a meeting of party executive members," he told
a televised press conference.
</P>
<P>
On the LDP's defeat in the triennial race for the upper house
of parliament, he said: "It's all my fault."
</P>
<P>
The LDP, led by Hashimoto since September 1995, suffered a
devastating setback in the upper house poll by winning only 44
seats, short of its targeted 61 pre-election seats.
</P>
<P>
Prime minister from January 1996, Hashimoto became the first
premier to resign to take the blame for a defeat in an upper house
election since the late Sousuke Uno did so in 1989.
</P>
<P>
He also told the press conference that he would cancel his
planned official visits to France and the United States, initially
scheduled for between this Sunday and July 25.
</P>
<P>
"I can't go ahead when I'm resigning," Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
Following in his footsteps, the LDP's three top executives --
Secretary General Koichi Kato, Policy Research Council Chairman
Taku Yamasaki, and General Council Chairman Yoshiro Mori --
expressed their readiness to step down, LDP officials said.
</P>
<P>
The LDP, which still dominates the more powerful House of
Representatives, or lower house of parliament, is expected to
convene a meeting of all its parliamentarians in the both houses
on July 27 at the earliest, and calls for a vote to elect the
prime minister at the outset of an extraordinary parliamentary
session, expected later this month, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and former Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama are the likely candidates to become
Hashimoto's successor, LDP sources said.
</P>
<P>
The major cause of LDP's defeat, analysts said, was its
perceived failure to pull the nation out of its protracted
economic mire.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's resignation may further destabilize Japan's
political and economic situation, they said.

SHANGHAI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the largest port city

first half of this year, up 13.8 percent over the same period of

But the growth rate dropped by 15.2 percentage points as a

months. But the city's import from Malaysia, the Philippines and
Thailand increased by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's export to Europe increased by 36.1 percent while
that to North America up by 24.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Advances Coal-Rich Shanxi's Basic Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 13 (Xinhua) --North China's Shanxi Province,
dubbed as a "sea of coal", has introduced an increasing volume of
overseas investment to advance growth of its basic industries.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, most of the overseas investment
has flown into agriculture, telecommunications, technical
upgrading, high-tech and housing construction fields.
</P>
<P>
By now, the agriculture sector of the province has made a use
of 600 million U.S. dollars overseas investment for financial
projects of water diversion and soil preservation on the Loess
Plateau, efficient irrigation, dry farming and poverty relief.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the comprehensive agricultural
development projects at the middle range of the Taihang Mountains,
financed by loans provided by an international agricultural
development fund, has added 17,600 hectares of farmland to the
poverty-hit counties in the Taihang Mountains, benefiting 500,000
local poor people.
</P>
<P>
One fourth of the investment for the fast growth of this
northern Chinese province's telecommunications sector has come
from overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The Wanjiazhai water diversion project, which will divert water
from the Yellow River, China's second longest, to water-deficient
Shanxi and will cost 20 billion yuan (2.41 billion U.S. dollars),
has won loans worth 400 million US dollars from World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project will divert water to Taiyuan,
the provincial capital, and the second phase to Shuozhou and
Datong, two major cities in northern Shanxi. The project is
expected to be completed in year 2001.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the New World Group of Hong Kong has invested
one billion yuan in building expressways and constructing
residential quarters in cities since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The conglomerate plans to pump up an additional three billion
yuan for construction of more infrastructure facilities in Shanxi
in the coming three to four years.

<P>
WELLINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Customs officers
seized a heroin shipment worth a record 26 million U.S. dollars at
Auckland International Airport Thursday, the Customs Service said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The heroin came from Thailand and was believed to have been
headed for Australia.
</P>
<P>
Customs Service investigations manager Phil Chitty said Monday
that it was the highest value ever drugs haul in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
He said that the previous highest was 10.4 million U.S. dollars
worth of cocaine seized from a ship in Auckland about 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Chitty said the heroin arrived on an aircraft from Bangkok late
Thursday morning and Customs officers were waiting to pounce.
</P>
<P>
"Customs and police drug investigators conducted a controlled
delivery of the consignment, and this resulted in the arrest of
two Vietnamese males late on Friday afternoon, after an attempt
had been made to send the consignment on to Australia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chitty disclosed that the operation was a "direct outcome of
information" provided by New Zealand Customs and police officers
based permanently at the New Zealand Embassy in Bangkok.

BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The quality of facilities in
China's amusement parks witnessed a remarkable improvement,

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Calls for More Int'l Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Monday the Asian crisis reveals quite
starkly that the current level of international cooperation is
inadequate for international trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and the other affected countries pointed this out at
the start of the crisis and the international community was
finally coming round to it, Anwar, who is also finance minister,
said when opening the International Management Accounting
Conference/National Accountants' Conference here.
</P>
<P>
"It is now generally agreed that there is a need to strengthen
or even overhaul international supervisory frameworks so that
contagious crises could be avoided in the future and the
likelihood of a global recession thereby reduced," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is no compelling reason to believe that the current
crisis, serious though it is, would protract far into the next
millennium, especially with so much energy being concentrated on
resolving it, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there was every reason to believe that borders would
continue to break down and the world would continue to shrink.
"For better or for worse, globalization will accelerate as
information technology, which is its main ally, continues to
develop at a relentless pace," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said globalization would mean stiffer competition and this
naturally called for transparency, accountability and
professionalism which all subsumed good corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the principle of creative destruction called for the
rebuilding of a more reliable system which meant, among others,
that accounting management and corporate governance must be given
more attention than before by both the public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference "Organizational Challenges into the New
Millennium" is jointly organized by the Malaysian Institute of
Accountants and the Faculty of Business Management of Universiti
Kebangsaan (National University) Malaysia and attracts over 400
delegates from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa,
Britain, Brunei and Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Drug Abuse Rampant Among Kuwaiti Youths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Drug addicts, mostly
teenagers, have been behind many crimes in Kuwait in recent years,
the Arab Times daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Kuwaiti Assistant Undersecretary of the
Interior Ministry Fahd Al-Fahd as saying that families should play
an active role in fighting drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Al-Fahd said that about 90 percent of drug use and drug-related
crimes are caused by the lack of proper family role.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to every mother to immediately report to the Interior
Ministry's Criminal Intelligence Department if she finds any of
her children taking narcotics," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a mother is the best deterrent against her
children falling prey to drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial statistics, there are about 29,000
drug addicts in Kuwait, most of whom are young people.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by Kuwait University on 110 addicts treated
at hospitals has found that 50 percent of them are between the age
of 15 and 19.
</P>
<P>
The drug issue has become a serious challenge to both the
Kuwaiti government and the society, with drug cases and
drug-related crimes rising alarmingly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interior Ministry, there were 2,537 drug cases
in 1991-1997, in which 4,456 persons were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also showed that 1,068 drug dealers had
been arrested by the end of last May, most of them were involved
in crimes.

<HEADLINE> China Loses 133,333 Ha of Farmland to Other Purposes in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China lost 135,800 hectares of
farmland to other purposes in 1997, today's "People's Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources, last
year the country's farmland was cut by 462,333 hectares due to
construction, structural adjustment in agriculture and natural
disasters, but 326,466 hectares of farmland was added by way of
land reclamation. Therefore, the total loss stood at 135,800
hectares.
</P>
<P>
The imbalance shows that the trend toward farmland shrinkage
has not been fully brought under control in China, though the
country has long worked out a goal for realizing a balance in the
gross volume of agricultural land, and it last year started
to freeze the construction of non-farming projects that may occupy
present farmland.
</P>
<P>
An official from the ministry blamed the farmland shrinkage on
loopholes in the management of construction and the ineffective
implementation of state policies.
</P>
<P>
localities have been urged to strictly follow the state policy
of ensuring a farmland balance, construct projects on idle land,
concentrate construction of more projects in one place, and better
monitor the approval of licenses to those agricultural projects
that may occupy too much farmland.

WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Michael Johnson of the United
States has decided to run only in the 400 meters at the Goodwill
Games starting in New York on July 19.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic hero, who chalked up a rare double win in the 200
and 400 meters at the Games in 1996, has been in a poor form this
season due to injuries.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, injury problems this spring and early summer
have not allowed me to reach that optimum level of preparation for
the sprint races, " Johnson said today. "I've decided to
concentrate my efforts on one distance for the Goodwill Games, the
400 meters, and I'm excited to defend my title in that race."
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the world record holder in the 200 meters, also plans
to run a leg in the 4x400m relay. The track and field events at
the Goodwill Games will be held from July 19 to 22.

SOFIA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and China could expect more
cooperation in economy and trade, Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov has said.
</P>
<P>
Kostov made the statement last week when he was asked about
concrete steps taken by the Bulgarian side to strengthen economic
and scientific ties between the two countries after Bulgarian
President Petar Stoyanov's China visit in May.
</P>
<P>
China is one of Bulgaria's major trade partners in Asia and
their bilateral trade volume totaled 70 million U.S. dollars last
year, Kostov told Xinhua.

<P>
During a meeting with Stoyanov, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
proposed building a joint electrical appliances plant in Bulgaria,
Kostov noted, adding that this suggestion would help each other
expand new markets.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's relations with China will occupy an important place
in the Bulgarian foreign and economic policy, Kostov said.
</P>
<P>
While China is playing an increasingly important role in world
affairs, Bulgaria is willing to cooperate closely with China in
fighting terrorism, organized crime as well as drugs and weapons
struggling, said Kostov.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou May Be Original Birthplace of Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- After analyzing a large collection
of giant panda fossils, archaeologists have concluded that
southwestern China's Guizhou Province may be one of the original
birthplaces of the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas, an endangered species of rare animal, is now
mainly found in southwest China's Sichuan Province, northwest
China's Gansu Province and Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Wu Tianzhuang, an archaeologist at the Guizhou Museum, said a
large amount of ancient giant panda fossils from various
evolutionary periods have been unearthed in his province, dating
from 10,000 to 600,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the modern giant panda is the result of four
periods of evolution going back as early as 25 million years
ago. Evaluations indicate that the giant panda fossils discovered
in Guizhou cover three of the four period, including those of the
earlist modern giant panda.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the fossils discovered in various parts of the
province indicate that the giant panda became extinct in Guizhou
10,000 years ago because of a changing climate and the intrusion
of mankind into the region.
</P>
<P>
He added that the simple diet of the giant panda and their low
reproductive capacity are two of the reasons for the decline of
the species.

<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China has recently opened the
College of Tibetan Medical Sciences, the only academy in the world
that studies and teaches Tibetan native therapy, to tourists from
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Tibetan Tourism Bureau told Xinhua today
that the move will enable more people to become familiar with
Tibetan traditional culture, which is being challenged by new
innovations in the electronic era.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan medicine was developed in the 4th century B. C. and
had long been monopolized by lamaseries. It is extremely effective
in treating many chronic diseases, including cancer and apoplexy,
and is favored by the Tibetan people even today.
</P>
<P>
However, this heritage was threatened after many master
practioners were persecuted and even killed during the Cultural
Revolution (1966-76), one of the goals of which was to destroy
traditional culture. In addition, many people worried that the
ethnic tradition would become extinct because of the introduction
of Western medicine.
</P>
<P>
The college, established in 1993 to save this traditional
medicine, contains tens of thousands of rare documents written
hundreds years ago by Tibetan doctors. Tourists may now see one
of the earliest studies of embryology in the world, as well as
many ancient surgical instruments made of stone and bone.
</P>
<P>
They can also gather information on how the old masters used
gold and mercury as medical ingredients, and meet with Choru
Cerang, 70, president of the college and one of the few master
practitioners who survived the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Local people hope that this unique tradition will spread
worldwide. So far, more than 20 countries have set up Tibetan
medicine research institutes or have used Tibetan medicines,
despite a lack of scientific explanation for its theory, which is
based largely on Buddhist doctrines.

<HEADLINE> South China City Endeavors to Resettle Laid-offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Guangzhou municipal government
will take effective measures to solve laid-off workers' life
difficulties and to create re-employment opportunities for them.
</P>
<P>
The city will go all out to implement policies it mapped out
last year, including guaranteeing minimum wages for all employees,
the minimum subsidy for laid-off workers, minimum unemployment
welfare money and a minimum living standard, to protect their
basic lifestyles, said Mayor Lin Shusen.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong province,
began to take its privately-run enterprises, township enterprises
and individual business runners into its pension and social
insurance program early in July in an attempt to alleviate the
pressure on the government to solve its laid-off workers' life
problems and to seek a way to rid its employees of their worries
about unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted that the city will set up more employment service
centers to find job vacancies for laid-off workers and it will
extend the service network even to the grassroots.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the municipal government will set aside
more funds for the program to train laid-off workers to make it
possible for them to find new jobs that they are unfamiliar with.
</P>
<P>
The city's goal is to find new job vacancies for 60 percent of
the laid-off workers annually and keep the unemployment rate below
three percent in the foreseeable future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou registered 80,000 laid-off workers in the first
quarter of this year, and it created 31,800 job opportunities for
them, an increase of 17.7 percent over the same period in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Sets up Anti-Harassment Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has set up an
Anti-Harassment Committee to provide 24-hour service to deal with
public complaints of harassment by elements in the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the Presidential Secretariat stated that
representations had been made to the President that some officers
had been responsible for the harassment of Tamil persons who were
arrested or detained for questioning.
</P>
<P>
It said the President is aware that the majority of officers
execute their responsibility with great restraint and humanity
under extremely trying conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, numerous reports have been received that some
officers indulge in unnecessary harassment of Tamil detainees
contrary to instructions.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly President Chandrika Kumaratunga has appointed a
Committee of Ministers and Senior Members of Parliament to look
into representations made by persons harassed or not dealt with
accordingly to the law so that immediate action could be taken to
grant them relief.
</P>
<P>
The Committee is empowered to give directions to any head of
the armed forces or the police force in regard to any illegal
arrest or undue harassment.

<HEADLINE> Thai Commerce Ministry Plans Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry is
working out a restructuring program aimed at focusing on export
promotion and trade negotiation to cope with the fast changing
economic situation, according to Sompol kietphaibool, Permanent
Secretary to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to remove overlapping tasks and amend 42 trade
laws under the ministry's jurisdiction. One of the planned reforms
is to eliminate redundancy in overseas offices. For instance,
Commercial Affairs Office (CAO) and Thai Trade Center (TTC) are
currently under the control of the Office of Permanent Secretary
for Commerce and Export Promotion Department, but both units
perform similar tasks on export promotion and trade negotiation,
Sompol was quoted Monday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the target, 40 CAO offices operating abroad will be
reduced.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the Department of Export Promotion will be reformed
 and a trade Development Council will be set up to function with
authority similar to that of the Board of Investment Committee.
</P>
<P>
The council may be chaired by the prime minister to make
important policies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, unnecessary regulations will be reviewed to
strengthen exports. This will streamline export procedures and
increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Department of Business Economics (DBE) will be
renamed the International Trade Negotiation Department. In the
future, both multilateral and bilateral negotiations will be the
responsibility of the department.
</P>
<P>
Currently, multilateral agreements such as the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation will fall under the DBE while bilateral
agreement such as the Thai-U.S. Textile Agreement will fall under
the Department of Foreign Trade (DFP).
</P>
<P>
The department will set up an Economics and International Trade
Research Office to provide updated databases. This will help the
country prepare strategies to strengthen the country's
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will modernize 42 trade laws written around World
War ii. Personnel will be retrained to increase efficiency and
skills, especially information technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The New York Life Insurance Co. of
the United States will establish a representative office in
Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company values the huge market in this populous
Chinese province and plans to open an office in the provincial
capital, said Michael J. Nocera, President of the New York Life
Insurance Co., during a recent visit to Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Nocera, his company will invest 250 million
U.S. dollars to finance the construction of infrastructure in
Sichuan. New York Life has now reached an initial agreement with
the concerned local departments.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1845, the New York Life Insurance Co. is now the

Shanghai and Guangzhou, and has invested 160 million
U.S. dollars, mostly in China's infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province has attracted more than 30 world-class
companies including Motorola, Chia Tai of Thailand, and 12
foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
The province has seen rapid growth in the use of overseas
investments. In the first five months of this year, its
contractual use of overseas funds exceeded 500 million
U.S. dollars, with paid-in volume amounting to 200 million
U.S. dollars, according to local sources.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Quality Standards for Flower Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of
Agriculture has drafted a set of quality standards as a key
measure to stimulate the domestic flower industry and gain a
large share in the international market, according to "China
Daily" today.
</P>
<P>
An official with the ministry is quoted as saying that the
standards will help improve the overall quality of flowers and
ensure a safer trade order.
</P>
<P>
Flower production has boomed in China during the last decade in
the wake of improvement in the people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
Flower shops have mushroomed, enjoying increasingly brisk
business, while street vendors with buckets of flowers have become
a common sight at rush hours.
</P>
<P>
However, problems such as slow improvement in the quality of
flowers and low flower prices for the growers have cropped up
endangering the development of the fledging industry.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in a sense, the quality standards will
protect flow growers' interests so that they can increase their
production and improve the quality of flowers.
</P>
<P>
According to him, quality standards for cut roses,
gypsophila, gladioli, carnations and chrysanthemums have been
published. Quality standards for 30 other flowers will also be
published by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
China's high-quality flowers and 70-80 percent of flower
seedlings are imported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is also improving statistical and information
service as part of its efforts to promote the sector's
development. It will set a national statistical network on line
for the flower-growing sector next year in cooperation with the
State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The network, which now has 40 big member units ranging from
administrative departments, flower growers to flower traders, will
provide both the growers and traders with latest flower
information.
</P>
<P>
China has 80,000 hectares of land devoted to flower planting,
accounting for one third of the world's total. And it has plenty
of ancient and typical species.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- All new power projects scheduled
for construction in coming years in south China's Guangdong
Province will be built through public bidding nationwide, "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Total investment for these new plants, which will have an
installed capacity of more than 6 million kilowatts, will outstrip
60 billion yuan (7.23 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The province tries to attract foreign investors to finance
local power industry, which still has great potential in the years
ahead because of the rapid economic growth in southern China, the
paper quoted an official from the Guangdong Electricity Group Corp
as saying.
</P>
<P>
These power plants will also import plenty of advanced foreign
equipment and technologies in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Taishan Plant, which has two 660,000-kw generating units,
will cost an investment of 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion
U.S. dollar), while the Shanwei Plant, with two 600,000-kw
generating units, needs 11 billion yuan (1.33 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Guangdong plans to invest a total of 10.9 billion yuan (1.31
billion US dollars) this year in building its power projects. The
investment gap is large, the official said.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Merapi volcano in Indonesia's
Central Java spewed six times hot clouds as far as three
kilometers from its peak on Sunday, an official has said.
</P>
<P>
But the volcano which erupted at 4:38 local time last Saturday
showed a sign of declining activities and thus, the volcano's
status was degraded from "danger Merapi" to "Alert Merapi,"
spokesman for the Mt. Merapi Observatory Post Sugiono said in
Magelang, Central Java, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sugiono asked residents living around Merapi to be on the alert
against the possibility of the volcano spewing hot clouds, reports
reaching here Monday said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the volcano's hot clouds last Saturday destroyed
pine forest and pine seedlings owned by the state forestry company
(Perhutani) on the volcano's slopes. But there have been no
reports of casualties as yet.
</P>
<P>
Merapi, 2,968-meter high, is one of the most active volcanoes
in Indonesia which has a total of 127 active volcanoes.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Sharply Against Yen Early in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar climbed above 144
yen in Tokyo early Monday morning following the devastating defeat
of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Sunday's House
of Councillors election.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 144.05-144.07 yen at 9 a.m. (local
time), up from 141.30-141.40 yen late Friday in New York and from
140.95-141.05 yen in London.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning, the dollar hit a height of 144.50 yen, a
level last seen on June 17 when the United States and Japan
jointly intervened in the currency market to prop up the sagging
yen.
</P>
<P>
The LDP won only 44 of the 126 seats contested, far short of
its targeted 61 seats. Ryutaro Hashimoto has decided to quit as
LDP president and prime minister to take the blame for his party's
major setback.
</P>
<P>
Dealers believe the dollar will move further upward against the
yen.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, share prices plunged
with the key Nikkei index dipping below 16,000 for the first time
on an intraday basis since July 1.
</P>
<P>
In the first 15 minutes of trading, the Nikkei Stock Average of
225 selected issues on the First Section fell 271.23 points, or
1.69 percent, from last Friday's close to 15,818.83.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 17.76 points or 1.43 percent to
1,223.74.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector in Guangzhou to Have Full Scope for Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong Province,
encourages the city's private sector to compete in the world
market, according to a number of suggestions to encourage private
sector to conduct foreign trade and economic co-operative
activities passed here recently.
</P>
<P>
The suggestions are the country's first local official effort
to encourage the private sector to get involved in a field long
dominated by state-owned businesses, "China Daily" said here today.
</P>
<P>
A municipal government official urged the myriad private
companies in Guangzhou to earn big profits in the world market and
contribute to the city's economic growth while enlivening the
domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
Private sector is allowed to conduct foreign trade and set up
their overseas subsidiaries and branches in Hong Kong, Macao and
around the world. Their overseas companies and branches will be
treated as foreign firms when they return to invest in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses will be able to set up joint ventures and
Sino-foreign co-operative firms with their overseas
partners. Government departments should provide necessary
services. Those who have the status of "legal person" will receive
the same preferential policies as state-owned enterprises in
conducting processing business supplied by foreign partners.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Considers Jet Offer From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government is
considering an offer to buy second-hand F16 jets from the United
States, according to a report by local daily "The Dominion"
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that it is understood that New Zealand, along
with other countries, had been offered F16 fighter jets after a
purchase agreement between the U.S. and Pakistan was withdrawn
because of Pakistan's exploding of nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Defense Ministry of New Zealand said the
planes were being offered at a "more than reasonable" price.
</P>
<P>
The report quotes New Zealand Defense Minister Max Bradford as
saying that his government is evaluating the offer and the
evaluation is not expected to be completed for about three months.
</P>
<P>
Bradford said the model of F16 offered was not the one New
Zealand would have wanted to buy, but it might be capable of
serving 90-95 percent of what New Zealand wanted from a jet
fighter.
</P>
<P>
The purchases were "all within the envelope" of the Defense
Assessment, a government policy paper on defense equipment
purchases, Bradford added.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Air force sources of New Zealand confirmed
that a team of Americans had visited New Zealand, assessing the
chances of selling a squadron of second-hand F16 jet fighters to
the air force.

<HEADLINE> Japan's LDP Suffers Major Setback in Upper House Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) suffered a major setback in Sunday's election for the
House of Councillors (upper house) losing 17 seats, official
figures showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
As of 2 a.m. local time Monday (1700 GMT, Sunday), 44 LDP
candidates had been declared winning, 30 in prefectural
constituencies and 14 in the proportional representation system,
far short of its 61 seats being contested in the triennial
election.
</P>
<P>
The figure was the second worst only after the 36 seats won by
the LDP in the 1989 election.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest reason (for the LDP setback) is a delay in
economic recovery," Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the LDP's Policy
Research Council, said in a television program.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hahshimoto is expected to
announce his resignation as LDP president and hence prime minister
to take responsibility for his party's crushing setback.
</P>
<P>
A senior LDP official confirmed that Hashimoto has decided to
announce his intention to quit the LDP presidency and the prime
ministership at LDP executives' meeting later Monday.
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast to the LDP's disastrous showing, Japan's
largest opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), headed by
popular former Health and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan, was headed
for a conspicuous advance.
</P>
<P>
The DPJ, 18 of whose seats were being contested, appeared
certain to break the 30 mark, including seats for DPJ-backed
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Communist Party (JCP), whose public support has
reached record highs recently, also emerged as a big winner in the
race by doubling its strength in the upper house.
</P>
<P>
By 2 a.m. Monday, 26 DPJ aspirants had been declared
successful, 14 for the JCP, nine for the Komei party, six for the
Liberal Party (LP) and five for the Social Democratic Party
(SDP). A total of 20 independents also were declared winners.
The New Party Sakigake did not pick up any seats.
</P>
<P>
Half of Japan's upper chamber, which has far less clout than
the lower house in determining the government formation or
policies, is reshuffled every three years, with members serving a
fixed six-year term.
</P>
<P>
About 99.40 million people -- 48.24 million men and 51.16
million women -- were eligible to vote in Sunday's poll.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout was projected at 58.27 percent, up sharply from a
record low 44.52 percent posted in the previous election in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The sharp recovery in voter turnout was traced to the extension
of voting hours by two hours under a revision of the Public Offices
Election Law last month.

TOKYO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto will announce his resignation as premier and president
of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to take
responsibility for the LDP's major setback in Sunday's House of
Councillors election, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto will offer the resignation at a meeting of LDP
executives later Monday, Kyodo quoted a senior LDP official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, in a televized speech, said late Sunday that the
setback suffered by the LDP is his responsibility entirely and he
will decide what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
The LDP is expected to end up with less than 55 seats, far
short of its 61 seats being contested in Sunday's upper house
election, according to an exit poll conducted by Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
If Hashimoto resigns, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and former
Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama are the likely candidates
to become his successor, Kyodo quoted LDP sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The LDP also plans to ask some opposition parties, including
the New Peace Party and the Komei party, to join hands with the
LDP in a partial alliance.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto was scheduled to visit France and the United States
from July 19 but the election result may change this, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto has indicated the 61 LDP seats at stake as a win-loss
line. LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato expressed similar views.
</P>
<P>
The LDP fielded 87 candidates, 30 for the proportional
representation slots, under which voters cast their ballots for a
party rather than for an individual, and 57 for prefectural
constituencies.

<HEADLINE> Japan's LDP Suffers Major Setback in Upper House Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) suffered a major setback in Sunday's election for the
House of Councillors (upper house) losing 17 seats, official
figures showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
As of 2 a.m. local time Monday (1700 GMT, Sunday), 44 LDP
candidates had been declared wining, 30 in prefectural
constituencies and 14 in the proportional representation system,
far short of its 61 seats being contested in the triennial
election.
</P>
<P>
The figure was the second worst only after the 36 seats won by
the LDP in the 1989 election.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest reason (for the LDP setback) is a delay in
economic recovery," Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the LDP's Policy
Research Council, said in a television program.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hahshimoto is expected to
announce his resignation as LDP president and hence prime minister
to take responsibility for his party's crushing setback.
</P>
<P>
A senior LDP official confirmed that Hashimoto has decided to
announce his intention to quit the LDP presidency and the prime
ministership at LDP executives' meeting later Monday.
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast to the LDP's disastrous showing, Japan's
largest opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), headed by
popular former Health and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan, was headed
for a conspicuous advance.
</P>
<P>
The DPJ, 18 of whose seats were being contested, appeared
certain to break the 30 mark, including seats for DPJ-backed
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Communist Party (JCP), whose public support has
reached record highs recently, also emerged as a big winner in the
race by doubling its strength in the upper house.
</P>
<P>
By 2 a.m. Monday, 26 DPJ aspirants had been declared
successful, 14 for the JCP, nine for the Komei party, six for the
Liberal Party (LP) and five for the Social Democratic Party
(SDP). A total of 20 independents also were declared winners.
The New Party Sakigake did not pick up any seats.
</P>
<P>
Half of Japan's upper chamber, which has far less clout than
the lower house in determining the government formation or
policies, is reshuffled every three years, with members serving a
fixed six-year term.
</P>
<P>
About 99.40 million people -- 48.24 million men and 51.16
million women -- were eligible to vote in Sunday's poll.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout was projected at 58.27 percent, up sharply from a
record low 44.52 percent posted in the previous election in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The sharp recovery in voter turnout was traced to the extension
of voting hours by two hours under a revision of the Public Offices
Election Law last month.

</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard will send his Telstra
privatization plans back to the Senate next month in a bid to test
the resolve of Independent senator Mal Colston who scuttled the

<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- A senior cabinet minister, minister for Finance, John Fahey,
has broken ranks over the proposed second airport for Sydney at
Badgerys Creek, saying environmental obstacles to the proposed
development are "almost insurmountable."
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government determined to push ahead with its
effort to sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, has given
itself seven weeks to persuade Independent senator Mal Colston to
change his mind.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian Stock Exchange plans to throw open the 40
billion Australian dollars (24.8 billion U.S. dollars) corporate
bond market to retail investors in a move that has sent shock
waves through the investment banks that control the market.

<HEADLINE> Key Northern Afghan Province Seized by Taliban: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia have
claimed to have captured a key province in northern Afghanistan
after a major offensive and amid intense infighting in the
opposition Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Sunday night from the Afghan
capital of Kabul, the Taliban had earlier claimed sweeping gains
against the Northern Alliance with the capture of Faryab province.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia were reported to be fighting their way to
Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold of the anti-Taliban Northern
Alliance led by ousted Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
One report quoted a senior Afghan official for information and
culture Maulawi Mohammad Yaqub as saying that "after we launched a
heavy attack, the whole of Faryab has been taken and the
mujahedeen have advanced into Jowzjan."
</P>
<P>
"There has been little resistance, and the opposition were just
fleeing for their lives, leaving behind all their heavy weapons,"
Yaqub said.
</P>
<P>
However, Yaqub's claim could not have been independently
confirmed. Meanwhile, officials from the Northern Alliance said
that they were unable to comment.
</P>
<P>
Faryab was a major stronghold of Rashid Dostam, an important
ally of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. However, Dostam's grip
over the area is reported to be weak due to long standing disputes
with local commanders.

SAINT-DENIS, France, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian coach Zagallo
said on Sunday star striker had an illness before the final and should

</P>

"We had a very big trauma. Ronaldo should not have played the game.
He had a problem. The whole team was upset by this," Zagallo said
after Brazil lost to France 3-0 in the final.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian squad doctor Lidio Toledo revealed that Ronaldo had a
stomach upset two hours before the game.
</P>
<P>
Zagallo was apparently annoyed by a question concerning this matter
by the Brazilian media in the post-game news conference.

"He played because he played. I have the morality and personality
to come up here. I am man enough. You owe me a lot," he angrily
replied.

<P>
Ronaldo's name did not appear in a line-up hand-out before the

Catholic enclave in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
"Taking immediate effect peaceful protests will be scaled
down," the Orange Order said in a statement in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The pledge by the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland came amid
mounting tension in Northern Ireland after eight days of violence
by Protestant extremists that culminated in a firebomb attack
early Sunday that killed three Catholic children.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Lodge said it wanted its annual province-wide
celebrations on Monday to take place "in a dignified fashion and
which, mindful of the recent tragedy, will fully recognize local
sensitivities."
</P>
<P>
The independent Parades Commission has agreed to allow the
Orangemen's parade to take place in Belfast on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Grand Lodge said it backed its Portadown members'
decision to have "a continued presence at Drumcree".
</P>
<P>
Earlier Orangemen in Portadown voted to continue the Drumcree
protest indefinitely, despite calls for it to end after the arson
attack.
</P>
<P>
Garvaghy Road residents' spokesman Breandan MacCionnaith said
the Orangemen's decision showed that the Portadown Orange Order
was "beyond anyone's control."
