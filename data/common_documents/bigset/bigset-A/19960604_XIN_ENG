<HEADLINE> France's Overseas Investment Drops in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- France's overseas investment in 1995
dropped 21 percent from the previous year to 9.56 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the foreign investment the country attracted -- 12.1
billion dollars -- remained almost the same as in 1994, the Bank
of France said today.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the decline in overseas investment to
falling investment in the U.S. and European Union (EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, French investment in the U.S. slid 62 percent to 1.3
billion dollars, and its investment in the EU countries was 4.06
billion dollars, accounting for 43 percent of the country's total
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France's investment in Asia surged 55 percent to 560
million dollars, and in eastern Europe, its investment rose 266
percent to one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S remained the top foreign investor in France, with 3.58
billion dollars in 1995. It was followed by Britain with 2.92
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> SDB Plays Important Role to Take In Funds Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China's fledgling State Development
Bank, operational for just two years, is standing out as one of
the most important links in attracting foreign funds for the
country's key capital projects.
</P>
<P>
It will sign an agreement with Asian Development and Industrial
Bank Association in Seoul early this month for a 100 million-US
dollar syndicated loan to be used by Qilu petro-chemical complex
in Shandong Province for an ethylene expansion project.
</P>
<P>
The loan is co-organized by ADIBA's two members, the Industrial
Bank of Japan and the Industrial Bank of Korea. The State
Development Bank was one of the initiators of ADIBA, which was
established last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Yong, director of SDB International
Financial Bureau, SDB is to seek about $300 million from abroad
during the second half of this year for major clients, including
the Lingao nuclear power plant in Guangdong, Ertan hydro-electric
Power plant, and an ethylene project in Daqing, northeast China.
</P>
<P>
"We have not decided whether the funds will be raised through
syndicated loans or by issuing bonds," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that SDB will also raise funds for generating sets
for the Three-gorges Dam project.
</P>
<P>
SDB became involved in raising foreign funds in 1995, a year
after the bank was formed to serve government-backed key
construction projects. Up to the present its international
financing activities have been mainly centered on export
credits. Of the some $2.8 billion negotiated last year, 95 percent
were export credits, including $2.3 billion provided by Britain
and France for the Lingao Nuclear Power plant.
</P>
<P>
However, the policy-oriented bank began to use overseas bond
markets this year, by issuing 30 billion yen worth of bonds
(approximately 288 million US dollars) in Japan in February.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the success of the first issue, the bank has set
eyes on the American market.
</P>
<P>
"The Yankee bond market has big capacity with bond trading very
active," explained Zhang Yong.
</P>
<P>
"We would have more choices in maturity terms which are better
suited to the capital needs of China' key projects," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is optimistic about SDB's international finance business
expansion since the bank is set to increase its proportion of hard
currency in its total capital assets, from a present miserly 3
percent to 20 percent in next 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
At present, SDB has business links with 44 banks around the
world. It plans to set up branches in major international
financial centers in the future and research and feasibility
studies about to get underway, according to Zhang.

<HEADLINE> Reliability Enhanced For China's Power Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The reliability of large-sized
power-generating units with capacities of more than 100 megawatts
produced in China has risen to more than 86 percent, up 4.4
percentage points from 1991.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister of Power Industry Lu Yanchang said in Beijing
today that the enhancement in reliability represents a remarkable
improvement in both safe operation and economic efficiency of the
country's large-sized generating units.
</P>
<P>
The senior official noted that China has introduced a
reliability administration system aiming at solving common quality
problems, which proved to be very effective.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, power construction units and power equipment
manufacturers work jointly on the installment and trial operations
of new generating units, and pool the wisdom of both sides in
trying to find out and solve any defects of power equipments,
which might be hidden factors leading to accidents.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister cited the latest statistics as showing that
by the end of 1995, the country's total installed generating
capacity had reached 217,000 megawatts, of which, almost 59
percent has been contributed by large-sized generating units with
capacities above 100 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The senior official added that the favorable change in the
structure of generating units signals the fast growth of China's
power sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's Senate decided today
to dismiss Supreme Court Chairman Mikhail Malakhov on alleged
bribery, the Kazakhstan Telegraph Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following a suggestion by President
Nursultan Nazarbayev on May 24.
</P>
<P>
On February 4, Supreme Court Judge Umegen Ikhsamov accused
Malakhov of taking more than 100,000 U.S. dollars and three sedans
in bribes, saying he had evidence to prove the charge.
</P>
<P>
Malakhov has denied the charge, describing it as slanderous,
but he was suspended by a presidential order on April 9.
</P>
<P>
The State Committee for National Security is investigating the
case, which, if proven, would be the worst corruption scandal in
the country in recent years.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Finance Bangladesh's Rural Credit Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has planned to provide
a soft loan of 105 million US dollars to finance Bangladesh's
rural credit scheme.
</P>
<P>
According to sources today, the loan is a unique attempt to
channel financial assistance to poor people in the countryside,
especially women.
</P>
<P>
"It will use a highly successful government agency as an
intermediary to 100 small non-governmental organizations providing
micro-credit and some big ones," the World Bank's mission chief in
Dhaka Pierre Landell-Mills confirmed, adding that this is a huge
injection of resources spread over 5 years with an aim to reduce
poverty and promote rural income activities -- mundane things like
poultry, fish-farming, trading activities and sewing.
</P>
<P>
The rural credit scheme is expected to reach 2 to 4 million
individuals and benefit millions more, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that nearly half of 120 million Bangladeshis
live below the government-set poverty line of 11.12 US dollars per
month or a daily calorie intake of 2,122.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Inspects "Best Practices" for Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali today visited the exhibition of "Best Practices" for
improving living environment here organized within the framework
of the Second U.N. Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II).
</P>
<P>
Ghali spent most of his time around the Chinese stand, located
in the middle of the exhibition hall and the biggest one occupying
some 500 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Construction Minister Hou Jie accompanied the
U.N. Chief and introduced China's arduous efforts in improving its
human settlements.
</P>
<P>
Ghali nodded from time to time in approval and appreciation
while fixing his eyes at the pictures showing the rapid
development in housing construction in urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the Chinese stand, the U.N. chief signed his
name at a pictorial prepared by the Chinese Ministry of
Construction called "Human Settlements In China," specially
dedicated to the HABITAT II.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Construction Ministry, from
1979 to 1995, a total of 12.9 billion square meters of housing
completed in China, enabling 160 million urban and rural families
to move into new residence.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China began to promote the "National Anju Shelter
Program" under which 150 million square meters of low-cost
housing will be built in five years.
</P>
<P>
However, China, the most populated country in the world, is
still facing big challenge and difficulty in its human
settlement.
</P>
<P>
"China shall continue its drive to improve its urban
environment, control the excessive population growth, and upgrade
living conditions in both rural and urban area," said Hou Jie
during today's opening session of HABITAT II, also called "City
Summit."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official: Free Economy Guaranteed for Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China's top official in charge of
Hong Kong and Macao affairs reiterated today that the Chinese
government will permit Hong Kong to maintain its free economy
under the "one country, two systems" concept after the British
colony's reversion to China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of
China's State Council or cabinet, made the remark at a lecture in
Tokyo to an audience that included business executives and
government employees.
</P>
<P>
"The present social and economic structures as well as
citizens' lifestyle in Hong Kong will not change at all," under
the "one country, two systems" concept, Lu told the audience.
</P>
<P>
The region's public servants will also stay intact after 1997,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He turned down observations that some Hong Kong residents are
fleeing to escape the 1997 handover, saying foreign investment
there has been increasing.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of diplomatic relations and defense, Hong
Kong will have full autonomy after China re-establishes its
sovereignty over the region on July 1, 1997, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
If China successfully resolves the Hong Kong issue, it will
help resolve the issues of Macao, a Portuguese colony to be handed
over to China in 1999, and Taiwan in terms of achieving national
reunification, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged increased Japanese investment in Hong Kong and
called on the Japanese government to help with the region's
stability by granting visa-exemption to new Hong Kong
passport-holders visiting Japan for business.
</P>
<P>
"After 1997, every investment and economic law will stay the
same as at present. So, Japanese friends, please be at ease at
this point, there will be no change in the economic field," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Lu, on a seven-day visit to Japan through Saturday at the
invitation of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, will meet Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, he met Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda for talks
on Hong Kong's reversion to China next year.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signed a cooperation agreement today with Russia's three
Transcaucasian neighbors in a bid to end conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Russia wants a solid peace throughout the Caucasus
region. That is the foundation of Russia's Caucasus policy,"
Yeltsin said after signing the pact with the presidents of
Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on "International Accord, Peace and Economic and
Cultural Cooperation in the Caucasus" condemned "aggressive
separatism, ethnic exclusivity and religious extremism" and called
for joint efforts to settle conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>
The mountainous region, a volatile patchwork of nearly 50
ethnic groups, has been racked by bloody ethnic and civil wars
which have claimed heavy casualties since the break-up of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin met with Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze,
Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Azeri President Haydar
Aliyev amid tight security at a hilltop sanatorium in the spa town
of Kislovodsk in southern Russia.
</P>
<P>
Referring to last week's ceasefire accord signed between
federal authorities and separatist rebels in Chechnya, Yeltsin
reassured his counterparts that the agreement "opened the way to a
full settlement of the (Chechen) conflict" and that Russia would
stick unswervingly to the plan.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan Tries to Expand Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Boosting trade and economic
relations with other countries and exploring potential foreign
markets have been the first priority of the Pakistani government
in implementing its export strategy.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, a medium-level country in terms of foreign trade, has
long been relying on exports of traditional agricultural, textile
and light engineering items.
</P>
<P>
A narrow export base and a relative low level of foreign trade
are believed to be the main reasons for holding up the country's
development of economic and trade relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has been trying hard in recent years
to seek a bigger trade share in the world market by taking a
number of bold policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
For this end, the government has mapped out a strategy to
address the key problem -- lack of diversification -- both in
terms of markets and products.
</P>
<P>
Due to successful marketing, Pakistan exported non-traditional
products worth one billion US dollars during the first 10 months
of the current fiscal year (July 1995 to April 1996).
</P>
<P>
To give it a further boost, Pakistan's Export Promotion Bureau
(EPB) has also prepared a list of export items, pin-pointing 202
non-conventional items for exports in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The EPB has organized about 60 trade exhibitions abroad to
introduce Pakistan's export items. It plans to hold 30 such
exhibitions a year and to open export display centers in all major
cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pakistani government has been making great
efforts during the last few years to find potential markets for
the country's products and to explore further avenues for boosting
trade links with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the drive is particularly marked by a
number of successful overseas visits by government leaders.
</P>
<P>
The recent visit to Sweden by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was
part of the government's strategy to enhance trade and economic
ties with the European countries which have been Pakistan's
important trading partners over the years.
</P>
<P>
During her tour of Sweden, Benazir Bhutto signed two trade
accords, under which Pakistan will export electrical fans worth
six million US dollars to the Swedish private sector.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to provide a new fillip to the Pakistani
products in the European market and could be termed as a major
achievement in Pakistan's quest to promote exports of
non-traditional products.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has maintained a sound trade relationship with the
European countries on the whole. The European Union (EU) continues
to rank as Pakistan's most important trading partner for both
imports (about 24 percent) and exports (about 29 percent).
</P>
<P>
Along with improving its trade relations with the EU, the
Pakistani government has also ventured to look towards the "East"
to increase exports in real sense.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto also visited Japan, Indonesia and
Brunei this year, which is expected to provide a new impetus to
Pakistan's economic ties with these countries.
</P>
<P>
A major breakthrough was achieved during Benazir's visit to
Indonesia and Brunei with the signing of agreements worth 1.25
billion US dollars for new exports compared with only 100 million
US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that encouraged by the positive outcome,
Pakistan's economic and trade relations with other countries in
this region have the potential for further expansion in the
future.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Railway Starts Ambitious Upgrading Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Railway (PR) has
embarked on an ambitious program of rehabilitation and upgradation
of locomotives, which needs 160 million US dollars, a senior PR
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen in Karachi, M. Ziaullah, new PR General
Manager, said the implementation of the program will bring greater
efficiency in the passenger and cargo train operations in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Ziaullah pointed out that about 60 percent locomotives had
become over-aged, which seriously affected the punctuality of the
train operations.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the locomotives had become as old as 32 years as
against their normal age of 20 years," he added.

<HEADLINE> Retailers Fed Up With Shop Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Retailers in the United States,
who are pursuing a customer-friendly service, now find themselves
abused, because they have suffered a lot from a growing number of
return fraud.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the USA Today, American retailers lose
1 billion U.S. dollars a year to return cheating practices.
</P>
<P>
Many shops and chain stores have a 30-day refund policy. Some
shops have a more lenient policy of allowing customers to make
returns any time for any reason. Therefore, many people would find
out various kinds of excuse to get their money back, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Cleveland furniture store owner Fred Crosby said, "I had
someone want to return a 6-month-old sofa so they could take the
money and buy a new one cheaper somewhere else and pocket the
difference."
</P>
<P>
While bad checks and shoplifting account for the bulk of the
retail industry's 26 billion U.S. dollar yearly losses, return
fraud now costs the industry about 1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
Electronics retailers say radar detectors and video cameras are
bought for vacation trips, then quickly returned. Apparel stores
see a big retail churn in evening wear for class reunions and
weddings mostly during the Christmas and New Year's party season.
In college towns, personal computer sales surge during finals
month, followed by massive returns at semester's end.
</P>
<P>
Since returned items can't be resold, return fraud pushes
prices up, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Retailers now have tightened their return policy by shortening
the days allowing for a return. For example, customers at Best Buy
now have only five days to return laptop computers at the start of
exams. "Even a really good student has trouble getting all his
term papers done in five days," said Mark Germscheid, the shop's
consumer relations supervisor.

<HEADLINE> Bahraini Information Minister on Coup Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini Information Minister
Mohammed al-Muttawa today said his country would like to keep good
relations with all neighboring countries on the basis of
non-interference of internal affairs, according to reports
reaching here from Manama.
</P>
<P>
During a press conference held in Manama today after an
urgent cabinet session, the Bahraini minister expressed hope that
Iran should establish good neighborly relations with other
countries on the basis of mutual respect of sovereignty and
non-interference of each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain today announced the discovery of a conspiracy by a
pro-Iranian terrorist organization to topple the current
government.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini information minister said that 29 plotters
supported by Iran attempted to topple Bahrain's ruling family,
which belongs to the Sunni sect of Islam, to establish a Shiite
Moslem government similar to that of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain was recalling its ambassador from Iran, it was
reported.
</P>
<P>
There was no reaction available from Iran on the Bahraini
allegation.
</P>
<P>
Muttawa did not say when the arrests had taken place but said
that the detainees had given full confessions last month.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain was also sending special envoys to the Gulf Cooperation
Council, GCC, countries, Egypt and Syria to explain the details.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini minister said the plotters belonged to a movement
calling itself " The Military Wing of Hezbollah - Bahrain" and
that it could still be active.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the movement is to stage an armed revolution to
overthrow the Bahraini government by force and replace it with a
pro-Iranian regime, Muttawa said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the GCC member states, which include Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Oman and Qatar,
Sunday called on Iran not to engage in "acts of sabotage" at the
end of the foreign ministers' meeting held in the Saudi Arabian
capital of Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The GCC "demands that Iran does not interfere in the internal
affairs of Bahrain and (other GCC) member states," adding that
Iran must not "revert to acts of sabotage and encourage them, and
must respect the independence and sovereignty of the GCC states."

<HEADLINE> Cuba Urges World to Oppose U.S. Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina today called on the international community to oppose the
Helms-Burton bill, a U.S. law aimed at tightening its
long-standing economic blockade of the island country.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of unleashing worldwide economic terrorism
and said the whole planet is suffering the extraterritoriality of
U.S. laws.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe now it will be better understood what Cuba has suffered
over the last 37 years," Robaina said in an interview with the
official news agency Prensa Latina.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the bill, which Robaina
calls "an imperial decree", into law on March 12, tightening the
economic embargo against Cuba and threatening to extend it to
countries doing business with the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban foreign minister said that the U.S., which touts
itself as a promoter of free trade, introduced the principle of
intimidation into commercial relations "with black lists and
imperial letters."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of State sent letters last week to some
enterprises doing business in Cuba, warning them they would be
punished if they did not leave the island in 45 days.
</P>
<P>
Robaina said that, for Cuba, the news is not that some
enterprises have left Cuba, but that many others continue doing
business here, some are signing new agreements, and some will come
later.
</P>
<P>
And he said that if the war started by the U.S. causes some to
fall, Cuba will never speak an offensive phrase against those who
are also victims of the law.
</P>
<P>
Washington is demonstrating that it is not looking for changes,
opening, or pluralism on the island, but servilism, which now is
faced with rejection, and the U.S. is now trying to destroy the
country.
</P>
<P>
But Robaina vowed Cuba will continue the process of economic
transformation and opening at the pace and with the amplitude
decided by Cubans themselves.
</P>
<P>
The best way to condemn and protest against the Helms-Burton
law, he said, is to work successfully and confidently with those
who defy the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Robaina reiterated that entrepreneurs, enterprises, and
governments should be confident of Cuba's process of opening and
reform.

<HEADLINE> Leaders of Zambian Opposition Party Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Four leading members of Zambia's
opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) headed by
former President Kenneth Kaunda were detained by police here
today.
</P>
<P>
The detainees, UNIP deputy leader Inyambo Yeta, secretary
chief Patrick Goma, finance chairman Rabson Chongo and press
officer Muhabi Lungu, were suspected by the police in connection
with a series of bomb blasts that had taken place in the country
recently.
</P>
<P>
UNIP administrative secretary Basil Kabwe was quoted by
Zambian News Agency as saying that policemen have come to search
the party headquarters, saying they were looking for subversive
materials and explosives. They did not find anything but arrested
the four party leaders, Kabwe added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, five men were detained by the Zambian
police suspected in connection with the recent explosions at the
official residence of President Frederick Chiluba and offices of
"Times of Zambia".
</P>
<P>
The police charged the five, including three retired army
officers, with being part of Black Mamba, a shadowy movement
opposing the controversial constitution amendment bill which bars
Kaunda from contesting presidency in the general elections to be
held later this year.
</P>
<P>
Police also detained two members of the Zambia Democratic
Congress (ZDC), another opposition party headed by former
Minister Dean Mungombva, last week for unspecified reasons.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda has denied any link with Black Mamba, saying it is a
government plot to discredit him.
</P>
<P>
UNIP and ZDC have expressed their determination not to
recognize the new constitution.

RIO DE JANEIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of people over 60
in Brazil could more than treble over the next 10 years to 34
million, making it the nation with the sixth largest elderly
population in the world, according to new forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The projections of an ageing population were released by the
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).
</P>
<P>
Brazil, the world's sixth most populous country, had 156.3
million people in 1991, with annual population growth of 1.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The IBGE estimates that Brazil now has 10.7 million people
over 60 and that if its projections are correct, the country will
have 34 million elderly people by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Arab, Western Countries Understand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister-elect Benjamin
Netanyahu said today that Arab and Western countries understand
Israel wants to continue the peace process based on Likud policy.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who Sunday night made his first public speech after
winning the elections, said that there was a general positive
reaction in the Arab and western world to his new policies.
</P>
<P>
Attending the celebration party held by the Likud-Gesher-Tsomet
faction at the Knesset (parliament) to toast his election
victory, Netanyahu pledged to continue seeking peace with Israel's
Arab neighbors, whom he urged to join the peace process to
achieve real peace with security for everyone in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that he plans to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Jordanian King Hussein as soon as possible after he forms the
new government.
</P>
<P>
But, Netanyahu put the highest priority on the need to bring
unity, peace and security to Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
In his hectic election campaign, Netanyahu promised that he
will conduct the peace talks with Arabs in a different way from
the current Labor government to ensure security for Israel: to
slow down the pace of Israeli-Palestinian peace process, expand
Jewish settlements and oppose Israeli withdrawal from Golan
Heights seized from Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world, alarmed by Netanyahu's election victory,
remains skeptical about his real intentions at this stage.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak held today a three-hour intensive talks with
visiting Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to discuss the
implications of Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that Netanyahu's speech did not inspire optimism,
adding Egypt and Syria will wait and see what policies Netanyahu
government will actually adopt. Al-Assad said that peace process
is not going in a positive way now, and Syria will keep a full
alert on this development.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu met earlier today with Israeli President Ezer
Weizman to brief him on Likud's coalition talks with other
parties and his policy guidelines.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli laws, Netanyahu is to form the next
government within 45 days after the official publication of
the election results due on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today praised neighboring Ukraine for having shipped all its
nuclear warheads to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma announced Saturday that it
had shipped to Russia the last of the nuclear weapons it inherited
from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released today, Yeltsin hailed the close
cooperation between Moscow and Kiev in dismantling and
transferring the nuclear warheads, noting the political, economic
and technological difficulties encountered.
</P>
<P>
"Common sense and commitment to international obligations
always took the upper hand," Yeltsin said, pledging further
cooperation with Ukraine in security affairs.
</P>
<P>
Under an accord signed in January 1994 by presidents of Russia,
Ukraine and the Untied States, Kiev agreed to get rid of its
nuclear weapons by this month in exchange for economic assistance
from Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
When the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, Ukraine inherited
about 2,000 nuclear warheads left on its territory.

<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
is to make a two-day visit to Britain on June 3-4 for talks with
British leaders on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes just two days after Benjamin Netanyahu defeated
Israel's Prime Minister Shimon Peres in the general election to
become new Israeli Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said Arafat has called on Netanyahu, who
maintained a harder line in Arab-Israeli peace talks, to keep
promises made by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokesman said Arafat is to hold
separate talks with British Prime Minister John Major and deputy
Prime Minister Michael Heseltine to exchange view of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between Arafat and Major scheduled on Monday,
"no doubt they will take the opportunity to talk about the latest
developments in Israel," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"It was planned as a normal trip by the Palestinian leader to
discuss the peace process among other things," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his short stay in Britain, Arafat is also expected to
meet with representatives from the Department of Trade and
Industry and visit Oxford.

<HEADLINE> 40 Armed Robbers Escape From Nigeria's Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Forty condemned armed robbers
escaped from the Bauchi Main Prison in Nigeria at the weekend, an
official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria report quoted a prison official as
saying that six notorious armed robbers from outside, led by the
No. 1 armed robber in the country, Jerry Bendal, used a rope to
scale the main walls of the prison at about 3 a.m. on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The six men went straight to the condemned criminals' cell,
broke it open and allowed all the inmates to escape although
Jerry had organized the jail-break to only free two of his boys,
one Charles and another Dauda who had earlier been condemned to
death by a robbery tribunal.
</P>
<P>
According to prison sources, Jerry and his men came to the
prison with sophisticated machine guns, adding that one warder
lost his life during the fracas while five others who sustained
serious injuries were admitted to hospital.
</P>
<P>
They said the warders, who only had batons, were unable to
withstand the onslaught, adding that at the end of the operation,
there were only 11 condemned armed robbers left in the prison.
</P>
<P>
The Abuchi State Deputy Commissioners of Police and the
Assistant Commissioner of Police in charge of the investigation
and intelligence Bureau have since visited the scene and ordered
an investigation.
</P>
<P>
Both officers declined to comment on the incident.
</P>
<P>
Armed robbery has remained rampant despite a war to crack down
on it announced by the military government led by General Sani
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Last week, armed robbers stormed the Nigerian Railway Police
in the northern Kaduna State and robbered cars and other
properties in the Nacerian National Railway compound in Lagos
where hundreds of Chinese railway experts stayed.

<HEADLINE> State Banks in Capital Surplus in Ho Chi Minh City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- All state banks in Ho Chi Minh city
are now in a state of mobilized capital surplus, the "Vietnam
News" daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The English daily quoted the State Bank of Vietnam as saying
that the total amount of idle mobilized capital at these banks is
estimated at about 14,000 billion Vietnamese dong (about 1.27
billion U.S. dollars), constituting 60 percent of the banks'
mobilized capital in circulation.
</P>
<P>
"The total deposit liabilities at the banks increased 15
percent since the beginning of the year, despite a reduction in
bank interest rats. As a result, the banks' activities in the city
were slowed down," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It added that nine banks, including five commercial banks,
suffered losses in their commercial transactions by April, while
the other banks reported profits which were lower than that in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the loss, according to the commercial
banks, is that the regulations applied to banks are too severe,
notably the regulation of credit, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most of the loans granted by the banks are
short-term loans. Medium and long-term loans do not find many
customers because most of the people who seek these types of loans
do not fit the qualifying criteria.
</P>
<P>
To tackle this impasse with the banks, the Finance Ministry has
allowed banks to use their idle mobilized capital to purchase
treasury bills.

JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission Chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
his deputy Alex Boraine are due to meet Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the South African Press Association
today, the long-awaited meeting, scheduled to be held in Cape
Town, is the last in a series which the commission has held with
party leaders to explain the aims and work of the 17-member panel
which has been probing three decades of human rights abuses in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi is the only major political leader not to have met
the commission since it was set up last December.
</P>
<P>
So far, Tutu and Boraine have held talks with National Party
leader F. W. De Klerk, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, Pan
Africanist Congress leader Clarence Makwetu, Freedom Front leader
Constand Viljoen and Democratic Party leader Tony Leon.
</P>
<P>
There has been persistent efforts to arrange a meeting between

enemies.

<HEADLINE> British Minister Reaffirms Britain's Support for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Jeremy Hanley, British minister of
state for foreign affairs, today reaffirmed Britain's support for
Lebanon in his talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri
and Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his 90-minute meeting with al-Hariri, Hanley
said his visit to Lebanon was aimed at stressing "Britain's
standing on Lebanon's side in the peace process" in the Middle
East region.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the region in light of the Israeli
elections last week, the British minister said that his
government would "urge the new Israeli government to resume the
peace process and to continue what the previous Israeli
government had done" on the Syrian-Israeli and Palestinian-Israeli
tracks.
</P>
<P>
Hanley noted that he delivered a message to the Lebanese prime
minister from British Prime Minister John Major, which "reiterates
the friendship between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The message also contained the support of Britain, the
Europeans, the United States for the efforts exerted for the
realization of peace in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to urge Israel to implement (U.N. Security
Council) Resolution 425, which provides for an Israeli withdrawal
from the occupied Lebanese lands," he added.
</P>
<P>
After his 70-minute meeting with Boueiz, the British minister
said that he had "good talks" with the Lebanese prime minister
and the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to discuss the Israeli elections and the
reactions on them and we encourage the Lebanese to judge the new
Israeli government by its acts and not by its positions launched
during the election campaigns," he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether the peace process would be
negatively affected by the victory of Benjamin Netanyahu, the
leader of the rightwing Likud Party, in the Israeli elections,
Hanley said that it would be in Israel's interests to continue
the peace process, and it would be in the new Israeli prime
minister's interests to pursue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The British minister has left the Lebanese capital this
afternoon for Damascus on the second leg of his tour in the
region.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Holds 11th Trial of Two Former Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The 11th trial session on mutiny and
treason charges involving former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh
Tae-woo was held at the Seoul District Court here today.
</P>
<P>
Also standing trial at the court were Chun's 11 close aides,
including former first army corps commander Hwang Young-si.
</P>
<P>
Chun Doo-hwan admitted today that he and his close aides
formulated a plan to settle the political tensions in the country
in May 1980, but again rejected the prosecution's charges that the
aim of their move was to usurp the power.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers today completed their cross-examination of the
13 defendants involved in the military revolt on December 12, 1979
and began to question eight defendants involved in the bloody
crackdown of the civil uprising on May 18, 1980, in Kwangju,
capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
In earlier cross-examination by defense layers, all defendants
alleged that their arrests of the then Army Chief of Staff Chung
Sung-hwa and several other loyal generals on December 12, 1979,
was not a mutiny, but a legitimate and unavoidable action needed
to investigate the assassination of President Park Chung-hee.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers including Chun
and Roh have been indicted for mutiny or treason, or both. The
mutiny and treason charges respectively stem from their roles in
the 1979 military revolt and the 1980 military crackdown of the
Kwangju civil uprising.
</P>
<P>
Chun Doo-hwan, who loomed large as the army strongman after the
1979 military revolt, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled
the country until February 1988. He was followed by Roh Tae-woo
who stepped down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two former presidents, who were arrested last year, have
also been indicted for graft charges because they accepted huge
bribes from businessmen while in office.

<HEADLINE> NATO Foreign Ministers Approve European-only Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- After more than two years'
wrangling, the foreign ministers of NATO's 16 member states today
ratified a plan to set up European-only military units which will
exclude U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
The decision gives the green light to the creation of Combined
Joint Task Forces (CJTFs) which will be used by European nations
for peacekeeping or relief missions.
</P>
<P>
The CJTFs will not have U.S. participation but will use
American military hardware, such as intelligence, communications
and airlift assets.
</P>
<P>
The plan, adopted at the spring session of the North Atlantic
Council, gives European nations more flexibility and resources to
deal with regional crises in Europe.
</P>
<P>
For example, members of the 10-nation Western European Union
(WEU), Europe's defense organization which complements NATO, could
conduct an operation using American equipment without involving US
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
However, the North Atlantic Council, made up of representatives
of the 16 NATO members, will authorize missions for the new
forces, which will, in effect, give the United States the power of
veto.
</P>
<P>
Although the Europeans could, under the new plan, mount their
own peacekeeping operations, a U.S. senior official told reporters
that he expected such operations to be "smaller scale missions"
and "very few and far between."
</P>
<P>
The principle of the CJTFs was first proposed by the United
States at a NATO summit in January 1994 with the aim of shifting
more of the alliance's security responsibilities to Europe.
</P>
<P>
But the plan stalled due to differences between Washington and
Paris over the U.S. role and influence over the use of NATO staff,
equipment and headquarters.
</P>
<P>
France was initially opposed to parts of the plan because of
its 30-year refusal to place its forces under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough has been made possible by the recent
willingness of the French to take part in NATO activities and
institutions, including participation in the Peace Implementation
Force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The ratification of the CJTFs concept also gives non-NATO
nations, especially countries in central and eastern Europe, the
chance to participate in the more flexible and mobile forces.
</P>
<P>
Over the next six months, NATO military leaders will put the
concept into operation, including identifying where the CJTFs
should be headquartered and who should command them.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day meeting, the foreign ministers also approved the
creation of a political-military policy coordination group, made
up of two members per delegation, to smooth decision-making within
the alliance.

<P>
TOKYO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Stocks fell sharply in Tokyo today
amid news reports of a virtual bankruptcy of a nonbank
institution, and the U.S. dollar eased against the yen, slipping
to the mid-107 yen level.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
21,588.52, down 367.67 points, or 1.67 percent, from Friday's
close.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Price Index, covering all first-section stocks
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, dropped 21.93 points, or 1.30
percent, to 1,658.64.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's decline against the yen on today's Tokyo Foreign
Exchange was due in part to the U.S. currency's weakness against
the German mark and partly to a late afternoon rumor in the market
of a possible default by the Brazilian government.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 107.62-65 yen at 5 p.m., down from
108.15-18 yen at 9 a.m.. It moved between 107.50 and 108.29 yen
during the day's session.

<HEADLINE> NATO FMs Meeting Ends With Call for Shaping New NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The spring session of the North
Atlantic Council ministerial meeting ended today in the historic
symbol of a divided Europe with a final communique which calls for
efforts to shape a new NATO to meet post-Cold War challenges.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting of foreign ministers from the 16 NATO member
countries was dominated by the issue of the alliance's adaptation
and reform process.
</P>
<P>
Other main topics were the NATO-led peace Implementation Force
(IFOR) operation in Bosnia, NATO's enlargement, the Partnership for
Peace program and NATO's relations with Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers stated in the final communique that it is
now the moment to take a "decisive step" forward in making NATO
"increasingly flexible and effective" to meet new challenges.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to carry further the ongoing adaptation of the
alliance's structures of which an essential part is to build a
European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI) within NATO.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed to enhance their contribution to
security and stability throughout the Euro-Atlantic area by
broadening and deepening their dialogue and cooperation with
partners through the partnership program.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed NATO's intention to further develop their
important relations with Russia and Ukraine while maintaining
openness to new members through the established enlargement
process.
</P>
<P>
In the final communique, three fundamental objectives were
listed which will guide NATO's actions to improve the alliance's
capability, namely ensuring the alliance's military effectiveness,
preserving the transatlantic link and developing the ESDI within
the alliance.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the 16 foreign ministers ratified the plan
to establish the Combined Joint Task Forces.
</P>
<P>
Under this new plan, European allies will be allowed to run,
under the banner of the West European Union (WEU), military
operations (peacekeeping or relief missions) in a regional crisis
without U.S. participation but use NATO's command structures,
intelligence, logistics and communications resources.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also approved the establishment of the Policy
Coordination Group for closer coordination of political and
military viewpoints to smooth the way for decision-making.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the IFOR mission in Bosnia, the ministers
stated that the IFOR will be maintained at approximately its
current force levels until after the elections which will have to
take place in September at the latest under the peace agreement,
and will retain its overall capability until December, when the
IFOR's mandate comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that NATO will develop a "strong, stable and
enduring partnership" with Russia. The partnership between the two
sides is an essential element of security in the Euro-Atlantic
area, they said.
</P>
<P>
Other issues such as NATO's relations with the WEU and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe follow-up conference in Vienna
and the dialogue with the Mediterranean countries were also
discussed at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Involvement in Bahrain's Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran today strongly refuted
allegations of any Iranian interference in the international
affairs of other countries, including Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, denied
Bahrain's allegations that Iran was involved in a plot for
toppling the ruling Al Khalifa family of Bahrain, saying they were
"totally baseless."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by Iran's official news agency IRNA as
saying that the Islamic Republic of Iran "advises the Bahraini
government against being influenced by the conspiracies of the
enemies of the Islamic Ummah."
</P>
<P>
He said the Bahrain stance was a result of instigation by
outsiders, and will have no outcome other than straining
bilateral ties and paving the way for presence of foreign powers
in the region. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi reiterated that Tehran had always been for regional
cooperation in order to restore stability and security.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain today announced a defeat of coup d'etat plotted by Iran
and the arrest of 29 plotters.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini Information Minister Mohammed al-Muttawa said that the
29 plotters supported by Iran attempted to topple Bahrain's ruling
family, who belongs to the Sunni sect of Islam, to establish a
Shiite Moslem government similar to that of Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said Bahrain was recalling its ambassador from Iran, but
would not server ties.
</P>
<P>
Muttawa did not say when the arrests were made but said that
the detainees had given full confessions last month.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini minister said the plotters belonged to a movement
calling itself " The Military Wing of Hezbollah - Bahrain" and
that it could still be active.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the movement is to stage an armed revolution to
overthrow the Bahraini government by force and replace it with a
pro-Iranian regime, Muttawa said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government is
planning to extend Teachers' Resource Centers (TRCS) to the
national level in the coming five years as a means to promote the
standard of education in the country.
</P>
<P>
Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Education and Culture,
S. Odunga made the remarks today while opening a seven-day
workshop on the role of TRCS held in Arumeru District, Arusha
region, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He said the TRCS now involved only 5,000 teachers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Africa faces a severe education crisis as students'
achievement is reaching low levels while the 21st century puts
science and technology as of prime importance for development,
Odunga said. He attributed poor education foundation in the
region to, among others, the lack of teaching materials including
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
He said that TRCS is considered by the government of Tanzania
as a mechanism for solving educational problems facing teachers
in a meaningful and effective manner since it deals with teachers
who are major actors in the system of education.
</P>
<P>
The TRCS address the most critical problems in schools and
will be effective in decentralization of education system away
from the central government, but based on local resources.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day workshop financed by the Danish Agency for
International Development (DANIDA) through the Danish Volunteers
Services (CVS) has drawn participants from Zimbabwe, Mozambique,
Uganda, Lesotho, Zambia, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, South Africa
and Eritrea.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Assad Call for United Arab Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad today called for a united
Arab front in dealing with the new Israeli government led by Prime
Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference following their three-hour talks,
the two leaders urged Arabs to take time to see what policies
Netanyahu would follow.
</P>
<P>
The summit between Mubarak and al-Assad came amid concerns of
the Arab world that right-wing Likud leader Netanyahu's victory in
last week's Israeli elections would slow down the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Things are not going in a positive way," al-Assad told the
press conference. "We have to be fully alert and on guard."
</P>
<P>
He said that the resumption of Syrian-Israeli talks is "out of
the question now."
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad, who was met by Mubarak at the airport when he arrived
in Cairo earlier today, said he believes the United States is
serious in its efforts to bring about peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said during his election campaigns that he would take
a tougher line in peace negotiations with the Palestinians and
Syria than Shimon Peres, the outgoing prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he rejected the return of Golan Heights to Syria
and holding talks with the Palestinians on the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan and Arab east Jerusalem in the 1967
Middle East war. Syria demands the return of the strategic plateau
as a prerequisite for making peace with Israel, while the
Palestinians want to establish an independent state with Jerusalem
as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel has regarded Jerusalem as its united, eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said at the press conference that if the Israelis,
under the leadership of Netanyahu, want a real and comprehensive
peace, the Arabs are ready for peace.
</P>
<P>
His talks with al-Assad dealt with Egyptian-Syrian relations
and the current situation in the region in the wake of the Israeli
elections, Mubarak said.

<HEADLINE> 177 Foreign Companies Operate in S.Africa in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 177 foreign
companies established businesses in south africa in 1995, Trade
and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said today.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question during a senate debate in Cape Town,
Erwin said 90 of these companies are financial or similar
institutions, while 47 are trading companies.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors in which foreign companies began doing business
are manufacturing, construction, transport, mining, agriculture
and community service, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said the registrar of companies, which kept details of
these companies, did not have records of the exact amount of
money they had brought into the country.
</P>
<P>
However, figures from the Reserve Bank indicated that the
total inflow of all foreign investment came to 21.7 billion Rand
(about 4 billion U.S.Dollars) in 1995, up from 1.25 billion
U.S.Dollars in 1994.

<HEADLINE> 1.8 Million S.Africans Infected With Hiv in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.8 million people
or 4.3 percent of South Africa's total population were infected
with HIV in 1995, Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma said today.
</P>
<P>
In her budget speech in the senate in Cape Town, Zuma said the
Department of Health had found in annual surveys that the highest
hiv infection rates were among women in their early twenties.
</P>
<P>
''From 1994 to 1995 we saw an increase in the overall
prevalence of HIV infection from 7.6 percent to 10.4 percent
among women attending antenatal clinics,'' said the minister.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 13 percent of South African
women between the ages of 20 to 24 were infected with hiv, while
11.03 percent of women between 25 and 29 were infected.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said of particular concern was that the hiv infection
rate among pregnant teenagers was as high as 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that teenagers constituted a high risk group for
hiv infection and hence the intervention programs needed to
continue focusing on this group to prevent them from hiv
infections and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
These statistics were a real concern as they had serious
implications for the entire social and economic development of
the country, she said, adding that ''HIV/AIDS is a real threat to
the lives of our general population in particular young adults''.
</P>
<P>
While criticising the previous government had done little to
address the issue, Zuma said the present government had allocated
80 million Rand (about 18.6 million U.S.Dollars) in its 1996/97
budget to fight aids.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Coalition Government Possibly to be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's parliament today voted
overwhelmingly to open a debate on a censure motion submitted by
the Islamic Welfare Party (RP) against the center-right coalition
government led by Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
The voting results of 317 to 124 suggest that the parliament
would oust the government possibly on Saturday. To unseat the
government, 276 votes are needed.
</P>
<P>
Most of the deputies from the True Path Party (DYP), the
coalition partner, joined the deputies from the RP, the Republican
People's Party (CHP) and the Grand Unity Party (BBP) in voting for
the opening of the debate against the government.
</P>
<P>
The debate will be held on June 6 and the vote will be set for
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the Democratic Left Party (DSP) stayed away from
the voting today and once again gave their indirect support to
Yilmaz. Besides 75 DSP deputies, 33 others, some possibly from
the DYP, stayed away from the vote.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there are some DYP mavericks who oppose DYP
Chairwoman Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
The RP became the first party in December's general elections,
but was shut out of power by the coalition set up by Yilmaz and
Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Since the coalition government was set up in March, Yilmaz and
Ciller have not been in good cooperation and have been fighting
against each other.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Director of the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Elizabeth Dowdeswell,
issued a statement here today marking the World Environment Day
which falls on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dowdeswell said at the heart of the World Environment Day
celebrations, which will be held in Istanbul, is the belief that
every individual human being has the right to enjoy clean air,
pure water and the benefits of our biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
She said most people want to improve the quality of their
lives, having a clean, decent, safe home in which to live and
raise a family.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNEP boss said, the quality of life is threatened
by the explosive and continuing growth rates of urban areas.
</P>
<P>
And now, cities are expanding into fragile ecosystems, adding
that nearly 40 percent of cities with a population of more than
500,000 are located on coasts.
</P>
<P>
She also said air pollution already exceeds health standards
in many mega cities, urging that cities future development to be
based on environmental considerations.
</P>
<P>
"One thing is clear, and it is that the fate of cities will
determine more and more not only the fate of nations, but also of
our planet," She noted.
</P>
<P>
If cities are to continue to be the engines for economic
growth, their future development has to be based on
considerations that are environmentally sustainable,she added.
</P>
<P>
Ms Dowdeswell said: " The ultimate solution to every
environmental problem, from deforestation to pollution, lies in
each of us taking the responsibility for our own acts and not
giving up hope."

<HEADLINE> Percentage of New York High School Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The percentage of New York City
public high school students graduating in the traditional four
years has reached a five-year low, according to the city's Board
of Education.
</P>
<P>
Examing what happened to all the students in the city's schools
who would have been expected to graduate in the classes of 1991
through 1995, a report, which was released on Sunday by the Board,
shows that in the Spring 1995, 48 percent of the students who had
started high school four years before had graduated, three percent
lower than the graduation rate for the class of 1991, and 33.7 of
the students still were in school after four years, 5.2 percent up
from the class of 1991.
</P>
<P>
For the class of 1992, 30 percent of students who had started
high school four years before went on to to a fifth year of
school. An additional 13 percent continued into a sixth year, and
7.6 percent stayed for a seventh year.
</P>
<P>
As result, there are now more 19-,20-and 21-year-old students
than ever in classrooms, and this year, about 10 percent of the
city's 300,000 high school students are over 18, education
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The report did not explain why this abnormal situation occurred
in the city's high schools, only saying that these students have
confronted a variety of obstacles to finishing high school on
schedule, such as social and family problems.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing on Sunday, John C. Fager of the Parents
Coalition for Education, a citywide advocacy group, called on
City's departments concerned to give more attention to the
declining four-year graduation rate. He said," It's a bad news for
the kids who have to spend five and six and seven years finishing
high school and it's a bad news for the taxpayers because this
means a lot of extra expenditures.
</P>
<P>
School officials said that about 6,000 u.s. dollars are needed
to educate each child.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Street Vendors Disappear in Lagos' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- There is a saying that Nigeria's
Commercial Center of Lagos has been prosperous because it has so
many street vendors.
</P>
<P>
They joked that in the six million population of the city, one
million are street traders.
</P>
<P>
And about half of the selling and buying of local people's
daily necessities are made on the street.
</P>
<P>
''Lagos is famous in Africa for its banking, population and
street trading,'' Lagosians say.
</P>
<P>
But the bankruptcy of over half of the 300 banks in Lagos has
forced the government to announce a series of new rules and
regulations. The overcrowded population of the city has forced
the government to build another capital called Abuja in the
center of the country.
</P>
<P>
Today, in the middle of the International Environment Year,
the Nigerian government acted on the street vendors.
</P>
<P>
''The street trading is jeopardizing the nations's
environment, causing traffic jams and damaging the country's
foreign investment environment,'' said an decree released by the
Lagos state government today.
</P>
<P>
No wonder a drive around the city on the ''busy Monday'' did
not show up the much familiar scene: the street vendors who keep
on knocking at your car screens and doors as you are blocked by
traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
And there is no sign of them running to and for across the
streets to bargain a good price for their small goods at the risk
of their own lives and causing danger for motorists.
</P>
<P>
The hard measures announced by the government worked. At least
for the time being.
</P>
<P>
The new decree imposes a fine ranging from 5,000 Naira to
15,000 Naira (around 65 to 200 US Dollars) or a term of
imprisonment ranging from six months to one year, both on the
street vendors and on the buyers.
</P>
<P>
''Don't be surprised if you see a car owner being arrested and
prosecuted for just doing his shopping right in the middle of the
street or a housewife who prefers to buy her wares by the
roadside instead of going into the market,'' said a government
official.
</P>
<P>
It also prohibits selling on pedestrian bridges and the
extension of shops to walkways.
</P>
<P>
On why the state intends to prosecute the buyers, he said:
''If there are no buyers, there won't be sellers.''
</P>
<P>
He added that a special tribunal has been set up by the Lagos
State Judicial Court on street trading.
</P>
<P>
But vendors say the measure are ''simply killing us''.
</P>
<P>
In the country where the monthly income for an ordinary family
is as low as no more than 1,000 Naira (around 12 US Dollars), no
street vendors can afford to pay the fine of 5,000 to 15,000
Naira.
</P>
<P>
''They (the fine) are worse than imprisonment'' said a street
vendor, who sneaked at the corner of a street in the Victoria
Island, Lagos.
</P>
<P>
''But apart from selling things in the street, what else can
we do? What do they (the government) want from us?'' he
complained.
</P>
<P>
''Go to the market and do your business illegally,'' that's
the answer from the government officials.
</P>
<P>
They say the street vendors produce garbage, noise and crowd
the street, they say over one third of the traffic accidents in
the city are caused by the street traders.
</P>
<P>
Street trading is a way of avoiding paying government taxes.
It is also a way of escaping marketing rent.
</P>
<P>
''It is small business and it causes a big problem to our
environment and city administration,'' an environment expert
shrugged.
</P>
<P>
''It's a good thing they finally disappeared,'' said a driver.
</P>
<P>
Will they reappear?

<HEADLINE> Rotary International District Conference Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The 71st Rotary International
District 9200 Conference was officially opened here today by
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, with "Act with Integrity, Serve with
Love, Work for Peace" as its theme, will mainly review the
district's projects and explore ways to further Rotary
International's goals of world understanding, peace, education,
health and communication.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Museveni said the Ugandan government
highly appreciates the underlying character of Rotary
International. He said that Uganda believes that the discipline
and self sacrifice on which Rotary International is built, are
the kind of building blocks Uganda needs to build itself.
</P>
<P>
He commended the contribution of non-government organizations
(NGOs), including Rotary International, to social services in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He clarified that NGO will continue to be very important
partners in the delivers of services to the people as government
alone will not meet the demand for social services for a long
time to come.
</P>
<P>
He urged Rotarians in District 9200 to individually and
collectively work for peace. He said that without peace their
district has no future.
</P>
<P>
Tonny Serrano of South Africa, representing President of
Rotary International Herbert Brown, thanked President Museveni
for his encouragement to the Rotarians.
</P>
<P>
He said that 56 million US Dollars have been contributed
by Rotarians throughout the world to eradicate polio in Africa,
which he called the last bastion of the disease in the world.
</P>
<P>
This is the third annual Rotary International district
conference held in Uganda since the Rotary movement started in
the country in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Present at the conference are over 1,000 Rotarians from Rotary
International District 9200 which includes Eritrea, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Mauritius, Tanzania, Reunion, Seychellyes, Somalia,
Djibouti and Uganda, and others from South Africa, the United
Kingdom and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Official Urges Croatia to Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Serbian Commissioner for Refugees
Bratislava Morina said here today the international community must
force Croatia to guarantee safety and security to Serbs in its
territory.
</P>
<P>
"A failure of the U.N. mission in Eastern Slavonia would be a
defeat for Europe and the entire international community," Morina
said in talks with coordinator of the Geneva-based special
department of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) for the former Yugoslavia Rene Van Rooyen, according to
Tanjug news agency report.
</P>
<P>
Croatian government troops last year captured all parts of the
self-styled Republic of Serb Krajina except the Eastern region
situated between Croatia and Yugoslavia, forcing hundreds of
thousands of Serbs to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
Van Rooyen said the question of Serbs' return to Krajina was
highly important at this moment and that international peace
forces in Eastern Slavonia would do everything to restore trust
between the Croat and Serb population in the region.
</P>
<P>
Morina and Van Rooyen agreed that conditions have to be created
for the return of refugees from Yugoslavia to their earlier places
of residence.
</P>
<P>
Van Rooyen agreed with Morina's proposal to organize a regional
meeting of all commissioners for refugees from the former Yugoslav
Republics in the near future, so that the problem of refugees
could be tackled in direct contacts.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Tells Zambians to Make No </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has told his government and party leaders to refrain from
commenting on some west countries' threats to cut off aid to
Zambia because of the constitution amendment bill.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the Zambian News Agency, the president
urged the United States to use its economic and political power
constructively, especially in the circumstance that the biggest
sources of financial support to Zambia are from Washington.
</P>
<P>
He told his government and party leaders that relations
between countries are a very delicate matter and exchanges of
views are conducted through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba praised Zambia's cooperating partners for their
substantial support. Zambia is now at a critical turning point
and foreign assistance is crucial,he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill signed into law by Chiluba last week, former
president Kenneth Kaunda is not qualified to stand as a
presidential candidate in the general elections because his
parents are Malawi immigrants.
</P>
<P>
After the bill was signed, the United States threatened to cut
off its assistance to Zambia unless the later repeals the bill.
</P>
<P>
Britain has already withheld its aid to Zambia due to the
constitution amendment bill.
</P>
<P>
Some Zambian government ministers have criticized the United
States for the threat.

<HEADLINE> Study: A Third of Poor Kids in Working Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- More than one-third of all the
poor children in the United States, or about 5.6 million, are
members of "working poor" families, said a survey released on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Only 14 percent of children in working poor families were born
to a teen-age mother. Most were born to women over 25 years old
and half lived in married, two-parent households where at least
one parent -- usually the father -- worked all year, said the
report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which cited federal
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The findings indicate that between 1989 and 1994, when the
overall economy was strong, conditions became worse for the
working poor. The number of children in such families increased by
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The problem is caused by a decline in the value of low-skill
labor, said Douglas Nelson, executive director of the Casey
Foundation, a Baltimore-based charitable organization that focuses
on disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s, a young adult working full time at the
minimum wage could keep a family of three out of poverty, he said.
"In 1994, a household head working full time at the minimum wage
earned only 70 percent of the income needed to lift a family of
three out of poverty."
</P>
<P>
According to researchers, an annual income of 11,821 dollars
for a family of three was considered the poverty level for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that from 1985 to 1993, the years statistics
are available, the number of babies born weighing less than 5.5
pounds had increased 6 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The birth rate to mothers aged 15-17 jumped 23 percent and the
number of violent teen deaths rose 10 percent over the same
period. However, the total number of infant deaths over that time
span dropped 21 percent, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Drop Third Time in Four Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- With a decline of 0.1 percent in
April, the factory orders in the U.S. dropped for the third time
in the first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department reported here today that orders
for both durable and nondurable goods totaled a seasonally
adjusted 309.1 billion dollars in April, down from 309.5 billion
in March when a 1.7 percent jump was posted, the only increase
this year.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods plunged by 1.9 percent in April but
those for nondurable goods rose 2 percent, the sixth advance in
seven months.
</P>
<P>
The report said that falling aircraft bookings had offset an
increase of motor vehicle sales. Transportation orders fell 12.8
percent, nearly erasing a 14.6 percent jump in the previous month.
It was the largest drop since a 14.8 percent decline in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders rose 1.9
percent, the fourth increase in the last five months.
</P>
<P>
Orders are considered a key gauge of the nation's manufacturing
strength and a decline could mean slower production and job
growth.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders fell 0.2 percent, the first
decline since August. A shrinking backlog suggests businesses are
able to meet consumer demand with current production facilities
and manpower.
</P>
<P>
But inventories, another sign of future activity, edged up 0.2
percent, wiping out an identical decline a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, rose 1.7 percent, the
third straight increase.

<HEADLINE> HK Police to Enhance Cooperation With Mainland Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Police will strengthen
cooperation with its counterpart in the mainland in combating
cross-border crimes.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Hui Ki-on, commissioner of Hong Kong Police, said here
today that joint efforts will be made in tackling problems of
illicit fish bombs, illegal pregnant immigrants, and pick
pocketing in Lo Wu -- a traveler pass between Hong Kong and the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner made the remarks after a ten-day visit to the
mainland, where he met with public security officers in
Guangdong, Beijing and Shanghai. The trip, which enhanced mutual
understanding and cooperation, proved to be a success, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the commissioner, Hong Kong Police has sought
assistance from Guangdong Provisional Public Security Bureau to
trace the origin of fish bombs discovered in the territory.
</P>
<P>
A total of 319 kg of fish bombs were seized in the first
quarter of this year, outweighing those captured in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Hui also held a thorough discussion with Guangdong
 officers on clamping down on pick pocketing in Lo Wu. The number
of reported cases in 1995 dropped compared to 1994.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence exchange will be strengthened between the two
places to deal with the problem of influx of illegal immigrants
into Hong Kong, particularly pregnant ones, said Hui.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australia Retreats on Greenhouse Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government made a
U-turn today in the course of supporting the international drive
to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government issued a declaration that Australia
would seek exemption from the international agreement on
greenhouse emissions to be reached under the Framework Convention
on Climate Change next year.
</P>
<P>
The joint declaration of the foreign, environment and resources
ministers said the government would not undertake the binding
target and timetable for emission reduction.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Australia was among the world's first group of
countries signing the Framework Convention, which foreshadowed
that developed countries should stabilize greenhouse emissions at
the 1990 level by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Australia will insist that the outcome of current
international negotiations on climate change safeguards
Australia's particular economic and trade interests," said today's
declaration.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is particularly vulnerable to the economic impacts
of coordinated OECD-wide measures to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions," it said.
</P>
<P>
Local media said the declaration was the first major victory of
industries over the coalition government, but experts said it was
a big setback for the global efforts to combat climate change.
</P>
<P>
Australia has the world's highest per capita level of
greenhouse gas emission and ranks the sixth in total output of
greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
Though the former Labor government had undertaken to limit the
growth of greenhouse emissions at 3 percent above the 1990 level
by 2000, the coalition government's new decision means that local
industries can even break that mark now.
</P>
<P>
Local industries have lobbied strongly for the government to
adopt a softer stance on greenhouse gas emissions, as 81 percent
of the energy used in Australia is from coal fire.
</P>
<P>
Major consumers of coal energy, such as the coal industry and
the aluminum industry, expected their total output of greenhouse
gases to rise, not to fall, by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the current voluntary agreement between industries and
the government, there are no penalties if industries fail to meet
the emission target.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government has also effectively ruled out the
introduction of carbon taxes that discourage inefficient use of
fuel.
</P>
<P>
"We are the world's largest coal exporter and we specialize in
greenhouse-gas intensive exports such as petroleum products, basic
metals, chemicals, cereals and livestock," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government promised to fund environmental
projects with the proceeds of selling the government-owned Telstra
company. But the sale of the telecommunication company has yet to
be approved by the Senate that was overwhelmingly opposed to the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace Australia's climate change campaigner Keith Tarlo
said it was "grossly unfair" to expect the developing countries to
stand at the same starting point in reducing greenhouse gas
emissions as the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Australian Democrats environment spokesman Meg Lees said the
coalition government would risk a repeat of last year's
embarrassing situation in Berlin when it goes to Geneva this July.
</P>
<P>
Australia faced isolation at the first Conference of Parties
under the Framework Convention in Berlin in March-April, 1995,
when it insisted that developing countries should share the burden
with developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
With the United States and Japan indicating their support for
more enforceable measures at the second meeting of the parties
scheduled for Geneva in July, Australia has to be prepared to
"sing solo," a local newspaper said.

<P>
TOKYO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The top Chinese official in charge of
Hong Kong and Macao affairs today briefed Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto on China's Hong Kong policy based on the "one
country, two systems" concept.
</P>
<P>
China will not make any major changes in Hong Kong after 1997
apart from taking over control of diplomatic relations and
defense, said Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of China's State Council.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's local administration and the lifestyle of its
citizens will stay the same after it returns to Chinese

who briefed reporters on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The official said that during their 30-minute meeting, Lu told
Hashimoto that under the "one country, two systems" concept, a
market economy will continue to prevail in Hong Kong after British
colonial rule ends in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he hoped Hong Kong will play a role as China's
window on the world after it reverts to Chinese rule next year,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who is on a seven-day visit to Japan through Saturday at
the invitation of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, met Foreign
Minister Yukihiko Ikeda on Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, Qinghai Province, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese World Cup
walking champion Gao Hongmiao said Tuesday that she is in best
ever form both physically and psychologically, that increases her
confidence for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now, I have no injury and no psychological pressure on
myself," the Chinese said at Duoba Sports Training Base, some 40
kilometers west of Xining.
</P>
<P>
Gao, 22, who took the gold medal in the 10 kilometers race with
42 minutes 19 seconds at the World Cup walking tournament in
Beijing in April last year, arrived Duoba last weekend for a
plateau training in the leadup to the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I'm more confident now that I will have good performance at
the Olympics," said Gao, who also took 10 kms at the 1994 Asian
Games in Hiroshima, Japan.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that Gao has trained in this 2,300-meter
Qinghai Plateau. And she said she felt comfortable and even did
not experience restrained by the high altitude during the training
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chuntang of Gao's coach also confirmed that her training
times were satisfation.
</P>
<P>
Gao ranked No. 11 in the world this year, but Wang said the
ranking could not reflect her actual competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Wang, however, also said Gao, the only Chinese woman who could
walk the 10 kms within 42 minutes, will face strong challenges
from athletes from Russia, Australia and Hungary with comparable
times.
</P>
<P>
The coach said he will focus on improving Gao's tactics,
psychological stableness and stamina in the six-week training here
before they fly for Atalant.

BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of six of the seven Thai
coalition government parties met today requesting the Prachakorn
Thai (Thai citizen) Party to stay in the government.
</P>
<P>
The Prachakorn Thai Party made a decision last week to quit the
government later this month.
</P>
<P>
The party was not happy with Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa's May 28 cabinet reshuffle, in which the Palang Dharma
(virtue force) Party, whose five cabinet members resigned on May
24, returned to the government, and the Nam Thai (Thai leadership)
party was given an additional cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
Prachakorn Thai has the same number of parliamentary seats as
Nam Thai.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that Prachakorn Thai's threatened withdrawal could
rock the government.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties claim that the prime minister has lost
control of the situation and should resign to make way for a new
government.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government consists of the Chart Thai (Thai
nation), New Aspiration, Palang Dharma (virtue force), Social
Action, Prachakorn Thai (Thai citizen), Nam Thai (Thai leadership)
and Muan Chon (the masses) parties, which together have 232 of the

<P>
DHAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 40,000 members of
Bangladesh's armed forces will be deployed in the country to
ensure law and order during the June 12 parliamentary elections,
Chief Adviser to the caretaker government M. Habibur Rahman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with members of the Overseas Correspondents
Association of Bangladesh, Habibur said the armed forces would be
deployed together with a large number of policemen and other
law-enforcing agencies.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the police have recovered 4,000 fire arms and a
huge quantity of explosives and ammunition since his caretaker
government took over power in early April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 40,000 people have been arrested for
possession of illegal arms and on various criminal charges, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The chief adviser declined to comment on the demand for a
public trial of some detained army officers, including former
Chief of Army Staff A.S.M. Nasim, who are charged with a coup
attempt against the caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is under investigation. Let us wait and see.
It is too early to make any comment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nasim and six other senior army officers were sacked from their
posts and put under military custody on May 20 for alleged
involvement in a foiled mutiny.
</P>
<P>
The former largest opposition party, the Awami (People's)
League, has accused the Defense Ministry under President Abdur
Rahman Biswas of framing up the charges to serve a conspiracy of
the ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party to disrupt the coming
elections.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is going to happen that will jolt the chances of a
free and fair election," the chief adviser said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the might of the people is behind the Election
Commission while all political parties have given their promises
of full cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Senior Environmental Protection Official on White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A white paper China issued today
aims to enhance the understanding of its environmental protection
efforts by the international community.
</P>
<P>
 "Environmental Protection in China" will also promote
cooperation between China and the rest of the world, said a senior
environmental protection official today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Xie Zhenhua, head of the State
Bureau of Environmental Protection, said China has, for the first
time in the form of a white paper, introduced to the international
community its environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first time China has systematically and
scientifically summed up its achievements scored over the past 20
years, particularly since it launched its reform and opening to
the outside world, he said.
</P>
<P>
There has been misunderstandings in some foreign countries
about China's environmental protection measurers. Some countries
claimed that China had merely emphasized economic growth to the
neglect of environmental protection or its impact on people's
health, he said.
</P>
<P>
The white paper issued today has convinced the world that China
has taken all possible measures including legal, economic,
administrative, scientific and technological measures to protect
its environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 years, China's gross national product (GNP) has
grown by ten percent each year, but has avoided a deterioration in
the environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the issue of the global environment, a few countries
blamed China for being a high pollution country, he said. The
white paper tells the world that China is a responsible nation,
which is striving to solve its own environmental problem.

<P>
Xie said China has drawn experience from the advanced countries
in environmental protection. But it has its own experiences and
distinctive environmental control technology.
</P>
<P>
"China can match the advanced countries in the administration
of environment protection," he said, adding that "the only
difference is that China lacks money and technology."
</P>
<P>
Xie also criticized some Western countries for paying only lip
service to solving global environmental issues since the United
Nations Environment And Development Conference in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"Few advanced countries have kept their promises to offer more
funds and technology for the solution to global environmental
issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a large country, China will work hard to solve its
environmental issues. The effort itself is a contribution by China
to help solve the global environmental issues," Xie said, while
voicing his hope that the international community will support
and cooperate with China in the form of capital, technology and
experience.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Supply Financial Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan will channel financial aid to
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) through the
United Nations in response to an expected appeal to help the
country overcome food shortages, Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The assistance will be provided through the U.N. as
humanitarian aid and will be handled separately from the bilateral
rice aid issue, Kyodo said, quoting government sources.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money to be granted will be determined in
consultation with South Korea, it said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Young Sam has asked Tokyo to discuss
the issue with Seoul before deciding on any aid to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the DPRK have no diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Japan provided 500,000 U.S. dollars to Pyongyang last year in
response to a U.N. call for such aid.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters earlier today
that his government should extend some assistance to the DPRK from
a humanitarian point of view.
</P>
<P>
Japan agreed last year to supply 500,000 tons of rice to the
country, including 150,000 tons free of charge, on condition that
it was for civilian use only.

<HEADLINE> Drive Launched to Learn Shijiazhuang's Model Taxi Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Beijing taxi drivers have been
urged to go down the road of their colleagues in Shijiazhuang,
capital of north China's Hebei Province - by being more polite.
</P>
<P>
A forum was held in the Chinese capital to promote a nationwide
drive to encourage taxi drivers to have high moral conduct and be
still more polite and customer-friendly.
</P>
<P>
The event was held in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhifeng, director of the Traffic Control Bureau of
Shijiazhuang city, introduced some of the city's model taxi
drivers, and spoke about the outstanding deeds they have peformed.
</P>
<P>
Shijiazhuang has 96 taxi companies, more than 4,800 taxis, and
over 9,600 taxi drivers, 85 percent of them self-employed.
</P>
<P>
Since December last year, the north China city launched
activities to improve the local taxi service trade in a bid to
combat impoliteness and rudeness by taxi drivers. Under attack
were drivers who failed to use their distance-meters, or refused
to take customers, overcharged, or spoke rudely to them.
</P>
<P>
Just half a year later the effort has helped the city's service
trade take on a new look and win public approval.
</P>
<P>
The forum was co-sponsored by the Ministry of Communications
and Hebei Province.

<HEADLINE> Tutu Calls Buthelezi to End Boycott of Truth Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission Chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu today
held a 90-minute talk with Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the South African Press Association
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in Buthelezi's Ministerial Office in Cape
Town with the attendance of Deputy Commission Chairman Alex
Boraine and IFP Council member Joe Matthews.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited meeting between Tutu and Buthelezi was the
last in a series which the commission had held with party leaders
to explain the aims and work of the 17-member panel which was
probing three decades of human rights abuses, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi was the only major political leader not to have met
the commission since it was set up last December.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Tutu told Buthelezi it was crucial that
the truth commission hear IFP's side of the story on past human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi read out a prepared statement committing his party
to the ''notion of a nation-wide truth-finding exercise'', but
rejecting the structure of the commission as a ''recipe for great
evil''.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi also criticised the 17-member panel appointed by
President Nelson Mandela, saying many commissioners were known to
have African National Congress (ANC) leanings.
</P>
<P>
''Just now the IFP leadership is still waiting with bated
breath as the ANC-led government has stated its intention to
charge some senior members of the IFP's national council,'' said
the IFP leader.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, Tutu repeatedly
emphasised the importance of the IFP appearing before the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said: ''Whatever the IFP may feel about the commission it
is important that their story must be told if we are going to
have a reasonable full account of the past conflict.''
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as ''full and frank'', tutu said he
still hoped the commission's display of independence and
even-handedness would persuade the IFP to drop its opposition to
the truth body.
</P>
<P>
However, Buthelezi said in his statement that the IFP doubted
whether the commission would be able to promote national unity
and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the commission's powers to grant amnesty,
saying only the judiciary had the administrative capacity and the
skill to handle the amnesty applications in an objective and
technical fashion. enditem

<HEADLINE> ITU Approves New Standard for International Free-phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Telecommunications
Union (ITU) approved on Tuesday a new standard to allocate phone
numbers for the international free-phone service.
</P>
<P>
Under the standard, subscribers of the service will be
allocated a unique Universal International Free-phone Number
(UIFN) which should be applied for and registered at the ITU
through telephone carriers, an ITU spokeswoman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
She added that the number, composed of a three digit country
code for global service application, then 800, then an eight-digit
global subscriber number, will be valid globally and subscribers
can retain it even if they change carriers.
</P>
<P>
The ITU will start to collect applications in December 1996 and
to assign UIFNs from February 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Free-phone" is a service which permits the cost of a telephone
call to be charged to the called party, rather than the calling
party.
</P>
<P>
Pioneered in the United States in 1966, the free-phone service
now carries around 100 million calls per day in the U.S. alone.
</P>
<P>
Free-phone has proved particularly popular with business
subscribers, who are often willing to bear the cost of a telephone
call in order to promote their services or to encourage customers
to order their products by phone.
</P>
<P>
Recent estimates by AT&AMP;T indicated some 100 billion
U.S. dollars is currently traded over the free-phone service every
year.
</P>
<P>
Until now, however, companies have been restricted by only
being able to use their free-phone number in one country. Those
who wish to offer services or products to customers abroad have no
choice but to register a separate number in each country, which
has proved unwieldy and often inefficient, the ITU said.
</P>
<P>
The ITU hoped that the new standard might stimulate the market
for free-phone services in Europe and the Asia-Pacific which until
now have been slow to take up the service, the spokeswoman added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Announces Deregulation Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government today
announced a deregulation package to cut import duties, abolish
surcharges and streamline import regulations.
</P>
<P>
"The deregulatory measures aim to improve the competitive edge
of local products and are very consistent with the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum and the ASEAN Free Trade Areas (AFTA) regulations,"
Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution Hartarto
told the press.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Development
Supervision Saleh Afiff said the package covers 11 sectors,
including the rescheduling of import duty reduction, amendments to
import duties on capital goods and the abolition of surcharges.
</P>
<P>
Afiff said the new deregulation package sets a target of
cutting tariffs to 5 percent by the year 2000. Tariff reduction
will be carried out in 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
For the export duty tariff, the government plans to cut the
rates in 1996, 1998 and 2000 to reach a target of 10 percent by
the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has so far reduced import duties of
1,497 out of 7,288 tariff items.
</P>
<P>
The deregulation also includes streamlining import regulations,
handling dumping charges, granting export facilities to exporters
planning to operate in certain sectors and simplifying procedures
for licensing industries to operate in industrial parks.

<HEADLINE> Poors to benefit from Charitable Clinics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Charitable clinics have been
opened in six hospitals and sanatoriums in the capital of south
China's Guangdong Province to help impoverished families and
pensioners.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Charity Society, the sponsor of the clinics,
handed out 40 free-health-care cards for families with low incomes
in each of the city's districts.
</P>
<P>
The society, which is one of the local organizations of the
China Charity Federation (CCF), will pay all the medical expenses
and clinic fees for the card-holders.
</P>
<P>
The CCF was established to promote charities and collect
donations. By the end of 1995, the CCF had recruited 44 local
organizations throughout the country as group members and it had
collected donations of over 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A director at the Guangzhou Charity Society said that his
society is planning to build a charitable hospital this year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Indicates Milder Line on NATO Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov today hinted that Moscow was not opposed to NATO
enlargement as such, but could not accept weapons and troops
being moved eastward.
</P>
<P>
He told the so-called "16 plus one meeting" with NATO foreign
ministers that a clear distinction should be drawn between the
military and political consequences of the enlargement.
</P>
<P>
At a short press conference after the meeting, Primakov called
his talks with the foreign ministers "very constructive," and said
it was important that the alliance was treating Russia as "a key
player" in the emerging security architecture in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"On our side, we believe that NATO is playing an important
role. It is adapting to the new realities," he said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said "it is
our will not only to maintain but also to enlarge and deepen our
relations (with Russia)."
</P>
<P>
Primakov told the meeting that Moscow wants to start talks on a
tactical anti-missile defense system, as well as hold more regular
meetings with NATO members to start talks on an "enhanced
relationship," NATO sources said.
</P>
<P>
This dialogue could lead to a special relationship pact or
charter, which was proposed by NATO a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Russia has signaled recently that while it remains opposed to
NATO plans for eastward expansion, it realizes that the alliance
will eventually take in several countries in Central and Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Moscow's major concern, said diplomats, is to make sure that
the Baltic republics are not admitted to the alliance and that no
NATO troops or nuclear weapons are stationed on the soil of new
members.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Russia signed the Partnership for Peace plan with
NATO, as well as a program for a broad and enhanced dialogue with
NATO beyond the plan.
</P>
<P>
Since then, no significant progress has been made on the
proposal for a special relationship with NATO to reflect Russia's
power, although Russian troops are serving with the NATO-led peace
Implementation Force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers agreed at a meeting on Monday that plans
to admit new members from Eastern Europe remained on track.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are widely expected to
be the first countries to join the alliance, although no decisions
on "who and when" will be made before the end of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The five high-tech industrial
development zones in Central China's Hunan province are becoming
magnets for business enterprises, thanks to better infrastructure
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The zones covering 97.5 square kilometers are home to 575
high-tech enterprises, which obtained a total income of 4.95
billion yuan last year, up 168.4 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Products such as central air-conditioners, super-hard materials
and personal computers produced at the zone compete well on the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that the zones have made full use of
their advantages in technology to help old enterprises transform
their technologies and equipment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the five zones had attracted 120

<P>
SHENZHEN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant
in south China's Guangdong Province has started to operate to full
capacity again.
</P>
<P>
The build up of energy output came after it completed the
second annual refueling and maintenance for its Unit 1 on May 31,
an official said today.
</P>
<P>
The Unit 1 shut down on March 31 for second refueling according
to schedule. Since then the plant has not only conducted regular
refueling and maintenance, but also replaced guide tubes of
control rods, said an official in charge of the plant.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the problem with the dropping time of
control rods in both units of the plant has been completely solved.
</P>
<P>
He also said that a damaged exciter in Unit 2 was transported
to Britain for repair a few months ago. After the repair work it
was installed in Unit 1 and has proved to be operating well.
</P>
<P>
Refueling and maintenance for Unit 2 ended in Mid-April. Both
generating units in the power plant are operating to full
capacity, he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Investigates into Buffer Zone Killing in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in
Cyprus (UNFICYP) is investigating into the killing of an unarmed
Greek Cypriot soldier Monday in the U.N.-controlled buffer zone
and called for cooperation from both sides on the island to ensure
the security of the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
An UNFICYP spokesman said today that "we continue to
investigate yesterday's killing and new elements are coming up."
</P>
<P>
The incident took place Monday morning when a Greek Cypriot
National Guardsman, Stelios Panagi, 19, entered unarmed the
U.N.-controlled buffer zone, for unknown reasons, at Ayios
Andreas area of Nicosia and the Turkish soldiers, who manned the
Turkish posts on the demarcation line fired shots at the Greek
Cypriot soldier.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeepers took the seriously wounded soldier to
the Nicosia General Hospital but the doctors there verified his
death.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.N. role in the incident, the spokesman
said it took the U.N. peace-keepers about 30 minutes before they
reached the body of the Greek Cypriot soldier, the eighth
National Guardsman killed by the Turks in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. resident representative Gustave Feissel said
today that "we are very saddened by this tragic incident and
useless loss of life of a young Greek Cypriot."
</P>
<P>
Feissel left this morning for Istanbul, Turkey to attend a
meeting Wednesday between U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, who is there on the occasion of a U.N. conference,
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Feissel said, "We are pursuing our investigation and I hope
that within a couple of days we will have completed it."
</P>
<P>
He said in the meantime, the UNFICYP commander has already met
with the Turkish force commander raising this matter "in very
strong terms". He will also meet the National Guard commander and
there will be further meetings with the Turkish commander.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official acknowledged that the U.N. force can not
control the whole of the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the cooperation of the two sides is
indispensable to ensure the security of the buffer zone and that
people from either side do not enter the buffer zone illegally.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, the Cyprus government has protested to the
U.N. and foreign governments over the killing of an unarmed Greek
Cypriot soldier.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides described the killing as "a
cold-blooded murder."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Greek Cypriot soldier entered the zone
unarmed and recalled that the incident had taken place within the
no man's land, which is under the U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
tool control of 37 percent of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-strong U.N. peace-keeping force patrols the
180-kilometer long buffer zone across this east Mediterranean
island.

invest 1.1 billion US dollars in China by the turn of the century,
90 million US dollars of which will be poured into the country's
power industry.
</P>
<P>
Details of the investment plans were revealed at a meeting on
Siemens' instrumentation and control technology for power plants
held in Jiaxing Power Plant in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
China's power industry will witness a speedy development in the
coming years, increasing the country's demand for
electricity-generating equipment.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to add 10,000 megawatts of installed capacity
annually, providing a huge market for domestic and overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
Siemens mainly provides electricity-generating equipment for
China's fossil-fueled as well as hydraulic power plants, and
process control systems for the country's fossil-fueled power
plants.
</P>
<P>
Siemens has already provided turbogenerators for fossil-fueled
power plants in Rizhao in Shandong province, in Hanfeng in Hebei
Province and in Yangshupu in Shanghai. And it also has provided
gas turbogenerators for the Yangpu Power Plant in Hainan Province,
and hydraulic electrogenerators for some water power plants.
</P>
<P>
It has also won orders to provide two sets of 350,000 kw of
units for Fuzhou Power Plant in southeast Fujian Province and six
sets of 350,000 kw of units for Yangcheng Power Plant in north
China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The company will also invest more than 100 million German Marks
to join the Dongfang Group in Chengdu in southwest China's Sichuan
Province to set up a joint venture to produce
electricity-generating equipment.
</P>
<P>
Siemens now has two joint ventures in China to produce process
control systems -- Teleperm, one in Nanjing and the other in
Dalian.
</P>
<P>
The Jiaxing Power Plant has used the control systems for its
two sets of 300,000 kw of units. The plant plans to add six sets
of 600,000 kw of units for its second phase of expansion.
</P>
<P>
Siemens hopes to get new orders for the control systems from
the Jiaxing Power Plant for its second phase of expansion.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Swiss Authorities have banned Sri
Lankan expatriates there from buying or carrying weapons following
a series of violent incidents involving extortion of funds for
Tamil rebels, a local evening newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which will come into force today, is aimed at
curbing feuding within the Sri Lankan Tamil community in
Switzerland, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Swiss police in April this year arrested 15 members of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), including the group's
leader N. Muralidaran, according to local press reports early.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the LTTE rebels have been frequently
accused of extorting money from Tamils living in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 of Sri Lanka Tamil people are now living in
Switzerland as refugees since 1983 when the LTTE rebels launched
a guerrilla war.

<HEADLINE> Breeding Ground of Black-beaked Gull Discovered in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Eggs of a rare gull have been
discovered in a Chinese deer protection zone.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 eggs of black-beaked gull were spotted in a
polder area of Dafeng County, east China's Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
The discovery has proved that the David's deer protection zone
in the polder area in Dafeng County, where these eggs were found,
is one of the few breeding places of black-beaked gulls in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Black-beaked gull, not well known by people, is a rare bird in
the world, described as a small-sized gull.
</P>
<P>
River mouth areas in China's Hainan island and Zhanjiang city
of southern China's Guangdong province are habitats for
black-beaked gull in winter. There are also traces the gulls in
beach areas in the Republic of Korea, Japan, Taiwan and other
countries and regions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
During spring, their traces are usually found in beach areas of
Beidaihe in north China's Hebei province and seaside of
Vladivostok, Russia. But the number of black-beaked gulls found in
those places only stands at 30 to 40.
</P>
<P>
The polder area in Dafeng county has favorable conditions for
breeding black-beaked gulls, with the establishment of protection
zones in the area and improvement of environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 varieties of rare wildlife under state protection have
been found in the area. Varieties of birds in the area have risen
to 315 from 184 ten years ago.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Launches Seeds Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui province has
launched a "seeds project" to raise the coverage of fine seeds in
the province to 98 percent by the end of this century from the
current 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The project, including the breeding, production, processing,
packaging and marketing of seeds, will make seeds production a
special industry.
</P>
<P>
In some parts of the province, farmers plant grains with their
own seeds or seeds bought randomly on markets.
</P>
<P>
The province needs more than 500 million kilograms of seeds
every year. Because of lax management in the past few years,
farmers sometimes suffered from a scarcity of seeds, or worst
still were sold fake seeds.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to efforts made by the local government, 60 percent of
the seed strains of oil-bearing crops and cotton can now be
provided for farmers in an organised way in the province.
</P>
<P>
So far a 300-hectare original seeds base and 70,000 ha of seed
production bases have been built and the construction of
processing and marketing system is in full swing.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Economic boom province of
Guangdong in south China is striving to help all its
mountain-living people out of poverty by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
During the period the provincial government will spend 500
million yuan (about 60 million US dollars) in the mountainous
areas in the province's northern part for poverty relief programs.
</P>
<P>
The provincial financial department will arrange low-interest
loans to help poor areas develop agricultural and energy
exploitation projects.
</P>
<P>
The department will also set aside 20 million yuan of subsidies
to remove impoverished people out of limestone areas.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the booming coastal cities in Guangdong have been
asked to undertake responsibility for aiding poor people in 16
mountainous counties.
</P>
<P>
Mountainous areas account for 65 percent of the province's
total territory. Over the past decade, the average per capita
income of mountainous farmers has been raised from 410 yuan to
2,200 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The number of poor people in the province has been cut to
800,000 from four million ten years ago.
</P>

PARIS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A new generation Ariane-5 rocket
exploded about 40 seconds after lifting off today from Kourou in
French Guiana, French television showed.
</P>
<P>
Four identical scientific satellites with the rocket were also
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Television pictures showed the rocket suddenly veering off
course and exploding with debris falling from the sky.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the control center said the reason for the
explosion is not immediately known and is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rocket blasted off at 1233 GMT from the European
Space Agency launch center in Kourou.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the maiden flight of the Ariane rocket is a
serious setback to Western Europe's space industry, which is
struggling to maintain its lead in the competitive commercial
satellite launch market, observers noted.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the Ariane-5 had been delayed about 50 minutes
due to bad weather.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Minister Leaves for OPEC Meeting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid left here Monday evening for Vienna to attend the
ministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) due to start Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC meeting will concentrate on the study of the new oil
situation in the world following the signing of the oil-for-food
deal between Iraq and the United Nations on May 20.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi newspaper al-Jumhuriyah today quoted foreign news
agency dispatches as saying that the OPEC preparatory meeting has
concluded with the easing of concerns over a possible declining in
oil price in the world market once Iraq reenters it.
</P>
<P>
Oil exports present at the preparatory meeting said that the
oil production quota for Iraq must be under control but Iraq
insisted that its oil production quota of 3.14 million barrels
per day before August 1990 should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said last week that the OPEC production quota for Iraq
should be adhered to and that other oil producers should not share
the quota saved by Iraq due to the U.N. oil and trade sanctions
imposed after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will support for any "constructive" negotiations at the
forthcoming OPEC conference which will contribute to a stable
world price, Rashid added.

<HEADLINE> Bigger Transactions on China's Inter-bank Lending Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China raised more than 71 billion
yuan in fund-raising centers nationwide in May, up about 43.68
percent over April.
</P>
<P>
Outside the fund-raising centers, Chinese banks raised 18 or so
billion yuan, up some 53 percent from April and non-bank financial
institutions mustered about 11.8 billion yuan, up about a quarter
from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
On the inter-bank lending markets, transactions in the 60-day
lending expanded dramatically to 15.482 billion yuan, accounting
for 30.5 percent of the total turnover, of which 50.54 percent was
attributed to lendings with maturity of more than one month.
</P>
<P>
Trading in the seven-day and 30-day lendings were also active.
</P>
<P>
Analysts pointed out that for most of the time in May interest
rates on all inter-bank lendings were stable and lower than in
April, fluctuating between 0.95 percent to 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
But interest rate on the seven-day lending dropped to 0.735
percent on May 20, a record low since the national inter-bank

<HEADLINE> Global FDI Flows in 1995 Surge to All-Time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide foreign direct investment
(FDI) flows surged to an all-time high in 1995, but the developing
South still received a much smaller share of the total FDI than
the developed North, latest U.N. data said.
</P>
<P>
The global FDI flows were estimated at 325 billion U.S. dollars
in 1995, a 46 percent rise over 1994, preliminary U.N. Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) data released Tuesday showed.
</P>
<P>
Following their emergence from a period of slow growth and
boosted by a new wave of mergers and acquisitions, FDI inflows to
the developed countries reached an estimated 216 billion dollars
in 1995. The United States led the way with record inflows of 75
billion and record outflows of 97 billion.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries registered an estimated 97 billion in FDI
inflows, a record high. And the transitional economies of Central
and Eastern Europe received twice as much FDI in 1995 as in 1994,
an estimated 12 billion, also the highest figure on record.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD pointed out that both in developing countries and
Central and Eastern Europe, a small number of countries accounted
for a large part of the increases in FDI inflows: China,
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand in the former group and the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and Russia in the latter group.
</P>
<P>
According to UNCTAD analysis, the unprecedented level of global
FDI flows in 1995 suggests that the speed of globalization of
production by trans-national corporations may be accelerating.
</P>
<P>
Extensive data and analysis of the 1995 global FDI flows will be
provided by the UNCTAD in its annual World Investment Report to be
published at the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> EU Likely to Lift Mad Cow Derivatives Ban on Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The EU Commission said it would
lift a worldwide ban on British beef derivatives after EU farm
ministers failed to come to a decision on the issue Monday night,
local radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture ministers of the 15 EU countries voted 9-6 in favor
of easing the ban on gelatine, tallow and bull semen at a meeting
in Luxembourg Monday night. But under EU voting rules, six votes
against were enough to block the decision.
</P>
<P>
Under EU rules, the issue will automatically go to the EU
Commission.
</P>
<P>
EU farm commissioner Franz Fischler told reporters that the
Commission will lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
"We will now go ahead and lift the ban," he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Portugal, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium and
Luxembourg voted against easing the ban Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission ordered a worldwide ban on the export of
British cows, beef and beef derivatives on March 27 after mad cow
disease, or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, was linked to its
human equivalent, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission on May 21 formally asked the Council of
Agricultural Ministers to decide on the partial lift of the ban.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Greater Zhuhai-Macao Technological Cooperation Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zhuhai Special Economic Zone
enjoys bright prospects for scientific and technological
cooperation with Macao, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jingping, deputy director of the Zhuhai High-Tech
Industrial Development Zone Administrative Commission, said,
"Macao's economy has been growing rapidly in the past few years."
</P>
<P>
Macao has formed an industrial structure focusing on
export-oriented processing, tourism, real estate, construction,
finance and insurance, he said,
</P>
<P>
He said the export-oriented processing industry has become the
foundation of Macao's economy, but is still characterized by
labor-intensive operations.
</P>
<P>
The industry also suffers from such problems as rising
production costs and the shortage of researchers.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Zhuhai has become a major center for expanding
high-tech industries in Guangdong Province after ten years of
construction.
</P>
<P>
Flexible policies are being pursued in Zhuhai to encourage
investors from Macao and overseas.
</P>
<P>
"The Zhuhai High-Tech Industrial Development Zone has created a
fine investment environment since its establishment three years
ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prices of raw materials, labor, land and workshop buildings in
the zone are far lower than those in Macao, he said.
</P>
<P>
The zone has forged long-term research cooperation relations
with 36 key universities and colleges, military factories and
research institutes in other parts of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
But though it has a large technical work force, it lacks funds,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"I think Zhuhai and Macao can supply each other's needs,
greatly expand cooperation in science and technology research and
development and jointly build new high-tech industries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation will help Macao upgrade its industrial structure,
enable it to turn out goods with a high added value and increase
the competitiveness of its products on the global market, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that Zhuhai should focus on developing and
manufacturing high-tech products in his zone, while Macao should
concentrate on packing and marketing such products.

<HEADLINE> Contact Group Calls for Efforts for Bosnian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
International Contact Group for Bosnia, ending their meeting here
Tuesday, appealed for "every effort" to be made to enable Bosnian
elections to take place as scheduled in September.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by the German, French, British,
U.S. and Russian foreign ministers, representatives from the EU
troika (Spain, Italy and Ireland) and the European Commission, and
Carl Bildt, the EU's highest civilian administrator in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Contact Group welcomed the joint
declaration issued in Geneva on Sunday by Presidents Alija
Izetbegovic of Bosnia, Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Franjo
Tudjman of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called the conduct of free and fair elections
in Bosnia by the September 14 deadline the most important
follow-on step in the peace process. The election deadline is
stipulated in the Dayton peace agreement on Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The statement said a "serious obstacle" in the way of the
election process were persons indicted by the International
Criminal Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia who are still holding
high-ranking official positions.
</P>
<P>
It said: "The parties are obliged to respect the interdiction
according to which individuals indicted of war crimes by the
Tribunal must not strive for or hold any public office, no matter
whether it was conferred upon them or obtained through elections."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Bosnia arms control negotiations under the
aegis of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
are "indispensable" for comprehensive peace and regional stability
in Bosnia, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It called upon the parties concerned to complete these
negotiations by June 6 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The participants at today's meeting also agreed to hold the
next ministerial-level meeting this summer.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China expressed the hope today that
proposed reforms by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
would benefit peace and stability in Europe and the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on an agreement to reform the NATO reached by
foreign ministers of the member countries on Monday, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said that NATO is "a
product of the cold war."
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of the cold war, NATO has taken a series of
self-adjustments to cope with the new circumstances and is still
in the process of reforming itself," Shen said at a press
conference in Beijing this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Shen said, it is inevitable to re-adjust the
relationship between Europe and the United States within the
framework of NATO.
</P>
<P>
"This also shows that it is becoming increasingly impossible
for any single force to dominate European affairs
single-handedly," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is no relationship between China and the Nato, Shen
noted. However, he added, "we hold that actions taken by NATO
should conform to the security interests and aspirations of the
relevant countries and regions and also benefit peace and
stability in Europe and the world as a whole."

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge in Pheonix, the
United States, on Monday has extended a court injunction allowing
banned heptathlete Gea Johnson to compete in the national Olympic
trials.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who was suspended for four years in 1994 following a
positive doping test for steroid by the International Amateur
Athletic Federation and USA Track and Field, was suing the two
bodies for 12 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trials will begin on June 14 in Atlanta, where Johnson will
compete in the heptathlon, in which the top three qualify for the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Earl Carroll accepted jurisdiction in the
case, in which Johnson alleged that her doping test was mishandled.
</P>
<P>
Carroll also ordered DNA testing on the positive urine sample
to identify whether it was Johnson's and wanted the report to be
submitted by July 10.
</P>
<P>
He said the next court hearing will be held on July 22, three
days after the Olympics' opening ceremony.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that about 160,000
Chinese people die from stomach cancer each year.
</P>
<P>
According to a new medical book, over 90 percent of patients
who suffer from stomach cancer can survive its early stages if the
stomach is removed promptly.
</P>
<P>
But in most cases, the stomach cancer has developed to an
advanced stage when diagnosed, and the patients cannot be fully
cured through surgery.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of stomach cancer patients depend on chemotherapy to
ease pain and prolong their lives. Radiation treatment has
developed rapidly during recent years because of advances in
medical science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Chemotherapy is expected to play a more important role in
cancer treatment, said Li Jingtai, director of the General

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Increase Infrastructure Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
increase infrastructure spending for the continual expansion of
the economy, according to the government's Memorandum on Economic
and Financial Policies (MEFP) available today.
</P>
<P>
The MEFP, to be submitted to the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), said "capital spending needs to be stepped up to address
the large backlog of unmet infrastructure needs."
</P>
<P>
On the basis of a recent review of the Philippine economy by an
IMF team, the MEFP acknowledged that Manila needs to focus its
structural efforts on securing additional revenues in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, multilateral financial institutions such as the Asian
Development Bank and the World Bank had voiced concern over the
country's problems in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In the Asian region, an average of about 5 to 9 percent of the
gross national product (GNP) is allocated to infrastructure
projects.
</P>
<P>
However, in the Philippines, the allocation accounts for only 3
to 4 percent of the GNP, in spite of the government's efforts to
ease the funding requirement for the infrastructure projects
through build-operate-transfer schemes.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Cuts Water Supply Budget by Two Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is to cut its water supply
by two percent this year to relieve the city's water shortage
caused by drought.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector will face a 2.07 percent cut, hotels and
restaurants by 2.92 percent, colleges and universities by two
percent, hospitals by 1.58 percent and other fields by 2.66
percent.
</P>
<P>
Units fined for wasting water in 1995 will have their water
supplies reduced by two to 15 percent, according to the "Beijing
Youth Daily".
</P>
<P>
Experts said this move is due to the fact that Beijing's per
capita annual water supply has dropped from 400 cubic meters to
300, constituting only one-thirteenth of the world's average, or
one-seventh of the nation's average, or 20 percent less than
Israel's average.
</P>
<P>
The city faced its fourth major drought, since 1950s, during
the period between last winter and this spring, when its rainfall
was only 12.2 mm, 18.9 mm less than the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this April 16 local reservoirs held 3.739 billion
cubic meters of water, 120 million cubic meters less than the same
1995 period.
</P>
<P>
More than 22 percent of the city's machine wells do not have
enough water, and some even refuse to supply water.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has vowed to make every effort to save
water, make full use of water and fight any kind of waste of
water. Water supplies for local primary and middle schools, and
some key sectors and industries are guaranteed.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Franchisers to Gain Foothold in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- At least 1,000 foreign and local
franchisers are expected to gain foothold in the Philippine market
by the year 2000, creating jobs for some one million Filipinos,
the Philippine Franchise Association (PFA) predicted today.
</P>
<P>
At the Philippine International Franchise Conference here
today, PFA President Samie Lim said franchising is expected to
become one of the country's biggest foreign exchange earners in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
There are already 200 foreign and local franchisers in the
country at present, Lim noted.
</P>
<P>
He said franchising is a business option to local retailers in
the liberalized retail industry.
</P>
<P>
Also at the conference, Mark Siebert, president of Francorp
Inc., the world's largest franchise development consulting firm,
projected a robust growth in the franchising business in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
A PFA study showed that there were 64 local businesses in
various franchising stages and formats in the country in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the PFA, as of the first quarter of 1996, an
additional 30 businesses, in both food and non-food sectors, have
adopted franchising as a method of expansion in the Philippines.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today criticized the West for interfering other's
internal affairs, saying that the Malaysian people do not need
others to tell them how the country should be run.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after officially launching the "World Consumers Day

our people should live? This is our country, so we are the one to
decide."

Transparency International, which ranked Malaysia the 26th most

He said the West should look at racial discrimination and
corruption in Europe which was very high there, and pointed out
that the worst record of human rights violation was to be found in
Europe today.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A major American oil company,
Caltex, opened its first retail station here today after a 20-year
absence.
</P>
<P>
Caltex is the first American oil company to enter the petroleum
retail business in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
John Raeside, general manager of the Caltex Cambodia Limited,
told reporters that Caltex plans to invest 20 million U.S. dollars
in Cambodia in the coming years to build a supply and distribution
system and a retail network of 20 petrol stations in Phnom Penh
and other regions.
</P>
<P>
Caltex will take nearly 10 percent of Cambodia's oil market in a
few years, Raeside said.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of Caltex's investment is a marine terminal at
Sihanoukville scheduled for completion by mid 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
High-quality products at internationally competitive prices
will be imported through the terminal from Caltex's refineries in
Singapore and Thailand.

manipulated by foreigners," said General Aidid.

The bolded general threatened that any imported political
structure will not function in the country and asked his
opponents to forget about their baseless illusion.

<HEADLINE> 100 Million Homeless in World: UN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 4 (Xinhua) -- About 100 million people in the
world are homeless, most of them women and dependent children,
says Wally N'Dow, Secretary General of the Second United Nations
Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II).
</P>
<P>
A written statement released today by the U.N. Center for
Human Settlements based in Nairobi, Kenya, points out that the
problem is not just homeless. Overall, at least 600 million
people live in shelters that are life-threatening or
health-threatening in developing world cities.
</P>
<P>
Every day, some 50,000 people, mostly women and children, die
as a result of poor shelter, polluted water and inadequate
sanitation, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason for homelessness among women and their
dependent children is poverty," says N'Dow, who is also Assistant
Secretary General and head of HABITAT.
</P>
<P>
"Women are doubly disadvantaged by their need to earn a living
while providing care for family members and running households,"
the report quoted N'Dow as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 1.3 billion people living in poverty around
the world, 70 percent are women and girls. Women and girls are
also the fastest increasing group of impoverished, a process
called "the global feminization of poverty."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimates that if all housing could be
brought to a minimum acceptable standard, there would be 5
million fewer deaths and 2 million fewer permanent disabilities
annually on a global basis.
</P>
<P>
The two-week HABITAT II, also called "City Summit," started
Monday in Istanbul, Turkey, with the participation of government
and non-government organization representatives from some 150
countries.
</P>
<P>
The global conference is aimed at finding solutions to urban
problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong-based Asia Satellite
Telecommunications Co. Ltd. (AsiaSat) and the Value Network
(Australasia) Ltd. (TVN) have announced the signing of a lease
agreement for a 36 MHz C-band transponder on AsiaSat 2.
</P>
<P>
The service named as the TV Shopping Network (TVSN) will be
dedicated to the provision of 24-hour TV home shopping throughout
Asia.
</P>
<P>
AsiaSat 2 is the second satellite of AsiaSat which was
successfully launched on November 28, 1995 and began its
commercial operation in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Peter Jackson, Chief Executive Officer of AsiaSat, said that
the agreement will bring one of the first home shopping channels
into Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Reaching over 3.3 billion people in the region, AsiaSat 2 is
certainly the ideal platform to achieve economy of scale for TV
home shopping business," he said.
</P>
<P>
William Schereck, president of TVN, said that TVSN provides the
viewers with the convenience of shopping at home combined with a
broad range of products and services priced to represent good
value.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is only these recent years that TV home
shopping business has been introduced in places outside the United
States. "Given Asia has the world's largest population, and the
fastest-developing economies, its potential for growth is
enormous," he added.
</P>
<P>
TVSN began broadcasting as Australia's first and the only home
shopping channel in December 1995. Home shopping programs are
produced by TVSN and broadcast directly viewers via satellite and
cable TV seven days a week for 24 hours per day.
</P>
<P>
Services will be expanded to the whole of the Asian region when
TVSN commences broadcast on AsiaSat 2 in July this year.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Claims Taken Hostage in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- One of Liberia's warring faction
leaders, Roosevelt Johnson, has claimed the Ghanian government
was holding him in Accra against his will.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is some game being played here" said the
general who has been staying in the Ghanian capital ever since
the failed west African summit meeting in early May aimed at
resolving the fresh round of armed conflict in the Liberian
capital.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like there is some deal to get rid of me so that
Taylor will walk over our people in Monrovia," Johnson was quoted
as saying by a report reaching here today. His troops have been
fighting with the men loyal to Charles Taylor, another warlord of
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Monrovia has calmed down since last week when the African
peacekeeping forces, ECOMOG, declared that they had taken full
control of the city and the warring factions had stopped fighting
and began to withdraw from the capital.
</P>
<P>
Johnson was evacuated on May 4 from Monrovia to the Sierra
Leonian capital of Freetown by the United States marines. A
Ghanian aircraft flew him to Accra to atttend the May 7-8
emergency summit of the West African Committee of Nine on
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"They assured us they were going to take us back. But they are
dodging us and refusing to take us back to Monrovia," said
Johnson, adding that his local and international telephone lines
had all been cut.
</P>
<P>
"This is a deliberate attempt to hold us hostage," said the
angry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the matter, Ghana's Deputy Foreign
Minister Mohamed Chambas said: "We advised Johnson that there is
no point in his rushing back to Monrovia until the ruling council
of state has met and taken certain decisions."
</P>
<P>
"Now if he disagrees with that, that is not helpful to the
peace process in Liberia," said Chambas.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanian official said that Johnson, who had already issued
the statement recommitting himself to the Abuja peace accord
signed last August as demanded by the west African mediators,
would be allowed to return as soon as the Liberian authority
reinstate him as the local government minister.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian council of state was set up according to the
Abuja peace agreement which set August 20, 1996 as the date for
the general elections in the west African country torn apart by
over six years of civil war.

"There are some good signs... Primakov has said he would like
regular contacts," said a NATO official.
</P>
<P>
Russia has signalled recently that while it still opposes NATO
plans on eastward expension, it realizes that the alliance will
eventually take in several countries in central and eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Moscow's major concern, said diplomats, is to make sure the
Baltic republics are not admitted and that no NATO troops or
nuclear weapons be stationed on the land of its new members.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Russia signed the PfP (Partnership for Peace)
Individual Partnership Program with NATO, as well as a program for
a broad, enhanced dialogue with NATO beyond PfP.
</P>
<P>
Since then no major progress has been made on the promise of a
special relationship with NATO to reflect Russia's power, although
Russian troops are serving with the NATO-led peace force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Primakov was due to lunch with U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher on Tuesday, on the sidelines of the ministerial
meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council which brings
together NATO members with their former Warsaw Pact foes.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers agreed at a meeting on Monday that plans
to take in new members from Eastern Europe remained in track.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are widely expected to
be in the first wave, although no decisions on "who and when" will
be made before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Before the NATO meeting with Primakov, foreign ministers from
the five-nation "Contact Group" of major powers which coordinate
policy on Bosnia met to review the prospects for the country's
first post-war elections.
</P>
<P>
No details of the contact group meeting were immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
However, it was agreed on Monday by the 16 NATO foreign
ministers that NATO force in Bosnia would not start withdrawing
until after the elections in September.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's sunken ship "MV
Bukoba", which capsized with over 600 passengers, has become a
permanent tomb for those "lost at sea", "The Guardian" of the
east African country reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report came after a symbolic burial ceremony was held
yesterday at the scene of the accident in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The joint service was held aboard four vessels -- MV Butiama,
Clarias, Ukerewe and Orion, each carrying about 250 mouners.
</P>
<P>
The government was represented by chief justice Francis
Nyalali, who shoved a handful of sand into the lake as a burial
symbol.
</P>
<P>
The government has called off the rescue operation because of
possible health hazard caused by the bodies buried 27 metres at
the bottom of the lake. The bodies are said to have decomposed
beyond recognition.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Trade Volume Sharply Increased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is expecting to earn an
export turn-over worth 3.05 billion U.S. dollars in the first half
of this year, a 16.5 percent increase compared with the same
period last year while its import will be valued at 4.8 billion
U.S. dollars, report here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's import-export turnover has shown a sharp rise, with
an average increase of 20 percent in exports and 22 percent in
imports per year for a decade now, especially since 1991. This is
nearly three times faster than the annual gdp growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has trade ties with 104 countries and its essential
export items have increased from two before 1991 to 12 at present,
including crude oil, rice, marine products, textiles and garments,
coffee, rubber, cashew and other farm products.
</P>
<P>
Garments are top on the list of most increased export articles,
registering an annual rise of 30-40 percent. Now, the country has
more than 3,000 garment companies and enterprises employing tens
of thousands of young workers.
</P>
<P>
Different from the previous years, report said, the first half
of this year sees an immense decline in the import of foreign
consumer goods which have represented only 10 percent compared to
the corresponding period last year.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Rejects Rabbani's Offer For Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic militia
Taliban has rejected an offer for peace talks by President
Burhanuddin Rabbani, and again demanded his resignation.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today from the Afghan
capital of Kabul, the Taliban said the offer was based on "mala
fide intentions."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban also said on Monday that the Kabul regime had
carried out eight attacks on it since Rabbani reached a patch-up
with Hezb-i-Islami of Gulbadin Hikmatyar.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Rabbani said at a press conference that he
was ready to renegotiate the recently concluded power-sharing deal
with Hekmatyar if his key rivals decide to join the government,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani renewed his offer to the Taliban and General Abdul
Rashid Dostam, urging them to join the intra-Afghan dialogue aimed
at broadening the base of his government.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani said he had sent a "goodwill" delegation to Dostam's
headquarters in Mazar-i-Sharif, and another government team would
be sent to southwestern Kandahar for talks with the Taliban
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, which has been besieging Kabul for more than eight
months, have so far refused to hold talks with the Rabbani
government, dubbing his administration as "corrupt and
un-Islamic".
</P>
<P>
Dostam, whose National movement controls several northern
provinces, has also rejected similar offers in the past.

<P>
SINGAPORE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Singapore reported today that in
the first quarter of this year, 24 Singaporeans have been infected
with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
Among the 24 infected, 12 have full blown AIDS (Acquired
Immunity Deficiency Syndrome), while the other 12 are virus
carriers.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry said that this has brought the total number
of Singaporeans with HIV to about 440 since 1985.
</P>
<P>
It said that most of the infected caught the disease through
sex and, for this year, more than 20 cases were infected this way,
while three were infected via intravenous drug use.
</P>
<P>
As in earlier years, men formed the majority of the cases,
almost 90 percent. Giving a profile of the victims, the ministry
said most were between 30 and 39 years of age and single.
</P>
<P>
Others were married, divorced or widowed. None of the spouses
of those married have so far been diagnosed with AIDS, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry stressed that the only way to avoid AIDS
was to avoid casual sex and sex with prostitutes.

Xi'an, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Three Turks, one American, and their

capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, to Istanbul in
Turkey, along the ancient "silk road."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Media Critical of Likud's Threats of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli media have expressed
their grave concerns over Likud's threats to "settle accounts" for
their alleged negative reporting of the Likud election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Likud member of the Knesset (parliament) Limor Livnat, ticked
to be the new communications minister, lashed out today at the
media for their hostility against Likud during the election
campaign, adding she will propose the privatization of the Israeli
Broadcasting Association (IBA).
</P>
<P>
Privatizing the IBA means laying off at least half of its
staff, but Livnat denied any link between Likud's grievance and
the privatizing proposal.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for it to continue existing at the public
expense. Our philosophy is that all state-owned enterprises ought
to be privatized, and the IBA is just another one of them," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the electronic media, Livnat singled out the
Channel 1 Television for its "attitude of unmitigated
discrimination against the Likud."
</P>
<P>
"There is a tendency among its journalists to demonize all
Likud politicians and supporters, and to glorify all those on the
Labor side," she said.
</P>
<P>
Then she went on to attack the radio reporters for exhorting
Arab voters to vote to save Labor's Prime Minister Shimon Peres on
the election day.
</P>
<P>
Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu defeated Labor leader Shimon
Peres with a razor-thin lead in the election for premiership.
</P>
<P>
During the Likud celebration rally Sunday night, some Likud
supporters held posters calling for the dismissal of Channel 1
famous news anchorman Haim Yavin and Channel 2 political
correspondent Gadi Sukenik.
</P>
<P>
Razi Guterman, director of the National Federation of Israeli
Journalists, denounced Likud leaders' assault on the media and
warned that it could lead to violence against journalists.
</P>
<P>
"The hostile atmosphere they are building up will seep into
the public and cause violence," said Guterman, "It's amazing that
even before the Likud has formed a government, its first act is
intimidation and threats to settle accounts with the media."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Labor's Secretary-General Nissim Zvilli blasted
Livnat for what he called a "campaign of threats and incitement"
against the media.
</P>
<P>
Current Communications Minister Shulamit Aloni also warned that
privatizing the IBA would lead to the cancellation of cultural,
religious and educational programs, broadcasts for new immigrants
and minorities, investigations, and interviews, due to their low
ratings.
</P>
<P>
However, Likud's Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu came
out today in defense of the media, saying "it serves a vital role
in democratic life." He said that any debate on the media's
functioning should be held in a responsible and cultured manner.

GUANGZHOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of south
China's Guangdong Province has built 2,000 research-oriented
manufacturing companies since it began to implement the policy of
invigorating the economy through science and technology in 1993.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Guangzhou City Science and Technology
Commission said that 158 of the 2,000 manufacturers have been
designated as high-tech companies by the State Science and
Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
The official said that over the past three years, the Guangzhou
City government has concentrated on building the Guangzhou Economic
and Technological Development Zone, the Tianhe High-Tech
Industrial Development Zone, the Nansha Economic and Technological
Development Zone, the Guangzhou Electronics Industrial Park and
the Guangzhou Science and Technology Park.
</P>
<P>
Technological progress now contributes 40 percent to
Guangzhou's economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
The per capita gross domestic product (the value of goods and
services produced) in Guangzhou was 19,000 yuan in 1995, meeting
the quota for the year 2000 five years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the city government has proclaimed a series of
regulations designed to accelerate economic growth through
scientific and technological progress, aid the development of
high-tech industries, and strengthen management of
non-state-owned, research-oriented companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
is implementing an agricultural development project that has
produced high yields.
</P>
<P>
The project includes construction of several production bases
of grain, cotton, beets and fruit, which all should be completed
by the end of the century, a regional official said.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang will introduce agro-techniques that are expected to
increase grain output by 1,500 kilograms per hectare, and should
transform low-yield cotton fields so that they produce an output
of at least 1,500 kilograms per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Other expansions include building more livestock farms,
developing water-saving agro-techniques, and expanding the
production of grapes, beets and pears.
</P>
<P>
With vast land resources, an ideal climate and abundant
sunshine, Xinjiang has good prospects for agricultural
development, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> No-Smoking Day Marked in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel today marks the No-Smoking
Day, which had been observed around the world Wednesday but
postponed here due to the national elections.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight percent of Israel's total population of 5.5
million smoke, and nearly one third of them puff on more than 20
cigarettes a day, a report from the Israeli Health Ministry
revealed.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that nearly one third of the male population
and one quarter of the women in Israel have the smoking habit.
</P>
<P>
Some 58 percent of this country's smokers tried to kick the
habit during the past years. More than one-tenth of the population
smoked in the past and quit, while 61 percent never smoked,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Ami Sperker, a researcher of the Health Promotion and
Prevention Medicine Department at Ben-Gurion University, has
launched a three-year study of ninth graders in Beersheba to
monitor their smoking habits.
</P>
<P>
The pupils will themselves prepare educational programs to
prevent smoking among their peers, and the researchers will see
whether this affects their smoking habits.
</P>
<P>
Sperker pointed out that according to his research, it is
clear that no-smoking teenagers have a much higher self-image
than their smoking peers.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization said earlier last week that some
3 million people around the world will die this year as a result
of smoking.
</P>
<P>
Today's observances are being organized by the Health
Ministry, the Israel Cancer Association and the Israel Forum for
the Prevention of Smoking. Special programs on smoking will be
broadcast on television during the day.

-- Higher education has provided a great number of scientific,
technological and managerial personnel for environmental
protection work. A total of 140 colleges and universities,
including Beijing University, Qinghua University, the People's
University of China, Beijing Normal University, Nanjing
University, Tongji University and Wuhan University, all have
departments of or majors in environmental studies, with a total of
206 units having the authority of awarding bachelor's
degrees. Approved by the Academic Degrees Committee under the
State Council, there are 223 units granting master's degrees in 51
majors concerning the environment, 77 units granting doctorates in
39 majors, and several postdoctorate positions. Furthermore, more
than 40 specialized secondary schools and over 100 vocational high
schools also offer environmental courses. Over the past 20 years,
large numbers of specialists trained by China's professional
environmental education have become a significant force in the
environmental protection field.
</P>
<P>
-- On-the-job training has enhanced the quality of
environmental managerial personnel. In 1981 the Environmental
Administrative Personnel Training College was established for the
purpose of offering on-the-job training, continuing education and
academic-level education to administrative personnel in the
environmental protection departments throughout the country. By
the end of 1995 over 5,200 trainees had completed courses
there. These skill-enhanced trainees are playing an important role
in promoting the nation's environmental protection work. Moreover,
proceeding from the actual needs, various types of environmental
training classes and symposiums have been held by various
localities and departments concerned. Statistics show that over
the past decade, more than 10,000 training classes have been held
and attended by over 400,000 persons.
</P>
<P>
-- Basic environmental education has cultivated and enhanced
young people's environmental consciousness. In recent years,
environmental education has been offered in high schools, primary
schools and kindergartens throughout the country to cultivate the
children's loving-the-nature quality and sense of responsibility
for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
China is a populous country with underdeveloped education and
the nation's consciousness about the environment remains to be
further enhanced. Therefore, it will be a long-term, arduous task
to do well in environmental publicity and education in
China.

-- China strives to popularize environmental protection
knowledge among the people and raise their consciousness about
environmental protection and gradually to cultivate fine
environmental ethics and codes of conduct. As early as in the
1970s, popular science textbooks on environmental protection were
compiled or translated into Chinese to widely introduce
environmental protection knowledge and enlighten the people on
such knowledge. Since the 1980s large-scale publicity activities
have been organized all over the country every year on World
Environment Day, Tree Planting Day, Love the Birds Week, etc. In
recent years the Chinese media has been further promoting
publicity and reports on environmental protection. Virtually all
newspapers, radio and TV stations frequently offer environmental
protection programs, and, in particular, the media pays special
attention to severely polluted areas and units. Since 1993 the
media's "China Trans-century Environmental Protection Inspection
Campaign," centered on news about environmental law enforcement,
has aroused a nationwide response and accelerated the solution to
a number of major environmental problems. Meanwhile, the various
provinces and cities have also developed such activities. In the
past three years, 1,500 journalists from 750 news units have
participated in these activities, engendering more than 10,000
news articles. Of these, television news items alone accounted for
1,600.
</P>
<P>
In 1983 China established the first national-level professional
newspaper on environmental protection in the world -- the China
Environment News, with an annual circulation of nearly 300,000
copies. In 1980 the China Environmental Science Press was
established. By 1995 it had published over five million copies of
books of 860 titles on the environment. Since 1990 the China
Environment Yearbook has been published, and its English version
also published since 1994. Besides, there are more than 30 local
environmental newspapers and several hundred professional
periodicals.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government encourages the whole of society to
participate in environmental publicity and education
activities. In recent years the environmental protection
departments, educational departments, cultural departments, news
units, organizations for women and youth, scientific associations
and academic societies have all developed their own environmental
publicity and educational activities, highlighted by the following
aspects:

China has actively developed bilateral cooperation in the field
of environmental protection. Over the past ten-odd years China has
successively signed bilateral environmental protection cooperation
agreements and memorandums of understanding with the United
States, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Canada, India,
the Republic of Korea, Japan, Mongolia, Russia, Germany,
Australia, Ukraine, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and the
Netherlands. Exchanges and cooperation have been carried out in
environmental planning and management, global environment
problems, pollution control and prevention, protection of forests
and wild animals and plants, marine environment, climate change,
air pollution, acid rain and sewage disposal and important
achievements have been made in these respects. China has also
taken part in the Global Learning and Observation to Benefit the
Environment, as proposed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote further international cooperation in the
environment and development field, China set up the China Council
for International Cooperation on Environment and Development in
April 1992, composed of more than 40 leading specialists and
well-known public figures from China and other countries, to be
responsible for submitting proposals and advisory opinions to the
Chinese government. The Council has put forward valuable concrete
proposals on energy and the environment, biodiversity protection,
ecological agriculture, resources accounting and the pricing
system, public participation and the implementation of the
environment laws and regulations, which have aroused the attention
and response of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
China took an active part in the preparations for and in
attending the UN Conference on Environment and Development. It
made great efforts for the smooth convening of the
Conference. China has taken part in all the preparatory meetings
of the Conference and played a constructive role in discussions
and negotiations concerning international environment
conventions. In June 1991 the Ministerial Conference of Developing
Countries on Environment and Development, proposed by China and
held in Beijing, was participated in by 41 developing countries,
and the Beijing Declaration published by it set forth the
principled stand of the developing countries on environment and
development, making substantial contributions to the preparation
of the UN Conference. In line with the requirements of the first
meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the UN Conference on
Environment and Development, China worked out the Report on the
Environment and Development of the People's Republic of China,
which gave an overall exposition on the current situation of
China's environment and development, put forward strategic
measures for coordinated development of China's environment and
economy and set forth China's principled stand on the problems of
the global environment, which have received favorable comments
from the international community.

meeting of the Conference and made an important speech proposing
the strengthening of international cooperation in the field of
environment and development, winning positive comments from the
international community. On behalf of the Chinese government, Li
Peng took the lead in signing the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological

Since 1979 China has signed a series of international
environmental conventions and agreements, including the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
Flora, International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling,
Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, Basel
Convention on Control of Trans-Boundary Movements of Hazardous
Wastes and Their Disposal, Montreal Protocol on Substances That

<P>
China always conscientiously carries out its responsibilities
for international environmental conventions and agreements which
it has signed, approved or joined. Under the guidance of China's
Agenda 21, in order to conscientiously undertake its promised
duties China has worked out some important documents and state
programs or action plans, including the 21st Century Agenda on
Environmental Protection, Action Plan for the Conservation of
Biodiversity, Action Plan for Forestry in the 21st Century Agenda,
and the 21st Century Marine Agenda. The Chinese government
approved the State Plan for Gradually Eliminating Substances That
Deplete the Ozone Layer and put forward a plan and policy
framework for eliminating controlled materials as well as measures
for controlling or banning the production and extensive use of
substances which deplete the ozone layer. In July 1994, with the
support of the UN Development Program, the Chinese government
successfully held in Beijing the High-level International
Round-Table Conference on Agenda 21, which contributed to the
promotion of the nation's sustainable development. To provide
legal basis for preventing environmental pollution by the
importation of wastes, in November 1995 China published the
Emergency Announcement on Strictly Controlling Trans-Boundary
Movement of Wastes to China, and in March 1996 it published the
Provisional Regulations on Environmental Protection and Management
of Wastes' Importation.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection in China (32) Concluding Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than 20 years of unremitting efforts, China has
achieved successes in environmental protection that have attracted
worldwide attention. In spite of this, the Chinese government
clearly knows that waste of resources and environmental pollution
in the country are quite serious because China is in the
development stage of rapidly promoting industrialization and still
practices the extensive production and management methods. Along
with population increase and economic development, this problem
will become more prominent. It is still a long-term and arduous
task to solve the environmental problems left over by history and
control the environmental problems that appear in the process of
development.
</P>
<P>
In the process of the reform and opening up and the
modernization drive, China will continue conscientiously to carry
out the basic national policy on environmental protection and
implement the sustainable development strategy.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) the Chinese
government will put into effect a series of important
environmental protection measures, including the China
Trans-century Green Project, and realize the objectives of the
struggle for environmental protection as put forward in the Ninth
Five-Year Plan of the People's Republic of China for National
Economic and Social Development and the Outline of the Long-Term
Target for the Year 2010. It will do its utmost to bring the
aggravating tendency in environmental pollution and ecological
destruction basically under control and improve the environmental
quality of cities and regions.
</P>
<P>
Mankind still faces a great many of difficulties in solving the
problems of the environment and development, and there is a long
way to go. China will, as it did in the past, cooperate for the
same aim with the other countries of the world and strive for
protection of the global environment in which mankind lives, and
for the common prosperity of humanity.

<HEADLINE> Mt Qomolangma Remains Pure Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The area of Mount Qomolangma remains
pure and free from litter left by mountain climbers and tourists.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, the center of modern
mountain-climbing sports moved from the Alps to the Himalayas,
centering around Qomolangma. Chinese climbers opened a route on
the northern slope of Qomolangma on May 25, 1960, which was made
available to overseas climbers in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 17 years, 44 peaks in Tibet have been opened to
overseas sportsmen, and more than 10,000 people from over 30
countries and regions have explored the area.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have taken measures to avoid problems that
might develop following a rise in mountain climbing and tourism,
according to Losang Dawa, standing vice-chairman of the Mountain
Climbers' Association of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The group is responsible for building permanent facilities for
the treatment of garbage in the mountainous regions, collecting
garbage in those areas twice a year, and preparing adequate
garbage bags for mountain climbers.
</P>
<P>
The association also stipulates that the visitors must protect
the wildlife and plants, and take proper precautions for any items
that might decay.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1995 report released by the Regional Bureau for
Environmental Protection, the area around the base camp on the
northern slope "has pure and clean air and may be the cleanest and
least artificially contaminated area in the world."
</P>
<P>
Losang Dawa said the Mountain Climbers' Association will
increase efforts toward environmental protection in Mount
Qomolangma by regularly removing garbage from the camp sites, and
analyzing and appraising the snow at the camp sites and mountain
peaks in cooperation with scientific institutions.

BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of the
white paper entitled "Environmental Protection in China" issued by
the Information Office of the State Council here today:
</P>
<P>
Foreword
</P>
<P>
China is a developing country and now it is confronted with the
dual task of developing the economy and protecting the
environment. Proceeding from its national conditions, China has,
in the process of promoting its overall modernization program,
made environmental protection one of its basic national policies,
regarded the realization of sustainable development as an
important strategy and carried out throughout the country
large-scale pollution prevention and control as well as ecological
environment protection. Over the 18 years since the start of
reform and opening up to the outside world, China's gross national
product (GNP) has achieved a sustained annual growth of around 10
percent, while its environmental quality has basically steered
clear of the outcome of corresponding deterioration. Practice has
proved that the principle China has adopted to achieve
coordinated development between the economy, the society and the
environment has been effective.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the international community, China, while making
great efforts to protect its own environment, has taken an active
part in international environmental affairs, striven to promote
international cooperation in the field of environmental
protection, and earnestly fulfilled its international
obligations. All these have fully shown the sincerity and
determination of the Chinese government and people to protect the
global environment.
</P>
<P>
What efforts has China made to protect its own environment?
What is the situation of environmental protection in China? On the
occasion of the annual World Environment Day, which falls on June
5, here is an account.

<HEADLINE> Arab Countries in Preparation for Summit on Middle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries are making
efforts to hold a summit on the prospects of the Middle East peace
process following the victory of the Likud bloc leader in Israel's
May 29 elections for premiership.
</P>
<P>
According to reports of the Saudi official news agency Saudi
Press Agency (SPA), foreign ministers of Syria, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia held talks Monday night in Saudi capital Riyadh to discuss
proposals on organizing an Arab summit in June.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa arrived at Riyadh just hours after talks
between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad in Cairo Monday.
</P>
<P>
SPA quoted a reliable source on condition of anonymity as
saying that proposals on holding in June small or wider Arab
summits devoted to the Middle East peace process were discussed.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Mubarak and Assad held a closed-door
meeting Monday in Cairo before being joined by Shara and Moussa
and other leading members of their governments.
</P>
<P>
Assad is reported to have said that they had discussed holding
an Arab summit, adding "Egypt and Syria will pool their forces and
hope that our Arab brothers will join us."
</P>
<P>
Both the presidents had voiced pessimism for the future of the
peace process in the Middle East and urged Arabs to join their
efforts in face of a new Israeli right-wing government, media
reports said.

<P>
LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite a lull in hostilities on the
disputed Bakassi peninsula between Nigerian and Cameroonian
troops, the two sides are continuing massive troop deployments in
the combat zone.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today, while Cameroon is
airlifting and shipping war material and troops from Douala, the
largest city near the Nigerian border, Nigeria is doing the same
from its border city of Calabar.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, deplomatic efforts to resolve the dispute
are intensified with Togo playing a major role behind the scenes
and the United Nations stepping in.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian head of state General Sani Abacha and the
Cameroonian President Paul Biya have agreed to meet at the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit to be held in Yaonde
in early July to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have recently approved of the deployment of UN
observers mission in the disputed peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of armed clashes of the troops of both
countries caused the casulties of dozens of soldiers and
civilians and the fleeing of local citizens.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Cut Rice Export Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has decided to cut its rice
export tariff in order to encourage rice export, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry proposed to levy a 1 percent tax on rice
that is 5 to 10 percent broken and grant free tariffs for the
export rice that is more than 15 percent broken.
</P>
<P>
Local rice exporters have complained that they are suffering
losses due to a 4 percent tax imposed previously on their export
consignments.
</P>
<P>
The cut in the export tax on low quality, 25-35 percent broken
rice is expected to help local exporters maintain their market
share.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Vietnamese government has instructed relevant
government bodies to establish an export supporting fund to help
local exporters avoid losses caused by fluctuations in the world
rice market.
</P>
<P>
Rice exporters proposed lately that the government increase the
1996 rice export quota by 500,000 tons to 2.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, Vietnam exported 580,000
tons of rice. It is expected to export 600,000 tons in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
About 65 percent of Vietnam's rice are sold in Asian markets.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Maritime Economy Expects Promising Future (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China's use of maritime resources
is entering a new arena with the adoption of the UN Convention on
Maritime Law.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of
China decided at a meeting May 15 to abide by the UN Maritime
Convention.
</P>
<P>
An official with the National Bureau of Oceanography said that
the basic content of the UN Maritime Convention protects China's
maritime interests.
</P>
<P>
The official said that according to the convention, the sea
area under Chinese jurisdiction is about 3 million sq km. China
will develop regulations to protect its national sovereignty and
sovereignty rights from violation.
</P>
<P>
The convention establishes the understanding that the
international seabed area is the common property of mankind. It
also rules on regional exploration and development of the seabed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China has the right to apply for mineral zone rights
for exploration and development, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful use of maritime resources has become a marked trend
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the 45th UN Assembly urged nations worldwide to list
the development and protection of maritime resources as national
development strategies; in 1994, the 49th UN Assembly named the
year 1998 as the International Maritime Year.

<P>
China has a vast land territory and also boasts a wide sea
area, with a coastline stretching 18,000 kilometers. The country
has more than 6,500 offshore islands.
</P>
<P>
China's maritime economy has developed rapidly since the
implementation of reform and opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during the 1980s, the output value of the
country's maritime economy increased at an annual rate of 17
percent, while in the 1990s, the rate has exceeded 20 percent. In
1995 alone, China's output of maritime economy reached 180 billion
yuan, and the figure is expected to reach 300 billion yuan by the
year 2000, accounting for over 5 percent of the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for National Economic and
Social Development and the Long-Range Goal for the Year 2010 also
placed great importance on developing maritime industries,
investigating and protecting maritime resources.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has investigated coastline and polder
resources, offshore islands, and oceanic multi-metal consumption.
</P>
<P>
The country now has formed systems to monitor maritime
environment and forecast maritime disasters, as well as a service
to provide maritime information.
</P>
<P>
Currently, aquatic farming occupies a leading position in the
country's maritime economy. Its output value was 84.3 billion yuan
in 1984 -- 60 percent of the total output value of aquatic
farming.

<HEADLINE> CAS Determines Targets for Future Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) has set major targets for future development during China's
Ninth Five-Year Plan Period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guangzhao, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
said Monday that the highlighted areas include basic science
research, research on natural resources, environment and ecology,
developing methods to aid in the promotion of the national
economy, and developing new, high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the opening session of the Eighth Academicians
Conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhou said his
academy will play an active role throughout the various
divisions. His academy is to advise and consult with leaders about
economic construction, social development and development of
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
He added that his academy also will focus on problems in
connection with the national economic development and will
encourage technical innovation in the fields of industry and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to promote the country's ecological
network and to offer scientific basis for sustainable social
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
To cater to the market-oriented economy, the Chinese Academy of
Sciences will help develop a number of high-tech ventures in areas
of information, materials, biological technology and medicine.
</P>
<P>
in the next five years, Zhou said, the academy is expected to
train more than 10,000 post-graduates, doctors and post-doctorates
for the society.

<P>
In recent years, with the rapid development of maritime
farming, development of high-value sea products was warmly
welcomed by coastal counties and cities which reaped noticeable
economic returns. Both onshore and offshore fishing have steadily
advanced.
</P>
<P>
China first tapped into maritime petroleum and natural gas in
the early 1980s, and the output of crude oil reached 8.41 million
tons in 1995. This year, the output of oil is expected to be 13
million tons, and gas output should amount to 3 billion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
Maritime tourism, a new sector of the country's maritime
economy, produced 26 billion yuan in output value in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The country has more than 1,500 scenic spots, including coastal
beaches and offshore islands, though a fourth of them have been
opened to tourists. It is predicted that maritime tourism will
play an important role in China's maritime economic boom.
</P>
<P>
Such development also means progress for the maritime
transportation and salt industries, and it should accelerate
direct use of sea water, and maritime medicines and food
processing industries.
</P>
<P>
At present, provinces of Shandong, Guangdong, Liaoning, Fujian,
Zhejiang, Hainan and Jiangsu all have established plans to explore
maritime development.

The Chinese government regards prevention and control of
industrial pollution as the focal point of environmental
protection. Thanks to unremitting efforts over the past 20-odd
years, China has made great progress in this regard.
</P>
<P>
-- Changes in the strategy for the prevention and control of
industrial pollution have been effected. In the 1970s, China's
efforts to prevent and control industrial pollution was mainly
concentrated on the control of individual polluting sources. In
the 1980s, China carried out prevention and control of industrial
pollution in a comprehensive way through the readjustment of
irrational industrial distribution, the overall industrial
structure and the product mix in combination with technical
transformation, intensified the policies and measures in
environmental management and other aspects. In the course of
establishing the socialist market economic system in the 1990s,
China has changed its traditional development strategy, promoted
clean production and embarked on a sustainable development
road. In guiding concept for the prevention and control of
industrial pollution, "three changes" have been decided upon,
i.e., regarding the basic strategy in prevention and control of
pollution, China will gradually change its way of end-of-pipe
pollution control into pollution control during the whole process
of industrial production; with respect to the control of pollutant
discharge, concentration control will be replaced by a combination
of the control of concentration and that of total quantity; and
with regard to pollution control methods, focus on the control of
scattered individual polluting sources will be replaced by a
combination of centralized and scattered controls.

<TEXT>
<P>
-- Policy and legislation for preventing and controlling
industrial pollution have taken initial shape as a coherent
system. In order to effectively prevent and control industrial
pollution, the Chinese government has drawn up three major
policies for environmental protection, i.e., "putting prevention
first and combining prevention with control," "making the polluter
responsible for treating the pollution" and "intensifying
environmental management." In addition, it has drawn up the policy
on the comprehensive utilization of resources, the policy on
preventing and controlling industrial pollution in combination
with technical transformation, the policy on overall improvement
of the urban environment, the policy on environmental protection
technology, and the policy on environmental protection
industries. The laws and regulations on environmental protection
that have been promulgated include explicit provisions on the
prevention and control of industrial pollution. Local governments
at all levels have worked out their policies on the prevention and
control of industrial pollution in accordance with their
respective actual conditions.
</P>
<P>
-- Enterprise environment supervision and management have been
reinforced. The Chinese government has promoted the enforcement of
the environmental impact assessment system and the
"three-at-the-same-time" system (i.e., facilities for preventing
and controlling environmental pollution and destruction shall be
planned, constructed and put into use at the same time as the main
production projects). These steps have played remarkable roles in
controlling new pollution sources. The nation's environmental
impact assessment rate of construction projects above the county
level and the implementation rate of the "three-at-the-same-time"
system have reached 60.8 percent and 87.3 percent respectively.
By the end of 1995, 480 cities and 77,000 enterprises had made
pollution discharge declarations and registrations; 240 cities had
issued a total of 16,000 pollutant discharge licences to 14,000
enterprises. Since 1979 China has collected 24.7 billion yuan in
pollutant discharge fees.

-- Measures for preventing and controlling industrial pollution
have gradually been improved. First, China has completed a great
number of pollution-control projects through the readjustment of
the industrial structure and product mix, and promoted clean
production through technical transformation. Chemical,
metallurgical, light, machine-building, power and building
materials industries have actively adopted clean production,
speeded up technical transformation and firmly eliminated a large
group of equipment and products that caused heavy pollution and
consumed large amount of energy and materials. Consequently,
industrial production has increased for several years running, the
discharge of pollutants has declined steadily and the economic
returns of enterprises have gone up year by year. The Jilin
Chemical Industrial Company is an old enterprise, but for many
years it has relied on progress in science and technology to carry
out technical transformation of its production equipment which
used to cause a serious waste of resources and produced heavy
pollution. As a result, it has fundamentally eliminated the
pollution caused by various chemicals. Second, in combination with
the comprehensive improvement of the urban environment and
regional reconstruction, a number of enterprises which caused
heavy pollution have been closed down, moved away or otherwise put
under control, thus alleviating the trend of pollution in some
regions. The Beijing Municipal Government closed down the heavily
polluting south section of the Special Steel Factory of the
Capital Iron and Steel Company, eliminating a large pollution
source in the city proper. Shanghai has strengthened the
prevention and control of pollution in the upper reaches of the
Suzhou and Huangpu rivers and in major urban districts, so that
pollution in some of the districts has been brought under
control. Third, the dynamics of setting deadlines for eliminating
pollution have been reinforced. Since 1978 the Chinese government
has announced two groups of scheduled pollution-control projects,
totaling 367, and local governments have designated 220,000
pollution-control projects, which have basically been
completed. Fourth, the prevention and control od pollution is
developing toward regional and river valley comprehensive
improvement. Since the late 1980s, the Chinese government has
taken measures to comprehensively alleviate air pollution in Benxi
and Baotou cities, and water pollution in the Baiyangdian Lake and
huaihe River drainage basins. In 1995, the Chinese government
promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on the Prevention and
Control of Water Pollution in the Huaihe River Drainage Area," and
the work is being actively carried out in accordance with the
plan.

Fifth, efforts have been stepped up to save energy and reduce
consumption. The capability to treat waste gas, water and
industrial residues ("three wastes") has been enhanced and the
comprehensive utilization rate of these materials has been
increased. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995)
energy consumption for every ten thousand yuan worth of the gross
domestic product (GDP) decreased from 5.3 tons of the standard
coal in 1990 to 3.94 tons in 1995, saving a grand total of 358
million tons of the standard coal, or an annual average
conservation rate of 5.8 percent. In 1995 the waste water
treatment rate of the industrial enterprises at and above the
county level all over the country reached 76.8 percent; the smog
and dust removal rate of waste gas from burning fuel, 88.2
percent; waste gas purification rate from production processes,
68.9 percent; and the comprehensive utilization rate of industrial
solid waste, 43 percent. Output value attained through the
comprehensive utilization of the industrial "three wastes" came to
19 billion yuan. Starting in 1983, Li Shuangliang, a retired
worker of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, and 20 other retired
workers spent 10 years removing a huge slag heap, thus eliminating
a serious, long-standing pollution source of the Taiyuan Iron and
Steel Company. The slag was utilized in a comprehensive way, with
900,000 tons of waste iron and steel worth 160 million yuan
recovered.
</P>
<P>
China is a country with coal as its primary source of
energy. Seventy percent of the smog and dust in the air and 90
percent of the sulfur dioxide emission come from coal burning. As
a result, the cities with concentrated industries and population
suffer from serious air pollution. Acid rain has occurred, and the
situation has gone from bad to worse in some regions and
cities. The Chinese government has adopted some measures, such as
developing clean coal technology and clean-combustion technology,
and collecting sulfur dioxide emission fees, to control acid
rain. A long-term study by Chinese experts on the issue of acid
rain proves that the precursors of acid rain generated from the
emission source in Chinese mainland are mainly spread within
Chinese territory, mainly in the areas south of the Yangtze River,
in regions east of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and in the Sichuan
Basin.

Like other developing countries, China's per capita energy
consumption and the emitted sulfur dioxide are much lower than the
world average at present, and it will remain so by the end of this
century. According to the "Framework Convention on Climatic
Changes," China is under no specific obligation to limit the
emission of carbon dioxide. However, mindful of its responsibility
for protection of the global climate, China follows the principle
of attaching equal importance to energy conservation and
expansion of the energy industry, striving to raise its energy
utilization efficiency and to readjust its energy structure. While
appropriately developing nuclear power, China spares no effort to
develop hydroelectric power and to strengthen research into and
exploitation of geothermal power, solar energy, wind energy,
oceanic energy and other new energy sources, so as to reduce the
greenhouse gas emission.

<P>
Since the start of reform and opening up to the outside world,
China's GNP has quadrupled, but the growth of the emission of
pollutants is clearly slower than the economic growth. Some
environmental quality indices of some regions and cities have
basically remained stable, and some localities have made
improvements to a certain extent. In spite of this, China's
industrialization is still in the primary stage of development,
with a low level of modernized management. Its industrial
distribution and structure need to be further readjusted. With
comparatively backward equipment and production technology, the
prevention and control of industrial pollution remain an arduous
task of environmental protection in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always considered the cities as key
points in environmental protection work. In the past 10-odd years
China has speeded up urbanization. In 1980 the urban population in
China totaled 191.4 million, a figure which rose to 351.71 million
in 1995. In 1980 China had 223 administratively designated cities,
which went up to 640 in 1995. The urbanization level increased
from 19.39 percent in 1980 to 28.85 percent in 1995. Just like
other countries, the issue of environmental pollution has also
appeared in the course of China's urbanization. Therefore the
Chinese government has adopted effective measures to control
environmental pollution and done its best to improve the quality
of the urban environment.

-- Drawing up overall city plans and readjusting the layout of
urban functions. By the end of 1995 each of the 640 cities in
China had worked out its own overall city plan. So had each of the
31,559 administratively designated towns. In accordance with the
"Law on City Planning," while working out an overall city plan,
the city must include in the plan details of environmental
protection, such as protecting and improving the city's ecological
environment, and preventing and controlling pollution and other
public hazards. In light of the requirements of the overall
planning, many cities, while transforming the old areas and
developing new ones, have, in accordance with the city's function
zoning, readjusted the industrial layout, strengthened the
prevention and control of industrial pollution, changed the
situation in which factories and residents share the same areas,
controlled urban environmental pollution caused by production and
in people's daily lives, and constructed a large number of
residential quarters with reasonable layout and complete social
services. In addition, China has designated 52 key environmental
protection cities, and put 99 leading national-level historical
and cultural cities under special protection.
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening the construction of infrastructure and
improving the capability to prevent and control pollution. At
present, 68.4 percent of urban residents in China use gas for
cooking and heating; the centralized disposal rate of urban sewage
is 20 percent; the innocuity rate of urban garbage and fecal
disposal is 45.4 percent; and the afforestation rate is 23.8
percent. In 1994 Beijing invested 15.13 billion yuan in the
construction of urban infrastructure, of which over five billion
yuan was used to construct environmental improvement
facilities. It built the Gaobeidian Sewage Treatment Plant, with a
daily handling capacity of 500,000 tons, and the large-scale Datun
Garbage Transfer Station and Ahsuwei Garbage Landfill, thus
having greatly improved Beijing's overall environment.

-- Carrying out comprehensive improvement of the urban
environment and improving the quality of the urban
environment. Since 1989 the Chinese government has carried out the
quantitative examination system of the urban environment
comprehensive improvement throughout the country. The state and
the provincial governments have carried out such examinations in
37 key cities and other 330-plus cities. The implementation of
this system has enhanced the sense of responsibility of leaders at
all levels for urban environmental protection, and such
examinations have been included in the governments' work
agendas. Hence a management system and operation mechanism have
taken an initial shape for the comprehensive improvement of the
urban environment under the unified leadership of mayors with
various relevant departments bearing their respective responsibilities
and the people actively participating in it. All cities in China
have increased their investment in environmental improvement and
speeded up relevant construction. Marked results have been
achieved. By 1995 China had constructed 11,333 sq km of
smog-and-dust control zones, and 1,800 sq km of up-to-standard
noise-control zones, and increased public lawns by 490 million
square meters. A large number of urban waterways, such as the
Zhongdong River in Hangzhou, the Funan River in Chengdu, the Haihe
River in Tianjin, the Suzhou River in Shanghai, the Qinhuai River
in Nanjing and the Haohe River in Nantong, have been cleaned up on
a large scale. Hence, the urban water environment has been
improved.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to comprehensive urban environmental improvement and
ecological construction, Benxi City in Liaoning Province has
cleared up 21 "smog dragons," 17 polluting wastewater sources and
two "mountains" of industrial residue which were notorious sources
of pollution. It has also constructed a round-the-city forest
park with an area of 220 sq km. Consequently, Benxi, which used to
be known as one of "the cities on earth which could not be seen
from a satellite" because of air pollution, has made a remarkable
improvement in its environment.

-- Notable successes have been attained in the harnessing of
main rivers and lakes. Since the foundation of New China in 1949
the Chinese government has taken comprehensive exploitation and
control of major rivers and lakes, with emphasis on the prevention
and control of flood and waterlogging, as an important task of
water conservancy construction. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan
period, on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the
lower reaches of the Yellow River, and on the Huaihe, Haihe,
Songhua and Liaohe rivers and Lake Taihu, the main dikes were
heightened and reinforced, waterways were cleaned up, and flood
diversion projects were built. The construction of a group of key
projects for water control and other uses were completed or
started. To compensate for lack of water resources in northern
areas, the Chinese government vigorously promoted the planning and
construction of water-diversion projects between different
drainage basins. In November 1995 it sponsored an overall
feasibility study of the middle, eastern and western lines
projects for diverting water from south to north.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project is a gigantic, trans-century project
for harnessing and developing the Yangtze River. When it is
completed, floods on the upper reaches will be effectively
controlled and areas on the middle and lower reaches will be able
to improve their anti-flood capability, thus lessening the harmful
effects on the ecological environment. Hydroelectricity, which
will be the energy discharged by the project, causes much less
pollution than coal-burning power plants. The government has
organized experts to work out the Report on the Impact of the
Three Gorges Project on the Ecology and Environment, and
Countermeasures, and has approved the Environmental Impact
Statement of the Three Gorges Project. The government will adopt a
sequence of measures to minimize the unfavorable effects on the
ecology and the environment that could be caused by the Three
Gorges Project.

Territorial control forms part of China's work in implementing
the sustainable development strategy. Since the start of the
reform and opening-up era, the Chinese government has carried out
territorial control on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
-- New progress has been made in territorial control planning.
In this work the Chinese government has formulated a sequence of
national, trans-provincial and key-regional territorial control
plans, such as the National Program for Overall Land Use Planning,
the National Program for Afforestation, the National Plan for
Marine Development, the National Program for Water and Soil
Conservation, the Comprehensive Plan for China's Seven Major River
Valleys, the Plan for Economic Development in the Three Gorges
Area, the Economic Plan for the Yangtze River Delta and Areas
Along the River, Key Points of the Economic Plan for Northwestern
Areas, and the Resources Development and Environment Protection
Plan for the Juncture of Shanxi, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia. Some
provinces and cities have also drawn up or revised local
territorial control plans and the overall plan for land use. By
the end of 1995 the overall plan for land use had been completed
60 percent at the provincial level, 69 percent at the city
(prefectural) level and 63 percent at the county level.
</P>
<P>
-- Many achievements have been made in research on territorial
control. To help formulate the Ninth Five-Year Plan for National
Economic and Social Development and the Outline of the Long-Term
Target for the Year 2010, the Chinese government, proceeding from
realizing coordination and sustainable development of the economy,
society, population, resources and environment, has organized
research on vital issues such as the development of territorial
resources and environmental control, the overall plan for the
national territory, and how well mineral resources can satisfy the
demands of the national economy. It has also completed the Major
Issues on the Development of National Territorial Resources and
Environmental Control During 1996-2010 and other research reports
on special subjects. The government has laid down the overall
framework of optimizing the development and control of territorial
resources, the regional development strategy and distribution of
territorial resources exploitation, as well as the targets and
measures of territorial control and environmental protection.

-- Land preservation, exploitation and control have been
promoted on a full scale. In order to put cultivated land under
proper protection, basic farmland preservation areas have been
delimited all over the country, in accordance with the Regulations
on the Protection of Basic Farmland. By the end of 1995, 2,100
units at the county level had finished the work, with well over 70
percent of farmland put under effectual protection. Planned
management of the land to be used for construction has been
strengthened, putting the total area and makeup of such land under
proper control. Random occupation of farmland has been curbed to
some extent. In 1995, farmland used for construction was 20.8
percent less than the previous year. In recent years, the
government has formulated the Key Points of National Planning for
Desertication Control During 1991-2000 to speed up the
desertification prevention and control project. It is planned that
6.667 million hectares of desertified land will be treated over 10
years. The development of 20 key counties, nine experimental areas
and 22 demonstration bases of the national desertification
prevention and control project has been brought into line with the
development plan of the national economy. During the Eighth
Five-Year Plan period 3.759 million hectares of desertified land
were tackled in a comprehensive way. The Chinese government also
devotes much attention to water and soil conservation. It has
effectively prevented soil erosion and improved the ecological
environment and agricultural conditions. At present, 25 key soil
erosion control areas have been established at the national
level. Water and soil conservation projects are carried out in
seven big river valleys. In more than 10,000 small river valleys
with serious soil erosion, problems concerning mountains, rivers,
farmland and forests are tackled in a comprehensive way. Soil
erosion has been checked in a total area of 67 million hectares,
and a great number of water and soil conservation projects have
been completed, making eroded soil decrease by 1.1 billion tons
every year and water conservation capacity increase by 18 billion
cubic meters. In the comprehensive soil erosion control area in
the Loess Plateau, a total of 15 million hectares of land have
been treated -- 30 percent of the soil erosion area -- with over
300 million tons less silt flowing into the Yellow River every
year. Since the publication of the Regulations on Land
Reclamation, most of the provinces and cities have worked out
procedures for implementation of these regulations and some dozen
provinces and autonomous regions have put into effect procedures
for raising funds for land reclamation and for the use and
administration of these funds. As a result, remarkable progress
has been made in the country's reclamation of discarded land. From
1987 to 1995 a total of about 3.5 million hectares of land were
reclaimed, among which 600,000 hectares had been waste land. In
1989 the experimental work of land reclamation was carried out in
major mineral-producing provinces. In 1995 construction of three
national-level reclamation demonstration zones was started in
sunken areas of coalfields, while the national reclamation
technical standards were stipulated. Tongshan County in Jiangsu
Province invested 56 million yuan to reclaim 6,600 hectares of
land, basically balancing land reclamation with land use.

-- Pollution prevention and control in township enterprises
have been strengthened. Township enterprises are a strong mainstay
of the Chinese rural economy and an important sector of the
national economy. Because of their rapid development, the
environmental problems they caused attracted the serious attention
of the Chinese government and people. In the past decade,
environmental management and pollution prevention and control in
township enterprises have made some progress. In areas along the
eastern coast, the technical and equipment levels of township
enterprises have been gradually raised. Centralized pollution
control has been carried out, along with construction of small
towns, township enterprises zones and economic development
zones. All these steps have seen certain outcomes. Zhangjiagang
City in Jiangsu Province is spurring its economy to develop
rapidly while paying due attention to prevention of environmental
pollution by township enterprises. It has thus realized a
coordinated development of both the environment and the
economy. Township enterprises in the central and western areas
have been actively guided, aided and supervised to prevent
environmental pollution spreading. It should be pointed out that
environmental protection in township enterprises is still an
arduous task, and that the government will keep guiding them to
develop in a healthy way, preventing and alleviating environmental
pollution through reinforced environmental management.

-- Development of green and organic foods is welcomed. In order
to meet the people's increasing demands for high-quality food, and
to protect agricultural natural resources and the ecological
environment, relevant departments began in 1990 to develop "green
food," featuring pollution-free, safe, high-quality and nutritious
contents. By the end of 1995 a total of 568 sorts of green food
had been developed, with many becoming well-known products. Since
the start of the development of green food, 1.13 million hectares
of land have been well protected. In 1995 a government department
published the Procedures on the Administration of Organic
(Natural) Food Labelling. Organic (natural) food unpolluted by
chemical fertilizers and farm chemicals has now appeared in

The Chinese people have accumulated abundant experience in their
protracted struggles against natural disasters, in which they laid
down principles like "putting prevention first and combining
prevention and control," and "combining prevention and rescue." A
working system has been primarily established to avert all kinds
of natural disasters, and a contingent of experienced scientists

China has traditionally been an agricultural country. In
developing agricultural production, the government attaches great
importance to rural environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
-- Achievements have been made in eco-agriculture. The
government has taken the development of eco-agriculture as an
important means to realize the coordinated development of the
environment and the economy. At present, the 50 eco-agricultural
experimental counties designated by the state are playing positive
and exemplary roles in the country, spurring development of
eco-agriculture in 10 prefectures and over 100 counties. According
to statistics, the total output of grain of the experimental
counties has increased by 15 percent, output per mu by upwards of
10 percent, and the income per capita is 12 percent higher than
the average level of the surrounding areas. The practice of
eco-agriculture has brought about striking improvements in the
agricultural ecological environment -- barren hills greened,
forest acreage greatly raised, soil erosion controlled to some
extent, organic matter content of the soil increased, and the
ability of the agricultural ecological system to ward off natural
disasters improved. In the meantime, in order to promote regional
sustainable development, construction of some 100 ecological
demonstration areas, mainly at the county level, has been started
in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
-- Further development of rural energy construction. Energy
construction in rural areas is an important measure for protecting
and improving the rural ecological environment. In 1991
comprehensive energy construction in rural areas was started in
100 counties. As a result, the country was capable of increasing
10.8 million tons of standard coal and saving 11.37 million tons
annually. In 1995 fuel-saving stoves, methane, solar, wind and
geothermal energy sources and small hydropower stations began to
develop and were popularized in rural areas throughout the
country. In this way, a total of 80 million tons of standard coal
can be saved and produced every year. Methane-generating pits for
agricultural use were dug to benefit 5.69 million households and
fuel-saving stoves were in use in 170 million households.

deficit in forest reserves which had existed for a long period,
while the growth of forests has begun to exceed consumption. As a
result, the era of increase both in forest acreage and reserve has
dawned on the country. Currently, China's forest area totals 134
million hectares, bringing the country's forest coverage up to
13.92 percent. Artificial afforestation covers 33.79 million
hectares. Volunteers have contributed a total of 4.4 billion
person-times to planting 23 billion trees. Once-barren mountains

The government has paid special attention to the construction
of forest ecological projects. Since 1978 China has established 10
forest ecological projects, with a scheduled afforestation area of
120 million hectares -- aimed mainly at protecting and improving
the natural eco-environment and realizing the sustainable use of
natural resources. These projects are: the "three norths"
shelterbelts (the western area of Northeast, and the northern
parts of North and Northwest China), the shelterbelts along the
upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the coastal
shelterbelts, the plain farmland shelterbelts, the Taihang
Mountains afforestation project, the anti-desertification project,
the shelterbelts for comprehensive control in the Huaihe River and
Taihu Lake basins, the shelterbelts for comprehensive control in
the Pearl River basin, the shelterbelts for comprehensive control
in the Liaohe River basin, and the shelterbelts along the middle
reaches of the Yellow River. Currently, the "three norths"
shelterbelts project has finished its first and second phases,
resulting in a newly afforested area of 18.51 million hectares and
increasing the forest coverage from 5.05 to 8.2 percent. This
project has turned more than 40,000 sq km of barren land into
green one and more than 1.3 million hectares of desert land into
farmland, pastures and orchards. Twelve percent of the total
desertified land has been worked on, and 10 percent of it has been
brought under control, more than 11 million hectares of farmland
has been protected by forest networks, while 8.93 million hectares
of grassland have been restored, resulting in a 20-odd percent
increase in grass output. The agricultural eco-environment in one
third of the counties covered by the "three norths" project has
entered a benign circle. The shelterbelts project along the upper
and middle reaches of the Yangtze River has yielded a total of
more than 5.46 million hectares of newly planted forest in seven
years. A grand total of 1.6 million hectares of forest has
appeared since coastal shelterbelts project was launched in an
all-round way in 1991, which basically covers the
18,000-kilometer-long coastline. A total of 769 counties and
cities covered by the plain farmland shelterbelts have reached
their tree-planting goals, accounting for 84 percent of the total
918 counties and cities in the plain areas. The Taihang Mountains
afforestation project has already produced a total of 1.02 million
hectares of afforested area since it was launched in 1994. The
above large-scale eco-system construction projects have gradually
improved the eco-environment in a considerable number of areas.

listed as key protection species, including 258 species of wild
animals and 354 species of plants. Artificial reproduction has
been successfully implemented for more than 60 species of rare and
endangered wild animals, and through propagation, such species as
David's deer, wild horse and saiga tatarica have been
re-introduced.
</P>
<P>
Establishing nature reserves is the most effective method for
the on-site conservation of wild plants and animals. By the end of
1995 799 nature reserves of rather diversified types, covering a
total area of 71.85 million hectares (or 7.19 percent of China's
territory) had been established in China. There are 99
national-level reserves, of which ten -- Jilin's Changbai
Mountains, Sichuan's Wolong, Guizhou's Fanjing Mountains, Hubei's
Shennongjia, Fujian's Wuyi Mountains, Xinjiang's Mt. Bogda,
Guangdong's Dinghu Mountains, Inner Mongolia's Xilingol, Jiangsu's
Yancheng and Yunnan's Xishuangbanna -- have been listed in the
International Network of Men and Biosphere Reserves. Another six
nature reserves -- Zhalong in Heilongjiang, Xianghai in Jilin,
Boyang Lake in Jiangxi, East Dongting Lake in Hunan, Bird Island
in Qinghai and Dongzhai Harbor in Hainan -- have been included in
the list of the world's important wetlands. At present, a total of
512 historic and scenic sites has been designated, of which 119
are at the national level, 256 at the provincial level and 137 at
the city or county level, covering a total area of 9.6 million
hectares. Forest parks total 710, of which 248 are at the national
level. Scenic spots at Huangshan Mountain, Wulingyuan, Jiuzhaigou
and Huanglong are listed as parts of the world natural and
cultural heritage by the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization. The establishment of nature reserves
has put a number of representative and typical natural eco-systems
with scientific research value as well as rare and endangered
species under effective protection.

Establishing zoological gardens, botanical gardens and various
artificial breeding centers is an effective method for off-site
preservation of various species of wild animals and plants. By the
end of 1995 China had set up 175 zoological gardens and zoological
exhibition sites in public parks, 227 artificial breeding centers
for wild animals, more than 60 large botanical gardens and 255
wild plant gene and cell banks to ensure the continuation of rare
and endangered species of plants and animals, including the giant
panda, Chinese alligator, Chinese sturgeon, white-flag dolphin,
Manchurian tiger, crested ibis, Cathay silver fir, dovetree, Cycas
revoluta and camellia chrysantha tuyama. In addition, China has
established some dozen specimen centers, one gene bank and two
cell banks for wild animals, which have helped genetic
polymorphism research and preservation work. The medicinal use of
and trade in rhinoceros horn and tigerbone are strictly prohibited
by the government, and the illegal hunting of rare wild animals is
severely punished by law.
</P>
<P>
The government has placed much stress on the preservation of
the genetic materials from domestic animals and fowls, as well as
germ plasma resources from crops. There are 596 species of
livestock and poultry in China, of which over 70 percent are
native species. The government has appropriated special funds for
preservation of some endangered or sharply diminishing species of
livestock and poultry and established a germ plasma gene bank for
livestock forage grass. China had initially formed a preservation
system for germ plasma resources from crops, including one
national germ plasma bank for long-term preservation and a
duplicate one, 23 local germ plasma banks for mid-term
preservation, and 25 national germ plasma nurseries, of which two
are for test-tube culture. The germ plasma resources of most
agricultural plants in China are preserved, including 330,000
specimens of germ plasma for various species of crops, of which
300,000 have duplicates.

The government also attaches great importance to the
environmental protection of the Tibet Autonomous Region. The
environmental quality in Tibet today has been kept in an excellent
condition. The atmospheric environment there has attained the
state's first-level quality and the water quality of major rivers
and lakes is also higher than the national standard for the
surface waters environmental quality. Forests and grasslands are
under effective preservation. The forest area in Tibet totals 7.17
million hectares and the stumpage, 2.084 billion cubic meters. The
total grassland area amounts to 82.07 million hectares, of which
70.77 million hectares are usable. With an elevation of 4,700
meters, Namco Lake has become a natural habitat for rare water
birds like swans, egrets and sand birds.
</P>
<P>
Viewed from an overall situation, however, many problems still
exist -- the shortage of the forest area, grassland degradation,
soil erosion, desertification and difficulties in the protection
of rare and endangered species of wild animals and plants. Thus,
the further strengthening of the preservation of the ecological
environment and biodiversity remains an important task for the
Chinese government to tackle.

VI. Environmental Science and Technology, and Environmental
Publicity and Education
</P>
<P>
Through adopting the strategy of "relying on science and
education to rejuvenate the nation," China has made initial
achievements in actively accelerating the development of
environmental science and technology:
</P>
<P>
-- The research spectrum of environmental science and
technology has been steadily broadened. Research into
environmental science and technology in China began in the
1970s. As an important part of scientific and technological work,
it has always won great attention from the state. For some major
environmental research subjects the Chinese government has
formulated corresponding research programs and plans for
environmental protection while organizing forces to tackle key
scientific and technological problems. Besides, China has expanded
its research into comprehensive prevention and control of regional
environmental pollution, environmental background values and
environmental capacity, pollution control technology and global
environmental problems. As a result, the country has made
substantial scientific and technological achievements in some
research areas, such as the comprehensive prevention and control
of Beijing's environmental pollution, the capacity of the
atmospheric environment, the background value and environmental
capacity of the nation's major soils, acid deposition and its
impact and control, the forecasting and monitoring of the
influence of the changes in the global climate and corresponding
countermeasures, the depollution of coal, and the control of air
pollution. China has also developed research in such fields as
regional environmental impact assessment, environmental management
and environmental economy, environmental monitoring technology and
equipment, the protection of natural ecology, and the relationship
between the environment and people's health. This provides
scientific basis and technological support for environmental
management, the prevention and control of pollution, and
ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
-- The numbers of research institutes and personnel engaged in
environmental protection have been steadily increased. By the end
of 1995 some 390 scientific research bodies engaged in
environmental protection had been established nationwide, staffed
by more than 20,000 research and managerial personnel. A
comprehensive scientific research system composed of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, competent departments of different trades,
colleges and universities, and the environmental protection
departments has been basically built up.

<TEXT>
<P>
-- Work regarding the screening, evaluation and popularization
of the optimum and practical technology for environmental
protection has been organized. The popularization of the optimum
and practical technology is an important measure to expedite the
transformation of environmental scientific and technological
achievements into the capability of actual pollution prevention
and control. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, 1,316 kinds
of practical technology were recommended nationwide, and 438 of
them were appraised as the optimum items of practical
technology. Among them, 385 kinds have been put into use in
140,000 units, resulting in reduced emission of the "three wastes"
and good economic returns.
</P>
<P>
-- The development of the environmental protection industry has
been fostered. This newly emerging industry involves the
development of technology, manufacturing of products, circulation
of commodities, utilization of resources, provision of
information, and undertaking of contracted projects. China gives
priority to the development of the environmental protection
industry, with the guidelines of "actively fostering, adjusting
the structure, relying on science and technology, improving
quality, orienting to the market and providing excellent
services." Preferential policies are given to investment, prices,
taxes, etc., to encourage the development of the environmental
protection industry. A general survey of the nation's
environmental protection industry, the results of which were made
public in May 1996, shows that there are 8,651 units engaged in
the environmental protection industry, which is staffed by 1.882
million people and boasts 45.011 billion yuan worth of fixed
assets, an annual output value of 31.148 billion yuan and 4.091
billion yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
-- The development of environmental labels has entered the
stage of implementation. In March 1993 China began to carry out a
plan for environment labelling. By April 1996 the environmental
label certification work had been developed in 11 categories of
products, and 35 kinds of products from 21 enterprises had been
awarded environmental labels. As the environmentally-labelled
products enter millions of households the environmental label will
exert a growing influence in society.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government regards it a strategic task to actively
develop environmental publicity and education and to raise the
nation's consciousness about the importance of environmental
protection.

<HEADLINE> 25 Zimbabwean Farms Acquired for Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
acquired 25 farms during the last six months and is in the
process of acquiring 23 others for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Lands and Water Development Kumbirai Kangai said
here yesterday the government acknowledged the land hunger
problem in the country, but would continue its efforts to acquire
land for resettlement as long as funds permit.
</P>
<P>
He criticized those illegally settling on designated land.
although the government was aware of the land problem, it would
not tolerate people settling themselves haphazardly on state
land.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 squatters have moved onto state land and the
result has been quite adverse with the wanton destruction of the
environment, diseases and crime becoming the order of the day at
such settlements.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the resettlement programme needs to be done
in an orderly fashion and that the people need to be assessed to
determine their potential to succeed in agriculture before land
is allocated to them.
</P>
<P>
So far 60,000 families have been resettled while nearly 80,000 are
still waiting to be allocated land.

<HEADLINE> China Issues White Paper on Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the State
Council here today issued a white paper entitled "Environmental
Protection in China."
</P>
<P>
In the 20,000-word white paper, the office gave a detailed
account on the country's choice of implementing a sustainable
development strategy, improving the legal and administrative systems
on environmental protection step by step, the prevention and
control of industrial pollution and comprehensive improvement of
the urban environment, national land improvement and rural environmental
protection, protection of the ecological environment and
biodiversity, environmental science and technology and
enironmental publicity and education, and promoting international
cooperation in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The office said that China is a developing country and is
confronted with the dual task of developing the economy and
protecting the environment. Proceeding from its national
conditions, China has, in the process of promoting its overall
modernization program, made environmental protection one of its
basic national policies, regarded the realization of sustainable
development as an important strategy and carried out throughout
the country large-scale pollution prevention and control as well
as ecological environment protection.
</P>
<P>
Over the 18 years since the start of reform and opening up to
the outside world, China's gross national product (GNP) has
achieved a sustained annual growth of around 10 percent, while its
environmental quality has basically steered clear of the outcome
of corresponding deterioration. Practice has proved that the
principle China has adopted to achieve coordinated development
between the economy, the society and the environment has been
effective, the office said.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the international community, China, while making
great efforts to protect its own environment, has taken an active
part in international environmental affairs, striven to promote
international cooperation in the field of environmental
protection, and earnestly fulfilled its international
obligations. All these have fully shown the sincerity and
determination of the Chinese government and people to protect the
global environment, the office said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China said in a white paper today
that its environment has basically steered clear of deterioration
with the fact that its gross national product (GNP) has been
growing by around 10 percent annually over the past 18 years of
reforms and opening up.
</P>
<P>
The white paper on Environmental Protection in China, issued
here today by the Information Office of the State Council, said
that the principle China has adopted to achieve coordinated
economic, social and environmental development has been proved to
be effective.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has paid great attention to
environmental issues arising from the country's population growth
and economic development, and has made environmental protection an
important aspect of the improvement of the people's living
standards and quality of life, the some 20,000-word white paper
said.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote coordinated development between the
economy, the society and the environment, China enacted and
implemented a series of principles, policies, laws and measures
for environmental protection in the 1980s, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of
China" is the cardinal law for environmental protection in China,
the white paper said. The law has established the basic principle
for coordinated development between economic construction, social
progress and environmental protection, and defined the rights and
duties of governments at all levels, all units and individuals as
regards environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
China has enacted and promulgated many special laws on
environmental protection as well as laws on natural resources
related to environmental protection, it said.

The Chinese government has also enacted more than 30
administrative decrees regarding environmental protection. In
addition, departments concerned have also issued a number of
administrative rules and decrees on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
To implement the state environmental protection laws and
regulations, local people's congresses and people's governments,
proceeding from specific conditions in their own respective areas,
have enacted and promulgated more than 600 local laws on
environmental protection, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China had promulgated state environmental
standards on 364 items. As stipulated in Chinese law, the
environmental quality standards and pollutant discharge standards
are compulsory standards, and those who violate these compulsory
environmental standards must bear the corresponding legal
responsibility, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the Chinese government regards
prevention and control of industrial pollution as the focal point
of environmental protection. Thanks to the unremitting efforts
over the past 20-odd years, China has made great progress in this
regard.

In 1995 the waste water treatment rate of the industrial
enterprises at and above the county level in China reached 76.8
percent; the smoke and dust removal rate of waste gas from burning
fuel, 88.2 percent; waste gas purification rate from production
processes, 68.9 percent; and the comprehensive utilization rate of
industrial solid waste, 43 percent, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
Output value attained through the comprehensive utilization of
the industrial "three wastes" came to 19 billion yuan, it added.
</P>
<P>
China is a country with coal as its main energy source. Seventy
percent of the smoke and dust in the air and 90 percent of the
sulfur dioxide emission come from burning coal, the white paper
said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the white paper continued, the cities with
concentrated industries and their population suffer from serious
air pollution. Acid rain has occurred, and the situation has gone
from bad to worse in some regions and cities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has adopted measures such as developing
clean coal technology and clean burning technology, and collecting
sulfur dioxide emission fees, to control acid rain, the white
paper said.
</P>
<P>
A long-term study by Chinese experts on the issue of acid rain
proves that the precursors of acid rain generated from the
emission source in China's inland areas are mainly spread within
Chinese territory, mainly in the areas south of the Yangtze River
and in regions east of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and in the
Sichuan Basin, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
At present, 68.4 percent of urban residents in China use gas
for fuel and heating; the centralized disposal rate of urban
sewage is 20 percent; the innocuity rate of urban garbage and
fecal disposal is 45.4 percent; and the afforestation rate is 23.8
percent, the white paper said.

National land improvement is part of China's work in
implementing the sustainable development strategy. Since the start
of the reform and opening up to the outside world, the Chinese
government has carried out national land improvement on a large
scale, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
Notable successes have been attained in harnessing major
rivers and lakes. Since the foundation of New China in 1949, the
Chinese government has taken comprehensive measures to develop and
harness the major rivers and lakes, with emphasis on the
prevention and control of flood and water-logging, as an important
task of the construction of water conservation facilities.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), the main
dikes were heightened and reinforced, waterways were cleaned up,
and flood diversion projects were built on the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River, the lower reaches of the Yellow
River, and other major rivers and lakes, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
The construction of a group of key projects for water control
and other uses were completed or started. To compensate for lack
of water resources in northern areas, the Chinese government
vigorously promoted the planning and construction of
water-diversion projects between different drainage basins, it
added.
</P>
<P>
In November 1995, it sponsored an overall feasibility study of
the middle, eastern and western lines projects for diverting water
from south to north.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project is a gigantic, trans-century project
for harnessing and developing the Yangtze River. When it is
completed, floods on the upper reaches will be effectively
controlled and areas on the middle and lower reaches of the river
will be able to improve their anti-flood capability, thus
lessening the harmful effects on the ecological
environment. Hydroelectricity, which will be the energy discharged
by the project, causes much less pollution than coal-burning power
plants, the white paper said, adding that the Chinese government
will adopt a sequence of measures to minimize the unfavorable
effects on the ecology and the environment that could be caused by
the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
China has traditionally been an agricultural country. In
developing agricultural production, the Chinese government
attaches great importance to rural environmental protection, and
has taken the development of eco-agriculture as an important means
to realize the coordinated development of the environment and the
economy, the white paper said.

At present, the 50 counties designated by the state for
eco-agricultural experiment are playing a good and exemplary role
in the country, spurring development of eco-agriculture in 10
prefectures and over 100 counties, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the total grain output in the
experimental counties has increased by 15 percent, output per mu
by more than 10 percent, and the income per capita is 12 percent
higher than the average level of the surrounding areas, the white
paper said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, work has started in an all-round way to
construct some 100 ecological demonstration areas, mainly at the
county level, in order to promote regional sustainable
development, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government regards ecological environmental
protection as the focal point of its environmental protection
work. Through protracted efforts, China has made great
achievements in the protection and construction of the ecological
environment, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, the Chinese government has organized
large-scale tree planting activities and stepped up efforts for
the fostering, protection and management of forest resources and
consequently has made great progress in rational utilization of
forest resources.

Currently, China's forest area totals 134 million hectares,
which brings the country's forest coverage to 13.92 percent.
Artificial afforestation covers 33.79 million hectares. Volunteers
have contributed a total of 4.4 billion person-times to planting
23 billion trees. Once-barren mountains suitable for tree planting
in 12 provinces and autonomous regions are now clothed with
greenery.
</P>
<P>
There are 612 national-level rare and endangered species of
flora and fauna listed as key protection species, including 258
species of wild animals and 354 species of plants.
</P>
<P>
Artificial reproduction has been successfully implemented for
more than 60 species of rare and endangered wild animals, and
through propagation, such species as David's deer, wild horse and
saiga tatarica have been re-introduced.
</P>
<P>
Establishing nature reserves is the most effective method for
the in situ conservation of wild plants and animals. By the end of
1995, 799 nature reserves of rather diversified types, covering a
total area of 71.85 million hectares, or 7.19 percent of China's
territory, had been established in China.
</P>
<P>
There are 99 national-level reserves, of which ten -- Jilin's
Changbai Mountains, Sichuan's Wolong, Guizhou's Fanjing Mountains,
Hubei's Shennongjia, Fujian's Wuyi Mountains, Xinjiang's
Mt. Bogda, Guangdong's Dinghu Mountains, Inner Mongolia's
Xilingol, Jiangsu's Yancheng and Yunnan's Xishuangbanna -- have
been listed in the International Network of Men and Biosphere
Reserves.
</P>
<P>
Another six nature reserves -- Zhalong in Heilongjiang,
Xianghai in Jilin, Boyang Lake in Jiangxi, East Dongting Lake in

Cultural Organization, it added.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 China had set up 175 zoological gardens and
zoological exhibition sites in public parks, 227 artificial
breeding centers for wild animals, more than 60 large botanical
gardens and 255 wild plant gene and cell banks to ensure the
continuation of rare and endangered species of plants and animals,
including the giant panda, Chinese alligator, Chinese sturgeon,
white-flag dolphin, Manchurian tiger, crested ibis, Cathay silver
fir, dovetree, Cycas revoluta and camellia chrysantha tuyama, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The medicinal use of and trade in rhinoceros horn and tiger bone
are strictly prohibited by the government, and the illegal hunting
of rare wild animals is severely punished by law, the white paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that since the 1980s large-scale publicity
activities have been organized all over the country every year on
World Environment Day, Tree Planting Day, Love the Birds Week, etc.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the media's "China Trans-century Environmental
Protection Inspection Campaign," centered on news about
environmental law enforcement, has aroused a nationwide response
and accelerated the solution to a number of major environmental
problems, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
China holds that economic development should be coordinated
with environmental protection; protection of the environment is a
common task for mankind, but the economically developed countries
should take more responsibility in this respect; the
strengthening of international cooperation should be based on
respecting national sovereignty; the protection of the environment
and the spurring of development can not be done without peace and
stability in the world; and both practical interests of various
countries and long-term interests of the world should be
considered in handling environmental problems, the white paper
said.

<P>
China always conscientiously carries out its responsibilities
for international environmental conventions and agreements which
it has signed, approved or joined, the white paper added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government clearly knows that waste of resources
and environmental pollution in the country are quite serious
because China is in the development stage of rapidly promoting
industrialization and still practices the extensive production and
management methods, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
Along with population increase and economic development, this
problem will become more prominent, the white paper said. It is
still a long-term and arduous task to solve the environmental
problems left over by history and control the environmental
problems that appear in the process of development.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), the Chinese
government will put into effect a series of important
environmental protection measures, including the "China
Trans-century Green Project," and realize the objectives of the
struggle for environmental protection as put forward in the "Ninth
Five-Year Plan of the People's Republic of China for National
Economic and Social Development and the Long-Term Objectives to
the Year 2010," the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
China will do its utmost to bring the aggravating tendency in
environmental pollution and ecological destruction basically under
control and improve the environmental quality of cities and
regions, the white paper said.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection in China (2) I. The Choice of Implementing a Sustainable Development Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's modernization drive has been launched in the following
conditions: The country has a large population base, its per
capita average of natural resources is low, and its economic
development as well as scientific and technological level remain
comparatively backward. Along with the growth of China's
population, the development of the economy and the continuous
improvement of the people's consumption level since the 1970s, the
pressure on resources, which have been in short supply,
and on the fragile environment has become greater and
greater. Which road of development to choose has turned out,
historically, to be an issue of paramount importance to the
survival of the Chinese people and their descendants.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has paid great attention to the
environmental issues arising from the country's population growth
and economic development, and has made protecting the environment
an important aspect of the improvement of the people's living
standards and quality of life. In order to promote coordinated
development between the economy, the society and the environment,
China enacted and implemented a series of principles, policies,
laws and measures for environmental protection in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
-- Making environmental protection one of China's basic
national policies. The prevention and control of environmental
pollution and ecological destruction and the rational exploitation
and utilization of natural resources have a vital bearing on the
country's overall interests and long-term development. The Chinese
government is unswervingly carrying out the basic national policy
of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
-- Formulating the guiding principles of simultaneous planning,
simultaneous implementation and simultaneous development for
economic construction, urban and rural construction and
environmental construction, and combining the economic returns
with social effects and environmental benefits; and carrying out
the three major policies of "prevention first and combining
prevention with control," "making the polluter responsible for
treating the pollution" and "intensifying environmental
management."
</P>
<P>
-- Promulgating and putting into effect laws and regulations
regarding environmental protection and placing environmental
protection on a legal footing, continuously improving the statutes
concerning the environment, formulating strict law-enforcement
procedures and increasing the intensity of law enforcement so as
to ensure the effective implementation of the environmental laws
and regulations.
</P>
<P>
-- Persisting in incorporating environmental protection into
the plans for national economic and social development,
introducing to it macro regulation and management under state
guidance, and gradually increasing environmental protection input
so as to give simultaneous consideration to environmental
protection and other undertakings and ensure their coordinated
development.

<P>
-- Establishing and improving environmental protection
organizations under governments at all levels, forming a rather
complete environmental administrative system, and bringing into
full play the governments' role in environmental supervision and
administration.
</P>
<P>
-- Accelerating progress in environmental science and
technology. Strengthening research in basic theories, organizing
efforts to tackle key scientific and technological problems,
developing and popularizing practical technology for environmental
pollution prevention and control, fostering the growth of
environmental protection industries, and having set up an initial
scientific research system for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
-- Carrying out environmental publicity and education to
enhance the whole nation's awareness of the environment. Widely
conducting environmental publicity work, gradually popularizing
environmental education in primary and middle schools,
developing on-the-job education in environmental protection and
vocational education, and training specialized personnel in
environmental science and technology as well as environmental
administration.
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting international cooperation in the field of
environmental protection. Actively expanding exchanges and
cooperation concerning the environment and development with other
countries and international organizations, earnestly implementing
international environmental conventions, and seeking scope for
China's role in global environmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s the international community
and various countries have made an important step forward in
exploring solutions to problems of the environment and
development. The United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development, held in June 1992, made sustainable development the
strategy for common development in the future, and this won wide
acclaim from the governments of all countries represented at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
In August 1992, shortly after that conference, the Chinese
government put forward ten major measures China was to adopt to
enhance its environment and development, clearly pointing out that
the road of sustainable development was a logical choice for China
now and in the future.
</P>
<P>
In March 1994 the Chinese government approved and promulgated
"China's Agenda 21 -- the White Paper on China's Population,
Environment, and Development in the 21st Century." This document,
proceeding from the country's specific national conditions in
these three respects, put forward China's overall strategy,
measures and program of action for sustainable
development. Relevant departments and localities also worked out
their respective plans of action to implement the strategy for
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
At its Fourth Session in March 1996, China's Eighth National
People's Congress examined and adopted "the Ninth Five-Year Plan
of the People's Republic of China for National Economic and Social
Development and the Long-Term Objectives to the Year 2010." Both
the Plan and Objectives take sustainable development as an
important strategy for the modernization drive, thus making it
possible for the implementation of the strategy of sustainable
development in the course of China's economic construction and
social development.

BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of the
white paper entitled "Environmental Protection in China" issued by
the Information Office of the State Council here today:
</P>
<P>
Foreword
</P>
<P>
China is a developing country and now it is confronted with the
dual task of developing the economy and protecting the
environment. Proceeding from its national conditions, China has,
in the process of promoting its overall modernization program,
made environmental protection one of its basic national policies,
regarded the realization of sustainable development as an
important strategy and carried out throughout the country
large-scale pollution prevention and control as well as ecological
environment protection. Over the 18 years since the start of
reform and opening up to the outside world, China's gross national
product (GNP) has achieved a sustained annual growth of around 10
percent, while its environmental quality has basically steered
clear of the outcome of corresponding deterioration. Practice has
proved that the principle China has adopted to achieve
coordinated development between the economy, the society and the
environment has been effective.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the international community, China, while making
great efforts to protect its own environment, has taken an active
part in international environmental affairs, striven to promote
international cooperation in the field of environmental
protection, and earnestly fulfilled its international
obligations. All these have fully shown the sincerity and
determination of the Chinese government and people to protect the
global environment.
</P>
<P>
What efforts has China made to protect its own environment?
What is the situation of environmental protection in China? On the
occasion of the annual World Environment Day, which falls on June
5, here is an account.

<P>
II. Improving the Legal and Administrative Systems Step by Step
</P>
<P>
China pays great attention to environmental legislative work
and has now established an environmental statutory framework that
takes the "Constitution of the People's Republic of China" as the
foundation and the "Environmental Protection Law of the People's
Republic of China" as the principal part.
</P>
<P>
"The Constitution of the People's Republic of China"
stipulates: "The state protects and improves the living
environment and the ecological environment, and prevents and
remedies pollution and other public hazards," and "The state
ensures the rational use of natural resources and protects rare
animals and plants. The appropriation or damage of natural
resources by any organization or individual by whatever means is
prohibited."
</P>
<P>
"The Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of
China" is the cardinal law for environmental protection in China.
The law has established the basic principle for coordinated
development between economic construction, social progress and
environmental protection, and defined the rights and duties of
governments at all levels, all units and individuals as regards
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
China has enacted and promulgated many special laws on
environmental protection as well as laws on natural resources
related to environmental protection. They include: the Law on the
Prevention and Control of Water Pollution, the Law on the
Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, the Law on the Prevention
and Control of Environmental Pollution by Solid Wastes, the Marine
Environment Protection Law, the Forestry Law, the Grassland Law,
the Fisheries Law, the Mineral Resources Law, the Land
Administration Law, the Water Resources Law, the Law on the
Protection of Wild Animals, the Law on Water and Soil
Conservation, and the Agriculture Law.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also enacted more than 30
administrative decrees regarding environmental protection,
including the Regulations for the Prevention and Control of Noise
Pollution, Regulations on Nature Reserves, Regulations on the
Prevention of and Protection Against Radiation from Radio Isotopes
and Radioactive Device, Regulations on the Safe Administration of
Chemicals and Other Dangerous Materials, Provisional Regulations
on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution in the Huaihe
River Drainage Area, Regulations Governing Environmental
Protection Administration in Offshore Oil Exploration and
Development, Regulations on the Control of Marine Wastes Dumping,
Regulations for the Implementation of the Protection of
Terrestrial Wildlife, Provisional Regulations on the
Administration of National Parks, Regulations on the Protection of
Basic Farmland, and Regulations on Urban Afforestation. In
addition, departments concerned have also issued a number of
administrative rules and decrees on environmental protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
To implement the state environmental protection laws and
regulations, local people's congresses and people's governments,
proceeding from their respective specific conditions, have enacted
and promulgated more than 600 local laws on environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
Environmental standards are an important component of China's
environmental legal system. They include environmental quality
standards, pollutant discharge or emission standards, basic
environmental criteria, criteria for samples, and criteria for
methodology. The environmental quality standards and pollutant
discharge or emission standards are divided into state standards
and local standards. By the end of 1995, China had promulgated
state environmental standards on 364 items. As stipulated in
Chinese laws, the environmental quality standards and pollutant
discharge or emission standards are compulsory standards, and
those who violate these compulsory environmental standards must
bear the corresponding legal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
In the process of setting up and improving the environmental
legal system, China attaches equal importance to environmental law
enforcement and environmental legislation. For four consecutive
years, China has conducted nationwide checks on the enforcement
of environmental laws to seriously deal with acts of polluting and
damaging the environment and severely punish environmental law
violations. China pays great attention to supervision exercised by
the people and media over law violations regarding the
environment, and it has opened channels for the people to report
on environmental problems and has adopted measures for the news
media to expose environmental law-breaking activities.
</P>
<P>
It should be pointed out that the building of China's
environmental legal system needs to be further improved. For
instance, some areas still remain uncovered by law, the contents
of some laws are yet to be increased or revised and there are
still the cases of not fully observing or enforcing
laws. Therefore, it remains an important strategic task to
continue efforts to intensify the building of the environmental
legal system.
</P>
<P>
China attaches equal importance to the establishment of an
environmental administrative system and it has established a
system in which the National People's Congress enacts the laws and
supervises their enforcement, governments at different levels take
the responsibility for the enforcement of laws, the administrative
departments in charge of environmental protection exercise overall
supervision and administration, and the various departments
concerned exercise supervision and administration according to the
laws.

<P>
The National People's Congress has established an Environment
and Resources Protection Committee, whose work is to organize the
formulation and examination of draft laws on environmental and
resources protection and prepare the necessary reports, exercise
the supervision over the enforcement of laws governing
environmental and resources protection, put forward motions
related to the issue of environmental and resources protection,
and conduct exchanges with parliaments in other countries in the
field of environmental and resources protection. The people's
congresses of some provinces and cities have also established
corresponding environmental and resources protection institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Committee under the State Council
is made up of leaders of various related ministries under the
State Council. It is the State Council's discussion and
coordination agency for environmental protection work. Its major
tasks are: studying and examining the principles, policies and
measures related to coordinated development of the country's
economy and environmental protection, giving guidance to and
coordinating efforts in tackling major environmental problems,
exercising supervision over and conducting checks on the
implementation of the environmental protection laws and
regulations by various localities and departments, and promoting
the development of environmental protection undertakings
throughout the country. The people's governments at the
provincial, city and county levels have also established
corresponding environmental protection committees.
</P>
<P>
The National Environmental Protection Agency is the competent
environmental protection administration agency under the State
Council, whose task is to exercise overall supervision and
administration over the country's environmental protection
work. The people's governments at the provincial, city and county
levels have also successively established environmental protection
administration departments to carry out overall supervision and
administration of the environmental protection work in their
respective localities. At present, China has more than 2,500
environmental protection administration departments at and above
the county level, employing a total of 88,000 people for
environmental administration, monitoring, inspection and control,
statistics work, scientific research, publicity and education.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection institutions have also been
established in comprehensive departments, resources administration
departments and industrial departments under governments at
various levels to take charge of related environmental and
resources protection work. Most of China's large and medium-sized
enterprises have also set up environmental protection agencies
responsible for their own pollution prevention and control and the
promotion of cleaner production. At present, various departments
and enterprises employ more than 200,000 people for all kinds of
environmental protection work.

<HEADLINE> Russian Prime Minister Meets Zhirinovsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian prime minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin today met with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the
Liberal Democratic Party, in the prime minister's office and the
two discussed the present domestic social and political situation.
</P>
<P>
A press secretary for the prime minister was quoted as saying
that today's meeting is one between the prime minister and a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Another development is that Russian Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov, President Boris Yeltsin's top rival, today also met with
Zhirinovsky, who has been running hard for presidency. Zyuganov
appealed to nationalists to help defeat Yeltsin in the elections
on June 16.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll for Moscow NTV Television showed Sunday that
Yeltsin has widened his lead over Zyuganov by three percent from
last week, while Zhirinovsky trailed far behind the two of them.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov and Zhirinovsky agreed at the meeting that the
first-ever presidential election in Russia should proceed
peacefully, the Interfax news agency quoted Zhirinovsky's
spokesman Viktor Filatov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"A common viewpoint was worked out at the meeting, that the
elections must definitely take place, and must go ahead against a
peaceful and calm background guaranteed by the current
authorities," said Filatov.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is that there is mutual understanding, there
are points of convergence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Filatov denied that the two rivals of Yeltsin had discussed
details of any possible power shareout after the election less
than two weeks away.
</P>
<P>
Support for Yeltsin rose to 35 percent while Zyuganov trailed
with 24 percent and Zhirinovsky only five percent of the vote,
according to the latest NTV Television poll.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was at 27.7 percent in mid-May and Zyuganov at 19.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen percent of the Russian electorate were still
undecided.
</P>
<P>
No candidate is expected to win the June 16 elections outright
and the top two would therefore face each other in a second round
runoff poll on July 7.

<HEADLINE> Canada Launches Massive Oilsands Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien today launched massive multi-billion-dollar oilsands
projects in the western province of Albert.
</P>
<P>
More than 4.1 billion U.S. dollars of investment in the
oilsands projects was announced today at the northern Albertan
city of Fort McMurray, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)
Television reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
This investment will create some 10,000 new jobs for Canadians
in the next few years, the CBC said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, executives from 18 Canadian oil companies also
committed themselves to as much as 18.5 billion dollars of
investment over a 25-year period by signing the "Declaration of
Opportunity" to develop the Albert oilsands.
</P>
<P>
The Albert oilsands contain as much oil as Saudi Arabia. The
total oil reserve there is estimated to be 1.7 trillion barrels,
and the amount of oil recoverable with current technology to be at
300 billion barrels, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The only problem with oilsands is that it is mixed with sands,
and it has taken 30 years of research to profitably get the oil
out.
</P>
<P>
As conventional oil sources dry out, the oilsands are emerging
as the major new supplier of Canadian oil.
</P>
<P>
Federal and provincial changes in royalty and tax structures
are the major forces behind this massive private investment, the
CBC said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: France Succeeds in NATO Reform Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- NATO's agreement today to set up a
European component of the U.S.-dominated military alliance is
being hailed here as a success for France in its fight for a role
for itself, and for greater power for Europe, within the
organization.
</P>
<P>
In historic changes to European defense structure, the European
wing of NATO will be given more independence and be able to launch
its own peacekeeping or relief missions using borrowed
U.S. military hardware such as intelligence, communications and
airlift equipment.
</P>
<P>
The plan will also give European nations more flexibility and
resources to deal with regional crises in Europe by allowing the
Western European Union, the 10-nation European defense
organization, to run operations using American military assets but
without involving U.S. ground forces.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. will still have power to veto missions and
use of its hardware through NATO's policy-making body, the North
Atlantic Council, which will have to authorize any operation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the NATO
agreement, widely seen as a major step towards the building of a
European defense pillar, will shift more responsibility onto
Europe and is in the interests of European countries, notably
France.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette hailed the agreement
as a great success, saying it is the first time in the the history
of the 47-year-old alliance that Europe's role has been made clear.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in alliance history, Europe will really be
able to express its personality," he said.
</P>
<P>
De Charette added that France was now ready to play a full role
in a revamped NATO.
</P>
<P>
France has been bargaining its return to NATO's integrated
military command structure after 30 years of boycott in exchange
for NATO reform toward a more European military wing.
</P>
<P>
As part of its bid and move closer to the trans-Atlantic
alliance, France decided last year that its defense minister and
armed forces chief of staff could attend NATO meetings.
</P>
<P>
France's recent rapprochement with NATO, including its active
participation in NATO's Peace Implementation Force (IFOR) in
Bosnia, helped pave the way for this new agreement to set up a
European combined joint task force (CJTF).
</P>
<P>
The principle of the CJTF was first proposed in January 1994 by
the U.S. at the NATO summit in Brussels, aimed at shifting more of
the alliance's responsibilities to Europe and allowing more
flexibility in military operations.
</P>
<P>
But the plan stalled over differences between Washington and
Paris over the role and influence of the U.S. over NATO staff,
equipment and headquarters. The ensuing wrangle between the
U.S. and Europe, led by France, was eased by the French
rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
But analysts say France still has a long way to go to create a
clear European identity as the U.S. is reluctant to relinquish its
direct control over NATO's military firepower.
</P>
<P>
Under this new agreement, the U.S. still preserves the ultimate
power to use U.S. forces, and the power to supervise and veto any
NATO operations.
</P>
<P>
And although the Europeans could act on their own, a
U.S. official said he expected those operations would be "smaller
scale missions" and "very few and far between".
</P>
<P>
A U.S. representative to the Berlin meeting also said Europe
does not have the capacity to handle regional crises without the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Accidents Cost Canada Seven Billion Dollars Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Workplaces accidents have cost
Canada a total of 7.3 billion U.S. dollars in direct and indirect
losses every year.
</P>
<P>
Two Canadians are killed each day in a workplace accident, and
one out of every 15 Canadian workers can expect to be injured on
the job.
</P>
<P>
"These personal and economic costs can only be eliminated
through effective accidents prevention," Canadian Labor Minister
Alfonso Gagliano said, adding that prevention requires constant
awareness and active participation of employers and workers
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
The minister made these remarks at a press conference here in
opening Canadian Occupational Safety and Health (COSH) Week, which
starts today.
</P>
<P>
"Governments (at all levels) must continue to improve
legislation on occupational safety and health, and interested
organizations must continue working to strengthen Canadian
awareness of the need for accident prevention measures," Gagliano
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the key to eliminating all accidents is the constant
personal commitment of every employer and worker, the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
The COSH week, the tenth this year, is designed to remind all
Canadians that accidents prevention in the workplaces is
everyone's business.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Reinforces Troops Guarding Rail Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Additional government troops are
being dispatched today to the northwestern province of Battambang
to protect a major rail line linking the capital city and
Battambang, a local newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The Rasmei Kampuchea daily reported that royal soldiers from
the fifth military district will help local militiamen protect the
line running from the Pursat border northwest through Mong Russei
district.
</P>
<P>
Khmer Rouge guerrillas regularly use dynamite, landmines, and
home-made explosives to cut the major transport line, it said.
</P>
<P>
A project which began on May 20 to rehabilitate the line has

Paris, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A home-made bomb, termed by the
police as a "very crude" device, exploded under a car in Paris'
Left Bank area today, causing minor damage but no casualties.
</P>
<P>
Police said anti-terrorist experts are investigating the
incident, but there was no immediate indication it was connected
to a wave of bomb attacks that rocked France last summer.
</P>
<P>
The previous bomb attacks were blamed on Algerian Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
Police said the latest bomb was manufactured from a pressure
cooker packed with an undisclosed substance and placed under a
vehicle in Linne Street in Paris' 5th district.
</P>
<P>
It exploded before dawn, destroying the car and shattering the
windows of nearby buildings. The owner of the vehicle, a woman

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- American Automobile
Manufacturers Association today asked South Korea to open its
protected car market to foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Card, President of the association, said passenger car
imports to South Korea from the U.S. and other countries account
for less than 0.4 percent of the country's total vehicle sales.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted in a statement, South Korea is one of the
world's major auto producers and is aggressively expanding its
operations in emerging markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"If South Korea aspires to be a recognized and respected member
of the world trading community," he warned, "it must follow
through on opening its market to free trade in automobiles."
</P>
<P>
The statement followed a progress report by the U.S. Trade
Representative, in which the U.S. government said that South Korea
has taken some initial steps to allow access to its car market.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Names National Assembly Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Young-sam
nominated Kim Soo-han of the ruling New Korea Party (NKP) as
National Assembly speaker today.
</P>
<P>
President Kim, who heads the ruling party, also named Oh
Se-eung vice National Assembly speaker, NKP spokesman Kim Chul
announced here.
</P>
<P>
The house speaker-nominee Kim, 68, has been elected to the
National Assembly six times and had served as spokesman and senior
member of opposition parties before joining the ruling party in
1990. He was elected a parliament lawmaker on the ruling party's
national representation ticket in the general elections last April.
</P>
<P>
Vice speaker-nominee Oh, 63, is a seven-term legislator and
formerly served as state minister for political affairs and
Chairman of the National Assembly Culture-Information committee.
</P>
<P>
The ruling NKP plans to convene a special parliamentary session
tomorrow to approve the nomination of speaker and vice speaker of
the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
However, the main opposition National Congress for New Politics
(NCNP) headed by Kim Dae-jung and the conservative opposition
United Liberal Democrats (ULD) led by Kim Jong-pil are still
threatening to boycott the house session in protest of the
government and the ruling party's recruitment of opposition and
independent lawmakers-elect to secure a majority in the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11, the ruling NKP won 139 seats, 11 short of a simple
majority in the 299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
But, the NKP later lured into its fold 12 lawmakers-elect,
mostly independents, to secure 151 seats.

MEXICO CITY, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government is to
maintain its year-old anti-dumping tariff on rolled steel imported

The Commerce and Industrial Promotion Ministry has now ratified

<HEADLINE> Former Leader to Return to Nepal's Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A former leader of the Nepali
Congress (NC), the country's main ruling party, will rejoin the
party's leadership after nearly two years' absence.
</P>
<P>
NC General Secretary Taranath Ranabhat disclosed Monday in
Pokhara of Western Nepal that Ganesh Man Singh, co-founder of the
NC party, had agreed to join the party again, reports reaching
here today said.
</P>
<P>
The NC leader said the newly-elected NC President, Girija
Prasad Koirala, resolved to bring the party to its former state of
unity and to strength, referring to the NC's majority control in
the parliament before the 1994 mid-term election.
</P>
<P>
Singh, who founded the NC with two others 49 years ago, quit
the party in 1994 when the then prime minister Koirala announced
to dissolve the parliament and call for the mid-term polls.
</P>
<P>
Koirala resorted to the mid-term election due to the
intra-party differences over his government policy program which
was rejected by the Lower House, where his NC party held a
majority.
</P>
<P>
Dissidents in the NC requested him to resign from the post of
prime minister after the defeat of his program.
</P>
<P>
However, the NC lost its majority in the November 1994 mid-term
election and became the second largest party in the parliament
after the Communist Party of Nepal (UML), which later led a
nine-month-long minority government.
</P>
<P>
The present coalition government was formed last September by
the NC and two small parties after they jointly toppled the UML
government through a no-confidence vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
Ganesh Man Singh started his political career in 1940 when
Nepal was under the rule of the Rana regime.
</P>
<P>
He was elected NC's life-long supreme leader in 1982 after the
death of the renowned NC leader B.P. Koirala and led the 1990
people's movement which eventually overthrew the 30-year-long
partyless panchayat system in Nepal.

<HEADLINE> EU Warns Germany of Wide Budget Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
urged Germany to lower its budget deficit to meet conditions for
its switch to an EU-wide single currency system.
</P>
<P>
EU finance ministers placed Germany on a list of nations whose
budget deficit has gone beyond 3 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP), according to reports reaching here from Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Bringing deficit down to 3 percent of GDP is the target for
countries aiming to adopt Europe's single currency, known as "the
euro," when it is launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the EU's biggest economy and the main driving force
for establishing the monetary union. But its deficit rose to 3.5
percent last year, when it experienced a sharp economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 EU member countries, only the three smallest ones --
Ireland, Luxembourg and Denmark -- are not on the deficit warning
list.
</P>
<P>
Besides the deficit list, EU ministers meeting in Luxembourg
went on making preparations for the single currency.
</P>
<P>
They drafted plans proposed by Germany to fine those nations
that threaten the financial stability of the currency union by
raising high deficits after they adopt the euro.
</P>
<P>
Despite its own problem meeting the condition, Germany held
that the EU stick to all the criteria for joining the currency
union, including low inflation and public debt, and stable
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
In addition, EU ministers have outlined plans to limit exchange
rate fluctuation between the euro and currencies of those
countries that stay outside the single currency system after
1999.

<HEADLINE> Smaller Australian Wheat Crop Expected Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian wheat crop is
expected to be smaller in 1996-97 than in this year.
</P>
<P>
Wheat harvests are expected to fall slightly to 16.1 million
tons in the coming year from 16.6 million tons in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The current sowing was delayed by persistent dry weather in
southern and western Australia, though positive prospect of wheat
prices was expected to boost planting areas, the Australian Bureau
of Agricultural and Resources Economics (ABARE) announced today.
</P>
<P>
In its first forecast of next year's harvests, ABARE expects
that wheat planting areas will increase 10 percent over the last
season to 10.9 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of current planting intentions being realized and
assuming normal rainfall through to harvest, total wheat
production in Australia in 1996-97 is forecast to be 16.1 million
tons," ABARE announced.
</P>
<P>
ABARE Acting Director Stephen Beare said that depressed prices
for wool and beef had prompted farmers to shift to grain
production.
</P>
<P>
He said that total winter grain planting areas were expected to
increase five percent over the last season to 17.6 million
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Barley planting is expected to rise to 3.3 million hectares,
with production at 5.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Good rains in the northeastern part of the country secure ideal
conditions for local winter crops, while south and west waited for
crucial rainfall in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Rain in the next two weeks will be critical if the full
(Western Australia) area potential is to be realized," the
forecast said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Education Ministry to Lighten Students' Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Education Ministry is
introducing measures to ease students' burden as concern about
students' health rose in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision made by the ministry Monday, the total
weight of bags (including books) for kindergartners will be one
kilogram at most, for Grade 1-6 pupils not over two kilograms, and
for Grade 7-12 students not more than three kilograms.
</P>
<P>
All schools under the Office of the National Primary Education
Commission, the Department of General Education, and the Office of
the Private Education Commission are required to follow the
instruction.
</P>
<P>
Worried about the negative effect of carrying heavy school bags
on the growth system and bone structures of children, the ministry
suggested that students carry only several necessary items to
school in their bags everyday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also required that new school buildings to be
constructed supply lockers for students to keep their belongings
to be used in classes, so they do not have to carry heavy bags
back and forth between home and school.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry required schools to set aside at least
one hour a day for Grade 1-6 students to do homework at school.

<HEADLINE> Germany's GDP Drops for Second Quarter in Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Germany's gross domestic product (GDP)
dropped slightly again in the first quarter this year, making it
qualified for the definition of a recession.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 to 0.5 percent drop, to be announced by the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden on Wednesday, followed a 0.5
percent drop in the last quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Two successive quarters of GDP decline constitutes an economic
recession from the statistical viewpoint, although the government
has refused to admit the current one.
</P>
<P>
The government's denials are based on assurances that economic
growth is going to resume. Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt
said that he expects sustained GDP growth of 2 to 2.5 percent for
the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The government projects an annual growth of 0.75 percent this
year although experts predict the growth will be only 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the October-March recession mainly resulted
from a sudden fall in production and investments in the
construction industry under the severe winter weather conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is seeking at least 5
billion US dollars in financial assistance from the World
Bank-chaired Consultative Group for Indonesia (CGI) this year,
local press quoting a senior official as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Minister for National Development Planning Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said Monday in Surabaya, the second largest city in
the country, that the government requested Japan in particular not
to reduce its commitment during the donor group's meeting in Paris
on June 18-20.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia asked Japan to increase its loan commitment
in yen so that the value of the Japanese loan would not decline in
terms of the dollar.

The US dollar has appreciated by about 20 percent against the
Japanese yen to approximately 105 yen to the dollar from 87 yen in
June last year.
</P>
<P>
"The appreciation of the US dollar against the yen will be one
of the important subjects to be raised in the coming CGI meeting,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said recently that it would recommend to the CGI
that it provide at least the same amount as last year at their
coming meeting.
</P>
<P>
CGI creditors provided 5.36 billion US dollars in financial aid
to Indonesia last year.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the single largest creditor, pledged 187.6 billion yen
(2.14 billion US dollars at the rate of 87.5 yen per dollar) last
year.
</P>
<P>
The CGI, set up in 1992 to replace the inter-governmental group

<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The 26th General Assembly of
the Organization of American States (OAS) opened here today with a
call for the eradication of poverty and promotion of free trade in
this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade integration is one of the pillars on which
the new vision of the Americans is built, OAS Secretary General
Cesar Gaviria said in his speech.
</P>
<P>
"We need to exert our efforts to work for a great undertaking
that will bring us closer to being an America united by a common
effort," the former Colombian president added.
</P>
<P>
Trade among regional blocs has intensified, said Gaviria,
citing the trade between the United States and Latin America and
the Caribbean, which has increased 72 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Canada, for its part, increased its exports to Latin America
and the Caribbean by 30 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a clear course for hemispherical economic
integration has been approved by trade ministers of the region.
</P>
<P>
In order to attain the goal of building "a free trade zone by
2005, we need to understand integration as a political project
that is of concern to all."
</P>
<P>
The OAS general assembly, to be closed on June 7, was attended
by foreign ministers and other officials of the organization's 35
member countries.

<HEADLINE> Bankruptcy Cases on Rise in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Personal and business bankruptcy cases
in Germany amounted to 7,555 in the first quarter of this year in
what seemed to be a ongoing economic downturn trend.
</P>
<P>
The total number of bankruptcies, according to a Federal
Statistics Office report from Wiesbaden today, represented an 8.8
percent rise over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, creditor claims totaled 11 billion German marks,
or 7.22 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 29,000 businesses became insolvent in 1995, and about
32,000 are expected to follow in 1996, making it the 5th year in a
row that bankruptcy cases have been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The hardest hit has been eastern Germany, where 1,746
bankruptcies were reported in the first three months of the year,
a 38 percent increase over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the west, meanwhile, bankruptcy cases rose 6.6 percent to a
total of 4,344 cases.
</P>
<P>
Germany's economy is estimated to have contracted for the
second straight quarter in the first three months of 1996, with
severe winter weather depressing construction, which had been a
key part of the eastern German growth.

<HEADLINE> France to Cut Tax: Juppe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
today announced that his government will adopt a five-year tax
cutting plan, in a bid to ease tax pressure on companies and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Juppe told a press conference that the plan to be put into
effect at the start of 1997 will bring changes to the present
system of income brackets and eliminate disincentives to
investment.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister did not give full details, saying that
the project will be presented to the National Assembly and be
unveiled alongside the 1997 budget in September.
</P>
<P>
Since assuming office one year ago, Juppe's government, which
had pledged in the election campaign to ease tax pressure, has
raised taxes on several occasions in an effort to reduce the
social security deficit and narrow a growing budget gap.
</P>
<P>
The government's actions have triggered public discontent and
protest, which had led to three-week-long nation-wide strikes in
last December.
</P>
<P>
The tax cutting plan, aiming to spur consumption and at the
same time reduce the budget deficit, will lower "the overall scale
of income tax" over the next five years, said Juppe.
</P>
<P>
In other measures, he said, professional taxes will be reformed
with an aim to reduce the impact on new investors, and the special
levies imposed since the start of this year in a bid to cut
France's massive deficits will be phased out.
</P>
<P>
But the socialist opposition said the pledge to cut taxes is
intended to help the government win the 1998 legislative elections
and accused it of favoring those in the higher income brackets.
</P>
<P>
France is one of the countries having the highest tax rates in
the world, with the annual tax revenues in the government's 1996
budget totaling 1,400 billion francs (about 280 billion U.S.
dollars), an increase of 7.6 percent from the 1,300 billion francs
(260 billion dollars) in 1995.

RIO DE JANEIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Itaipu
hydroelectric power plant, the largest in the world, today began
operating in full swing to meet the increasing demand in the south

<P>
BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai exports to Germany posted 2.1
billion U.S. dollars in value last year, down 4.1 percent compared
with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to data from the German-Thai Chamber of Commerce, the
decline was attributed to a drop in Thailand's exports of
textiles, jewelry and food products.
</P>
<P>
However, Thai imports from the west European country rose to
3.6 billion dollars, up 19.5 percent from that of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The highest increase in imports was in machines and tools, up
45.9 percent. Imports of metals, bars, sheets, tubes and alloys
grew by 32 percent, while paper and board imports increased 26.7
percent and cosmetics 25.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Thailand's most important trading partner in Europe
and the fourth largest trading partner in the world. The chamber
expects Thailand's demand for German products and technological
know-how to continue to rise.

<P>
BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's rice exports rose to
520,000 tons in May, 70,000 tons more than the planned target.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Commerce Ministry, increasing
demand boosted the exports last month, despite the impact of heavy
rain on crops.
</P>
<P>
The increase in May swelled the total exports of rice in the
first five months of this year to 2.4 million tons, 15.4 percent
above the target.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the five months earned 21.42 billion baht (857
million U.S. dollars), compared with 20.06 billion baht (802
million U.S. dollars) from the sales abroad of 2.8 million tons in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the trend might continue although fiercer
competition was expected owing to increased supplies.

<HEADLINE> Albania's Ruling Democrats Show Strong in Runoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Albania's ruling Democratic party
further widened its parliamentary majority today in the second
round of the general election, taking six out of nine seats
undecided after last week's first round.
</P>
<P>
But the six main opposition parties refused to take part in the
runoffs, continuing their boycott launched midway through the
first round when they accused the governing Democrats of vote
rigging.
</P>
<P>
The conservative Democrats, who won 95 of the 115 single-member
constituencies in the first round of voting on April 26, now
control 10l of the 140 seats in the one-chamber parliament, the
People's Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Before the election, they held 92 seats against 38 for the main
Socialist opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Final results of the runoffs issued tonight by the Central
Electoral Commission gave the Republican Party two seats and the
Balli Kombetax Party one seat. The losers were the Union of Human
Rights, set up by ethnic Greeks in southern Albania, and two other
lesser right-wing groupings.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout was 59.2 percent, much lower than the 89 percent
in the first round.
</P>
<P>
The commission, a state body in charge of organizing and
overseeing the election, said fresh voting would be held soon in
the remaining four constituencies where "serious irregularities"
had been observed.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, 115 of the 140 parliamentary seats are
contested in single-member constituencies and the remaining 25 are
allocated to the 12 parties which win the most votes in the first
round by proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Socialist Party and five other opposition groups
have refused to accept the election results and demanded another
vote. They have demanded that polling be repeated in at least 80
of the 115 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 opposition candidates have been on hunger strike
in the capital city since Saturday in an attempt to force a fresh
poll.
</P>
<P>
Tension has gripped the country since April 27 when riot police
broke up a mass opposition rally staged in central Tirana in
protest at alleged ballot rigging. But the opposition vowed not
to bow to government intimidation and would continue to call
peaceful protests across the country.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) and the Organization for the Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have rapped the Albanian
government for "a lot of irregularities" observed by their
monitors overseeing the first round of balloting.
</P>
<P>
Italy, current holder of the EU rotating presidency, has called
on Albania to hold a partial re-run of the election. But the
Central Electoral Commission, which the opposition and foreign
observers said was appointed by the government, only admitted
there were some irregularities and have rejected the demand.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Urge Muslim-Croat Federation to Free POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serbs today appealed to
the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation to release 1,300 prisoners of
war and 1,000 civilians who the Serbs claimed were still held
captive by the Muslims and Croats.
</P>
<P>
Momir Talic, commander of the Bosnian Serb military forces
around Banjaluka, made the appeal while meeting with Michael
Jackson, commander of the southwestern district of the NATO-led
multinational peacekeeping force, and Pierre Kraehenbuhl, chief of
the International Red Cross delegation to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs have handed over to Jackson and Kraehenbuhl a
list of the 2,300 POWs and civilians, and Talic urged the two men
to help with the release of the POWs and civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton peace accord, signed last December, stipulates that
all parties to the three-and-a-half-year Bosnian war should set
free all prisoners of war and civilians by January this year.
</P>
<P>
But the Muslim-Croat Federation and Bosnian Serbs are believed
to be still holding Serb POWs and civilians.
</P>
<P>
Jackson told the press after meeting Talic that the release and
resettlement of POWs and civilians in Bosnia need more efforts
from the international community, as well as more goodwill from
all previous warring parties in the former Yugoslav region.

province, will be built and operated by Jiangsu Power Construction
Corp with an operation period of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The US company will bear the investment risks, while China will
be responsible for other risks. According to official sources, the
power project, with two 600,000-kilowatt generating units, will
begin operation with the first unit starting power generation in
2000.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said the foreign investor can sell its
shares after the power project is built and can also expand its
investment project to related business areas upon approval.
</P>
<P>
As China's largest industrial province, Jiangsu produced 940.1
billion yuan in industrial output value in 1995. Though the
province has an installed power capacity of over 10 million
kilowatts, it has a serious power shortage due to rapid economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to build power plants with nine million
kilowatts in installed capacity during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000). The province is seeking two billion US dollars
in foreign funds, about 25 percent of the total investment
needed.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Torch Relay Reaches Half-Way in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The Olympic flame reached
half-way in the United States when 77 runners carried it across
Chicago to Indiana on Monday, the 22nd of 42 host states prior to
the opening ceremony on July 19 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The flame was carried to Chicago by a special train from
Wisconsin after making brief stops at Waukegan, Lake Forest,
Highland Park and Evanston.
</P>
<P>
Chicago, one of a handful of cities where the torch made more
than one stop, cheered for its arrival on the 38th of the 84 days
scheduled for the relay.
</P>
<P>
The torch arrived at the Northwestern Metra Station, west of
Chicago's Loop, aboard a 19-car Union Pacific train from Milwaukee
shortly after noon.
</P>
<P>
It made the way to Grant Park behind schedule under a heavy
cloud, but the final runner was able to light the Olympic Cauldron
before any rains could fall.
</P>
<P>
A few thousand supporters gathered at the band shell to watch
the spectacle, as well as to listen to the Grant Park Symphony
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
Olympics expert John MacAloon was instrumental in bringing the
torch to the University of Chicago Hyde Park campus, where
University President Hugo Sonnenschein helped light a cauldron in
the center of the Main Quadrangle.
</P>
<P>
From the University, the torch was carried to Gary, Indiana.
</P>
<P>
The torch will pass through over 100,000 hands along its
15,000-mile relay from Olympia, Greece, to Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Retail Price of Jewelry Liberalized on Trial Basis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- In a move to reconsider the
pricing practices now in place, China's central bank for the first
time is allowing shops to freely set retail prices for gold
jewelry on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
The green light has been given to jewelry shops in the Gold
Jewelry Plaza in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, and is
expected to extend to all the shops in the zone in three to four
months, providing the experiment proves successful. Shenzhen,
adjacent to Hong Kong, accounts for 20 percent of gold jewelry
sold by wholesale.
</P>
<P>
While producers were allowed to set the ex-factory prices
according to the design and craftsmanship of gold jewelry, the
retailers could only be allowed to sell jewelry at state-set
unified prices, which were determined by the weight of each piece,
according to Shen Ruming, a division chief of the Shenzhen Branch
of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
"This has led shops to only sell gold jewelry of simple design
and mediocre technique since their ex-factory price was lower,"
Shen told Xinhua in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system introduced at the end of May, the jewelry
shops in the Gold Jewelry Plaza are now allowed to price their
jewelry based on a combination of three factors: the retail price
set according to the ex-factory price, the craftsmanship fee, and
a five percent consumer tax.

Xining, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The name of an animal protection
worker who was killed by poachers is to live on at the source of
China's famous Yangtze River.
</P>

Construction of the first nature protection station at the
river's source is underway in Kekexili.

poachers in 1994 while fighting with them to protect the wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the spirit of Juesang Sonandajie, south China's
Shenzhen launched the campaign of "Protect the Source of Yangtze
River and Love Nature" and plans to build five nature protection
stations by 2000.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Foreign Minister
Fernando Naranjo signed here today the inter-American convention
concerning the forced disappearance of persons and for the
compliance of criminal sentences abroad.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was held here on the eve of the
inauguration of the 26th period of session of the General Assembly
of the Organization of American States (OAS).
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Naranjo said that even though his country
has not had any cases of forced disappearance of persons, "it has
always repudiated, vehemently, that crime against humanity which
in the painful past has lacerated the conscience of several
countries in this hemisphere."
</P>
<P>
The document was signed in the 1994 General Assembly of the OAS
at the end of a lengthy process that began in 1987, when the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights proposed that a
convention be adopted in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-American Convention for the Compliance of Criminal
Sentences Abroad, adopted in the 1993 general assembly of the OAS,
was designed to encourage and promote cooperation among its 35
member states to ensure a better administration of justice.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the OAS Cesar Gaviria said that the
ratification of both legal instruments "once again reveals Costa
Rica's avante guarde and democratic vocation when it comes to
protecting the fundamental rights of human beings."

<P>
URUMQI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China's first pipeline transporting
finished oil products has been completed and is expected to be
brought into use in August. The pipeline links Karamay, a large
oilfield in northwest China's Xinjiang with Urumqi, its capital

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for 80 Million U.S. Dollars in Aid to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
called for 80 million U.S. dollars in aid to cover both
humanitarian activities and the operation of a 138-member U.N.
monitor contingent in Iraq, a U.N. spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the appeal, U.N. Spokesman Sylvanan Foa said it was
presented to donors last Friday by Under-Secretary-General Yasushi
Akashi in a letter with a copy of the document "United Nations
Inter-Agency Humanitarian Programme in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Foa explained that the appeal document was prepared in March
calling for 340 million U.S. dollars over the period April 1996 to
March 1997. It was decided to delay the launch of the appeal until
the outcome of the negotiations between U.N. and Iraq over
oil-for-food talks became clear.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, before the implementation of the
oil-for-food deal, the needs of vulnerable population should be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
"Some 80 million dollars are urgently needed to cover immediate
needs for food, water supply and sanitation, agricultural and
health services, as well as shelter and education," Foa said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, funding for the operation of the U.N. Guard
Contingent in Iraq will be exhausted this months," she added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Guard Contingent was established right after the
Gulf War through an agreement by the Iraqi government and
U.N secretariat. It is assinged to help protect U.N. relief
convoys and personnel in Iraq's three northern provinces where
it has no effective control.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reaffirms U.S. Support for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
reaffirmed leaders of major Arab nations in the Middle East of the
continued U.S. support for a lasting and comprehensive peace in
the region, the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that Clinton
made the commitment in his last weekend letters to President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt, King Hussein of Jordan, President Hafez Assad of
Syria and Palestinian Authority Leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Clinton assured the leaders "that the United States remains
committed to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the
region," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the Clinton administration was
"encouraged" by the conciliatory tone of Israel's new prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
After his election as Israel's new leader last week, Netanyahu

<HEADLINE> Perry Recommends New U.S. Navy Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry has recommended President Bill Clinton several replacements
for Adm. Jeremy "Mike" Boorda as the next chief of the U.S. Navy,
Pentagon officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The officials, who asked not to be identified, told reporters
that Clinton might announce "as early as Tuesday" a replacement
for Boorda, the former chief of the U.S. Navy who committed
suicide on May 16.
</P>
<P>
Although the Pentagon has kept secret Perry's recommendations,
the officials predicted that the Pentagon chief was leaning
toward Adm. Jay Johnson, 51.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a former commander of the 2nd Fleet and a 1968
graduate of the U.S. Navy Academy, became Boorda's second in
command as vice chief of Naval operations and the youngest
four-star admiral in the U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
Johnson has temporarily taken charge of the U.S. Navy since
Boorda's death.
</P>
<P>
The other recommendations include Adm. Leighton Smith, who
presently is the top commander of the U.S.-led 60,000-strong NATO
peace implementation force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Boorda shot himself in the chest in the backyard of his home at
the Washington Navy Yard after reporters accused him of having no
right to wear "V" for valor medals on his campaign ribbons under
the Navy rules.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Face Worsening Tobacco-Related </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) --The World Bank gave a warning
today that number of people worldwide who die from tobacco-related
diseases will rise from 3 million at present to 10 million by
2025, of which 7 million in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Within three decades in developing nations, tobacco use may
kill more people than AIDS, tuberculosis and complications from
childbirth combined," said Dr. Richard Feachem, Senior Adviser in
the World Bank's Human Development Department.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on a World-Bank-sponsored conference on
"Avoiding the Epidemic of Non-Communicable Diseases," Feachem
added that "tobacco consumption is falling in most Western
countries but is rising in the developing world and tobacco
companies already target developing countries."
</P>
<P>
Of the world's 1.1 billion smokers in the early 1990s, about
800 million, or almost 75 percent of the total, live in the
developing nations. In developing countries, about 50 percent of
deaths in 1990 were caused by NCDs, but by 2020, that proportion
is expected to shoot up by 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many developing countries are eager to address the issue and
are already beginning to spend more money on the NCDs disease
control. The World Bank is also trying to deal with this emerging
problem. This conference is the first intensive forum to share
information on the ways the international community can pursue
anti-smoking policies and seek for low-cost, effective ways to
reduce the burden of NCDs, such as cardiovascular disease and
cancer.

<HEADLINE> Security Situation Improves In Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
KIGALI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations headquarters
have reclassified the security status for Rwanda from the 3rd
category to 1st category which permits UN agencies staff members
to bring their family members to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by the UNDP Representative and
Resident Co-ordinator of the United Nations System in Rwanda,
Sukehiro Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
Hasegawa told reporters that the implications of the decision
to reclassify the security status in the most part of the country
are positive.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the following areas are excluded from
the reclassified status, such as Ruhengeri, Cyangugu, Kibuye and
Gisenyi.
</P>
<P>
According to UN classification, restrictions of UN staff
movement are now no longer applicable in areas classified in
category one in the country, which has satisfactory security.
</P>
<P>
Hasegawa also said the improved security status for Rwanda
would provide an incentives to private investors to increase
their investment in the country.
