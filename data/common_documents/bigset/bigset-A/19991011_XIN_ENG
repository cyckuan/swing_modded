<HEADLINE> French Defense Chief Visits Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard made a two-day official visit to Saudi Arabia until Sunday
to discuss the regional situation and seek a contract on the
purchase of French tanks by the Saudi armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Richard met with King Fahd and held talks with Prince Sultan
ben Abdel Aziz, the Saudi defense minister, on the situation in
the Middle East and in Iraq in particular, as well as cooperation
between the armed forces of the two countries, reported Agence
France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Iraq, Richard recalled that France is
critical of and reserved about the policy of the United States and
Britain, which are bombing targets in Iraq almost everyday.
</P>
<P>
France has suspended its participation in the allied
surveillance flights over southern Iraq from Saudi Arabia, after
the United States and Britain staged a massive bombing operation
against Baghdad in December 1998 for its failure to cooperate with
U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The French minister told his Saudi hosts that France has been
calling for the establishment of "an efficient and strict
monitoring mechanism" in Iraq to prevent it from obtaining arms of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
But France wishes that the United Nations will bring its aid to
improve the condition of live of the Iraqi population, who have
been suffering from a tough economic embargo since Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990, he said.
</P>
<P>
The French defense minister also said that France wishes to
sell its Leclerc tanks to the Saudi armed forces and would provide
a whole package of cooperation programs with such a contract,
including the training of personnel and transfer of the defense
industrial technologies involved.
</P>
<P>
After testing with success the French tanks in 1995 and 1997,
Saudi Arabia plans to buy 300 more such tanks with a cost of 20
billion francs (3.3 billion U.S. dollars), according to sources of
French defense ministry.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Force Reinforced to Fight Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government plans to
strengthen its police force to tackle the currently high levels of
crime in the country, Minister of Police Affairs David Jemibewon
has said.
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued here on Sunday by Special Assistant to
the President on Media and Publicity Doyin Okupe quoted the
minister as saying that 5,000 more policemen would be employed
annually over the next five years to increase the strength of the
police force now standing at 175,000.
</P>
<P>
Jemibewon told a meeting presided over by President Olusegun
Obasanjo on Saturday that the present structure of the police
force would be changed to hold back "the presently alarming rate
of crime in the society."
</P>
<P>
The changes include the creation of five more police zones in
addition to the existing eight in the most populous African
country and the establishment of 109 area commands to correspond
with the country's senatorial districts, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also recommended better funding, better equipment and better
service conditions for the police force.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting which focused on the Nigerian police
force and the currently high levels of crime in the country,
President Obasanjo said that increased funding alone could not
solve the problems of the police.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the alarming rate of crime is mainly attributed
to the intolerable levels of corruption in the society and the
very high rate of unemployment in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
"It was only when the society itself was properly sanitized
that significant improvement could be expected in the performance
of the Nigerian police force," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the failure of many Nigerian parents to accept
 responsibility for the proper up-bringing of their children has
forced many of such children to turn to a life of crime.
</P>
<P>
In view of persisting rumors of "attempted coups" and threats
to the security at the Presidential Villa in capital Abuja, the
president assured all Nigerians that the stability of any
administration has never been better than that of the present one.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Party Urged to Take Over Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda Sunday urged his opposition United National Independence
Party (UNIP) to prepare itself adequately to take over the state
power, Zambia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal at the 32nd meeting of the National Council
of the opposition party held in the central city of Kabwe, saying
that the country is now crying for good and committed leadership
and UNIP must be fully prepared to take over the reigns of power.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian people are fed up with the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) and they are now in the wilderness
without knowing where to go, he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He accused the MMD of destroying the economy through what he
said bad privatization policy.
</P>
<P>
However, Kaunda admitted that the UNIP Central Committee has
squabbles among its members.
</P>
<P>
The council must find a lasting solution to these problems and
not to squander this opportunity to revamp the UNIP, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the former president, the council is meeting to
critically examine the problems within the party and the
deteriorating economic situation and crime in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- British mobile phone company
Orange has provided a range of multimedia services using Wireless
Application Protocol (WAP) for visitors to the weeklong 1999 World
Telecommunications Exhibition, Telecom 99.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever questions you may have about exhibitions, events,
breaking news or hospitality at Telecom 99, there is one simple
answer: ask Orange," said Orange's Chief Operations Officer Colin
Tucker here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Orange will provide visitors to Telecom 99 with
access to the best information that is currently available on the
Internet, adding that "this new technology represents the next
important step in the evolution of electronic content, and Orange
believes that it will bring about a sea change in the way people
use their Orange phones".
</P>
<P>
Orange, one of the world's most advanced and fastest-growing
mobile phone companies, intends to be one of the first European
networks to launch a comprehensive range of multimedia services,
according to Tucker.
</P>
<P>
"These services are designed to be simple, easy to use and
tailored to the individual's needs and are just the tip of the
iceberg of the opportunities that WAP will enable," Tucker
explained. "In each of the countries that Orange has operations it
intends to launch such multimedia services."

<HEADLINE> IMF to Discuss Kenya's Loan Issue in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Finance Minister Chris
Okemo said Sunday that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would
convene in late November to discuss the resumption of loans to the
east African country.
</P>
<P>
Okemo made the remarks shortly after his returning from
consultations with the IMF and the World Bank in Washington on
Kenya's macroeconomic, fiscal and administrative situation.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions were extremely encouraging,'' he said at the
country's annual Moi Day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"I think they understood Kenya's position. The outcome (of
November's board meeting) should be encouraging,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the IMF had welcomed Kenya's latest efforts
toward streamlining the government.
</P>
<P>
In July, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi appointed a team of
private sector technocrats as part of the economic recovery plan.
He later cut the number of government ministries from 27 to 15.
</P>
<P>
The IMF halted a three-year 205 million U.S. dollars loan to
Kenya in July 1997 in protest at corruption and poor governance,
which has caused a sharp slowdown in the country's economic
growth.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Closer to WTO Entry: U.S. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
Commerce William Daley said Sunday he believes Jordan is closer
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) due to Amman's adoption of a
series of measures to reform its economy.
</P>
<P>
During a press briefing at the end of his two-day visit to
Amman, Daley said Washington will continue to support Jordan in
its efforts to join the WTO while encouraging United States
entrepreneurs to invest in the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Daley and 15 U.S. businessmen arrived in Amman Saturday in the
first leg of their nine-day regional tour which will also take
them to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Egypt, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
In Amman, Daley and his delegation met with Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh, Deputy Prime Minister Rima Khalaf
and other senior officials on the bilateral ties, trade and
investment opportunities in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh briefed Daley on measures taken by Jordan to join the
WTO, including privatization of public institutions, improvement
of investment environment and efforts to bring down budget deficit
and inflation.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has also reduced import duties for cars by an average 60
percent and planned to reduce the duties for electronic appliances
as part of its efforts to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh said Jordan has adopted measures to encourage foreign
investment in the kingdom as a key measure to stimulate its
stagnant economy, which registered a negative economic growth in
1998.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Daley on Jordan's economic difficulties
triggered by the Southeast Asian financial crisis and the
nine-year-old United Nations sanctions on Iraq, the main trade
partner of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Daley said he expects U.S. investment will be
increased in the coming months as part of U.S. support for the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Daley is expected to leave Amman Sunday evening to continue
with his regional tour to promote U.S. trade and investment in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Washington viewed Jordan as an ally in the Arab world after
Amman signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The government of U.S. President Bill Clinton is trying to get
the Congress' endorsement of a package of some 300 million dollars
in assistance to Jordan in 1999 to reward its role as a major
peace broker in the region.

<HEADLINE> Talks on EU-S.African Free Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Talks aimed at salvaging
the signing of the free trade agreement between the European Union
and South Africa were still going on shortly before 7:00 p.m. on
Sunday, spokesperson for the European Commission Mary McCaughey
said.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which began earlier in the day at an undisclosed
venue in Pretoria, were called in a bid to iron out EU member
states' last-minute objections to Monday's ceremony, supposed to
have been officiated by South African President Thabo Mbeki and EU
president Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
However, Ahtisaari has cancelled his flight out, and though
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin earlier on
Sunday appeared confident that the signing would go ahead, some
other government officials were less sure.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on SABC TV's "Newsmaker" program, Erwin dismissed
reports of a possible breakdown in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to tomorrow... We've had a few last-minute
problems, but I'm sure we can iron them out," Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to reports that the EU sticking point on the
agreement was over South Africa's commitment to phase out the
terms "port" and "sherry" after 12 years, Erwin said: "We're
experiencing some real frustration with the same five countries
that have persistently had problems with the agricultural side, so
they have raised questions as to whether we can go ahead with the
port and sherry agreement."
</P>
<P>
Erwin, who is leading the South African team at Sunday's talks,
 described the process over the last few days as unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The trade agreement, which has been more than four years in the
making, was given an overwhelming endorsement by the European
Parliament last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has to be signed by all 15 EU members before its
trade and development provisions for South Africa come into effect
in January.

GENEVA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Mobile phone subscribers in
China are expected to increase to about 200 million in the next
decade from about 26 million now, said a senior Chinese official
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Since the 1990s, the average annual growth rate of China's
telecommunications has been exceeding 40 percent and still
maintaining a strong momentum of growth," Minister of Information
Industry Wu Jichuan told a forum at the 1999 World
Telecommunications Exhibition, Telecom 99.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's Internet users are estimated at 7 million,
adding that the new generation public information network
characterized by IP technology will develop and mature rapidly
with its consistent evolution in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
"Great efforts will be devoted to the promotion of Internet and
digital technology-based economic and social activities such as
e-commerce, distance-learning, tele-medicine and tele-commuting,"
Wu told his audience.
</P>
<P>
He said that the information industry will play the leading
role in China's economy development in the new decade as the
growth rate of the info-com service, the information product
manufacturing and software industry will be much higher that of
GDP.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere to Undergo Brain Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The condition of
Tanzanian former president Julius Nyerere is still bad and doctors
attending him plan to wake him up through appropriate brain tests
on Tuesday, an official statement said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The doctors at the St. Thomas' Hospital in London said that it
is normal for an aged man like Nyerere to take a long time to come
round after being sedated for a period of time, a press release
issued Sunday evening by the Press Secretary to the president
Geoffrey Nkurlu said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, 77, was admitted to the hospital for leukemia 16 days
ago. His critical condition has not changed until Sunday but
doctors have prevented his condition from deteriorating further,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The document said that Nyerere's lungs are functioning well and
his heart is still strong.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere is revered as the Founding Father of Tanzania. He led
the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in 1961 and
masterminded its union Zanzibar isles in 1964 to form Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
After retiring as president in 1985, he played an advisory role
in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs. He tirelessly
mediated Burundi peace talks since 1996.

PARIS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Former French Prime Minister
Raymond Barre Sunday warned against excessive privatization of
enterprises of great national interests, in a reaction to the
disaster of the Paddington railway station in London last week.
</P>
<P>
"The things which took place in Britain called on us to think
it over about privatizations," said Barre in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He said that the great public services such as railway and
electricity cannot be privatized because big collective and
national interests are at stake.
</P>
<P>
"When it is about basic infrastructures, the government should
resume responsibilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barre said that the privatization of railways in Britain was
one of the "bad consequences from the ideology of the British
conservatives."
</P>
<P>
At least 127 people were killed when two trains bumped each
other on the railways near the Paddington station in central
London last Wednesday.

LAGOS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's 38 billion worth
liquefied natural gas company has exported its first consignment
of liquefied gas, announced the plant's management Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A France-going vessel carrying the first gas shipment of the
plant, said to be the biggest industrial project in Africa, left
a harbor Saturday on Bonny Island in the country's south Rivers
State, on Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
The plant on the island is targeted at exporting about six
million tons of gas annually to Europe, in Nigerian government's
bid to lessen its dominant relying upon crude oil export for
revenue.
</P>
<P>
The export was made possible with Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo's direct intervention last month in stopping a two-week
long siege of the plant by local youths asking for job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The pant, jointly invested by Nigerian government and nine
major western oil companies, is also aimed at improve the
country's environment through reducing gas flarings in the
country's oil fields.

<HEADLINE> New Cabinet Formed in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A new Egyptian cabinet under
Prime Minister Etef Ebeid and comprising 32 ministers Egypt was
formed on Sunday, according to a republican decree issued by
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen new faces appeared in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Old faces in the new cabinet include Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation Youssef Wali, Defense
Minister Hussein Tantawi, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Information
Minister Safwat el-Sherif, Minister of Economy Youssef Boutros
Ghali and Interior Minister Habib el-Adli also remained in office.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Transport and Communications in the former
cabinet has been divided into the current Ministry of Transport
and the Ministry of Communications and Information.
</P>
<P>
The division of the ministry is reportedly designed to step up
efforts to promote transport and curb the rampant traffic
accidents on rural roads, and to upgrade the development of the
information technology.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the creation of the Ministry of Youth mirrors
Mubarak's thinking that young people will "shoulder the
responsibility of pushing forward the march of progress in all
fields."
</P>
<P>
Minister of Youth Alieddin Helal Dessouki said on Sunday that
besides sports, his ministry is also tasked with grooming youth to
face up to future challenges in the social, economic and health
fields.
</P>
<P>
After Mubarak was sworn in last Tuesday for the fourth
consecutive six-year term, former Prime Minister Kamel El-Ganzouri
submitted the resignation of his cabinet. Mubarak then asked
Ebeid, minister of public business sector under El-Ganzouri to
form a new cabinet.

<HEADLINE> World to Greet 6 Billionth Baby on October 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- As the 6 billionth baby
on the planet is expected to be born on October 12, U.N. officials
are concerned about the rapid population growth and the problems
such as poverty and environment.
</P>
<P>
U.N. figures released Sunday show that world population has
doubled in the last 40 years with one billion added in the past 12
years, the shortest ever time-span for the billion growth.
</P>
<P>
With approximately 10,000 children born every hour, the planet
now accommodates an additional 78 million people a year. If the
trend continues, there could be 10 billion people on the globe in
the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
According to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), population
growth is about half that of 50 years ago, but due to large
families in the recent past, half the world is now under 25,
auguring for a huge army of the parents at the beginning of the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Population growth has slowed or stopped in Europe, North
America and Japan while the developing world accounts for 95
percent of the world population growth, resulting in continuing
poverty in many of the fast growing regions.
</P>
<P>
In sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South and West Asia,
billions of people are deprived of their basic needs, lacking
sanitation, adequate housing, clean water and health services with
one fifth of all children not attending school to grade five.
</P>
<P>
In a picture of wasterful and unbalanced consumption, water use
has doubled in the past generation and water shortages are
increasingly common. Food stocks are at 20 year low and per
capital food production is declining in scores of countries.
</P>
<P>
A population stabilization scheme would cost some 17 billion
U.S. dollars per year, about what the world spends in arms in a
week.
</P>
<P>
The rich countries are falling short in meeting the financial
promises made at the Cairo Population Conference in 1994, leaving
most of the population stabilization cost with the poorer nations.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to pay a price in a world that will be
overpopulated," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned,
appealing for action for the mankind's good.  )

TEHRAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official
stated on Sunday that Iran is among the most disaster-prone
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on relief work held in the northern
province of Semnan, Governor General of the province Mohammad Ali
Panjeh-Fouladgaran said that earthquakes and floods are the most
frequent disasters in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Population growth, irrational urban expansion, destruction of
natural resources and direct and indirect human intervention in
nature are among the most important factors amplifying the
magnitude of the natural disasters," the Islamic Republic News
Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in recent years there has been an
increasing frequency of disasters and the estimated damage to the
country has risen from 160 billion rials (53 million U.S. dollars)
in 1991 to 714 billion rials (238 million dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abbas Jazaieri, the head of natural disasters
headquarters at the Iranian Interior Ministry, said on Sunday that
during the past decade Iran has spent 2,881 billion rials (about
960 million dollars) on the prevention and the compensation of
damages of natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Qaen in the northeastern province of Khorasan,
Jazaieri said that 31 billion rials (10 million dollars) has been
spent in past five years on 67 research studies on ways of
minimizing damages of natural disasters with another 44 projects
still underway.

<HEADLINE> French Politician Suggests Referendum on Corsica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Former French Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua has suggested that France hold a referendum in
Corsica in order to stop the acts of violence there.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to be published on Monday by the daily le
Figaro, Pasqua, who is the president of the neo-Gaullist party
Rally for the Republic, said that the central government of France
should present a "coherent project" on the development of the
island, and submit it to the people there through a referendum.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to the people to decide what they want. The
government should agree to decentralize itself, and all that which
can be treated at the local level should be so," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the government for trying to solve the
problems in Corsica only through "police and judicial measures."
</P>
<P>
"One should have dialogue with all the nationalists so as to
make them understand that violence is illegitimate and useless in
a democratic country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Corsica has been subjected to acts of violence perpetuated by
the nationalists fighting for independence of the island since the
mid-1970s.

<HEADLINE> South African Goes Ahead under Multi-National Coaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- After a long-time isolation
from international sports, South African gymnasts have begun to
grab a standing in international gymnastics under the guidance
from a multi-national coaching team.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, formerly an unknown in gymnastics, won four
medals in the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia last year, including
a silver in floor, a bronze in rings, gold and silver in vault.
</P>
<P>
Behind the South African gymnasts is a multi-national coaching
staff with experience and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
Among the five coaches for the world championships which opened
here on Friday, there of them are from outside South Africa --
Hristov Gheorghe from Romania, Fidler Graham from England and
Szabo Mike from Hungary.
</P>
<P>
"They improved a lot in recent years, and we helped them do
that," said head coach Gheorghe who arrived in South Africa seven
years ago and has become naturalized.
</P>
<P>
His opinion was echoed by Graham who has been a permanent
citizen of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We helped them a lot in recent years. We gave them experience,
for they have no experienced coaches," said Graham.
</P>
<P>
Cameron-Smith Elizabeth, head of the South African delegation,
attributed the emergence of their gymnastics to the three coaches.
</P>
<P>
"(The reason for success) is the coaches' enthusiasm and the
teamwork between coaches and administrators," said Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
Though they have different coaching style they do a good
teamwork, said Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
"When Gheorghe gets upset with the team, Graham will come to
deal with the team. They are complementary for they have different
ways," Elizabeth said.
</P>
<P>
"We started to compete internationally after the apartheid was
abolished. So we fell short of international experiences, and the
Commonwealth Games is the first international for us this year."
</P>
<P>
"And for girls this is the first time to compete as a team,"
said Elizabeth, also the managing director of South African
Gymnastics Federation.
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth got excited with the South African men's performances
at the qualifier on Sunday which saw Cristian Brezeanu score 9,450
in vault. Brezeanu, 29, has been their hopeful for qualifying for
the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We did not come here with a big expectation. We come here for
the rankings in the world, and you could see here how the standard
is so that you could be realistic," said the official.
</P>
<P>
But before today's progress, Gheorghe has found himself in a
fix that his former Romanian-style coaching was not popular to
those African girls and boys who are more independent.
</P>
<P>
"They are talented, very talented, but they are also
independent. They do not like to work very hard, so I need to
adapt myself to them, and they also need to adapt themselves to me,
but the change is not big," said Gheorghe.
</P>
<P>
As he held that South Africa had great potential, he said that
South Africa still have some problems to solve.
</P>
<P>
"They all like to stay home. They need to be full-time if they
want to be stronger, and they need to build national training
centers just like China," Gheorghe added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri left here on Sunday for Riyadh to
pay an official visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure, Nateq-Nouri said the aim of his visit is to
foster parliamentary and economic relations between the two
countries, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the exchange of visits by Iranian and Saudi
officials has played a significant role in developing bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope to reach a positive decision with Saudi
officials on the issues relating to pilgrimage by Iranians to the
holy cities of Mecca and Medina.

Iranian Vice President for Legal and Parliamentary Affairs
Mohammad Ali Sadooqi, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, Commerce

of parliamentary contacts between the two countries.

officials to discuss bilateral ties, ways of strengthening the
Islamic inter-parliamentary organization and the active presence
of the two countries in that forum.

<P>
He said that other topics on the agenda are the possibility of
increasing the quota of Iranian pilgrims and closer economic
cooperation among Islamic states, especially in the Gulf region.
</P>

Abdul-Aziz, Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Second Deputy

<HEADLINE> Situation at Zimbabwe's Hospitals Deteriorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's health sector is now
offering limited services while some wards at the various health
institutions are without patients, as the strike by the country's
doctors in government hospitals entered the third week.
</P>
<P>
A survey released by Zimbabwe News Agency on Sunday found that
there was an unusually quiet atmosphere at the country's hospitals
as either some patients had been discharged or were now refraining
from going to the hospitals as doctors were not available.
</P>
<P>
President of the Hospital Doctors Association Nyasha Masuka
told the agency that there was no going back on the strike, and
what they were now waiting for was the meeting scheduled for
Wednesday between the doctors and a parliamentary committee,
Ministries of Finance, Health and Child Welfare and Public
Service, Labor and Social Welfare.
</P>
<P>
The strike had now entered its third week with no solution in
sight, with doctors having stopped offering emergency services
since Friday.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 760 doctors in all government hospitals
when in actual fact a minimum of 2,600 doctors was required to run
the hospitals effectively and effectively.
</P>
<P>
The agency reported the situation at the hospitals was getting
worse as each day passed, and there was a possibility of nurses
joining in the strike.
</P>
<P>
The doctors have vowed not to return to work until their
demands for more salary and good work conditions are agreed to and
put in writing.

<HEADLINE> EU, S. Africa to Sign Trade Accord as Planned: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and the
European Union will go ahead as planned to sign a trade and
cooperation agreement in Pretoria on Monday, South African Trade
and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on South African Broadcasting Corporation's
"Newsmaker" program, Erwin brushed aside reports that the signing
had been cancelled. However, the minister acknowledged that the
two sides need to "sort things out" before the signing.
</P>
<P>
"We've had a few last-minute problems, but I'm sure we can iron
them out, " Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
Top-level talks were being held in Johannesburg on Sunday in a
bid to salvage the trade agreement after Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari cancelled his trip to South Africa because the
negotiators were unable to resolve the last-minute objections to
the agreement from some EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari, who also holds the EU rotating presidency, is
supposed to sign the agreement with South African President Thabo
Mbeki at the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which has been more than four years in the
making, was given an overwhelming endorsement by the European
Parliament last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It did not include an accord on wine and spirits -- the "port
and sherry" issue, which missed an end-of-September deadline and
has still not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Officials on both sides hoped the main agreement could be
signed with the wine and spirits issue left for later, but the
process was thrown into confusion when representatives of some EU
states expressed reservations about signing an incomplete package.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has to be signed by all 15 EU members before its
trade and development provisions for South Africa come into effect
in January.
</P>
<P>
The 200-page agreement will liberalize nearly 90 percent of
trade between the EU's 15 member states and South Africa, which
totals 17.1 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will lift customs duties from 86 percent of EU
exports to South Africa over a 12- year period while eliminating
custom duties from 95 percent of South African exports to the EU
over a 10-year period.

<HEADLINE> Russia Warns About Foreign Support of Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
said Sunday that it has briefed representatives of a number of
Arab countries on "facts indicating that from their territory,
some foreign Islamic organizations are unfolding a campaign of
moral and material support for Chechen terrorists."
</P>
<P>
Such activity is arousing "serious concern" in Russia and "can
hardly be explained by a token of Islamic solidarity since Chechen
bands have embarked on the road of terror, disguised in religious
slogans, having nothing in common with Islam," the Interfax news
agency quoted the ministry's information and press department as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia maintains long-standing friendly ties and extensive
cooperation with the Arab states. Proceeding precisely from such a
spirit of Russian-Arab relations, Russia expects the governments
of these states "to apply effective measures toward curbing the
activity of those who embroil themselves in feeding up criminal
groups in Chechnya," the department said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The Arab diplomats reiterated their governments' official
position in support of Russia's sovereignty and territorial
integrity and non-interference in its internal affairs, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hebron Incident Reflects Lack of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The humiliation suffered by a
Jordanian parliamentary delegation in the West Bank city of Hebron
Saturday demonstrates that it still takes time to build up respect
and confidence between Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the last two days, Jordan strongly protested over the
incident, saying the harassment that Israeli soldiers and Jewish
settlers inflicted on the delegation violated the spirit of peace.
</P>
<P>
The 20-member delegation, headed by Lower House Speaker Abdul
Hadi Majali, was forced to receive security checks by Israeli
solders and then heckled by dozens of Jewish settlers while the
delegates prepared to visit the Ibrahim Mosque in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In a swift and unusual move, the Jordanian government issued a
sharp-worded statement to the Israeli government Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli treatment of the Jordanian delegation not only
violated the spirit of peace, but also ran against diplomatic
conventions, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Jordanian Ambassador to Israel lodged a similar
protest to the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The outraged speaker Majali said Jordan's trust in the peace
process had been shaken by the way Israel treated the Jordanian
delegation, which was on its last stop of a four-day visit to
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The incident was one of the several unhappy episodes between
Jordan and Israel since they signed a peace treaty in 1994.
</P>
<P>
For years, Jordan has taken peace as a strategic option both in
its ties with Israel and in regional affairs, and Israel has also
viewed the peace treaty with Jordan as one of the pillars of its
foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Putting an end to decades of wars between the two countries,
the peace treaty has also helped build up close and personal ties
between leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But the latest incident has served as a reminder of the
suspicion and lack of confidence between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Israel sentiment can be detected among the Jordanian
population, some of whom are Palestinians who had been forced to
leave their homes in Palestine in the 1948 and 1967 Israeli-Arab
wars.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials, legislators, professional organizations
and opposition parties often complain that Jordan has never got
the peace dividends it deserves from the peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Israel is still blocking Jordanian products from
entering Israel and Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Instead of apologizing, the Israeli government has given a
different version of the latest incident, saying the delegation
had not contacted Israeli authorities before the visit to the
mosque.
</P>
<P>
The mosque has been under Israeli security control since an
agreement signed between Israel and the Palestinians in 1997
divided Hebron into Israeli-controlled and Palestinian-controlled
parts.
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen how Jordan and Israel will solve the
unhappy episode, which has apparently hurt the national feelings
of Jordan, if not left a serious and negative impact on bilateral
ties.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Combat Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki Sunday urged African countries to root out corruption
which has a corrosive impact on the societies.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 9th International Anti-Corruption Conference in
Durban, Mbeki said the meeting will "give an added impetus to all
of us as Africans further to intensify our own offensive against
the scourge of corruption".
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, I am certain that this conference will help further to
empower all of us to understand the legislative, institutional and
other measures we need to put in place to increase our
effectiveness in the fight against corruption," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to South Africa, Mbeki said the first thing the
government has to do was to end the illegitimate system of
apartheid and replace it with a genuinely democratic and
politically inclusive political system.
</P>
<P>
The existence for many decades of an illegitimate political and
social system contributed to the spread and entrenchment of
corruption in South Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the international dignitaries attending the conference
were Botswanan President Festus Mogae, Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo and President of the World Bank Jim Wolfenson. Also
present were South African government ministers, foreign
ambassadors and diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Qatar's Court Holds Hearing on Foiled Coup Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Supreme Criminal
Court held a hearing in Doha on Sunday into the case of a 1996
coup attempt allegely masterminded by the country's former police
chief Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem Bin Hamad Al-Thani.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah Bin Khalifa Al-Thani
and Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem Bin Jabr Al-Thani
testified during the closed-door hearing, according to the Kuwait
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said after the hearing that the judicial
authority is examining the case. He ruled out an amnesty for the
suspects.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, who testified upon the request of the
defendants, also denied speculations that Qatar's Emir Sheikh
Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani might pardon the detainees.
</P>
<P>
The Emir is awaiting the rule of the judiciary in the case, he
said.

<P>
The Supreme Criminal Court charged Sheik Hamad and other two
main suspects with attempting to topple the rule of the Emir in a
failed coup on February 13, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem, also Qatar's former minister of
economy and trade, was captured by Qatar's secret agents on July

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has approved an
anti- corruption strategy and an action plan to create a more
favorable environment for foreign aid and investment, President
Benjamin Mkapa said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Swiss Foreign Minister and Federal
Councillor Joseph Deiss in the State House, Mkapa said the
strategy and action plan formulated by Tanzania involve all the
ministries, departments and some significant civil organizations
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The government intends to compile the action plan and pass it
around so that people could identify which areas to assist in
combating corruption," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mkapa acknowledged that one of the main obstacles in
the fight against corruption is the lack of enough awareness by
the people, who don't seem to realize that demanding something or
giving something is something very reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government is determined to educate and
give people courage to stand up against those who want to deprive
them of their rights.
</P>
<P>
The president also briefed his guest on the political situation
in the Great Lakes region, particularly in Burundi and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>

Deiss arrived here on Sunday on a two-day visit, the first by a
member of the Swiss government in decades.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Concerted Efforts to Narrow Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- In the era of the new
technological revolution, the gap between the information rich and
the information poor has been further widened rather than
narrowed, said a Chinese official here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"This is reflected in the larger gap in the technologies of
network hardware facilities, the developing countries' increasing
dependence on the developed countries for the technologies of
network and information system software and the information
technology brain drain of the developing countries," Wu Jichuan,
Minister of Information Industry, told a forum at the 1999 World
Telecommunications Exhibition, Telecom 99.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to pay great attention
to this problem and take actions to seek practical and feasible
solutions.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem of under-developed communications, WU
said, developing countries have to work out development strategies
in line with their actual conditions. "They need to develop
telecommunications on their own arduous efforts," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Chinese minister pointed out that
developed countries and relevant international organizations
should conscientiously assume the responsibility of helping the
developing countries accelerate communications growth and offer
vigorous support in terms of financing, technology and personnel
training so as to "narrow the telecommunications gap between the
developed and developing countries and build a closely connected
human society through their common efforts".
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Chinese government, Wu appreciated what the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) had done in recent
years in the promotion of the cooperation and development of
global telecommunications, in the unification of telecom technical
standards and in the management of communications resources.

<HEADLINE> Ministers End ASEM Meeting With Deferences Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Economic ministers from 25
European and Asian countries Sunday ended their two-day conference
in Berlin, failing to reach a common stance over the coming world
trade round.
</P>
<P>
European countries and their Asian partners under the Asia
Europe Meetings (ASEM) process, while achieving wide agreement on
bilateral measures aimed to increase Euro-Asian trade and
investment, will speak out in deferent voices at the World Trade
Organization (WTO) negotiations scheduled for December in Seattle,
the United States, officials stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed many topics and exchanged views, but this is
not the place to set up the new agenda," said Pascal Lamy, the EU
commissioner for foreign trade affairs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference following the meeting, Lamy
acknowledged the gap between Europe and Asia was not easy to
erase, and "discussion is no way the sign of clinching, but for
better understanding."
</P>
<P>
"We have managed to speak frankly and honestly... we didn't
come here for a common statement, but we did exchange views," said
Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thai deputy Prime Minister and minister of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
The deference between the two parts lied in the anti-dumping
policy, the none-tariff barrier, and the labor standards issue.
</P>
<P>
The Asian countries are concerned that the anti-damping policy
of the EU could be used as an instrument of trade distorts, said
Supachai.
</P>
<P>
"We need regulations to secure that anti-dumping policy will
not be abused," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said the Asian countries found it hard to accept that
EU frequently deploy anti-dumping policy for European standards of
environment and food safety.
</P>
<P>
The positions of the EU and the Asians "seem to be quite
apart," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, the EU said the none-tariff barrier in Asian
countries hurt free trade and demanded further liberalization of
the market, an issue that the latter promised to comprehensively
discuss in the forthcoming WTO round.
</P>
<P>
But, "the negotiations in the global round should reflect the
interest of the whole membership," insisted Supachai.
</P>
<P>
The EU is keen on linking labor standards with the WTO round,
but Asian countries, afraid of a new device to distort trade, said
the International Labor Office (ILO) was a more appropriate site
to discuss the topic.
</P>
<P>
"We will not avoid dialogue, but we will avoid discuss the
issue openly in a way that distorts trade," said Han Duck-Soo, the
Korean trade minister.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the ministers accepted a wide range of measures
to promote trade and investment between Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
A chairman statement passed at the meeting said the two parts
would take actions focused on streamlining customs procedures,
technical standards and conformity assessment, public procurement,
food safety and intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
And an investment promotion plan will seek to foster more
transparency in investment regimes in both regions.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the Investment Experts Group (IEG) agreed to
launch an Internet-based "virtual information exchange room" to
provide information on investment regime of each ASEM partner.
</P>
<P>
Further more, the ministers agreed to get private industry
involved in the closer Euro-Asia economic dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in German capital, the first one under the Asia
Europe Meetings (ASEM) process since the Asian economic crisis
began sweeping the region in 1997, was targeted to boost trade and
investment between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM, launched in 1996 in Bangkok, Thailand, includes all
the 15 members of the EU and 10 Asian nations. The Asian countries
are Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Alarm For Winter in Balkan Launched By Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A call for the international
community to get Balkan aid and reconstruction moving faster
before winter was launched at Sunday's international conference on
Balkan held in the Italian northeast city of Venice.
</P>
<P>
The co-ordinator of the Balkan Stability Pact, Bodo Hombach,
said that the United Nations was afraid of the winter in Balkan.
</P>
<P>
"Humanitarian aid is urgently needed," Hombach told reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, Bernard Kouchner, the
U.N. special envoy for Kosovo admitted at the conference that for
the moment he was not even in a position to pay his assistants'
wages.
</P>
<P>
Italian Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio warned against
talking of a new Marshall Plan for the Balkans along the lines of
the one in which the United States funded reconstruction in Europe
after World War Two.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "today's reality is much more complex than
the past"."
</P>
<P>
Franco Bernabe, head of the Italian government's task force for
reconstruction, pointed to the high costs of bureaucracy in
international organizations - on average 30 percent of all
international aid missions goes on paying officials and other
administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
He therefore stressed the importance of minimizing waste and
maximizing cost-effectiveness in the forthcoming operation.
</P>
<P>
Bernabe also urged the international community to face up to
the humanitarian emergency in Serbia, where he said 700,000 to
800,000 people were living in extremely precarious conditions.
</P>
<P>
The European Investment Bank said it would take 6.5 billion
U.S. dollars to build the infrastructure the region needs, over
the next 4-5 years.
</P>
<P>
In another point, James Pardew, the U.S. special envoy for
Kosovo, repeated the U.S. line that independence is not the best
future for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In Rome, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini stressed that
humanitarian aid to Serbia would be forthcoming ahead of the
Balkan winter.

<HEADLINE> Official: 620 Kidnapped in Russia in 9 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- In the first nine months of the
year, 620 people were abducted in Russia, an official source said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of those hostages, 382 were subsequently released, said Nikolai
Morozov, deputy department chief of the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Morozov said 278 of the victims, including 81 servicemen, were
abducted in the North Caucasus, and that 121 of them remain in
captivity, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The official said 63 foreigners were kidnapped during the
period and 13 are still held by their abductors.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, a total of 1,289 persons have been kidnapped in the
North Caucasus and the overwhelming majority of them were kept in
the breakaway republic of Chechnya, Morozov said.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 50 armed gangs, with about 2,000 members, are
involved in the business of abductions. Law enforcement agencies
have so far eliminated 37 such groups numbering 130 persons.

<HEADLINE> PM: Surrender Terrorists First, Talks Second </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin said Monday that talks proposed by Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov could not start before the breakaway republic hands over
terrorists to federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
Putin said he viewed Maskhadov's proposal, which was made
Sunday, in a positive light but the priorities should be changed.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov urged the federal forces to stop air and artillery
bombing raids first and then conduct talks with Chechnya. He also
vowed "to interact with all countries of the world, Russia
included, in fight against terrorism by taking world experience
into account."
</P>
<P>
Putin said that "the terrorists guilty of attacking peaceful
villages in Daghestan and bombing attacks in apartment houses in
Moscow, Volgodonsk and Buinaksk must be extradited," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia unleashed the fiercest attacks on the breakaway republic
after Chechen rebels infiltrated into the Daghestani republic and
the blasts, believed to be masterminded by Chechen militants,
killed over 300 people.
</P>
<P>
"Give us the men whose hands and arms are stained with blood
and we will be prepared for full-scale talks," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Nationalities Minister Vyacheslav Mikhailov also
commented on Maskhadov's proposals Monday, saying Maskhadov was
trying to internationalize the issue by appealing to international
organizations for assistance.
</P>
<P>
"This is inadmissible, as Chechnya is a constituent part of the
Russian Federation," Mikhailov said.

<HEADLINE> Tracker Fund of Hong Kong Launched on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Exchange Fund
Investment Ltd. (EFIL) on Monday launched the Tracker Fund of Hong
Kong (TraHK), commencing the disposal program for the massive
share portfolio the government acquired during its counter attacks
against market stipulators in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
TraHK will be the first collective investment fund of its kind
to be listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. It is designed to
provide investment results that closely correspond to, or track,
the performance of the Hang Seng Index (HSI).
</P>
<P>
By buying or selling units of TraHK, investors will effectively
be able to trade an entire portfolio of shares (index shares),
representing the HSI constituent companies, in a single
transaction.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony to mark the launch of the TraHK hosted by
EFIL, set up a year ago to manage the 118 billion Hong Kong
dollars (15 billion U.S. dollars) worth of shares in all 33 HSI
firms the government bought during the market operation in August
1998, Tsang said that the launch of TraHK marks the commencement
of the disposal program for the Hong Kong equity portfolio of the
Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government acquired that portfolio in very
exceptional circumstances when the Hong Kong financial markets
were subject to merciless and sustained attacks on several fronts,
Tsang said. Local and investors' confidence was on the verge of
collapse, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our action attracted a lot of criticisms at the time," Tsang
said.
</P>
<P>
"Some were worried that it might signify Hong Kong's departure
from free market principles," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Others feared that we might hold on to the shares bought
during the market operation and, as a significant minority
shareholder, seek to interfere with the day-to-day business
decisions of the index companies. Some event talked about the '
nationalization' of the index companies."
</P>
<P>
"With the launch of TraHK today, I hope that it is now clear to
all that these concerns are unfounded. The development since our
incursion proved that our move was a correct one," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a small portion of the portfolio to be retained as
long term investment of the Exchange Fund, the government is
committed to dispose of the rest in an orderly manner without
disrupting the market, the financial secretary said.
</P>
<P>
TraHK has a number of important advantages, Tsang said.
Compared with other disposal methods, it adopts a market neutral
approach with the least impact on the prices of the underlying
shares.
</P>
<P>
It caters for the needs of both institutional and retail
investors.
</P>
<P>
It adds to the variety and depth of our stock market by
introducing a new and liquid product, he added.
</P>
<P>
The manager of TraHK will be State Street Global Advisors (HK)
Limited and the Trustee will be State Street Bank and Trust
Company.
</P>
<P>
Individual retail investors are likely to be eligible for
incentives in the form of a price discount and loyalty bonuses.
</P>
<P>
The fund will also be offered to global institutional investors
via a bookbuilding exercise.
</P>
<P>
The retail offer and institutional book closing dates are
expected to be on November 4 and 5 respectively. The fund is
scheduled for listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on
November 12, 1999.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Medical Aid to Foreign Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China plans to improve the
quality of medical aid to foreign countries by providing high-
quality medicine and equipment to medical teams.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health (MOH) has listed a group of potential
products and suppliers, and will choose suitable ones for
different countries, Niu Zhongjun, an MOH official in charge of
aid-foreign work, said here today.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the service, which has been praised
internationally, was sometimes unsatisfactory as a result of poor-
quality medical products given to the locals.
</P>
<P>
For 36 years, China has been following a policy which provides
free or inexpensive medical service in foreign countries through
Chinese medical teams.
</P>
<P>
Since China sent its first medical team to Algeria in April of
1963, more than 16,000 doctors and other medical workers have been
assigned to over 60 countries and regions in Asia, Africa, Latin
America and Europe, offering treatment to 220 million foreign
patients and training some 2,000 local doctors and medical
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Niu said the action also aims to help more domestic products
enter into foreign medical markets, since the MOH has decided to
reform the former free service into mutually-beneficial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China will not only send medical teams to foreign countries,
but also jointly run hospitals and pharmaceutical factories abroad
in order to promote the export of medical facilities,
pharmaceuticals, medical materials, and traditional Chinese
medicine and technology, health minister Zhang Wenkang has said.

<HEADLINE> Fruit, Vegetable Processing Essential to Economy, Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Solutions to problems that occur
in the storing and processing of fruits and vegetables would help
reduce losses and bring about sound economic returns, according to
Song Jian, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Song made the remark in a meeting today with Adrianus Mooy,
executive secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (ESCAP) of the United Nations, in Yantai of east
China's Shandong Province, which will be hosting the International
Symposium and Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable Processing
Technology and Industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian said he was grateful to Mooy and his organization for
supporting China in hosting the symposium, which runs from October
12-16.
</P>
<P>
Song said that all northern provinces and regions in China are
confronted with problems in planting, storing and processing
fruits and vegetables, since temperatures in these areas fluctuate
from season to season.
</P>
<P>
Technological solutions to the problems would not only help
farmers avoid more losses, but also create more profit.
</P>
<P>
Mooy agreed with Song on the need to highlight the importance
of fruit and vegetable processing, saying that the upcoming
symposium will provide an opportunity share the technologies to
process fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Song and Mooy decided to have another symposium of this kind
held in southern China next year focusing on processing technology
of tropical fruits.
</P>
<P>
Song also met Roberto Castello, deputy director general of the
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), who was also here
to take part in the opening ceremony of the international
symposium, the first of its kind held in China.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is jointly held by the UNESCAP, Asia Pacific
Center for Transfer of Technology (APCTT), the Chinese Academy of
Engineering (CAS), and Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Participants from home and abroad are expected to share new
technology of fruit and vegetable processing, promote
international cooperation, and develop the high-tech industry of
fruits and vegetables.

<HEADLINE> UK's Mandelson May Return to Government: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair may name Peter Mandelson as secretary of Northern Ireland on
Monday, after the former trade minister spent nearly a year in the
political wilderness over a financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
A Reuters report quoted "political sources" as saying that
Mandelson would "definitely" replace Mo Mowlam in the job she has
held since the Labour Party wrested power from the Conservatives
in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
But Blair's office declined to confirm the news, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson, the former secretary of Trade and Industry, resigned
last December amid controversy over his financial affairs, after a
newspaper reported he failed to declare a large home loan from
fellow Minister Geoffrey Robinson.
</P>
<P>
Blair has frequently praised Mandelson as one of the most
brilliant members of Labour's team. Mandelson played a very
important role in Labour's victory over the Conservatives in the
election campaign in 1997, when Blair became the first Labor prime
minister after years in the shadow cabinet.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that Mowlam might move to the Department
of Health to succeed Frank Dobson, who announced on Sunday he was
quitting to seek the Labour nomination for mayor of London.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Cooperative and Its Development in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Cooperative
Alliance (ICA), which was founded in 1895, has grown into one of
the world's biggest non-governmental organizations with 240-plus
members from 120 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
China's supply and marketing cooperatives serve as a bridge
between the government and the 900-million Chinese farmers. Their
top decision-making body is the Cooperative Representatives'
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives (
ACFSMC), established in 1954, is an administrative organ in charge
of more than 30,000 local cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
ACFSMC joined ICA in 1985. Mu Li, deputy board director of
ACFSMC, was elected vice-chairman of the ICA at the ICA conference
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The supply and marketing cooperatives in China have undergone
fundamental reforms since 1982, shifting from a government
department to a popular organization run by Chinese farmers.
Enterprises under local cooperatives have been given increasingly
more power to operate independently.
</P>
<P>
The current goal of each cooperative is to develop itself into
a solely farmers' economic organization, which is expected to play
a bigger role in boosting the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
Up to 180 million Chinese farmers are currently holding
cooperative shares. The annual purchasing and sales volume of
Chinese cooperatives exceeds 100 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Party Announces Fresh Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's major opposition
party on Monday announced a dawn-to-dusk hartal (strike) on
October 21 to protest against "BSF (Border Security Force of
India) aggression in the border areas" and to press home the
opposition's "one-point demand" for the resignation of the
government.
</P>
<P>
This will be the 12th hartal program of the opposition this
year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public meeting at Paltan Maidan in downtown Dhaka,
leader of the opposition in Parliament and Chairperson of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Khaleda Zia said the government
had "totally failed to make protest" against the aggression of the
BSF in the frontier areas where many innocent Bangladeshis were
shot dead by BSF personnel in recent months.
</P>
<P>
"The present government is subservient to India... so, it has
no courage to make any protest against the Indian aggression on
Bangladesh," she told a big rally organized prior to a procession
orrcdvto9"44:)
on city streets in observance of an "anti-aggression day."
</P>
<P>
"The sovereignty of the country and the security of the common
people are now under severe threat," she said, urging the
government to resign and hold fresh elections under a neutral
caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
"If you wants to stay in power, we will call for continuos
hartals," she warned.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader also blamed the government for "harassing
opposition leaders and activists" by filing "false" cases against
them, and demanded the release of all opposition activists
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Destructive strikes are very common in Bangladesh, where
opposition parties call strikes to oppose the ruling party while
the latter adopts anti-strike activities, often resulting in
clashes and causing heavy economic losses.

NEW DELHI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive Index (SENSEX)

<HEADLINE> S. Africa-EU Free Trade Deal Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- South African statesmen
and economists welcomed the signing of a historic free trade pact
between the country and the European Union (EU) in Pretoria on
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
They said that this had paved the way for furthering trade ties
between the two sides, the South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Inkatha Freedom Party said it was relieved that the EU had
come to its senses at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Finance spokesman of the party Gavin Woods said that had this
not been the case, the consequences could have been quite damaging
to the relations between the two sides, not only economically but
also diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
It took negotiators more than four years to clinch the deal.
</P>
<P>
Roelf Meyer, deputy president of the United Democratic
Movement, said that there was no doubt the agreement would benefit
of South African trade.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the signing of the document, the New National Party
expressed the hope that it would take into account the needs of
the "port" and " sherry" industry in the Western Cape.
</P>
<P>
Finance spokesman of the party Pierre Rabie said that producers
had spent a lot of money on existing trade marks and their
interests would have to be looked after.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's access to European markets would pose challenges
to the country's manufacturers, but in the long term should
decrease unemployment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tony Twine, director of Econometrix Company, said it was a
hugely welcome development and that both sides would benefit.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would initially benefit more than Europe because
the latter' s tariffs would be lowered faster, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony at the launch of the African Renaissance
 Institute in Pretoria, South African President Thabo Mbeki
welcomed the breakthrough in the trade deal.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very good decision. The Europeans have thought
properly," he said.
</P>
<P>
South African Minister of Trade and Industry Alec Erwin and EU
Commissioner Toul Nielsen signed on the free trade pact.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Secretary of State Jukka Valpasaari and Ambassadors of
other EU member states also endorsed the document.
</P>
<P>
The accord will liberate about 86 percent of EU imports to
South Africa over 12 years, retaining protection on some items,
including automotive components and textiles.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Monday morning met in a closed-door session to consider
a recommendation by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send a
6,000-strong U.N. peacekeepers into Sierra Leone to promote the
peace process in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
A British draft resolution calls for sending the U.N. troops
for an initial 12-month period to stabilizing the country after
years of civil war, U.N. officials said here.
</P>
<P>
In August, U.N. observers, journalists and civilians were taken
hostage and later released in Sierra Leone by rebels after the
United Nations said it would triple the number of observers in the
country to monitor a July 7 peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his latest report to the Security Council, said that
Sierra Leone, which emerged from a brutal eight-year civil war
with the peace accord, desperately needs international assistance
to prevent another descent into violence and he asked the Security
Council to authorize the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
"Sierra Leone is in urgent need of security," he said in the
15-page report. "Without security, it will not be possible to
carry out the program of disarming and demobilizing approximately
45,000 ex-combatants, many of them children."
</P>
<P>
So far only about 670 rebels have reported to a demobilizing
camp near the capital of Freetown. Annan said U.N. humanitarian
agencies are expected to need at least three times the 22 million
U.S. dollars they have already asked donors for. About half the
210 U.N. military observers promised have been deployed.
</P>
<P>
Annan said his proposal of 6,000 U.N. troops depends on at
least part of the 12,000-member West African peacekeepers, known
as ECOMOG, "remaining in Sierra Leone" and other troops being
deployed to the U.N. If ECOMOG pulls out, a U.N. force of about
10,000 will be required, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan's proposal was well received by the Sierra Leonean
Government, headed by President Ahamed Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people were killed and many more injured
in the civil war, which left Sierra Leone in ruins. More than a
million people have been left homeless and 500,000 fled into
exile.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Hospital Stay Unrelated to Heart Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Health Minister Yuri
Shevchenko said Monday that President Boris Yeltsin's latest
hospital stay was not caused by cardiovascular trouble.
</P>
<P>
The president only has "a common cold," the Interfax news
agency quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, admitted to the Central Clinical Hospital Saturday
with what the Kremlin described as flu and a fever, moved to his
countryside house of Gorki-9 near Moscow Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old president has had health problems for years,
including heart trouble that led to multiple bypass surgery in
1996 and recurring bouts of pneumonia and respiratory infections.
He has also suffered from back pain and a recurring ulcer in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's health had appeared to improve in recent months and
he had been fairly active. He was last hospitalized in February
for a bleeding ulcer.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, a senior Kremlin official denied any knowledge
of whether Yeltsin's doctors had asked U.S. heart surgeon Michael
DeBakey for advice.
</P>
<P>
Igor Shabdurasulov, deputy chief of the presidential staff,
also refuted suggestions that Yeltsin pass his powers to Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
"There is no necessity or advisability even in raising the
issue," Shabdurasulov said.
</P>
<P>
"We all catch diseases. Colds come, cold go. So why should
powers be transferred on any occasion?" he said.
</P>
<P>
He said fanning the issue of power transfer was "an attempt to
drive a wedge between the president and the government, the
presidential administration and the government."

</P>
<P>
TIANJIN, China, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Title favorites Russia
surged from a staggering start to grab the second place of the
qualifying competition behind defending team champion China at the
world gymnastics championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian gymnasts including world and Olympic champion
Alexei Nemov collapsed in their first apparatus on the horizontal
bars.
</P>
<P>
Russia rallied to take the second place with a total of 227.083
points, while hosts China who remained untouchable on the top with
230.546. The third place went to Belarus which collected 226.557
points.
</P>
<P>
Russian pivot Nemov topped the floor exercise with an event-
high 9.737 points and fourth in the pommel horse with 9.737, the
same result shared by his teammate Nikolay Krukov.
</P>

individual finals in the parallel bars with 9.812 and floor

<P>
Defending all-around champion Ivan Ivankov of Belarus had a

competition in 226.382 points, followed by South Korea in 225.319
and the United States in 224.594.

The team finals will be held on Tuesday as China and Romania
are the hot favorites for the men's and women's titles
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Begins Reassessing Thai Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Moody's Investors Service, a
world famous ratings agency, has sent three analysts to Thailand
to conduct reassessment of the country's economic situation, a
well-informed source said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation of the country's economic recovery progress
could lead to a review of the agency's Thailand's sovereign rating
which is now at Ba1, one degree below the investment grade.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been mixed expectation in the local
business sector toward Moody's assessment of the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
Citibank's Anusorn Tamajai, for instance, said he is confident
that Moody's is possible to give Thailand a rating upgrading
within this year.

BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
told visiting Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Frias that closer
ties and cooperation that benefits both their countries are in the
best interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark in his talks with Chavez at the Great
Hall of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the relationship of friendly cooperation
between China and Venezuela has grown steadily since diplomatic
ties were sealed in 1974, and that China is satisfied with this
growth.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, in recent years the two countries kept
frequent high-level exchanges, enhanced mutual understanding,
expanded trade links, scored tangible results in economic and
technical cooperation, and increased cultural and educational
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In the field of international affairs, Jiang said the two
countries also supported and worked closely with each other.
</P>
<P>
"Both China and Venezuela are developing countries and face the
common task of ensuring peace and development," Jiang said, adding
that China is willing to make concerted efforts with Venezuela for
the buildup of long-term, stable, and comprehensive friendly
bilateral ties.

Jiang said that Venezuela has abundant natural resources,
diligent and brave people and a glorious tradition. The Venezuelan
government and people have worked to safeguard state sovereignty,
revitalize the national economy and improve people's lives, and
such efforts have borne remarkable achievements, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, President Chavez is leading the Venezuelan
government and people to overcome difficulties in the process of
political and social reform, Jiang said, adding that China
sincerely wished the reform would succeed.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said he was delighted to make the visit at the time of
New China's 50th anniversary. During the visit he saw the
prosperous and festive atmosphere and China's achievements over
the past five decades.
</P>
<P>
He told the host that his mission on this tour is to develop
friendly cooperation with China on behalf of the Venezuelan people.
To illustrate his point that geographic distance does not threaten
the relationship, Chavez quoted a Chinese poem, saying, "If in
this world an understanding friend survives, then the ends of the
earth seem like next door."
</P>
<P>
"The Venezuelan people hope the bilateral cooperation and
friendship can be as eternal and solid as the Great Wall," he

<HEADLINE> Singapore Rejects Western Model Social Safety Net </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Singapore official
Monday indicated that his country will not set up a western-model
social safety net but will pursue a different system best suited
for Singaporeans.
</P>
<P>
While debating at the parliament on Singapore President S. R.
Nathan's address on government policy a week ago, MP and Minister
Without Portfolio Lim Boon Heng brushed aside calls for the
setting up of social safety nets modeled by the west and
reiterated that there were different solutions in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Lim said "some people, both Singaporeans and foreigners,
mistakenly think we are grossly lacking in not setting a social
safety net. But that is because they see the social safety net as
the one modeled by the west."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fact that Singapore does not have unemployment
benefits pegged to the last-drawn pay as some other countries do,
Lim spoke highly of his country's provision for retrenchment
benefits, saying it does not necessarily mean "ours is deficient."
</P>
<P>
"In most countries, home ownership is 60 percent. Ours is 90
percent," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore one major household expenditure - rents - is not an
issue for most of our people," he added.
</P>
<P>
On calls for a minimum wage which Singapore does not have, Lim
said his country does "have subsidized public housing and the
subsidized public scheme is actually another way of delivering
what the minimum wage concept tries to deliver."
</P>
<P>
Elaborating in his analysis on which operating system is best
suitable for his city state to allow companies to be competitive
and at the same time to maintain social harmony, Lim said the
United States has been able to create more jobs and has lower
unemployment than Europe but wage disparity in the United States
is far wider than in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that the European model is unsuitable to his
country as well, saying that wage disparity is far narrower in
Europe but the social security system is struggling with many
choosing to remain unemployed rather than to take jobs with lower
pay.
</P>
<P>
On one hand immigrants from Central Europe and North Africa
take up those lower-value, lower-pay jobs and on the other the
unemployed applied political pressure for higher unemployment
benefits through staging demonstrations led by unions, Lim noted.
</P>
<P>
Citing Singapore's policy to ensure less-skilled workers would
not price themselves out of the market, Lim said a system that
provides more people with dignity of work is better than that
where the unemployed or unemployable live on the backs of those
who work.
</P>
<P>
"So there should be no monopoly of effective ideas for social
safety nets...there should be a free market for different ideas,"
Lim concluded.

policy of independence and self-reliance in international affairs,
upholds state sovereignty and hopes to push forward state-to-state
understanding and cooperation in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said the attempt to build up a single-polar world is a
dangerous move, and said he stands for the multi-polarization
process. Henceforth, Venezuela hopes China and the whole Asian
continent would maintain the development momentum so as to push
forward the multi-polarization process in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Chavez also briefed each other the domestic situation
of their countries.

<HEADLINE> 4 Injured at Gymnastics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Four gymnasts have been injured
at the world gymnastics championships with Aleman Manvel of Mexico
still in Tianjin Hospital.
</P>
<P>
"All the cases were not very serious in the doctors' point of
view," championships' chief doctor Liu Keqiang said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Manvel, the most seriously injured among the four, lost his
consciousness when he fell on the ground with his head during a
warm-up floor exercise two days ago, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
Manvel suffered a broken neck reminiscent of a tragedy of
Chinese women gymnast Sang Lang, who was paralyzed after a
training accident during the Goodwill Games in New York last year.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Manvel did not hurt his nerve like Sang Lan and he
would fully recover for sure, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Yong Chol Ri strained his right ankle in the men's
vault competition.
</P>
<P>
"Yong Chol Ri suffered a swollen ankle and could not stand or
walk afterwards. He got a fractured ankle," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Yong Chol Ri is expected to fully recover in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Finland's Jani Tanskanen, the 1997 world champion on high bar,
suffered a dislocated shoulder when he fell off the high bar in
Monday morning's qualifying competition.
</P>
<P>
Manvel has had himself insured by a Mexican company while Yong
is insured by the the Chinese People's Insurance Company.

ISLAMABAD, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani authorities
Monday arrested 22 Afghan nationals, most of them are believed to
be Taliban, who crossed into Pakistani border in north Waziristan.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the paramilitary frontier corps
arrested the Afghan nationals when they crossed into Pakistani
territory at the Ghulam Khan Check Post.
</P>
<P>
The arrest came after Pakistan stepped up monitoring at
Pak-Afghan border in the wake of recent sectarian killings in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the detained Afghans did not have any
document.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said last week that the
people who received training in Afghanistan's camps are involved
in sectarian killings in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, however, have denied the claims and said there is
no terrorist camp in Afghanistan.

About 30 people have been killed in Pakistan as a result of

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA) said Monday that it will continue to coordinate with
Vietnam to help the successfully implement its population and
development program.
</P>
<P>
Omer Ertus, the UNFPA representative in Vietnam, at a press
conference held here on world population, praised the Vietnamese
government for having taken the population work seriously by
issuing proper policies to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA official also said that Vietnam has been dealing well
with those issues of global concern, such as reducing hunger and
poverty, increasing women's power, curbing pollution, expanding
education and improving people's health.
</P>
<P>
For the 1996-2000 period, the UNFPA has implemented 19 projects
in Vietnam, including eight in reproductive health care, one in
gender equality promotion, two in improving policy-makers'
;:@")/(@;1"760',:@5(4.44)crfttneqcrkro
awareness about population and development and a similar project
for the press circle.
</P>
<P>
The fund has also provided technical help to Vietnam in
developing a population strategy for the 2001-2010 period, a
national plan of actions regarding population work, and in
improving the accessibility of family planning service.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, Vietnam has seen a remarkable decrease
in birth rate. A Vietnamese woman in the child-bearing group now
has an average of almost 2.4 children compared to 3.8 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The country's average life expectancy is 64 for men and 69 for
women.
</P>
<P>
However, Chairwoman of Vietnam's State Committee for Population
and Family Planning Tran Thi Trong Chien said that Vietnam still
has much to do to improve the quality, structure and distribution
of its population.

<HEADLINE> China Succeeds in Scaling Down Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China successfully scaled down
the annual natural growth rate of its population to below one
percent by the end of last year, lower than the figures of other
developing countries, the National Bureau of Statistics announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
The achievement meets the target set by the UN International
Conference on Population and Development years ago, which required
member countries to realize the one-percent growth rate goal by
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Although China is currently in its third peak of population
growth, it has upheld the family planning policy by working hard
to meet its goals, the bureau said in a press release today.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau's statistics, China's population was
one-fifth of the world's total by 1998, instead of one-fourth a
decade ago, with each woman giving birth to 1.8 children on
average.
</P>
<P>
China's population reached one billion in 1981, surpassed 1.1
billion in 1988 and exceeded 1.2 billion in 1995. Experts forecast
a population of 1.3 billion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Because of factors such as the large population, relatively
poor resources and an underdeveloped economy, it is necessary for
China to continue its family planning policy to control population
growth and improve population quality in the coming decades, the
bureau reported.
</P>
<P>
Based on its policy suggestion, the bureau predicted that China
will witness a zero population growth rate in 40 years, with its
population peaking at about 1.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Centenarians Receive Color TVs From Government in SW Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Acting Governor Zhang Zhongwei
of Sichuan Province handed a color TV set to Chen Suyun, a 106-
year-old woman who was representing all local centenarians, at a
ceremony here today.
</P>
<P>
The provincial committee of the Communist Party of China and
government of Sichuan presented a color TV set to each of the
local centenarians as a show of respect and concern.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, with more than 80 million people, is the third most
populous province in China, and has 1,083 people over 100 years of
age, about one-tenth of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Local people in this southwestern province enjoy longevity as a
result of their unique life-style, drinking more tea, among other
things, than people living in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at all levels in Sichuan have given priority
to caring for the centenarians, and during traditional festivals,
government officials often pay visits to this most elderly group
of people.
</P>
<P>
Local governments also pay a monthly subsidy to the
centenarians, at different rates in different localities,
depending on local revenues. Jian'ge County, the most generous of
all, pays 150 yuan a month to every centenarian.

<HEADLINE> Congo Criticizes U.N. for Delay In Sending Peace-keepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) Monday took a swipe at the United
Nations for delaying in sending peace-keeping forces to the
war-torn central African country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency in Harare, DRC
Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Ndomasi Yerodia lambasted the U.N. for
delaying in sending peace-keepers to his country, despite several
appeals by his government and other southern African leaders to
speed up the deployment of troops.
</P>
<P>
Yerodia noted that the U.N. responded with urgency to conflicts
 besieging other parts of the world, such as what happened in the
Kosovo and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Lusaka peace accord, the DRC
government, together with southern African leaders, had been
lobbying the U.N. to send troops to the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
"We have made a lot of appeals to the United Nations. I
personally met the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
Security Council and I asked them to send troops now," Yerodia
said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. is saying that they sent 90 observers, how can 90
people observe such a big country? Look at how they reacted to
East Timor. How many did they send? There is a lot of injustice.
 We have been pushing them to act," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the current situation in the DRC, the foreign minister said
the rebels continued to violate the Lusaka cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Yerodia said the situation had not changed and hope now lay
with the deployment of peace-keepers.
</P>
<P>
"We signed the agreement in July, but they (rebels and their
allies) are still violating the agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to the DRC after the
war broke out in early August last year when the rebels backed
allegedly by Rwanda and Uganda launched an attempt to topple
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of troops will only start after the U.N. has
deployed a peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the Zimbabwean government thought the withdrawal
will start in November or December this year.

<HEADLINE> Experts Say Family Planning is Key To China's Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Tomorrow is the day the world
population is expected to hit six billion -- a historic moment
that would have come sooner had China failed to bring its
population growth under control, according to Chinese demographers.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium here today marking "World Day of Six Billion
People," experts agreed that the country's family planning policy
will have to be in effect for a long time to come if the world's
most-populated country wants to achieve sustainable development in
the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
"Without taking effective measures to slow down the rapid
growth of its population, China would have 300 million people more
than current figure of 1.248 billion, and 'World Day of Six
Billion People' would have come much earlier," said Zhang Weiqing,
minister in charge of State Family Planning Commission (SFPC).
</P>
<P>
Professor Lin Fude, a researcher with the Demographic Institute
of the People's University in Beijing, believes that the country
would have been excessively burdened if those people had been born.
</P>
<P>
Demographers predict that China's population might reach its
peak by the year 2031. "In order to achieve the goal of grain
sufficiency and sustainable development by that time, China should
make sure that the population-control policy remains unchanged,"
Professor Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The experts also discussed the world's and China's population
in the coming century, China's population and sustainable
development, the guidelines of China's family planning policy, and
they also make suggestions for strengthening family planning work.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Cabinet Likely to Be Reshuffled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina is likely to reshuffle her cabinet following the Election
Commission's verdict on Monday which vacated the parliamentary
seats of two opposition law-makers who joined her government last
year.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Alauddin Ahmed and Hasibur Rahman Swapan, who were
elected parliament members as candidates of the major opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in the general elections in
1996, joined the Awami League cabinet last year as the state
minister for water resources and the deputy minister for
industries respectively.
</P>
<P>
The two would have to quit the cabinet after losing their
parliamentary seats, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the ministers who have proved themselves incompetent
might be asked to quit so as to pave way for the new, a report in
The New Nation newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that Amir Hussain Amu, who acted as the
party president last month when Hasina was on a visit to New York
and Paris, would be inducted in the cabinet, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Rafiqul Islam, who was relieved of the Home Ministry
and made minister without portfolio in March this year, is likely
to get a portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Nasim, who is in charge of both the Home Ministry and
the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, would have to give up
the portfolio of the post and telecommunications to a new man,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
And Mohammad Abdus Salam, chairman of Bangladesh Red Crescent
Society, is likely to be a new comer and given the Health
Ministry, the report said.

<HEADLINE> HK Initiates Plan to Enhance Transparency of Futures Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Futures
Exchange (HKFE) announced Monday a five-point plan to enhance
transparency on the trading floor.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which has been reviewed informally with the Security
and Futures Commission (SFC), presents the detailed measures
including a requirement that members install recording devices on
all telephones located at the floor booths and a ban on untaped
mobile communications devices on the trading floor.
</P>
<P>
Also included are the deployment of additional exchange
resources for surveillance of cross-trade, an enhanced price-
reporting system and market-opening procedures.
</P>
<P>
A new floor conduct committee has been appointed by the HKFE to
build on the plan, according to a senior official for the HKFE.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the five-point plan and establishment of the
committee is to provide members and their clients an extra measure
of confidence leading up to the migration of Hang Seng Index
Futures and Options to Hong Kong Automated Trading System early
next year, William D. Grossman, acting chief executive of the HKFE,
told a press conference Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is important for self-regulation to become a
badge of quality for the Hong Kong Futures Exchange, and for Hong
Kong as an international financial center, so the exchange may be
better able to attract both local and international investors,"
Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining a proper environment on the trading floor has
always been a top priority," added Mark Ho, head of the compliance
department. "We are strengthening a very sound system."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Futures Exchange is a leading futures and options
market place in the Asia-Pacific region, with a membership of over
130 companies, including a number of major international
institutions. The exchange is actively diversifying its product
base, which now includes currency, interest rate and equity-based
products.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls for Efforts to Improve Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Monday called for more efforts to improve domestic
production and exports of non-oil goods in order to develop an
oil-free economy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first national labor seminar here, Khatami
stressed the need for promotion of knowledge, appreciation of
national interests and political maturity of workers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"While oil should be valued as a divine asset, efforts must be
made to turn it into an earthly capital," he said, quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Citing the issue of employment as a pivotal axis of the third
five-year development plan (2000-2005), Khatami said that the
government is pre-occupied with finding a solution to the problem
of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Under the five-year plan, 3.8 million job opportunities should
be created in the country, which is an unprecedented figure in the
history of the nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Khatami noted, solving the problem of unemployment
demands national mobilization and determination as well as
solidarity among various forces and officials.
</P>
<P>
The government should take further steps to train skilled
manpower in technical and vocational fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for creating an atmosphere of dialog
between laborers and employers, saying that dialog is a symbol of
human life and dialog in its real sense will remove violence from
the scene of humanity.

<HEADLINE> China Making Giant Bell to Mark New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China is manufacturing a giant
bronze bell, the largest of its kind in the world, to ring in the
new millennium and commemorate the key events China has
experienced in this century.
</P>
<P>
The 50-ton bell will be 6.8 meters high and 3.38 meters wide,
bigger than the famous Yongle Bell, currently the world's largest,
which is located in the Big Bell Temple in northwestern Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the body of the bell will be carved with the words
to the national anthem as well as symbols that represent moments
in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
The idea to make the bell came from some leaders of non-
Communist parties and celebrities without party affiliation, and
has been supported by the Beijing Municipal Government as part of
the new millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The bell is set to be finished in December and will be rung on
the evening of January 1, 2000. China Central Television (CCTV)
will air a live broadcast on the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Early Decision on Wage Petitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada reiterated Monday his order to the Department of Labor and
Employment (DOLE) to make an early decision on the petitions for
wage adjustments.
</P>
<P>
The president said, however, that this does not mean that the
DOLE should come up with a hurried decision since the issue
involves balancing the interests of labor and management to ensure
that jobs are preserved and businesses continue to remain
operational.
</P>
<P>
"This involves not only the labor and the employer, but also
other factors such as the inflation rate. We have to think of
that," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said in a news release
that five regional wage and productivity boards are expected to
make a decision on petitions for increases in the minimum wage
before the end of October.
</P>
<P>
But Barican maintained that the demand for a nationwide
125-peso (3.125 U.S. dollars) daily wage hike may produce adverse
side effects on the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said this may threaten the viability of businesses,
particularly small and medium enterprises, which comprise 95
percent of the privately-owned companies in Metro Manila alone.
</P>
<P>
"It will lead to higher inflation, thus eroding further the
purchasing power of workers whom we want to protect," Barican
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Barican said, such a wage hike can result in a
"significant increase in unemployment."
</P>
<P>
Citing estimates from the National Economic Development
Authority, Barican said a nationwide 53-peso (1.3 dollars) daily
wage increase will result in an average inflation rate greater
than 12 percent in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
This estimate will shoot up further with a 125-peso daily wage
hike, he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Hosts Conference of Presidents of Open University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Over 60 university presidents
and senior academic leaders representing 56 institutions and
organizations from 20 countries and regions gathered in Hong Kong
Monday to discuss important issues in distance education and forge
the way ahead.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, named the Standing Conference of
Presidents of Open and Distance Learning Institutions (SCOP), is
sponsored by the Open University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This is for the first time that the International Council for
Open and Distance Education (ICDE) held its annual meeting in Hong
Kong since it was founded in 1938.
</P>
<P>
The conference is an international forum for inter-
institutional cooperation, partnership building, networking,
strategic development and capacity building.
</P>
<P>
This year's meeting will focus on the theme of resource and
management implications of delivering courses via the Internet,
institutional collaboration and the potential of research for
improving the quality in distance education.
</P>
<P>
Joseph W. P. Wong, secretary for Education and Manpower of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government,
attended the opening ceremony of the conference, saying that the
ICDE has dedicated itself to the promotion of international
cooperation in distance education and open learning throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is privileged to be part of this network, and is
committed to promoting lifelong learning and to marking education
available to all those who aspire to it," Wong said. "As the world
becomes increasingly globalized and information-based,
international collaboration has assumed a more important role," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"With the explosive spread of the Internet and the rapid
development of electronic communication links, we have arrived at
a crucial stage in the further evolution of open and distance
learning, said Charles Lee Yeh-kwong, council chairman of the Open
University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Founded 10 years ago, the university emerged as one of the most
dynamic and fast-growing learning institutions in Hong Kong
serving the needs of 25,000 adult students in its programs.
</P>
<P>
In his 1999 Policy Address published last Wednesday, the HKSAR
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa announced two new initiatives to
earmark 6.4 million U.S. dollars as a one-off grant to support the
university's development of a regional learning center.

the region, particularly in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Barak made this call here Monday during his meeting with

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The High Court of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region has given its sanction to the
merger terms of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and Hong Kong
Futures Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Charles Lee, chairman of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing
Ltd. (HKEC), an entity set up earlier this year for the
preparation work of the proposed merger, Monday expressed his
welcome to the sanction by the court.
</P>
<P>
"This will pave the way further for the proposed
demutualization and merger of the exchanges and the clearing
houses, and we look forward to the enactment of the enabling
legislation for the merger in the next few months," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The HKEC preparatory board is actively working with the
government on the necessary preparation for the implementation of
the merger around end January/early February next year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an open recruitment for the chief executive officer
and chief operating officer for HKEC has already started.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the HKEC will shortly engage a consultancy firm to
work out the organizational and remuneration structures on the
basis of the second policy paper published by the government on
July 8, 1999, with a view to finalizing the detailed structures
and human resources plan prior to the merger.
</P>
<P>
Lee reiterated that during the interim before the merger came
into being, he and his fellow directors would strive to work
closely with the incumbent leadership and staff of the two
exchanges and the clearing houses for the smooth and proper
functioning of the financial market.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Fails to Improve 1999 Budget Financing: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has failed to improve
the financing of the 1999 budget, Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the impressive performance of our revenues during the
year, this revenue was surpassed by social and development
expenditure demands," the minister said at the opening of a
two-day pre-budget seminar for parliamentarians and civil society.
</P>
<P>
He said the domestic debt was now pegged at more than 51
billion Zimbabwean dollars (1.34 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We had to settle for domestic borrowing since we did not make
significant progress with foreign borrowing from multilateral
sources," Murerwa said.
</P>
<P>
The revenue base had been declining due to factors which
included closure of manufacturing companies, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said unbudgeted expenditure had contributed
to the prevailing macro-economic environment, especially interest
on loans, wage bill, grants, pensions and operational expenses of
various ministries.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry was working out the modalities of
containing budgetary expenditures for each ministry for the second
half of 1999 to meet the fiscal deficit target.
</P>
<P>
The unstable macro-economic environment had resulted in very
low levels of economic growth, company closures, poverty and
social problems like corruption, he added.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa pointed out that negative foreign media coverage had
made it difficult for Zimbabwe to raise off-shore financing
because country risk had been rated very high.
</P>
<P>
"This means that the fiscal deficit had to be financed locally
at very high interest rates, further increasing government
expenditure on interest," he said.
</P>
<P>
The major challenges encountered in the 1999 budget were
inflation, unemployment, macro economic instability and low
economic and investment growth, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is the third of its kind, which began in 1997and
aimed at enabling civil society to take part in the budget
formulation.
</P>
<P>
About 50 members of parliament, economists, bankers and members
of civil society are attending the workshop.

<P>
TIANJIN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavian gymnasts came to
the world championships with the war memory, gratitude for China
and confidence to regain their past glory.
</P>
<P>
With the international sanctions yet to be lifted, they are
still struggling with the war aftermath and could not afford to
participate in the championships which opened on Friday.
</P>
<P>
When they almost sank into despondency, the Chinese showed
their compassion and generosity by offering the Yugoslavian
gymnasts free lodging and boarding and paid their round trips.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first international meet for our gymnasts after
the war. If the championships were not held in China, we would not
come," said Madic Dejan, head of the Yugoslavian delegation on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I have felt strong and deep compassion and hospitality from
the Chinese friends to the Yugoslavians who are in trouble, and I
feel it every step we make here," said Madic.
</P>
<P>
"Whether at airport or downtown, I can feel it. The other day,
I went downtown and some people recognized me, they raised their
thumbs, saying 'Good'."
</P>
<P>
"We are proud people, we did not lose our hope. We will rebuild
our homes with our own strength," said Madic.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, our team games are very successful, our
basketball are world champions, volleyball are world second best
and water polo are the third best. So this is connected with our
spirit and our character."
</P>
<P>
The war has torn the country but did not shake the nation.
</P>
<P>
Madic shown some picture albums which featured the broken
bridges, destroyed civilian facilities. He fallen into the memory
as he pointed to a bridge of Novi Sad, the second biggest city of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I was born there, and we regard the bridges as the soul of the
city," said Madic. "The bridges were broken, but our heart was not
broken, though it was hard for us."
</P>
<P>
Madic said that they had problems with training and nearly
missed the championships.
</P>
<P>
"We had problems with the preparation. During the war one of
our coaches was in the army and his charges had to work by
themselves. and we also had problems with the trip to here. Thanks
to your support we came here."
</P>
<P>
"We came here just to compete, to be there. The most important
thing is that we come." said Madic."Under your support, our
success is not the medal but the presence at the championships."
</P>
<P>
Having been strong in gymnastics in the 1960s, Madic has put
his eyesight on resuming their past glory though now it has still
a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
"Ten years, after ten years we will bring back the glory for
Yugoslavian gymnastics." said Madic.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Agrees to Talk on Combating Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Supreme leader of
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban Mullah Omar Monday said his militia
is ready for talks with everyone in the world on combating
terrorism, the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) said.
</P>
<P>
"It is beyond justice that today no distinction is drawn
between terrorists and mujahideen (holy warriors) in the world,"
Omar said in a statement from Kandahar, the Taliban's headquarters
in southwestern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Omar told the United States and other countries "not to
threaten mujahideen with the label of "terrorists," said the AIP.
</P>
<P>
Omar, whose militia controls over 80 percent of the war-torn
country, said his country had never been a bastion for terrorism
in history. "We have never been terrorists nor do we support
terrorists."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Washington imposed economic sanctions on the
Taliban, accusing the militia of protecting alleged Saudi
terrorist Osama bin Laden, who was suspected to have masterminded
the bomb blasts at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last
year.
</P>
<P>
Recently Pakistan, one of the three countries which recognize
the Taliban as the legal ruler of Afghanistan, said some
terrorists trained in camps in the territory of Afghanistan had
been involved in sectarian violence in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban rejected both accusations, saying that Washington
had failed to provide any evidence on Osama's involvement in
terrorism and that it allows no use of its soil for any terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
Omar said the international community had hailed the presence
of Muslim holy warriors in Afghanistan during the Soviet
occupation in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Most of the mujahideen had gone back to their native countries
following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Taliban head said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that some of the mujahideen who "are now being
dubbed as terrorists", including Osama bin Laden, had stayed in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The world should draw a distinction between terrorists and
mujahideen," he maintained.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Reactivate Economic Cooperation at Global Level: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will re-activate
economic cooperation at global level especially with friendly
nations, a senior Malaysian official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Our economic situation has now improved following recovery
efforts by the government. Hence, activities linked to economic
cooperation at international level especially with friendly
countries will resume," Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi told a press conference after meeting Iran's Consultative
Assembly First Vice Speaker Hassan Rouhani at his office in
Putrajaya near here.
</P>
<P>
Economic-related activities particularly trade were slightly
affected by the economic downturn faced by Malaysia, Abdullah
said.
</P>
<P>
He said he informed Rouhani that Malaysia welcomed Iran's plan
to enhance cooperation in all economic fields that would benefit
both countries and that Petronas, Malaysia's national oil
corporation, would proceed with its investments in oil and gas
sectors in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia appreciated Iran's decision to increase
the consumption of palm oil for food production in that country.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Iran could be the gateway to complement
Malaysia's plan to boost trade ties with West Asian countries via
its Bandar Abbas Port which he said could be used to bring in
Malaysian goods for the West Asian market and also import products
from the region back to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Rouhani valued the cooperation extended to Iran by
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Rouhani, heading a six-member delegation, is on a week-long
official visit to Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Guinea to Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Malaysia and
the Republic of Guinea Monday expressed their desire to strengthen
cooperation beneficial to both countries.
</P>
<P>
There is great potential for cooperation in the agricultural
sector in the Republic of Guinea which is rich in fertile land
ideal for rice, sugar cane and tropical fruits, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said at a joint news conference with
visiting Guinean President Lansana Conte after their talks in
Putrajaya near here.
</P>
<P>
There is also scope for cooperation in producing palm oil,
rubber and other agricultural products in Guinea, Mahathir said,
adding that Malaysia is keen to explore the possibility of setting
up oil palm and rubber estates in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether Guinea could expect an increase in
Malaysian assistance in other fields apart from the investment in
the agricultural sector, Mahathir said, "We would like to increase
but we are constrained by the fact that our economy has not fully
recovered."
</P>
<P>
"But to the extent that we can, we would like to take our part
in the economic development of Guinea," he added.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would like to learn Guinea's experience through
exchange of officers, Mahathir said, stressing that this would
allow both countries to learn how development projects were being
carried out in each country.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Conte said the agreements and Memoranda of
Understanding signed Monday between Malaysia and Guinea would
strengthen their bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We want to see that our cooperation (with Malaysia)
is beneficial to the people of the two countries. If we think that
our cooperation is not beneficial to our people, then we abandon
it. But, we will do everything possible so that our cooperation is
beneficial to the people of Malaysia and the people of Guinea."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Malaysia and the Republic of Guinea signed two
agreements on trade and information cooperation and two memoranda
of understanding on education cooperation and for the
establishment of sister-ports relationship between the Port Klang
Authority and Autonome De Conakry.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir and Conte witnessed the signing of the agreements and
the memoranda of understanding.
</P>
<P>
The Guinean president, accompanied by a 33-member delegation,
arrived here Sunday for a three-day visit at the invitation of
Malaysian King Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Election Commission Vacates Disputed Parliamentary Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Election Commission
(EC) in a verdict on Monday vacated the parliamentary seats of two
lawmakers of the major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) who joined the government last year, on charges of crossing
the floor.
</P>
<P>
"Having considered all the written and oral statements and in
the light of relevant constitutional provisions, it is ordered
that... the seats of Mr. Hasibur Rahman Swapan... and Dr. Md.
Alauddin... stand vacated with immediate effect" in accordance
with relevant articles of the Bangladesh Constitution, the verdict
said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Election Commissioner Mohammad Abu Hena pronounced the
verdict in the conference room of the commission.
</P>
<P>
The two members of parliament, Mohammad Alauddin Ahmed and
Hasibur Rahman Swapan, who were both elected as BNP candidates in
the general elections in 1996, took oath as ministers in the Awami
League cabinet last year.
</P>
<P>
The commission, a quasi-judicial institution, also ordered that
the verdict be immediately communicated to the speaker of the
Jatiya Sangsad, the country's parliament.
</P>
<P>
Hena said that considering the facts and circumstance of the
case and the law involved, "we are of the opinion" that the two
members of parliament had "resigned" from the BNP, which nominated
them in the 1996 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the pronouncement of the verdict, counsel of
the two defendants M.R. Hassan verbally submitted an appeal urging
the commission to stay the order for one month. He said his
clients would file a writ petition against the verdict in the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
On a writ petition filed by BNP chief whip Khandker Delwar
Hossain and Deputy Leader of the Opposition A.Q.M. Badruddoza
Chowdhury, a High Court Division Bench in August 1998 directed the
speaker to refer the matter of dispute over two BNP
parliamentarians' floor-crossing to the EC within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Supreme Court also asked the parliament
secretariat to send the matter to the EC following a prayer by
Badruddoza Chowdhury and Khandkar Delwar Hossain seeking disposal
of the matter of "floor crossing" by their members of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Address Waste Issue in Former U.S. Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
assured the public Monday that all required studies and actions
are now being undertaken to address the environmental and health
concerns at the two former U.S. military facilities in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said a technical working
group (TWG) tackling the issue agreed at a meeting last week to
draw up a second action plan to address the toxic waste problem in
the former U.S. military bases in Clark and Subic.
</P>
<P>
"For this purpose, the Philippine Task Force-TWG will be
conducting an ocular inspection in Clark on October 15, which is a
vital prerequisite for identifying the specific actions to be
undertaken by the task force," Barican said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The contents of the action plan, according to Barican, will be
fleshed out in a workshop to be held in the first or second week
of November this year.
</P>
<P>
The action plan will be separate and distinct from the first
action plan on bases cleanup recently finalized by the Philippine
Task Force, he said.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the United States has proposed the establishment
of a bilateral experts panel on bases cleanup involving the Clark
Development Corporation of the Philippines and the Civil
Engineering Research Foundation of the United States.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper report said Weston International, a known research
firm, made a study in 1997 and found that at least 14 areas at
Clark were contaminated with toxic chemicals such as dieldrin and
heptachlor.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Monday temporarily
suspended fishing concession in Myanmar waters by Thai fishing
vessels, according to a government statement released here Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The suspension came 10 days after the end of siege of the
Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok and taking of hostages by five Myanmar
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The Information Sheet quoted the sources at the Myanmar
Ministry of Fisheries as saying that there are altogether 106 Thai
fishing vessels that were officially granted concession on a
monthly basis to fish in Myanmar waters before the suspension.
</P>
<P>
The 106 Thai fishing vessels were reportedly to have returned
to Ranong, a Thai seaport town opposite to Myanmar's Kawthoung.
</P>
<P>
The statement also quoted the independent observers as saying
that "Both Myanmar and the Thai side firmly believe that apart
from the 106 fishing vessels which have returned to Ranong, the
rest are illegal fishing vessels poaching in Myanmar waters for
decades creating problems not only for Myanmar but also for
Bangladesh and India."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar warned a few days ago that the recent siege
of the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok by Myanmar gunmen could bring
about some adverse effect on the bilateral relations between
Thailand and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The present suspension of fishing concession in Myanmar waters
by Thai vessels is also seen as a response by the Myanmar side
over Thailand's handling of the Myanmar embassy seizure.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Introduce New Policy on Official Development Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government plans to
introduce a new assessment system on official development
assistance (ODA) projects in fiscal 2000 at the earliest to boost
the transparency of the selection process, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, an effectiveness assessment on a project
will be conducted before it is launched instead of afterward as is
the current practice, Kyodo quoted government sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Japan International Cooperation Agency and the now defunct
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), which are responsible
for implementing ODA projects, investigate possible projects
before decisions on ODA projects are made. But their investigation
results are not made public.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Foreign and Finance ministries plan to apply the
new system to certain new ODA projects in fiscal 2000 and to
gradually expand the scope of projects.
</P>
<P>
The OECF and the Export-Import Bank of Japan merged October 1
under the name Japan Bank for International Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The lack of transparency has drawn criticism from non-
governmental organizations and other observers as leaving room for
corruption in recipient countries.
</P>
<P>
The two ministries plan to introduce numerical criteria that
would enable third-party observers to gauge objectively what
favorable effects have generated in relation to the size of the
ODA outlay, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
If a project is found to be less effective, the Japanese
government will revise it with the consent of the recipient
country, they said.
</P>
<P>
Japan budgeted 1,048.9 billion yen (9.8 billion U.S. dollars)
for ODA projects in fiscal 1999, which ends next March 31. It is
expected that the ODA-related budget will remain almost the same
in fiscal 2000.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sees Fewer Labor Strikes This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Labor strikes in the Philippines
declined by 44 percent to only 46 during the period from January
to September this year as compared to 82 in the same period of
last year, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A report of the DOLE indicated that as a result of the decline
in strikes this year, the number of workers affected also
decreased by 64 percent to only 10,390 from over 29,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The DOLE's National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB)
said the total man-days lost due to strikes so far also
correspondingly went down by 73 percent to 129,000.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the decline in strikes around the country
to the maturity and sincerity on the part of labor and employers
in seeking and finding effective ways and means to avert and
settle their disputes.
</P>
<P>
It also cited the prompt efforts of the NCMB to avert strikes
by assisting labor and management to settle the disputes affecting
them.
</P>
<P>
The report said efforts to avert strikes and to resolve the
labor disputes this year should crown that made by the DOLE
throughout this decade to strengthen the foundations of industrial
peace in the interest of the nation's well-being and progress.
</P>
<P>
The DOLE expects strikes not to exceed 80 this year -- the
lowest in the decade. The number of strikes fell to less than 100
in the middle of this decade from close to 200 in 1990.

<HEADLINE> China: Largest Eel Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Statistics from the Fishery
Bureau under the Ministry of Agriculture indicate that China's eel
output now accounts for some 70 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, eel breeding acreage had reached 10,
000 hectares with an annual output of 160,000 tons. Nearly 50 eel
processing and over 100 eel fodder enterprises had been set up,
and their annual production capacity stand at 100,000 tons and 350,
000 tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that last year, the eel sector employed 85,000
people, turned out an output value of 26 billion yuan and turned
over nearly one billion yuan in taxes.
</P>
<P>
Lin Meijiao of the Fishery Bureau said that more than 70
percent of the eels produced in China are exported to Japan and
some other countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, eel exports earned more than 900 million US dollars,
accounting for 30 percent of the nation's total aquatic product
exports.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the eel industry has also boosted the
growth of regional economies. In 1995, the eel output value of
Fuqing City in east China's Fujian Province hit 5 billion yuan as
the sector turned over 120 million yuan in taxes, accounting for
33 percent of the city's total income.
</P>
<P>
But Lin warned that too much dependence on exports will leave
the country's eel industry extremely vulnerable to price changes
in the international market.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China exported 360,000 tons of roasted eels to Japan
and earned 860 million US dollars, but the unit price tumbled more
than half in 1998 due to the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
She called for greater efforts to tap the domestic market in
order to sustain the steady development of the country's eel
industry.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the annual eel consumption in China is less than 400,
000 tons. Lin said that efforts should be made to produce more eel
products that suit the taste of domestic consumers.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Warri Crisis Hopeful to Be Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Delegates representing the
militant youths of the three rival communities in Nigeria's
strife-torn Warri area have pledged their commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting on Sunday, representatives from Ijaw,
Itsekiri and Urhobo communities announced the forming of a new
association named Warri Peace Vanguard, the Guardian newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new association will hopefully end the decades long
conflict killing thousands of people and threatened to scare away
foreign oil firms from the oil city.
</P>
<P>
This move was made in the spirit of the "peace initiatives" by
the government, religious groups, traditional rulers and private
agencies, organizers of the meeting were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo paid an urgent visit only
weeks after stepping into power to the region following the ethnic
clash killed hundreds of people and ravaged the whole Warri city.
</P>
<P>
The three ethnic groups had come under one umbrella "where we
will speak with one voice on matters affecting our common
interests, common purpose and common destiny", Itsekiri
representative Lucky Pessu said at a press conference after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It is important we live in a peaceful environment," Urhobo
representative Anthony Ogbodu said. "The government should take
note of the peace vanguard as a consensus by Warri youths to
declare for peace."
</P>
<P>
The newly-founded association listed a six-point peace plan
which includes supporting the government's peace programs,
mobilizing community development, and promoting a peaceful way of
life.
</P>
<P>
Poverty is believed to be at the root of the conflict in the
area. Despite Warri's fame as an oil producing hub, its residents
are living under the average means of the country.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo has been pledging to reform the current oil revenue
distribution formula among the oil firms, federal and local
government.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Chinese Call for More Job Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A non-governmental organization
for the 60 million disabled Chinese today called for more job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The China Disabled Persons' Federation (CDPF) revealed that an
increasing number of the handicapped are having difficulties
finding a job, even though the employment rate among them has been
on the rise in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"As many state enterprise workers are laid off and rural
laborers flock into towns, job-seeking is becoming more and more
difficult, particularly for the disabled," said CDPF Chairman Deng
Pufang, adding that some 320,000 handicapped workers have been
deviated from their working posts.
</P>
<P>
The CDPF previously set a goal that by the year 2000, 80
percent of the disabled should be job-secure, compared with 75
percent at present and less than 50 percent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
"Employment is not only a legal right that the disabled should
enjoy along with everyone else, but a basic requirement for better
living and secure social status," said Deng, who is himself
confined to a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
The organization is holding a national seminar with the
ministries of labor and social security and civil affairs, and the
State Development Planning Commission, to discuss ways to create
more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
With support from the State Council, China's cabinet, the CDPF
plans to enforce a policy nationwide in one to two years, which
will require governmental organs, organizations and enterprises to
employ handicapped people according to a certain ratio.
</P>
<P>
Welfare businesses which are launched only for the disabled
will enjoy tax exemption or reduction and have full support, while
the self-employed disabled will also be encouraged, Deng noted.

<HEADLINE> Radio Program On Sex Draws Attention in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A program on sex broadcast
by the Cambodian Bayon Radio is becoming popular in the country,
which seeks to enhance sexual education and dispel misinformation
on sexual issues among people, especially the young.
</P>
<P>
The show, "Especially for You, Young people," is taking on a
subject that Cambodians long have kept silent on -- teenage
premarital sex.
</P>
<P>
The 30-minute program, which kicked off in March and is being
aired twice a week, focuses on topics like reproductive health,
contraception, AIDS, pregnancy and whatever else callers need to
know about sex.
</P>
<P>
The program is produced and hosted by NGO staff and funded by
the European Union, according to the Cambodia Daily.
</P>
<P>
The programmers hope this innovative program will reach the
country's adolescents at a critical time when studies have shown
that large numbers of youths are having premarital sex and misled
beliefs about contraception and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodia Daily reported that attitudes toward sex are
changing among teenagers with the influx of foreign movies and
karaoke videos.
</P>
<P>
HIV and AIDS awareness is a primary aim of the new radio
program. About 90 percent of the people infected by HIV in
Cambodia are between 15 and 35 years of age, according to the
Health Ministry's recent figures.
</P>
<P>
Radio can reach those whose reading skills are minimal. And
although the program is touching on sensitive issues, it is
getting influence and welcomed by people. The radio has received
many letters, which show that people are listening and it's
possible that it will prevent someone from getting AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Stops to Probe Soeharto's Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General's
Office Monday decided to stop its inquiry into alleged acts of
corruption by former president Soeharto, particularly in his past
position as head of a number of charity foundations.
</P>
<P>
"We have not found sufficient evidence to continue the
investigation," Acting Attorney General Ismudjoko told reporters
here after a meeting with President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
He said based on the facts unearthed by investigations on the
possible misuse of state facilities and on Soeharto's policies as
chairman of the charity foundations, as well as based on testimony
from experts and others, no sufficient proof was found to continue
the probe.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he would soon issue a Stop-Investigation Order,
Ismudjoko said.
</P>
<P>
During his reign, Soeharto chaired nine charities, which have
been accused of receiving government privileges and facilities as
well as being one of Soeharto's main business vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has handed over the control of seven of the nine
charitable foundations to the government earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
On other alleged corruption cases such as the national car
project, Ismudjoko said because they were initiated through a
presidential decree, the issue would be included in the report of
the coordinating minister for economic development and
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Under the Timor national car project, the government granted
tax breaks to PT Timor Putra Nasional, owned by Soeharto's son
Hutomo 'Tommy" Mandala Putra, to import completely built-up sedans
from South Korean carmaker Kia Motor. The project had caused the
country losses of 1.55 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced down on May 21 last year amid the country's
worst economic and political crisis.

<HEADLINE> Smuggling of Diesel Increases Between Nepal, India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The wide gap in the current
market price of diesel in Nepal and India has increased the
chances of cross-border smuggling of the petroleum product,
according to local traders.
</P>
<P>
The diesel is sold at 15.5 rupees per liter at the Nepali
market but at 23.52 per liter at the Indian market.
</P>
<P>
People along the Nepal-India border are taking this difference
as a golden chance to make big money by smuggling out diesel to
India.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 300 petrol depots and outlets in the
eastern region of Nepal alone, providing chances for smugglers.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Eastern Region Petroleum Products
Dealers' Association Shiva Prasad Ghimire said that it would be
very difficult to stop the smuggling of diesel.
</P>
<P>
He said to prevent smuggling of petroleum products, the Nepali
government has sent a circular to all the concerned agencies not
to sell diesel in jelly cans and drums and to allow vehicles with
Indian registration number to carry only 20 liters for their
journey across the border.
</P>
<P>
But this measure alone would not be sufficient to prevent the
illegal trade of diesel and other petroleum products, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has designated
"PS" as the international code on the Internet for Palestine,
signifying "Palestinian State".
</P>
<P>
From now on all the Palestinian Internet code address will end
with "PS", the Al Ayam newspaper here reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has notified the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
of this decision by the weekend, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Palestinian Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath as saying that he had
earlier supported the international telephone and postal codes,
which were considered as symbols for national independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ghassan Al Qadah, director of the government
computer system, told the newspaper that the Internet code "PS"
was a symbol of independence. It is the outcome of two years of
relentless efforts.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat refused an Internet code of
"WG" in reference to the West Bank and Gaza last year. After
intensive efforts made by its representatives at the U.N.,
Palestine succeeded in obtaining "PS" as its code, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Department of Economic and Statistics which is in
charge of the codes prepares a list called the "unified symbols
for countries and regions for statistical purposes." The code for
Palestine is on the list.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Economist Praises China's Poverty-Relief Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank economist praised
the achievements made by Guizhou Province in southwest China in
relieving poverty over the past few years, during a recent meeting
with Guizhou Deputy Governor Mo Shiren.
</P>
<P>
Economist Alan Piazza, head of a World Bank delegation, is
currently on a five-day inspection tour of the poverty-relief
projects in Ceheng County of the Bouyei-Miao Autonomous Prefecture
of Qianxinan, Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
China's projects aimed at eliminating poverty in the area have
set a good example for other developing countries, Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mo Shiren, Guizhou has invested 600 million yuan
for education, public health, infrastructure facilities, land
development, and township enterprises in poor areas since it began
using World Bank loans to eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, 760,000 poverty-stricken people in 623 villages have
benefited from these projects, and 7,000 more people will be
lifted out of poverty when all the projects are completed.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank-financed poverty-elimination projects aim at
solving problems related to poverty in 35 poor counties in Guizhou
and Yunnan provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, all
in southwest China.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Effective Pollution Control on Haihe River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, North China's largest
port, is stepping up its efforts to reduce serious pollution in
the Haihe River which empties into Bohai Bay carrying mud, sand,
and industrial pollutants, in response to a national call for
pollution control.
</P>
<P>
Along the Haihe valley, 119,300 square kilometers of land has
been destroyed by soil erosion due to ineffective pollution
control and environmental deterioration. In fact, the Haihe River
has become a dump for the factories along it.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai Sea, which used to be a rich fish farm in north China,
has been greatly damaged, and some fish species are now facing
extinction.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, sitting on an important section of the Haihe River,
has seen its efforts rewarded. Rules and regulations have been
created by the authorities requiring that factories along the
river must have their waste-water meet state standard before they
can dump it into the river.
</P>
<P>
A sewage-treatment plant capable of handling 100,000 tons of
refuse a day will be operational late this year. The Asian

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Sending More Troops to Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
denied recent accusation by President Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) of sending more troops to
his country to bolster the anti- government rebels there.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Kabila accused Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi of
sending reinforcements to the war-torn country to back their rebel
allies who were said to be renewing fighting with the DRC
government troops, the Monitor newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In response to the accusation, Ugandan State Minister for
Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi said over the weekend that it
was not true. At least Uganda has not sent any more troops to the
DRC since the Lusaka agreement was signed on July 10, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is also the current chairman of the political
 committee overseeing the cease-fire, added that if the DRC has
such a complaint, it should raise it at the Joint Military
Commission meeting due on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have sided with the rebels while Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia are allied with the DRC government. Burundi
has denied its involvement in the war, although the DRC government
says it has evidence troops and equipment from Burundi have been
sent to aid the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that the fragile truce has been jeopardized
by frequent small-scale violations of the Lusaka agreement. A DRC
radio said over the weekend that the rebels are renewing attacks
against two towns including one near Kabila's birthplace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations is waiting for a report on the
DRC situation to lay the groundwork for a U.N. peace-keeping
operation there. Some U.N. officials estimate that it could
require a minimum of 25,000 soldiers for the peace-keeping
mission.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Annan to Improve Situation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov has sent a letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
calling for steps to remedy deflections from the letter of the U.N.
Security Council resolution 1244 on Kosovo, the Interfax news
agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
He wants Annan to use the potential of the Security Council so
as to implement the resolution, Interfax said, quoting diplomatic
sources.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Ivanov said in the letter that "the so-called
Kosovo Liberation Army and other Kosovo Albanian militias have not
been demilitarized."
</P>
<P>
The letter said that there have been "departures from the
principles of Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov called for the "early resumption of a political process
leading to talks between the Yugoslav government and
representatives of the Kosovo population on the status of the area
and broad autonomy for it" within Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov has also sent similar letters to the foreign ministers
of the seven industrialized nations, or the Group of Seven,
Interfax said, citing the same diplomatic sources.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Monday reiterated
that Eritrea must "withdraw from all Ethiopian territories that it
has occupied by force".
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry also demanded Eritrea stop
training, arming and supporting terrorists and warlords against
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia would be ready, as ever, to fulfill its obligations on
the basis of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) peace
proposals, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It expressed its willingness to engage in the process that
includes delimitation and demarcation of the border and to avail
itself of the necessary arbitration if required.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate response from the Eritrean side to the
demands made by Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the OAU proposals, Ethiopia pointed out that so
far there are some loopholes available for Eritrea to exploit on
the issue of full and unequivocal return to the status quo ante.
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian government is therefore continuing its dialog
with the OAU in the hope of ensuring that a durable peace is
achieved in the shortest possible time," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Armed conflicts broke out between the two Horn of Africa
neighbors in early May 1998. Tens of thousands of people were
killed or wounded in the 16-month border conflict.

of the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) opened here Monday
with the participation of some 800 deputies of 1,115 non-
governmental bodies from over 100 countries, including South
Korean and Venezuelan presidents.
</P>
<P>
Under the theme of "Inspire, Empower, Act," the five-day NGO

development, the well-being of children, gender quality, peace and
security.
</P>

involvement in all phases of work on behalf of the human family
and United Nations endeavors.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the conference is designed to reflect common
values, ideals and goals on the eve of the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Deploy Troops to Protect Oil Pipelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
decided to deploy troops to guard the petroleum pipelines in the
country in a bid to curtail the pipelines vandals.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper New Nigerian Monday quoted a source with
the petroleum sector as saying that the government investigation
has shown that the pipelines vandals are experts in the business
with sophisticated tools which they used in breaking the
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified source said that the government has decided to
involve army soldiers and naval personnel in monitoring the oil
pipelines throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Some retired military personnel have allegedly been employed to
assist vandalists who are bent on sabotaging the industry and the
economy as a whole, the source added.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has sought the
assistance of local communities to monitor the pipelines in
various areas, but there is little the communities could do in the
face of the superior fire power of the vandals.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 244 line breaks had been so far
recorded in the oil-rich west African country between January and
September of this year alone.

PARIS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair has decided to withdraw
from the private company Railtrack, which is one of the most
profitable companies at the London stock exchange, the management

</P>
<P>
-- Relations between Morocco and Algeria were again under
tension after an incursion on September 30 of two jeeps of the

<HEADLINE> Manila Optimistic on Resuming Talks with MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- All systems will go for the
opening of formal peace talks between the government and the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the southern Philippines on
October 25, a ranking official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Yan, presidential adviser on the peace process, said in
a radio interview that there is no issue at present that threatens
to block the start of the formal talks.
</P>
<P>
"The October 25 event is the formal opening ceremony. Both
sides would then draft their agenda," Yan said.
</P>
<P>
The government will be represented in the formal peace
negotiations by a panel chaired by Undersecretary Orlando Soriano
of the Department of National Defense.
</P>
<P>
Yan urged both sides not to make premature disclosures on what
would be discussed during the formal talks as the agenda for the
negotiations has yet to be drafted.
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know what issues would be taken up first. We'll
know once the formal talks start," he said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is one of several armed groups presently carrying out
peace efforts with the Estrada administration.
</P>
<P>
But while President Joseph Estrada fully supports peace
initiatives with the MILF, he has made it clear the government
will not accommodate the MILF's demands for secession.
</P>
<P>
Neither will the government grant recognition to the MILF as an
independent state, since the Constitution decrees there is only
one government in the Philippines, the president added.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the MILF, the Estrada administration is also
conducting peace talks with other rebel groups at the local level
as part of its efforts to ensure lasting peace in the country.

<HEADLINE> New Egyptian Cabinet Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Atef
Ebeid was sworn in before President Hosni Mubarak on Monday at a
presidential palace in the posh Heliopolis district.
</P>
<P>
Ebeid's 32-member cabinet also took the constitutional oath
before the president, the country's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Following the swearing-in ceremony, Mubarak chaired the first
meeting of the new cabinet to draw up plans of action for its
tasks, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak outlined the priorities for the new cabinet, including
further and steady implementation of the national projects to
forge a solid basis for sustainable development; promoting the
privatization program in a bid to attract foreign investments and
accelerate the economic growth; and creating job opportunities and
stepping up efforts to upgrade social welfare.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president won a landslide victory in the September
26 referendum and was sworn in on October 5 for the fourth
consecutive six-year term. Then he accepted the resignation of the
cabinet under Kamel El-Ganzouri and asked Ebeid to form a new
government.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak issued a republican decree on Sunday, announcing the
formation of the new cabinet, which brought in 13 new faces as 19
members of the previous cabinet retained their posts.
</P>
<P>
Key ministers of the last cabinet, including Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation Youssef
Wali, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Defense Minister Hussein
Tantawi, Interior Minister Habib el-Adli and Information Minister
Safwat el-Sherif remained in office.

<HEADLINE> First Environmental Monitoring System Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The software is capable of reporting on a monthly or yearly
basis the volume of industrial polluting materials discharged
through outlets of selected industrial units.
</P>
<P>
The system represents a breakthrough in China's environmental
monitoring and management technology, experts with the National
Environmental Protection Agency said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, a manual sampling method is used to measure
pollution in China, a method that is not accurate and makes 24-
hour monitoring almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
The new system enables environmental protection departments to
monitor industrial pollution 24 hours a day and greatly increases
their efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The system, developed by the agency in cooperation with Xi'an
Communications University in Xi'an, capital of northwestern
Shaanxi Province, has been in trial use in a number of capital
cities across the country, including Xi'an, Shijiazhuang in north
China's Hebei Province, and Harbin and Changchun in northeast
China.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Have 1.6 Million Orphans by 2000: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will have a staggering
1.6 million orphans by the year 2000, according to a recent study
conducted by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).
</P>
<P>
The report titled "Situation Analysis of Orphans in Zambia"
said Zambia has the highest proportion of orphaned children in the
world, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
There were 4.1 million children in Zambia in 1996 and 13
percent of them, about 550,000, were orphaned, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that this bulge could have significant social
and economic implications for the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 64 percent of the total orphan
population, or 350,000 children, are paternal orphans while 22
percent maternal and 14 percent double orphans.
</P>
<P>
This sad situation has been attributed mainly to the problem of
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
While the government strives to find solutions to the problem,
orphans continue to suffer lack of schooling, homelessness,
starvation, crime and exposure to HIV infection, according to the
U.N. report.
</P>
<P>
The report places great emphasis on strengthening nuclear and
extended families, while aimed at improving strategies designed to
address the needs of the communities dealing with orphans.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Steps up Efforts to Eradicate Polio By 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
finalized its plans to conduct this year's polio immunization
campaign across the country in a bid to achieve the goal to
eradicate the disease by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
About 5.5 million children under the age of five will be
immunized in this year's two-day event which will be held from
October 23 to 24 and again on October 27-28, Richard Muga,
director of Medical Services under the Health Ministry, said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The program is a joint venture between the government, the
World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund,
the East African Standard newspaper Monday quoted Muga as saying.
</P>
<P>
To eradicate the disease, the Kenyan Health Ministry has
embarked on this year's major immunization campaign, the fourth in
a series since 1996, to administer two doses of oral polio vaccine
to children.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kenya Expanded Program of Immunization, the
Health Ministry has raised the immunization coverage for the
disease from 43 percent to over 85 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the polio vaccination, children under the age of
five will this year also be given Vitamin A and measles
immunization.
</P>
<P>
Muga said an average of 40 percent of the population suffer
from Vitamin A deficiency while measles immunization coverage
continues to be the lowest among other antigens in most parts of
the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not Greedy to Win Men's Team Medals, Coach Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Having finished third in the
qualification rounds though, the United States men's team was not
greedy to set their sights on taking a medal in the team final at
the World Gymnastics Championships here.
</P>
<P>
"Our top goal in Tianjin is to qualify for the Sydney Olympic
Games. Next is to reach the team final within top six. Finally,
we are not too greedy if we can take a team medal," U.S. men's
coach Tomita Yoichi said.
</P>
<P>
The Americans earned a total of 224.594 points, which put them
behind defending champions China who collected 230.546 and Japan
who got 226.382.
</P>
<P>
Yoichi lavished his praise on Blaine Wilson, who was within the
top five in the individual overall standings with 57.048 before
favorites Alexei Nemov of Russia and Ivan Ivankov from Belarus
took the floor later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
"I see no clear gap and leader in the men's individual events.
Wilson is competitive to all those big names, like Alexei Nemov
and Alexei Bondarenko of Russia, Ivan Ivankov of Belarus and the
Chinese guys."
</P>
<P>
With their expressive and open-minded manner, Yoichi believed
his team will perform better routines in the finals.
</P>
<P>
Yoichi named China untouchable for the team title, ruling out
other hot contenders Russia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The depth of Chinese gymnastics are so deep. I think they
will win the team title at this meet for sure and claim the
victory at the 2000 Olympic Games," Yoichi said.
</P>
<P>
"How and who can beat China for the team title? " Yoichi
laughed. "Unless they get injured themselves."
</P>
<P>
Yoichi, who left Japan at 18, has been coaching in America for
25 years. He preferred his adopted country winning over Japan in
the competition.
</P>
<P>
"I lived in the Unites States and coached the national team for
many years, I hope America is going better here though I love
Japan," he said.

<HEADLINE> China-U.S. Conference on Women's Issues Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua)-- Nearly 300 delegates from both
China and the U.S. gathered in the Great Hall of the People here
today to discuss issues faced by women of both countries in the
political, economic, educational and health-care arenas.
</P>
<P>
The conference, cosponsored by the All-China Women's Federation
(ACWF) and Global Interactions, Inc. of the U.S., will last four
days.
</P>
<P>
ACWF Vice-President Gu Xiulian said at today's opening ceremony
that with economic globalization and the surging of the knowledge
economy, women now are confronted with new opportunities and
challenges.
</P>
<P>
She recalled the escalation of Chinese women's status in
society since the founding of new China in 1949, which ended their
traditional sufferings and enabled them to participate in the
political, economic and cultural life of the country. " Chinese
women are now a great force in the creation of both material and
spiritual civilization," she remarked.
</P>
<P>
According to Gu, the Chinese government has set "equality
between men and women" as the country's basic policy, and laid
down specific goals regarding the protection of women's rights
including political participation, employment, labor protection,
education and other areas.
</P>
<P>
Many more people now realize that equality between men and
women is a major yardstick by which to judge a society, and
equality, development and peace are the common aspiration of
women worldwide, Gu said.
</P>
<P>
Jerrie Ueberle, president of Global Interactions, said the
delegates have witnessed tremendous achievements in China's
economy and social development while they were in Beijing.
Moreover, she noted, it is of great significance that women of
both countries discuss the issues of common concern and exchange
experiences, and this will help deepen their friendship and
realize the common development of women in the 21st century.

folk food in the past two months, and recipe providers are

<HEADLINE> California Signs Nurse-to-Patient Ratio Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 10 (Xinhua) -- California Governor Gray
Davis signed a bill on Sunday under which the state will set nurse
staffing requirements for all hospitals for the first time and
allow only licensed workers to perform certain medical tasks.
</P>
<P>
The text of the nursing law does not specify minimum nurse-to-
patient ratios, but instead requires the state Department of
Health Services to set those standards.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the state sets nurse-patient ratios only for
critical care units and neonatal intensive care units.
</P>
<P>
The California Nurses Association described the measure as "a
landmark bill that will make California the first state in the
nation to require safe hospital staffing."
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most significant days in the history of
nursing," Kay McVay, president of the nursing group, said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
The measure also will bar hospitals from assigning unlicensed
workers to perform certain procedures, including administering
medication, and it will prohibit hospitals from shifting nurses
trained in one unit to another unit without adequate preparation.

<HEADLINE> No Foreign Meddlers in Kenya's Internal Affairs: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has accused South Africa and some other Commonwealth nations
of seeking to impose a new constitutional order on Kenya through
the Law Society of Kenya and private citizens.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a celebration marking the 21st Moi Day in capital
Nairobi Sunday, Moi said these nations are guilty of interfering
in Kenya's internal affairs through civic organizations, media
reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president, who has been in power for 21 years, asked
foreign countries especially those from the Commonwealth to
respect Kenya's sovereignty and stop lecturing on governance.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent reference to South African High Commissioner to
Kenya Griffiths Memela, Moi said that some ambassadors based in
Nairobi were poking their noses into the country's affairs by
lecturing meetings.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Memela gave a keynote address at a law reform
workshop sponsored by the Law Society of Kenya and advised Kenyans
to borrow a leaf from South Africa to resolve the constitutional
review stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Moi made it clear that the amendment to Kenya's constitution
was an internal matter, saying that kenyans were not fools to be
lectured by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The president declared that foreign countries should channel
advice to government authorities and not through civic
organizations, adding that Kenya does not interfere in the
internal affairs of any nation, including its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has chosen not to interfere with conflicts in Somalia,
the Sudan and the Great Lake region because it believes these
nations can solve their problems by themselves without undue
influence, Moi added.

JAKARTA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Monday deplored the International Force in East Timor (Interfet)
cross-border raid against an Indonesian border post in East Nusa
Tenggara (West Timor).
</P>
<P>
"The government has yet to send a protest over the incident. We
are waiting for the investigation result," Makmur Widodo, top
official of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Military (TNI) spokesman Maj. Gen.
Sudrajat asked the Interfet to soon clarify the raid.
</P>
<P>
"The incident can hopefully be clarified today. But, one
obvious thing is that we are really sad and shocked that one of
our personnel from the Mobile Brigade unit was killed and four
others were wounded," he told reporters here Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 120 Interfet soldiers crossed into
Indonesian West Timor, and attacked the Indonesian border post
Sunday noon.

According to Sudrajat's explanation, the border post guards
returned fire at the attackers who firstly showered them with
bullets.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with an Indonesian RCTI television
correspondent, Sudrajat said Interfet Commander Maj. Gen. Peter
Cosgrove promised to conduct a joint investigation into the
incident, along with Brig. Gen. Sitorus who represents the
Indonesian military and police forces in the joint-security
consultative group on East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is expected to be able to clarify the
intrusion incident, he added.

Interfet troops who arrived in East Timor on September 26.

location.

<HEADLINE> Senior Ugandan Officials in Rwanda to Mend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A high-profile Ugandan
delegation arrived in Rwandan capital Kigali Sunday to mend the
deteriorating bilateral relations soured by the recent Kisangani
clashes between the troops of the two neighbors in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Ugandan National Political Commissar James Wapakhabulo, First
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Eriya
Kategaya and State Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma would hold
talks with their Rwandan counterparts, the New Vision daily
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting is to make recommendations for the heads
of state summit to be held soon, Wapakhabulo said. But he did not
disclose the venue and date for the summit.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Rwandan authorities reportedly withdrew their
top military officers in the DRC in line with the Mweya agreement
signed between Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan
Vice-President Paul Kagame in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear whether Uganda would reciprocate Rwanda's
gesture by redeploying its top military officer in the DRC James
Kazini, who is also blamed for the four-day Kisangani clashes
during which 38 Ugandan servicemen were killed.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Rwandan delegation led by Charles Murigande,
general secretary of the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front, visited
Kampala to restore good relations between the two allies.

<HEADLINE> Solar Energy Will Be Widely Used in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Solar energy will be utilized
in a wide range of areas in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
northwest China, with the adoption of the Sunshine Plan made by
the local government.
</P>
<P>
It will take three to five years to promote the use of solar
energy in both remote mountain and comparatively well-off
irrigated areas, and one million yuan (about 115,000 U.S. dollars)
has been earmarked for the first phase of the plan.
</P>
<P>
With 3,000 hours of sunshine a year, Ningxia is one of China's
regions ripe for the use of solar energy, and it has been
developing the use of this energy source since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
At present, thousands of solar powered appliances and dozens of
solar-heated houses are in use in many parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
Apart from China's own expertise, Ningxia intends to learn from
Israel, Germany, Japan and other countries which have made great
achievements in the field of solar energy.

<HEADLINE> 150th Anniversary of Chinese Immigration to Peru Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) and the
Peruvian Embassy gave a reception here today to mark the 150th
anniversary of the arrival of Chinese immigrants in Peru.
</P>
<P>
Qi Huaiyuan, president of the CPAFFC, addressed the reception
and said that Peru was one of the first Latin American countries
to receive Chinese immigrants in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
According to Qi, some 100,000 Chinese arrived in Peru between
1849 and 1874, where they made unique contributions to the growth
of the Peruvian nation, especially in agriculture, mining and
construction.
</P>
<P>
China highly values its friendship with Peru and other Latin
American countries, Qi said, expressing the wish that ties will be
strengthened and bilateral exchanges and cooperation in politics,
economy and culture advanced.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian Ambassador to China Luzimina Zanabria Ishikawa also
spoke at the ceremony, and mentioned the role played by Chinese
immigrants in Peru's multicultural society. "Over a century of
mutual understanding has helped form a special relationship
between the people of the two nations and their governments," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the reception were representatives from
relevant Chinese government departments and officials from foreign
embassies in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Protests U.S. Terrorist List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's leading anti-Israeli
military group Hezbollah, or Party of God, has protested being
listed as one of the terrorist organizations for 1999 by the
U.S. State Department, the Daily Star reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Hezbollah has a parliamentary and popular presence, and a
clear identity in which it takes pride as a fighter of the
occupation," said the group in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah was created in 1984 with an aim of
ousting Israeli occupation forces from the country.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, Israel has been occupying parts of Lebanon. It set
up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect
its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its military arm, Hezbollah is becoming an
important political power in Lebanon and its wide network of
social services has been particularly praised by the country's
poor people, especially Muslim residents inside the Israeli
occupied border zone.
</P>
<P>
The latest U.S. State Department terrorist list, which is
reviewed and published every two years, includes 28 international
organizations, 14 of them based in the Middle East and North
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Eight organizations were listed as falling under Hezbollah's
umbrella, including the Islamic Jihad Organization, Revolutionary
and Justice Organization and the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
Some of the kidnappings of Westerners in the 1980s were
claimed by these groups.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the U.S. administration is trying to blind
the facts and create confusion by listing the names of eight
organizations to justify its claims that Hezbollah is a terrorist
organization despite the fact that all these accusations are far
from the truth and reality," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Hexi Corridor to Become China's Top High-tech Agricultural Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 11 (Xinhua)-- The Hexi Corridor on the ancient
Silk Road will become a major high-tech agricultural base in China,
according to a seven-year development plan created by the
government of northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
One of China's poorest regions in the past, the 1,200-kilometer-
long Hexi Corridor has become a prosperous agricultural area,
undergoing three development phases since the founding of new
China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The large water-control project in the 1960s and 1970s and the
Hexi, Dingxi and Xihaigu construction project in the 1980s have
made the corridor one of the country's leading grain producers,
lifting most farmers of the region out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
In the third phase, which started earlier this year, the local
government will invest more on developing water-saving, high-tech,
and ecologically sound agriculture and building small towns and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 100 large foreign enterprises are taking
part in developing this area.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has also invested 300 million U.S. dollars in
constructing the Shule River Valley irrigation system, which will
create an oasis of 53,000 ha. in the desert.
</P>
<P>
The corridor is also a vital communications line as part of the
new Eurasian bridge, the strategic railway link with Europe, and
is rich in water, minerals, tourism, animals, plants, and solar
energy resources, giving it a major role in northwest China's
development.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Machine Tool Demand Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. demand for machine
tools fell slightly in August, according to a study by two
industry groups released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The American Machine Tool Distributors' Association (AMTDA) and
the Association for Manufacturing Technology (AMT) estimated
August demand at 435 million dollars, down 1.5 percent from 442
million dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
August demand was 11 percent below the 489 million dollars for
August 1998, and, orders of 3.6 billion dollars in the first eight
months of 1999 were down 35 percent from the same period in 1998,
the study said.
</P>
<P>
"However, a bottom to this downturn rests with calming
customers' apprehensions on consumer spending and with building on
the fragile recovery in Asia," Don Carlson, AMT president, said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
Analysts consider demand for machine tools a reliable indicator
of the strength of the manufacturing sector and the overall
economy.
</P>
<P>
The statistics are based on figures submitted by companies
participating in the U.S. Machine Tool Consumption study.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations (UN) has
named Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, a
model city for its environmental and economic improvement, said
Klause Toepfer, deputy secretary-general of the UN.
</P>
<P>
At the symposium on international environmental strategy held
here recently, Toepfer said that the UN would like to spread
Shenyang's successful experience all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The city, an old industry base once polluted heavily, also
signed an agreement with the UN, under which the UN will help
Shenyang upgrade its urban environment management and build
relations with other international organizations, such as the
World Health Organization (WHO). By so doing, it is anticipated
that Shenyang will become a world investment hub.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang was once on the list of the ten most seriously
polluted cities in the world. Considered to have a great potential
for development, it was chosen as the pilot city in 1997 under the
Sustainable Development Plan, which was launched by the UN in 1992
to improve the living environment worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Opposition Party Central Committee to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The central committee of
Zambia's opposition party led by former President Kenneth Kaunda
will be dissolved within two months as a result of its internal
divisions, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The National Council of the United National Independence Party
made the decision at its meeting in the central city of Kabwe
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There are deep divisions in the central committee which calls
for radical measures to restore harmony in the party, Kaunda was
quoted as saying at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The United National Independence Party could not bounce back to
power if it is divided and all loose ends must be tied, said the
former Zambian president.
</P>
<P>
"For the interest of the party, let's unite and prepare for the
congress or the party will disintegrate," he said.
</P>
<P>
A national congress of the United National Independence Party
will be held to elect a new central committee and a new party
chief, the Zambia Daily Mail reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best way of resolving the problems the party has
been facing," Publicity Information Secretary of the party Bwendo
Mulengela was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mulengela dismissed assertions that Kaunda is an old guard who
should rest, saying that the party does not look at the age of the
president but the contribution that he makes towards national
building.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech to the National Council meeting, Kaunda
admitted that his party has major problems which could only be
resolved by the national congress at which a new central committee
can be elected.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia's SOEs to Shake Off Losses </HEADLINE>

<P>
YINCHUAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region has vowed to reduce the proportion of its large-
and medium-sized State-owned enterprises (SOEs) that are in the
red to 25 percent next year, from the current 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
The petrochemical and building materials industries are
expected to be in the black this year, and the coal, metallurgical
and light land textile sectors will start making profits next year,
said Mao Rubai, Party chief of the region.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is the smallest autonomous region in China, but it has
90 large- and medium-sized SOEs, representing a relatively high
percentage of the State-owned economy.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies will be given to 34 heavily indebted SOEs
to help them become profitable, Mao said.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises should operate in accord with market demand
and establish a modern enterprise system, one official said.

night.
</P>
<P>
CNN TURK was born out of a marriage between the Dogan Group,

<HEADLINE> Slogans Released to Greet Macao's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- In the run-up to Macao's return
to the motherland, the Chinese government today released a list of
slogans to greet this major event.
</P>
<P>
"Warmly celebrate our government's resumption of exercising
sovereignty over Macao," reads the one at top of the 10 slogans.
</P>
<P>
Macao, which has been under Portuguese rule for several
centuries, is set to return to the motherland on December 20.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Macao represents the Chinese people wiping out
national humiliation, and Macao's entry into a new historic epoch,
" one slogan says.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Macao marks a major step toward the completion
of reunification of the motherland," says another.
</P>
<P>
The list devotes several items to the "one country, two systems
" policy, initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"One country, two systems" is a great beginning in realizing
the motherland's peaceful reunification; implement the "one
country, two systems" policy; carry out "Macao people governing
Macao" and a high degree of autonomy; and, maintain Macao's long-
term stability and development, the slogans read.
</P>
<P>
"Uphold the 'one country, two systems' policy, and complete the
great cause of the motherland's reunification," says another.
</P>
<P>
The slogans also stress the importance of Macao's Basic Law. "
The Basic Law of Macao represents the fundamental guarantee of
Macao's long-term stability and development." "Study, promote and
implement the Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
The slogans express the belief that Macao will have a better
future.
</P>
<P>
The list of slogans was released jointly by the Information
Office and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State
Council.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Accused of Disregarding Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Defense Minister
Moven Mahachi said that it was difficult for the allied forces of
the southern African countries to "ignore" the cease-fire
violations being perpetrated by the rebels and their allies in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The rebels and their allies in DRC are launching sporadic
attacks on both civilians and Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Allied Forces in the DRC, the daily Herald
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite these violations, as SADC Allied Forces, we are ready
to uphold and observe the terms of the Lusaka peace accord and
expect the rebels and their allies to follow suit," Mahachi was
quoted as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"They should realize that peace is the better option to war,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the attacks, the rebels and their allies are
making fresh deployments in the northern, eastern and western
fronts in the DRC, including moving their troops to areas around
the important town of Mbuji- Mayi.
</P>
<P>
Fears are that fresh troops movements by the rebels and their
allies around the central town appear to be in preparation for an
offensive on the industrial diamond-mining center.
</P>
<P>
The rebels and their allies have so far captured Bomongo in the
northern part of the DRC, confiscating civilian boats in the
process and attacked SADC Allied Forces position at Ikela in the
northwestern part of the DRC and Kabinda, Mahachi said.
</P>
<P>
"During these attacks, SADC Allied Forces were forced to
repulse the rebels. But let it be known that this was in purely
self defense," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean defense minister appealed to the international
community to put pressure on the rebels and their allies to
refrain from further tactical manoeuvres and abide by the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia had sent troops to fight for the
DRC President Laurent Kabila while Uganda and Rwanda had been
allegedly supporting the rebels determined to topple Kabila's
government.
</P>
<P>
The six countries directly involved in the DRC conflict and the
major factions of the DRC rebels signed the Lusaka cease-fire
accord on July 10 and on August 31 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladeshis Panic After Blast, Bomb Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshis have plunged into
panic following a blast in a mosque last Friday which killed six
people and injured many others and police's recovery of bombs in
other places during the last three days.
</P>
<P>
The government has put the law-enforcing agencies on full alert
to guard possible targets of the extremists following the
successive booby traps in Khulna and Dhaka, press reports here
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The police headquarters have issued special direction to search
suspects in bus and launch terminals, important establishments of
the government and religious places, using metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
"A nationwide alert has been issued and the security agencies
have been asked to tighten safety measures in the country's
important installations," Home Secretary Safiur Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
Two powerful explosives, each weighing three kilograms, in two
separate bags were found abandoned inside the mosque at Ahmadia
Muslim Jamaat's Bangladesh head office on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some devotees saw the bags in the mosque and reported them to
police, who rushed to the spot immediately and cordoned off the
area. Explosive experts after a brief examination shifted the
bombs to a nearby ground.
</P>
<P>
Police found the two bombs inside the bags and dumped them in
water and sand in the ground. "We are waiting for the blast and
this is a secure place for exploding the bombs," a police official
said.
</P>
<P>
The central office of Ahmadia Muslim Jamaat of the Kadiani
Muslim sect had been under police guard since a deadly bomb
explosion in southwestern Khulna city's Kadiani mosque last Friday
killed six persons and injured many others.
</P>
<P>
A mine was also found planted in the office of Janakantha, a
Bangla-language newspaper and a grenade at a Mirpur mosque in the
capital city on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government suspected that the simultaneous bomb incidents
were part of a plot to destabilize the government, the reports
said. "A vested quarter was out to create unrest disturbing the
law-and-order situation," according to the home secretary.
</P>
<P>
"Investigation is on by the different law-enforcing agencies to
dig out the conspiracy to unveil who managed so powerful
explosives and from where," he said.
</P>
<P>
A report in The Bangladesh Observer said the blast in Khulna
might be the result of an internal feud among Ahmadia groups of
the Kadiani Muslim sect.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at a public meeting in
southeastern Chittagong district on Sunday accused the opposition
parties of "trying to capture power by terror tactics."
</P>
<P>
"Rejecting the proposal for talks, the BNP (Bangladesh
Nationalist Party) has proved that they don't believe in
democracy. Their only target is to capture power with the help of
evil forces," she said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Urged to Explore Markets in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh should explore markets
in South and East Asia to boost its exports, The Financial Express
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted economist Debapriya Bhattacharya as saying on
Sunday that a change in composition of markets from the United
States and Europe to East and South Asian countries like Japan,
South Korea, Myanmar, Pakistan and India is needed immediately for
bolstering exports.
</P>
<P>
Bhattacharya, executive director of the Center for Policy
Dialogue, also stressed the need for diversification of exportable
commodities with a view to helping boost the country's overall
exports.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the monthly luncheon meeting of the American Chamber
of Commerce in Bangladesh here, he also emphasized the need for a
timely and pragmatic export policy to reap optimum benefit from
exports.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, D R Sen Gupta, director general of the Export
Promotion Bureau of Bangladesh, said the country has achieved an
average growth of 11.56 percent in export earnings over the recent
years because of policy support together with incentives provided
to exporters by the government.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's export earnings exceeded 5.3 billion U.S. dollars
in the 1998-99 fiscal year from a paltry sum of 448 million
dollars in fiscal 1992-93, Gupta said, adding that the growth came
mainly due to substantial increase in exports of non-traditional
goods.
</P>
<P>
The share of the traditional sector in the country's total
export earnings was 85.68 percent and that of the non-traditional
sector 14.32 percent in fiscal 1975-76. At present, however, the
scenario has changed, to 7.76 percent for the traditional sector
and 92.24 percent for the non-traditional one, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Gupta pointed out that the export earnings faced a
setback in the last fiscal year due to the devastation of flood.
</P>
<P>
He said the country would obviously be able to achieve the
target fixed at some 5.62 billion dollars for the 1999-2000 fiscal
year.

ISLAMABAD, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Pakistani English newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The News:
</P>
<P>
-- The government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is facing a
cacophony of domestic and foreign pressures, the worst since he
took power in early 1997, said a report in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
The Nation:
</P>
<P>
-- Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has said the
Lahore peace process with Pakistan can be resumed "if Pakistan
reciprocates in a genuine and credible manner" to initiatives
taken by India before the Kargil conflict broke out last May.
</P>
<P>
The Frontier Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A looming swoop on religious seminaries in the country,
reported preparations for dismantling terrorist camps on the
Afghan soil and Islamabad's incipient coolness toward the orthodox
militia are likely to strain the otherwise cordial
Pakistan-Taliban relations.

<HEADLINE> Socialists Win Portuguese elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Portugal's ruling Socialist
Party won a relative majority in Sunday's parliamentary elections
and will continue to govern the country.
</P>
<P>
The result of the polls released before midnight shows that the
Socialists bagged 44 percent of the vote with 96 percent counted,
winning 111 seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Close to 45 percent is needed for an absolute majority in the
230-seat legislature.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party held 112 seats in the previous legislature.
</P>
<P>
Their main opponent, the Social Democratic Party, got 32.5
percent of the ballots and 79 seats in parliament, followed by the
Communist Party/Green Party coalition with 9 percent of the vote
and 17 seats, the Popular Party, 8.4 percent and 14 seats, and the
Leftist Bloc, 2.5 percent and 2 seats.
</P>
<P>
The abstention rate among Portugal's 8.8 million eligible
voters was 38.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, who scored an historic victory
in general elections on the same day, said that he would be
willing to form a new cabinet even if his party fell short of an
absolute majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
He is the first of a new generation of center-left leaders in
Europe to face re-election.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists' victory in the polls owed much to a booming
economy that has benefited from Portugal's entry into the European
single currency and improved living standards.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Focuses on Industrial Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has allocated 1.2
billion rupees (17 million U.S. dollars) for industrial
development next year, the highest ever allocated to the sector,
in a bid to speed up industrialization, press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News quoted Industrial Development Minister
C.V. Gooneratne as saying this indicated the government's
commitment to develop the local industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The budgetary allocation will be used for industrial estates,
industrial training programs and the setting up of economic
centers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the present People's Alliance (PA) government assumed
office in 1994, the budget allocation for industrial development
was as low as 287 million rupees (4.1 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Consequently the government more than doubled the allocation
for industrial development to 800 million rupees (11.4 million
dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since then, there has been a steady increase in allocation of
around 100 million rupees (1.4 million dollars) annually,
Gooneratne said.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years under the PA government, he said,
thousands of industries were set up which helped reduce the
unemployment rate to 8.8 percent in 1998 from 13.1 percent in
1994, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that Sri Lanka's per-capita income also increased to
840 dollars last year from 588 dollars in 1993.

BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China has reinforced its
safety inspection of nuclear power and fuel plants after Japan's
recent nuclear leakage accident, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
China's nuclear monitoring centers showed that Japan's nuclear
leakage had no negative effects on China's environments, senior
nuclear officials have said.
</P>
<P>
The officials ruled out the possibility of similar accidents
occurring in China. , they said the China National Nuclear
Corporation (CNNC) asked all nuclear fuel factories to perform
complete inspections of equipment, operational procedures and
employees, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The inspection is expected to be completed by November 10,
according to Cong Huiling, director of CNNC's department of safety,
protection and health.
</P>
<P>
"Improving management techniques is the key lesson China should
learn from the Japanese accident since the leakage happened not
because of nuclear technology, but because of poor management and
human error," Cong was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power operators in China are required to have licenses
and well-trained, and workers in nuclear power plants must be
college-educated and undergo two to three years of training before
they begin work, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
China also has strict regulations and codes governing design,
construction and operation of nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
The country's nuclear industry actively promotes a culture of
safety, which requires everyone, from top decision makers to plant
workers, to put safety first, regardless of economic efficiency or
construction speed, the paper reports.

KUALA LUMPUR, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Far Eastern Economic

11 upon conviction for contempt of court in Malaysia, was released
Monday.
</P>
<P>

possibly his lawyers leaving the Seremban Special Prison in
Seremban, some 65 kilometers south of here, for an unknown
destination, Bernama news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Explains Absence from Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Latrell Sprewell, NBA New
York Knicks' star who missed the first week of the training camp,
finally offered an explanation Sunday, but the team decided to
drop him for their first exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
"Without any practice time, he's just not going to be ready to
play," said coach Jeff Van Gundy, who met with Sprewell and
general manager Scott Layden on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell said he had simply ignored the Knicks' phone messages
as he drove across the country, doing a 36-hour drive, arriving
before dawn Wednesday in Milwaukee, and then continuing on to New
York on Thursday with brother and a friend.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell explained that he drove instead of taking a flight
because he wanted to make his car to New York and pick up some
things in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
"That's just me. I like doing things myself," he said. "I
wasn't trying to send a message."
</P>
<P>
He said his agents failed to contact him and told where he was
to the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
If the team fines him for all the practices he missed, it would
total 40,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell will join the team for his first practice on Monday.
He will not play in the exhibition opener Tuesday night against
the Philadelphia 76ers, but he is not officially suspended.

<HEADLINE> German Ruling Party Defeated in Berlin Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, October 10 (Xinhua) - Germany's governing Social
Democratic Party (SPD) led by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
suffered this year's sixth defeat in succession in Sunday's local
election in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
While its main opposition Christian Democrats (CDU) led in the
poll by 40.8 percent of the vote, the SPD scored just 22.4 percent
in Germany's capital, according to preliminary official results.
</P>
<P>
In barely one year since it won the national election, Social
Democrats have been defeated in state elections in Hesse, Saarland,
Thuringia and Saxony, and lost absolute majority in Brandenburg
state.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, the Greens party, Schroeder's junior
partner in the federal government, also lost support of the voters
in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The party of foreign minister Joschka Fischer won 9.9 percent,
a poor achievement that made it an insignificant role in Berlin
state parliament.
</P>
<P>
The SPD's loss Sunday will further weaken the existence of the
"red-green coalition" in the Bundesrat, the upper chamber of
German parliament composed of delegates from 16 federal states.
</P>
<P>
On receiving the bad news, Franz Muentefering, the designated
general secretary of the SPD, admitted the party's performance was
"disappointing."
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that the SPD had survived its major crisis by "
stabilizing the support rate at a low level."
</P>
<P>
"We have climbed out of the deepest of the deep," he said,
apparently referring to the SPD's crash in the Saxony state
election last month with a historic-low rate of 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CDU, short of enough votes for a single-party state
government with absolute majority, will continue its "grand
coalition" with the SPD as a junior partner, said the CDU mayor
Eberhard Diepgen.
</P>
<P>
The Party for Democratic Socialism (PDS), the successor to the
communists in former East Germany, took third place in Sunday's
election with 17.7 percent of the vote. The result was a solid
gain for the party, compared to 14.6 percent in the last election
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
With support growing in this year's regional elections, the PDS
has proven itself a major player in eastern states.

second, Kucera, who led the game 2-0 midway, found himself tied
and let Henman fight back in the third and fourth sets.
</P>
<P>
Henman needed one break in each set to put the game into the
decisive set, which sew both break once to set up a breath-taking
tie-breaker. Kucera won it 7-2 in a surprising ease.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China has made a breakthrough
in the research and development of 18-millimetre copper foil,
breaking Japan's monopoly on this technology in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Scientists with the Union Copper Foil Co. Ltd in Huizhou, South
China's Guangdong Province, have successfully developed 18-
millimetre copper foil, a basic electronic material much applied
in information industry, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The copper foil produced by the company after six years'
scientific research in conquering all technological difficulties,
is regarded as "having reached all the national standards, and is
equal to international production of the same kind," according to
the State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The success is significant and will help the country's
independent development of high technology in areas such as
computers, aviation and space, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The 18-millimetre copper foil, also called printed circuit
copper foil, is only one-fourth the diameter of a strand of hair.
It is used in many fields like chemical industry, electrochemistry,
precise mechanisms, and transmission automatic control.

<HEADLINE> Canada Works out Fishing Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada has worked out a fishing
compromise in order to appease weeks of tensions between native
and non-native fishermen.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Fisheries Minister Herb Dhaliwal told a press
conference Sunday that Canada would allow limited fishery of two
aboriginal bands off the Atlantic coast, while the other 33 native
bands had agreed to honor a 30-day moratorium on lobster fishing.
</P>
<P>
The two bands, respectively in Burnt Church of New Brunswick
and in Indian Brook of Nova Scotia, will be allowed to fish until
the end of the month. But strict limitations will be imposed on
the size of catches, the number of traps and the type of fishing
gear.
</P>
<P>
Under the limitations, native fishermen are actually allowed to
trap lobsters for their own consumption rather than for commercial
purposes, according to the Burnt Church native band.
</P>
<P>
The compromise came after some native fishermen threatened to
continue fishing in defiance of the 30-day voluntary moratorium
announced by native leaders last week.
</P>
<P>
Dhaliwal also promised a long-term solution after next month to
end the tensions, which have remained high ever since the Supreme
Court of Canada ruled on September 17 that natives have rights to
fish out of the season and without a license in order to make a
moderate living.
</P>
<P>
Non-native fishermen fear that the lobster resource could be
depleted by next spring when they open fishery of their own.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Makes Major Find of Dinosaur Fossils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
found a batch of fossilized dinosaur bones dating back to over 60
million years ago in Heyuan County in south China's Guangdong
Province, the site where more than 1,000 dinosaur eggs had been
unearthed since March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The find of both fossilized dinosaur bones and dinosaur eggs at
the same site has made Heyuan one of the world's most important
dinosaur fossil repositories, according to archeologists from the
Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Dong Zhiming, a research fellow with the institute and also a
member in the excavation team, told Xinhua that what they have
found in Heyuan could provide significant evidence for further
study of the distribution and evolution of dinosaurs living in
Cretaceous Period more than 100 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Researchers here believe China could have the world's largest
reserve of dinosaur fossils.
</P>
<P>
Since the find of more than 100 fossilized dinosaurs in Zigong
City in southwestern Sichuan Province in 1970s, China has had
another major find in Xixia County in central China's Henan
Province, where over 5,000 dinosaur eggs were dug out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, small finds were reported from time to time in Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shanxi, Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Among ten pieces of dinosaur fossils found this time, there are
limb bones, phalanx, vertebra and coxa bones, which are believed
to belong to three dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
"It is a kind of small carnivorous dinosaur about three to four
meters long which is believed to live on small mammals like lizard,
" said Dong.
</P>
<P>
Heyuan is situated on a 100 sq.km. stretch of red sandy slate.
Archeologists assumed that it was once a rainy jungle suitable for
dinosaurs to live, which would mean more bone fossils are expected
to be unearthed here.
</P>
<P>
The local government of Heyuan has set up reserves in a number
of locations, where more fossils possibly exist, to prevent from
illegal attempts of digging and robbing. It has offered awards of
100,000 yuan since 1996 to people who have provided clues or turn
over dinosaur fossils.

<HEADLINE> China's Higher Education Becoming Hot Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- With more and more Chinese
shelling out big bucks for a college degree, higher education is
fast becoming one of China's hottest industries, according to a
Chinese economist.
</P>
<P>
Hu Angang, the economist, said Chinese people's potential
spending on higher education is estimated to be some 250 billion
yuan (28.7 billion U.S. dollars) per year in the next decade or so,
which is much more than the money spent now for a diploma.
</P>
<P>
"With the coming of the knowledge-based economic age, education
will be the rising industry," said Guo Fei, a scholar with the
Finance College of China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 2.1 million students were enrolled in
colleges and universities in China last year, bringing the total
number of college students to 6.2 million.
</P>
<P>
If the enrollment figure goes up by 50 percent, the demand will
raise more than six billion yuan (690 million U.S. dollars) per
year, based on the average yearly expenditure of a student at six
thousand yuan (690 U.S. dollars), Guo said.
</P>
<P>
China has been paying close attention to the development of
higher education, as it is part of the strategy to rejuvenate the
nation through science and education, he pointed out.

<P>
The Chinese Government announced in August that it will
increase the allocation for education in the national budget by
one percentage point annually over the next three to five years
and provide higher education opportunities for 15 percent of its
people by the year 2010, over the current nine percent.
</P>
<P>
Universities in China welcomed 2.7 million freshmen in
September, 330,000 of which are a direct result of the Ministry of
Education's attempt to increase college enrollment.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said that the estimated goal of an 11-
percent college entrance rate for high school graduates in 2000
will be reached ahead of schedule, while "reforms have transformed
China's higher education system into an attainable pursuit for
most high school students."
</P>
<P>
More and more Chinese families are willing to invest in higher
education for their children or themselves, the official said,
adding that this is especially true for those families living in
cities, where children with no siblings make up a large percentage.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the National Bureau of Statistics,
savings deposits of both urban and rural Chinese residents amount
to a total 6,000 billion yuan (690 billion U.S. dollars). Up to 44
percent of these people are saving for their children's future
higher education.
</P>
<P>
"Thus a large portion of these savings deposits can be
transformed into effective use with the rapid development of China
's higher education," said Hu Angang.
</P>
<P>
He also said the higher education industry will be the most
attractive investment field for both public and individual
investors as soon as China opens its higher education market.

<HEADLINE> England Beats Belgium in Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- One goal each from Jamie
Redknapp and Alan Shearer gave England a 2-1 victory over Belgium
in a soccer friendly in Sunderland, England on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was Redknapp's first goal for his team in his 15th
international and will long be remembered for the way it crashed
into the net off the underside of the crossbar with substitute
goalkeeper Ronny Gaspercic helpless.
</P>
<P>
England had taken the lead after six minutes with an overhead
kick from skipper Alan Shearer -- the 14th goal Shearer has scored
for his club or country in the last four weeks --which took his
tally of England goals to 28 making him joint-sixth with David
Platt on the all-time scoring list.
</P>
<P>
But it only took Belgium six minutes to equalise after a
penetrating 10-pass move that, in the final stages, cut the
England defence to shreds.
</P>
<P>
Gilles de Bilde exchanged passes with Marc Wilmots before
sending a superb 30-meter pass out to David Oyen wide on the left.
</P>
<P>
He cut inside Kieron Dyer and crossed for an unmarked Branko
Strupar to pick his spot and leave goalkeeper David Seaman
helplessly stranded as he wheeled away after scoring his fourth
goal in his fourth international.
</P>
<P>
The match, the first England international in Sunderland since
1950, was never a classic but was still a useful exercise for both
managers with Belgium co-hosting the European championship finals
next year and England looking ahead to the qualifying play-offs
next month.

LOS ANGELES, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Video serving and
multimedia access technology from three U.S. companies have been
selected for a Shanghai online project, according to a report
released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI), a Mountain View, California-based
producer of visual computing system, said that Shanghai Post &AMP;
Telecommunications Administration has selected its technology and
those from Oracle Corporation and ViaGate Technologies for the
Shanghai Online II broadband network.
</P>
<P>
According to SGI, Shanghai Online II is expected to offer
residential and business customers broadband multimedia services
including high-speed Internet connections, voice services,
video-on-demand and interactive gaming. The project will help
address the growing need for enhanced Internet services in the
Shanghai metropolitan area and also will lay out the
infrastructure for future communications development.
</P>
<P>
A broadband network is ideal for these new services, SGI said,
and with scalable server technology, Shanghai Online can expand
their service and capacity as their subscribers base grows.
</P>
<P>
Having deployed a fiber network through its metropolitan area,
Shanghai is expending fiber both to the building and the
neighborhood. The initial trial phase of the Shanghai Online II
project involved 100 users who had access to MPEG-2 video content,
according to SGI. MPEG (moving pictures experts group) is a
standard for compression video. Using 4 to 16 megabits per second,
MPEG-2, used in DVD movies, is a broadcast-quality standard that
provides better resolution than VHS tapes.
