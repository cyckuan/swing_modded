At least 10 dead from Hurricane Isis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS MOCHIS, Mexico (AP) _ Hurricane Isis has left at least 10
people dead and caused widespread devastation in two Mexican
states, officials said Friday.
	   Jose Antonio Linan, civil defense spokesman in the state of
Sinaloa, said authorities had recovered the body of a man who had
been swept away by an overflowing stream, raising the death toll in
the state to eight, the government's Notimex news agency reported.
About 300 houses were destroyed.
	   Federal officials said the closure of roads had stranded more
than 1,200 bus passengers in the Pacific coast state.
	   Seemingly harder hit, but with a lower death toll, was the Los
Cabos region at the tip of the Baja California peninsula.
	   More than 12 hours of heavy rains and shrieking winds late
Tuesday and early Wednesday ravaged city streets, cut all roads to
the north and killed a married couple. The body of the husband, who
had been missing since the storm, was recovered Friday, Notimex
reported.
	   Notimex said troops were using shovels and bars to free at least
120 cars buried in mud that rushed down ravines and through city
streets.
	   The hurricane reached winds of 75 mph (120 kph), but quickly
dissipated after making landfall near Los Mochis and heading
inland.
	   Isis brought more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in a
day to Empalme, near the fishing and tourist town of Guaymas in
Sonora state. Even normally parched San Bernardino near the U.S.
border received 2.2 inches (5.5 centimeters), according to the
National Meteorological Service.
	   In the southern state of Chiapas, heavy rain caused the
Pijijiapan River to overflow its banks, destroying 20 houses and
hundreds of acres of corn in the villages of El Arenal,
Tapachulita, Salto de Agua, Topo and Ceniceros, officials said.
	   Over three days, rain has forced more than 2,000 people from
their homes in 40 villages in the state.

South Korea condemns North's missile capability
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea said Saturday it doesn't
matter whether North Korea launched a ballistic missile or a
satellite, its communist neighbor is a threat either way.
	   After a meeting of the National Security Council, the Foreign
Ministry issued a statement saying Seoul has been unable to confirm
North Korea's claim that Monday's launch was a scientific
satellite.
	   U.S. and Japanese officials had described it as a two-stage
ballistic missile that soared across northern Japan before dropping
into the Pacific Ocean.
	   ``Whether it's a satellite or a missile, it shows North Korea
has acquired an ability to deliver a missile. This is a serious
security threat to the region,'' Lee Ho-jin, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman, said.
	   Foreign ministers of the United States, Japan and South Korea
will meet later this month at the United Nations to discuss
countermeasures to the North's missile development, Lee said.
	   Military officials and scientists in the region scrambled
Saturday to try to verify or dismiss the North Korean claim that it
used a three-stage rocket to launch a satellite broadcasting
patriotic songs.
	   So far, South Korean officials have been unable to detect a
North Korean satellite in orbit. North Korea was not known to have
previously tested a three-stage rocket, although the country is
monitored closely by U.S. spy satellites.
	   Japanese defense officials have said the launch was a test of a
two-stage Taepo Dong 1 ballistic missile. U.S. officials said the
test represented a worrisome advance in North Korea's missile
capability.
	   ``Basic technology involved in launching a missile or a
satellite is the same,'' said Kim Doo-sup, a research fellow at
Seoul's Korean Institute for Defense Analysis.
	   ``It may be a scientific satellite. But the North didn't
urgently need one,'' Kim said. ``It was a military move. The North
has just demonstrated to the world that it can deliver a payload of
chemical, biological and perhaps nuclear explosives.''
	   For years, North Korea, a country dependent on outside aid to
feed its 24 million people, has been using its military capability
as a bargaining chip to get economic and other concessions from the
United States.
	   In the early 1990s, Western satellites discovered the country
building a massive complex of nuclear facilities, suspected of
concocting atomic bombs.
	   That led Washington to strike a deal with North Korea in 1994,
giving it two nuclear power plants worth at least dlrs 4.6 billion
in exchange for the North's promise to dismantle its suspect
nuclear weapons program.
	   North Korea says Monday's launch was of a three-stage,
domestically developed rocket with a satellite payload. The timing
and sites where the first two stages of the rockets fell coincided
with the American and Japanese reports of what they described as a
ballistic missile.
	   Some Western officials, including Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, questioned the North's credibility.

Water warning back in place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ For the third time in five weeks,
Sydney residents were warned Saturday not to drink water straight
from the tap.
	   The New South Wales Health Service said test results had shown
high concentrations of the parasites cryptosporidium and giardia in
drinking water from several filtration plants serving the majority
of Sydney's 3.7 million citizens.
	   Health Department director general Michael Reid admitted the
water problems were worse than before.
	   ``We clearly have an incident here of very high levels coming
through the treatment plant,'' Reid said. ``These are the highest
levels we've experienced to date.''
	   Residents should boil water before drinking, cleaning teeth,
gargling, washing uncooked foods such as salads and making ice, the
department said. Schoolchildren should take bottled water to
school.
	   The first contamination scare was in late July while the second
warnings had only just been lifted before Saturday's reinstatement.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium is spread in similar fashion. It causes flu-like
symptoms and can kill people with weak immune systems, including
the very young and the elderly.
	   The scares have caused severe embarrassment for Australia's
largest city, as the international spotlight intensifies in the
lead-up to the 2000 Olympic Games.
	   ``For it to happen twice suggests we have a problem that needs
rapid resolution,'' chief Olympics organizer Sandy Hollway said
before the latest scare. ``Were this to happen periodically between
now and the Games this would dent our image, it would be mad to say
otherwise.''
	   New South Wales Urban Affairs Minister Craig Knowles admitted he
could not guarantee an early end to the crisis and warned citizens
to take it seriously.

King opens talks aimed at ending Cambodia's political crisis

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Talks aimed at ending Cambodia's
current political crisis opened Saturday morning under the aegis of
King Norodom Sihanouk at his palace in the northwestern province of
Siem Reap.
	   The meeting _ held just a short distance from the famous temples
of Angkor Wat _ is chaired by the king and brings together
representatives from three rival political parties, the election
committee, and the country's highest appeals body.
	   The aim of the planned three-day meeting is to help ease
political tensions which have been mounting in Phnom Penh since
July 26 parliamentary elections, the 75-year-old monarch said in a
statement.
	   Those tensions have edged into violence which it is feared may
increase.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party won a slight majority in
the polls, but not the two-thirds needed to form a government on
his own.
	   The leading opposition party, FUNCINPEC, and its ally the Sam
Rainsy Party _ which together won 58 of 122 seats in the National
Assembly _ have accused Hun Sen of cheating to ensure victory at
the polls.
	   They have threatened to boycott the new National Assembly if
their allegations of fraud _ dismissed as baseless by election
authorities loyal to Hun Sen _ are not properly investigated.
	   Sihanouk said Saturday he wants to find out what concessions
rival parties are willing to make so that ``calm'' can return to
Phnom Penh, a new National Assembly can convene and a new
government can form.
	   He has expressed doubts that the goals of the meeting will be
reached.
	   The three main parties, he said, have so far stubbornly refused
to compromise on any of their demands.
	   The king, whose powers are limited by the constitution, is a
moral authority for many Cambodians.
	   Around-the-clock opposition protests against Hun Sen and alleged
election fraud entered their 13th day Saturday.
	   Thousands have turned up for the rallies.
	   The elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted the king's son,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, as co-premier in a bloody coup d'etat.
	   Opposition leaders Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy on Saturday
criticized this week's endorsements of the July polls by the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Japan, noting that their
complaints about irregularities have not been properly
investigated.
	   They said in a statement that they hoped the talks in Siem Reap
would provide them with a conduit to address legal and technical
concerns which have so far been ignored.
	   ``But we are concerned that premature endorsements of the
electoral process may jeopardize the process initiated by His
Majesty,'' they wrote.
	   Protests against Hun Sen have been largely peaceful, but angry
mobs linked to the recent upheaval were reported Friday to have
killed as many as five ethnic Vietnamese and severely beaten
others, accusing them of being behind a wave of fatal poisonings.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, who condemned the killings, have in
their public speeches played on the anti-Vietnamese prejudices held
by many Cambodians.
	   Though Vietnamese troops toppled the genocidal Khmer Rouge
regime in 1979, a harsh, decade-long occupation followed,
exacerbating traditional suspicion and hatred of Vietnam.
	   Many Cambodians see Hun Sen, who ruled the country during
Vietnam's occupation, as too pro-Hanoi, a perception encouraged by
his opponents.
	   In the wake of the killings of the Vietnamese, the government on
Saturday issued as statement condemning the rallies which they said
have ``incited racial discrimination and caused violence against
ethnic Vietnamese.''
	   The government, ``warned opposition parties to immediately stop
their anarchical and criminal acts, and their violations of the
law.''

After 10-year respite, Dow gets two 500-point drops in one year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Graphic MARKET 2WEEKS &QL; 
 &UR; By BRUCE MEYERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bull or bear, after two 500-point tumbles in
less than a year, even the longest-term investors may be wondering
whether they have what it takes to ride this bucking bronco.
	   Before Monday, and ignoring percentages, one might have hoped
that one-day drops of that size by the Dow Jones industrial average
came only once a decade.
	   After all, that's how long it took to get from the first ever,
the 508-point Black Monday plunge of Oct. 19, 1987, to the second,
the record 554-point slide last Oct. 27.
	   The third 500-point drop in history, Monday's loss of 512, will
likely be followed by aftershocks for weeks and months to come, but
the stock market will probably return to more normal levels of
volatility, analysts say.
	   The problem, however, is that ``normal'' has little to do with
the relative calm that investors have been spoiled by through most
of this decade.
	   Not only was last October's 500-point plunge the first in 10
years, it also was the first of at least 400 points, 300 points or
even 250 points since 1987.
	   But suddenly, in addition to Monday's sharp drop, there have
been moves of 337 points, 299 points, and 288 points in just the
past month alone.
	   Normal volatility, then, may mean that leaps and dives of 200
points, while not commonplace, won't be so unusual.
	   Maybe investors will get used to it. According to Alan
Steginsky, a 42-year-old doctor in Columbus, Ohio, ``Anything less
than 100 points is a flat market.''
	   It's easier to remain calm, of course, when you're still ahead,
said Dan Ascani, research director at Global Market Strategists in
Gainesville, Georgia.
	   ``Investors felt a lot of pain (during the recent slide).
They've just given back nearly half of the wealth they gained since
1995, when they began to pile into mutual funds at a heavy pace,''
he said. ``If it drops again, investors are not going to want to
give back the rest and could begin selling and contribute to a
greater selloff.''
	   For now, after a sobering 1,700-point, 18 percent drop from
July's record high of 9,337.97, the Dow is still about twice as
high as it was at the end of 1994.
	   ``It all depends if you're playing with their money or your
money,'' said Dub Cochran, a 75-year-old retiree from Des Moines,
Iowa. ``It's just like a casino. Once you start getting into your
money then you start losing your stomach.''
	   But even if the huge losses of recent weeks didn't shake their
Pavlovian confidence in Wall Street's ability to bounce back,
perhaps a steady diet of 200-point swings will make investors
reconsider whether they have the stamina to ride out even a rising
stock market.
	   ``People aren't used to the violent price moves that we've seen,
but one can't expect that in a month's time they will become so
alarmed that they bail out,'' said Richard A. Dickson, a technical
analyst at Scott and Stringfellow in Richmond, Virginia.
	   ``They're looking at their mutual fund statements and they see
it going down, but everybody says, `No big deal.' People have been
told you have to be long-term. It's not going to take one or two
months to shake that conviction,'' he said. ``When you're looking
at a string of losses on your statement, that's when it becomes a
definite concern. It's easy to be long-term in a bull market. It's
harder in a bear.''
	   On Friday, the Dow fell 41.97 to 7,640.25, down 411.43 for the
week. The decline left the Dow with a loss of 268 points, or 3.4
percent, for the year. At the July peak, the Dow was up 18.1
percent for 1998.
	   The New York Stock Exchange set a new one week volume record of
4.690 billion shares, blowing past the previous mark of 4.016
billion set last October.
	   In other trading Friday, the Standard and Poor's 500 fell 8.37
to 973.89, down 53.25 for the week; the Nasdaq composite fell 5.34
to 1,566.52, down 73.16 for the week; and the NYSE composite index
fell 3.58 to 486.31, down 25.81 for the week.
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.78 to 347.07
on Friday, trimming the week's loss to 11.47.
	   Likewise, the small-company dominated American Stock Exchange
composite index rose 4.01 to 602.71 on Friday, escaping the week
with a slim gain of 0.13.
	   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index _ which represents the
combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues _
ended the week at dlrs 8.931 trillion, a loss of dlrs 486.9 billion
for the week. A year ago, the index stood a shade higher at dlrs
8.941 trillion.

Spirlea defeats Serena Williams in tame match

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ No bumping. No cursing. And not much intensity
until a dramatic final two games that left Irina Spirlea pumping
her fists in triumph and Serena Williams walking dejectedly to her
chair.
	   In what promised to be a grudge match but turned into an
exhibition of mostly mundane tennis, Spirlea defeated Williams 6-3,
0-6, 7-5 Friday night to reach the fourth round of the U.S. Open.
	   Spirlea had collided with Serena's older sister, Venus, during a
changeover while losing in the semifinals last year. The incident
led Spirlea to curse Venus Williams after that match, and Richard
Williams _ the father of Serena and Venus _ to label Spirlea ``a
big, tall white turkey.''
	   Richard Williams also said at that time that Spirlea ``ought to
be glad it wasn't Serena she bumped into. She would have been
decked.''
	   But there were no fireworks or fistfights Friday night. The
players carefully avoided each other on changeovers, though they
exchanged only a perfunctory handshake after the match.
	   ``Tonight was not my night. That was the best she served in her
career. I didn't play that well. She had a lot of big serves I was
not able to return,'' Williams said. ``I'm pretty disappointed. I
didn't plan on losing today or in this tournament.''
	   The ninth-seeded Spirlea screamed after the final point and
swatted a ball high into the stands. Her victory kept up the
pattern of favorites moving easily through the tournament _ only
two seeded women and three seeded men have been eliminated so far.
	   Men's No. 10 Carlos Moya needed 3 hours, 49 minutes to rally
from a two-set deficit for the first time in his career as he
defeated Michael Chang 3-6, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-3 in a match
that lasted until 1:33 a.m. EDT.

Explosion in Dagestan kills 10 people, injures 80
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NABI ABDULAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ A car bomb probably caused the
explosion that killed at least 10 people, including two children,
and gouged a five-meter (15-foot) crater in a street in the capital
of a restive southern Russian region, officials said Saturday.
	   At least 80 people were injured in the Friday night explosion
and half remained in hospitals, according to the press office of
the regional administration of Dagestan.
	   The Emergency Situations Ministry initially said the explosion
was caused by an artillery shell fired from an eastern suburb of
the Dagestan capital of Makhachkala.
	   But the local administration said Saturday that shards of glass
and metal fragments found in the bodies suggested a car bomb.
	   Dagestan has been wracked by violence and kidnappings in recent
months as various religious and ethnic groups battle for power. It
has also been hit by spillover violence from breakaway Chechnya, on
its western border. A car bomb recently killed Dagestan's top
Islamic leader.
	   Friday's explosion occurred outside the local television center
on the street where Dagestan's prime minister, Khizri Shikhsaidov,
and Makhachkala Mayor Said Amirov live. Neither was hurt.
	   Local TV commentator Angela Mamadibirova said the attack was
believed to be an attempt on Amirov's life. She said he has
survived 10 assassination attempts this year.
	   Later, television reporters speculated that the explosion had
been intended to destroy the television center. The TV building was
badly damaged, and 40 percent of its equipment destroyed, the
television report said.
	   A building housing an agricultural institute and 10 buildings
nearby were also damaged, the Interfax news agency said. Many
students living in a dormitory at the institute were injured by
glass shards, local television said.
	   The explosion left a crater 5 meters wide (16-1/2 feet wide) and
3 meters deep (nearly 10 feet deep).
	   Rescuers, including airborne troops and specially trained
Emergency Situations Ministry workers flown in from Moscow,
searched for more victims on Saturday.
	   The ministry said another 10 people were believed trapped in the
rubble, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. It did not say whether they
were thought to be dead or alive.
	   The regional government declared Saturday and Sunday to be days
of mourning.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Some hugged one another, others
stood alone. One woman plucked wildflowers near the base of the
lighthouse, then crouched and stared out to sea.
	   More than 300 relatives of Swissair Flight 111 victims, their
privacy protected by police and military escorts, are mourning
together and visiting Peggy's Cove _ the coastal town closest to
where their loved ones died in the crash Wednesday that killed 229
people.
	   Despite intensive efforts, including deployment of a submarine
equipped with sonar, searchers have been unable to locate the
plane's flight-data and voice recorders, which could shed light on
the cause of the crash.
	   Most of the victims' bodies have not been recovered yet, and
most of the human remains retrieved so far are fragments, slowing
the identification process.
	   On Friday, about a dozen relatives who arrived on a series of
flights from New York and Geneva made the trip to the fishing
village near Halifax that has become the base for searchers.
	   Peter Gerety _ who traveled from Connecticut to be near the site
where his brother, U.N. worker Pierce Gerety, was killed _ carried
two rocks off the beach.
	   ``I just felt like having a memento. It was such a beautiful
place, and that's the irony of it.''
	   Swissair chief executive Jeff Katz said a private,
non-denominational memorial service would be held Saturday for the
victims. The time of the service was not provided to the media.
	   The plane, en route from New York to Geneva, disappeared from
radar screens 16 minutes after its pilots reported smoke in the
cockpit.
	   Air traffic controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, advised the
pilots to make an emergency landing in Halifax, but the MD-11
wide-body jet never made it, crashing into the ocean 30 miles (50
kilometers) to the south.
	   At a press conference Friday, the chief investigator defended
the actions of the cockpit crew, saying their last conversation
with controllers was conducted in a professional manner.
	   Vic Gerden of Canada's Transportation Safety Board refused to
speculate on what happened in the jet's final moments.
	   ``I don't deal in maybes, could haves and would haves,'' he
said. ``The crew indicated there was smoke in the cockpit. We don't
have further indication of specific problems.''
	   Gerden said the plane descended rapidly while trying to reach
Halifax and made a couple of sharp turns over the coast while
dumping fuel.
	   Katz told a news conference the three-engine jetliner was well
maintained, saying it ``had a clean bill of health.''
	   He said Swissair had complied with all directives from U.S.
aviation officials advising of wiring problems in MD-11 jets. Two
such advisories in 1996 and 1997 warned of potentially hazardous
wiring in the cockpit and in a rear consol for flight attendants.
	   Authorities say the wreckage is so fragmented that it may be
difficult to reconstruct the plane, as would normally be done in
the investigation.
	   The hunt has turned up no piece of wreckage bigger than a
kitchen tabletop, though 100 pieces of luggage were recovered
Friday.
	   Authorities were mapping the ocean floor in preparation for
sending down a small, remote-controlled submersible to investigate
the sea bed.
	   Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, Dr. John Butt, said X-rays
and dental charts would be needed to identify the victims. He said
relatives would not be pressured to come to a makeshift morgue at
an air base to assist with the identifications.
	   The family members who made the trip to Peggy's Cove on Friday
got an escort from soldiers as they got out of their vehicles. The
throng of reporters at the site was kept at a distance.
	   Valerie Warren was among the volunteer bus drivers who picked up
mourners at the Halifax airport.
	   ``It was a very quiet ride in,'' she said. ``A baby crying was
the only noise I heard.''
	   Many relatives chose not to accept Swissair's offer to bring
them to the crash scene, including former boxing champion Jake
LaMotta, whose son Joe was on the doomed airplane.
	   ``Why bring on the extra grief?'' said LaMotta, 76, who lost his
only other son, Jake Jr., in February. ``I'm pretty on in years. I
don't want to face it 'til I have to. ... It's just too much for me
now.''
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it would help arrange
press briefings by relatives willing to make statements, but warned
journalists not to intrude on those who wished to be left alone.
	   Staff Sgt. Keith McGuire also said police were becoming
exasperated with members of the public, both on shore and in boats,
venturing into the search area to look for debris. He said the
intruders face arrest and seizure of their boats.

South Korea condemns North's missile capability
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATEs with Itar-Tass report of satellite launch, grafs 4-5,
and with comments by President Kim and former Secretary of State
Kissinger, grafs 11-12

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea said Saturday it doesn't
matter whether North Korea launched a ballistic missile or a
satellite, its communist neighbor is a threat either way.
	   After a meeting of the National Security Council, the Foreign
Ministry issued a statement saying Seoul has been unable to confirm
North Korea's claim that Monday's launch was a scientific
satellite.
	   U.S. and Japanese officials had described it as a two-stage
ballistic missile that soared across northern Japan before dropping
into the Pacific Ocean.
	   But the Russian Service for the Monitoring of Space Objects said
it had confirmed that North Korea had launched a satellite, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported from Moscow.
	   Itar-Tass quoted an unidentified official of the service as
saying the satellite was circling the earth every two hours and 45
minutes in a high, elliptical orbit.
	   ``Whether it's a satellite or a missile, it shows North Korea
has acquired an ability to deliver a missile. This is a serious
security threat to the region,'' Lee Ho-jin, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman, said.
	   Foreign ministers of the United States, Japan and South Korea
will meet later this month at the United Nations to discuss
countermeasures to the North's missile development, Lee said.
	   Countries in the region scrambled Saturday to verify or dismiss
the North Korean claim that it used a three-stage rocket to launch
a satellite broadcasting patriotic songs.
	   So far, South Korean officials have been unable to detect a
satellite. North Korea was not known to have previously tested a
three-stage rocket, although it is monitored closely by U.S. spy
satellites.
	   Japanese defense officials have said it was the test launch of a
two-stage Taepo Dong 1 ballistic missile. U.S. officials said it
showed a worrisome increase in North Korea's missile capability.
	   The test launch could lead Japan to develop a missile defense
system and trigger a missile proliferation in the region, former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was quoted as saying in a
meeting with President Kim Dae-jung on Saturday.
	   Kim called for a closer military cooperation with Washington,
saying the North was using its missile development to extract more
economic and other concessions from the United States and Japan,
his office said.
	   ``Basic technology involved in launching a missile or a
satellite is the same,'' said Kim Doo-sup, a research fellow at
Seoul's Korean Institute for Defense Analysis.
	   ``It may be a scientific satellite. But the North didn't
urgently need one,'' Kim said. ``It was a military move. The North
has just demonstrated to the world that it can deliver a payload of
chemical, biological and perhaps nuclear explosives.''
	   For years, North Korea, a country dependent on outside aid to
feed its 24 million people, has been using its military capability
as a bargaining chip to get economic and other concessions from the
United States.
	   In the early 1990s, Western satellites discovered the country
building a massive complex of nuclear facilities, suspected of
concocting atomic bombs.
	   That led Washington to strike a deal with North Korea in 1994,
giving it two nuclear power plants worth at least dlrs 4.6 billion
in exchange for the North's promise to dismantle its suspect
nuclear weapons program.

	   Polls opened in early morning on hazy, warm day amid
expectations for high turnout among the 278,000 eligible voters.
Maltese are traditionally very passionate over their politics, and
turnout was expected to along the lines of the 96 percent figure of
1996.
	   Polls were scheduled to close at 10 p.m. (2000 gmt). Complete
official results were likely to be announced on Monday, but enough

Hong Kong's quasi-central bank acts to strengthen currency peg
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's quasi-central bank unveiled on
Saturday seven steps to strengthen the territory's 15-year old
currency peg to the U.S. dollar, but said it reserved the right to
intervene should it see continued manipulation in the markets.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced it will lend Hong
Kong dollars to banks at the rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars to the
U.S. currency, adding that it will move up the rate to the official
peg of 7.80 if necessary.
	   The measures will take effect immediately when the markets open
on Monday.
	   Hong Kong has tied the value of its own currency to the U.S.
dollar for more than a decade. It has held that rate steady over
recent months, which has taken a toll on local industry by making
the territory far more costly than other places in Asia to do
business.
	   ``If there is no manipulation in the currency market _ and these
regulations make it more difficult _ we will step back from the
market,'' said HKMA Chief Executive Joseph Yam, adding that the
HKMA still reserves the right to intervene if it sees market
manipulation.
	   The quasi-central bank has spent nearly 15 percent of its 96
billion U.S. dollars in foreign reserves in an effort to defend the
dollar peg against speculators in the money markets.
	   In the past few weeks, speculators have played on the currency
peg's connection to local interest rates, driving rates higher and
share prices lower, in an attempt to weaken the peg. With the
announcement, the HKMA effectively guarantees funding will be
available for banks to settle their accounts by providing a clear
convertibility rate.
	   The HKMA said the changes were necessary to face ``the worst
financial turmoil in the history of Asia.''
	   ``The package of technical measures will strengthen our defense
against manipulation by the speculators in our foreign exchange and
money markets,'' said Financial Secretary Donald Tsang in a
statement.
	   Yam said the changes would ease volatile interest rates and make
it harder for speculators to bet against the Hong Kong dollar,
while banks could now lend Hong Kong dollars without fear of
dramatic fluctuations.
	   ``I think volatility of interest rates will be dampened,'' Yam
told Dow Jones Newswires. ``(Speculators) would need to sell quite
a lot more (Hong Kong dollars) to make interest rates go up.''
	   Hong Kong's major banks welcomed the move. The Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corp. _ the territory's largest bank _ welcomed
the move, saying in a statement that the measures would ``bring
calm and stability to Hong Kong's financial markets and help reduce
interest rate volatility.''
	   ``I think that the adjustments are very technical, but they
reinforce the whole concept of the currency board,'' Mervyn Davies,
chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, told Dow Jones
Newswires. ``They should have a stabilizing effect on foreign
exchange and money markets.''
	   At midday Saturday, the Hong Kong dollar was quoted at 7.7310 to
the U.S. currency, sharply stronger from 7.7499 late Friday. The
Hong Kong dollar strengthened overnight after the HKMA said it
would announce measures to strengthen the dollar peg.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hard-line lawmakers backed down from confrontation
with Boris Yeltsin, unexpectedly postponing hearings on whether to
confirm the president's pick for prime minister.
	   Opposition leaders said Friday that they would accept Yeltsin's
invitation to discuss the candidacy of acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin face to face before the new vote, which was
rescheduled for Monday.
	   They said Saturday they would present five alternative names for
consideration _ including Soviet-era Central Bank chairman Vladimir
Gerashchenko and the former head of the Soviet state planning
committee, Yuri Maslyukov.
	   Political leaders were expected to spend a second weekend trying
to reach a deal. Behind-the-scenes dealing a week ago led to a pact
in which Yeltsin agreed to cede some power to parliament in return
for lawmakers' confirmation of Chernomyrdin. The deal was
jettisoned when the largest faction in the lower house, the
Communists, backed out and the chamber rejected Chernomyrdin
handily the next day.
	   ``A longer pause for contemplation is better than haste,''
Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said Friday.
	   Yeltsin and the lower chamber, the State Duma, have been locked
in battle for nearly two weeks over Chernomyrdin's nomination,
following the president's dismissal of the previous government on
Aug. 23.
	   Meanwhile, the economy has deteriorated by the day. On Friday,
the ruble dropped another 21 percent and sharp price rises spurred
consumer anxiety.
	   ``I started to get worried today for the first time,'' said one
shopper, retired theater director Nina Vasilyeva. ``The idea of
stocking up hadn't even come into my head before. But groceries are
now twice as expensive. I'm buying things I don't need because
everybody's bought the rest.''
	   The official ruble rate fell Friday to 16.99 to the U.S. dollar,
or 5.8 cents, down from 13.46 to the dollar, or 7.4 cents, on
Thursday. The street level was even lower.
	   Under the constitution, Yeltsin has three chances to propose a
prime ministerial candidate, either the same person or different
people. If the Duma votes no three times, the president can disband
the legislature and call new elections.
	   Yeltsin has said he will nominate no one other than
Chernomyrdin, whom he fired last spring after he served as prime
minister more than five years.
	   The leader of the Agrarian Party, Nikolai Kharitonov, said
Saturday that he and his allies in the Communist Party and People's
Power faction would give Yeltsin five other names on Monday.
	   Besides Gerashchenko and Maslyukov, they will suggest Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov; Yegor Stroyev, speaker of the Federation
Council, the upper house of parliament; and Gennady Kulik, deputy
chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Interfax said the opposition leaders considered proposing
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov as well.
	   ``I decided not to name Zyuganov because this name gives the
president heartburn,'' Khartinov said.
	   The opposition has insisted it would oppose Chernomyrdin, whose
failed leadership they say is to blame for the crisis.
	   ``We won't consider any agreement. We're not going to sign
anything. And we will not vote for Viktor Stepanovich
(Chernomyrdin) because we think he's unable to handle this job,''
Zyuganov told the Duma on Friday.
	   However, Chernomyrdin's position was strengthened Friday when
the Federation Council passed a non-binding motion 91-17 expressing
confidence in him.
	   The vote was only symbolic, but it may increase pressure on the
Duma to find a compromise. The regional governors who make up the
Council have huge power and the vote signaled they would back
Yeltsin in a showdown.
	   Before the upper house vote, Chernomyrdin tried to convince them
that he can cure Russia's economic woes.
	   ``It may be our last chance to build a normal economy in Russia.
Yes, our actions will be unpopular. Everyone will assail us. But
don't tie the government's hands, give us time to step back from
the precipice. That refers to everyone from the president on
down,'' he said.

Police investigate new reports against deposed deputy PM
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's top police chief said
Saturday that ousted deputy prime minister tried to interfere with
a criminal investigation against him.
	   Inspector-General of Police Rahim Noor told a news conference
that police were investigating four new police reports accusing
Anwar Ibrahim of tampering with evidence and intimidating
witnesses.
	   Since Anwar was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on Wednesday, he has been dogged by allegations ranging
from sexual misconduct to leaking state secrets.
	   Most of these accusations have been published in a book entitled
``50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Be PM,'' which the police have been
scrutinizing for months. The four reports announced by Rahim on
Saturday brings to eight the number of police reports filed against
Anwar.
	   ``We have strong evidence that Anwar resorted to persistent and
consistent measures to thwart police investigations, manipulating
them for his own benefit,'' Rahim said. ``If necessary, we'll
expose all this in court.''
	   He added that he hoped to conclude the investigations ``as soon
as possible'' so they could decide whether or not Anwar should be
arrested and charged.
	   Rahim stressed that the ongoing police investigations weren't
politically motivated and weren't ``a conspiracy at the highest
levels'' to depose Anwar.
	   ``We're investing the case under the jurisdiction of law.
Anything else wouldn't be professional,'' said Rahim.
	   Speaking to reporters outside his residence in the affluent
Damansara neighborhood, Anwar shrugged off the new allegations.
	   ``I wouldn't be surprised if they added 20 more,'' he said.
	   He also canceled plans to lead an entourage of supporters on a
370-kilometer- (222-mile-) drive north to his hometown in Penang
state, where he would launch a rally to clear his name.
	   He told the reporters keeping a 24-hour vigil outside his home
that the trip had been canceled due to ``unsettled business'' in
the capital.
	   Earlier Saturday, Anwar warmly welcomed Lim Kit Siang, the
opposition leader of Parliament and his one-time chief antagonist,
into his home.
	   Lim later emerged from a closed-door meeting and called for an
emergency Parliament session to be convened to discuss Anwar's
plight. However, he denied that Anwar was planning to align himself
with Malaysia's opposition forces.
	   Lim's son, Lim Guan Eng, recently began serving an 18-month
prison term for having questioned the country's judicial system in
a pamphlet.
	   Human rights activists fear the beginning of a political
crackdown against the opposition as Malaysia struggles with the
worst economic crisis in 13 years.
	   Anwar on Friday said that if he were arrested, ``hundreds more
will follow me.''
	   Anwar was unceremoniously dumped as deputy prime minister and
finance minister after months of political differences with his
boss, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   He was then expelled as vice president of the ruling United
Malays National Organization, after UMNO Supreme Council members
feared that police investigations against Anwar could smear their
party's reputation.
	   Anwar for years was seen as Mahathir's heir to the prime
minister's post. Many believed he would be given the nod from his
one-time mentor during next year's UMNO elections.
	   But now, the conservative Muslim who once spearheaded a drive
for stronger Islamic influence over the secular government of this
Southeast Asian nation, stands accused of sexual misconduct and
treason.
	   Anwar said he intends to clear his name in court, then begin a
campaign of political reforms.

Thousands pray for Mother Teresa on first death anniversary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ Housewives, beggars and schoolchildren
were among thousands of people who joined nuns of the Missionaries
of Charity to pray for the extraordinary Mother Teresa of Calcutta
on the first anniversary of her death on Saturday.
	   At a special early morning mass at Mother House, the
headquarters of Mother Teresa's charity, priests from different
churches in the eastern Indian city of Calcutta conducted prayers
and read passages from the bible.
	   Father Francis Gomes from the nearby St. Xavier's church led the
mass and offered holy communion to all the nuns and Catholics
present.
	   ``Her lovable memory which guided us to the path of god is still
fresh in our hearts. Today we all assemble here to commemorate the
first anniversary of her death that touched millions of hearts,''
he said.
	   Since dawn on Saturday, hundreds of visitors queued at the tomb
of Mother Teresa to pay their respects to the nun who became famous
as the ``Saint of the Gutter'' for her work among India's poorest
people.
	   Among them was 50 year old Arun Nath, a disabled man whose
treatment Mother Teresa funded over the years.
	   ``I came here to pay tribute to the great soul. In her death
last year, I lost my mother again,'' he said.
	   Nuns of her charity organization stood near her tomb, decorated
simply with white roses and marigolds, as admirers filed by and
laid bouquets at the foot of her grave.
	   ``Whenever I used to come here earlier, I was always greeted
with a smile by mother. Like all others, I miss her so much,'' said
Julian Vicario, a Spaniard who has been doing voluntary work with
the Missionaries of Charity for two years.
	   Later, Sister Nirmala, a Hindu-born Indian convert to
Catholicism who became Mother Teresa's successor, held an all faith
prayer in her honor.
	   ``Today is a great day as mother has gone home to god and she is
resting there. She is very powerful with god to intercede for us,
pray for us and bless us,'' Sister Nirmala said to the Hindus,
Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs and members of India's other
religious minorities who had gathered there.
	   Dozen's of Mother Teresa's admirers said her presence could
still be felt a year after her death.
	   ``Whenever I used to get mentally fatigued, I came to mother
house. The very first sight of mother used to bring back my peace
of mind. Though mother is no more, I get the same kind of feeling
whenever I visit mother's tomb,'' said Shibani Dutta, a Hindu
housewife, who traveled from a Calcutta suburb take part in the
prayers.
	   Hourly prayers will be held through the day at the first floor
chapel in the Mother House, said Sister Christi, spokeswoman of the
Missionaries of Charity. Another all faith prayer meeting will be
held later in the afternoon, she said.
	   Nuns also held feeding programs for the poor during the day at
several homes that are run in the city by the charity order.

Government, rights commission to set up reconciliation team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government and the
National Commission on Human Rights have agreed to set up a
reconciliation team to deal with threats against national unity.
	   The formation of the informal National Reconciliation Team was
endorsed during a meeting Friday with President B.J. Habibie.
	   Its members will include government officials, public figures,
representatives of the government-sponsored watchdog and
non-government organizations.
	   ``We will soon announce the line up of the team,'' said Marzuki
Darusman, vice chairman of the rights body, known as Komnasham.
	   Darusman said the new team would propose issues concerning
national integrity that should be handled by the president and his
cabinet ``in order to reach a new perception for the progress of
the state.''
	   Justice Minister Muladi was appointed liaison officer in the
formation of the reconciliation team.
	   Muladi, who also is a member of the rights body, said national
reconciliati	   Muladi, on is important to strengthen national unity and to
combat the threat of separatism.
	   ``We try to forget past resentment without ignoring legal
efforts,'' Muladi said.
	   Also present at the three-hour meeting were Armed Forces
Commander Gen. Wiranto and all his chiefs of staff, and a number of
cabinet ministers.
	   Indonesia has been plagued by social unrest and political
upheaval as it struggles with a severe economic crisis that set in
July of last year.
	   Widespread violence and student-lead protests in May were
instrumental in forcing the resignation of former President
Suharto, who had ruled the country with an iron hand for more than
three decades.
	   About 1,200 people were killed in the violence.
	   Habibie, who replaced Suharto, is still regarded by university
students and government critics as ``a continuation of the Suharto
regime.''

The United States should stop pressuring Japan on economy, paper
</HEADLINE>
says

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese newspaper on Saturday criticized U.S.
pressure on Japan during a meeting of the countries' top finance
officials, saying Japan alone can't fix the world economy.
	   Washington has been pushing Tokyo to take on more drastic
financial reforms. The latest call came Friday at the end of talks
between Japan and the United States aimed at containing a worldwide
financial crisis.
	   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said after a meeting in San
Francisco with Japan's Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that the
revival of Japan's economy is key to putting the global economy
back on a sound footing.
	   ``Stabilizing the global economy requires more than action from
just Japan. The United States must also make efforts,'' the Yomiuri
Shimbun _ Japan's largest circulation daily _ said in an editorial.
	   ``Even as the American economy enters a dangerous position of
its own, the United States can't move beyond its preoccupation with
pressuring Japan,'' the paper said.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party has been trying to
pass a series of bills designed to stabilize the financial system
and to use public money to clean up debt-ridden banks.
	   But the plan has been tied up in Parliament by opposition
parties which don't want to use public funds to bailout banks.
	   Analysts in Tokyo said pressure from the United States may be
just what the government needs to break the legislative log jam.
	   ``Really what this whole meeting was about was for the United
States to communicate to Japan's opposition that this government is
on the right track and if you oppose it and defeat it you become
part of the problem,'' said Kenneth Courtis, chief economist at
Deutche Bank Capital Markets.
	   U.S. pressure could encourage ruling and opposition parties to
seek a compromise to pass the important financial legislation,
Courtis said.
	   Rubin said after Friday's meeting that ``the world needs Japan
to get back on track.''
	   Japan made no new commitments on measures to revive its sagging
economy, but Miyazawa said Japan would take ``all possible steps to
promote financial stability.''

Myanmar newspapers denounce opposition as World Bank bars loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ As one college campus remained closed
Saturday for fear of student unrest, the state-run press accused
the pro-democratic opposition of demanding the impossible in a bid
to destabilize the country.
	   The commentary, which also took note of Southeast Asia's
economic turmoil, comes at a time when the military government is
facing increasing challenges.
	   The World Bank on Friday announced that Myanmar _ also known as
Burma _ would ineligible for new loans from the international
lending body because of a failure to pay old debts. The move
doesn't affect any existing World Bank programs for Myanmar, but it
sends a signal around the world that the country is a bad credit
risk.
	   The World Bank's last project in Myanmar closed in 1995, after
the agency gave Myanmar its last loan in 1987. After that, the
macroeconomic environment became so severe that the bank felt it
was unable to operate in Myanmar.
	   The commentary in Saturday's state-run newspapers said that
while economies in Southeast Asia are in turmoil and countries
around the world are facing economic crisis, the Myanmar government
has tried hard to overcome difficulties within its capacity.
	   ``Taking advantage of the economic crisis in the region, some
people are trying to create anarchy by demanding for the
impossible,'' it said. ``They are instigating the public to revolt
and protest, leading towards the disintegration of the country.''
	   It warned that anyone trying to disrupt the national convention
will have to face the punishment of the people.
	   Although the commentary did not refer to any organization by
name, it appeared to be talking about the National League for
Democracy.
	   The NLD, led by Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi, won
82 percent of the seats in parliament in a 1990 election, but the
military refused to honor the result.
	   Suu Kyi and her colleagues have vowed they will convene
parliament sometime during September. The government has threatened
to arrest the opposition leaders and ban her party if they try.
	   The military has said that a constitution is necessary to
convene parliament and accused the opposition of going against the
law. A national convention to draw up guidelines for a constitution
began in 1993 has been in recess since 1996.
	   Access to the Hlaing campus of the Yangon Institute of
Technology remained closed Saturday morning. The campus was closed
Thursday after students began chanting and demanding examinations
be delayed.
	   Hundreds of students have demonstrated publicly at least three
times during the past two weeks, the first public protests in
Yangon in almost two years.
	   Students last demonstrated in December 1996. The military put
down the protests without excessive force, but sentenced dozens of
students to long prison terms. Universities have been shut since.
	   Some were reopened within the last few months so students could
prepare for and take long-delayed exams. Examinations are scheduled
for Monday, and students at the Hlaing campus said they wanted them
delayed.
	   The military government is extremely wary of any activism on the
part of students, as they have historically played pivotal roles
Myanmar's political movements.

Sacked Malaysian leader's wife stands by him: Singapore report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The wife of Anwar Ibrahim, who was sacked as
Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister amid
allegations he engaged in sexual misconduct, said in an interview
published Saturday she is standing by her husband.
	   Singapore's tabloid, The New Paper, asked Dr. Wan Azizah Wan
Ismail how she feels about seeing salacious newspaper allegations
about her husband engaging in sodomy and wearing a wig for a sexual
rendez-vous.
	   ``It's not painful, because I know it's not true,'' the
51-year-old retired physician said in the interview.
	   Anwar, with his wife sitting next to him at a news conference
Thursday, gave a blanket denial to the allegations of sexual antics
as well as more serious suggestions of leaking state secrets.
	   He said the allegations, for which he has not been formally
charged, were part of a political conspiracy to discredit him
because of disagreements with his former mentor, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar from his Cabinet posts on Wednesday and
orchestrated his former designated successor's ouster from the
governing party on Thursday. Anwar, who was detained for 22 months
in 1974-75 under the country's laws that allow imprisonment without
charge, expects to be arrested soon.
	   Dr. Wan Azizah rejected The New Paper reporter's suggestion that
her situation is like that of Hillary Clinton, whose husband, U.S.
President Bill Clinton, has acknowledged engaging in extra-marital
sexual activities.
	   Dr. Wan Azizah said she had told her six children, ``Your father
is a brave man and he's been victimized.''

King opens talks aimed at ending Cambodia's political crisis

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ No breakthroughs were reported
Saturday on the first day of talks aimed at ending Cambodia's
current political crisis, but participants described the meeting's
atmosphere as positive.
	   The meeting, chaired by King Norodom Sihanouk, is being held
just a short distance from the famous temples of Angkor Wat in the
northwestern province of Siem Reap.
	   It brings together representatives from three rival political
parties, the election committee, and the country's highest appeals
body to discuss the stalemate that has followed parliamentary
elections in July.
	   Sihanouk said Saturday the goal of the planned three-day meeting
is to find out what concessions rival parties are willing to make
so that ``calm'' can return to Phnom Penh, a new National Assembly
can convene and a new government can form.
	   But he has expressed doubts that the talks will be successful,
saying beforehand that the three main parties have so far
stubbornly refused to compromise on any of their demands.
	   ``We have not reached a satisfactory solution to any issue
yet,'' said Tol Lah, a representative of the opposition FUNCINPEC
party, after the four-hour meeting at Sihanouk's palace. ``Although
differences remain, the meeting took place in a good and brotherly
atmosphere.''
	   ``This is not a deadlock, many issues still need to be discussed
and will continue tomorrow,'' he said. ``I have optimism that all
parties will do their best to try to find a solution.''
	   Tensions have been mounting in Phnom Penh since the July 26
parliamentary elections.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party won a slight majority in
the polls, but not the two-thirds needed to form a government on
his own.
	   The leading opposition party, FUNCINPEC, and its ally the Sam
Rainsy Party _ which together won 58 of 122 seats in the National
Assembly _ have accused Hun Sen of cheating to ensure victory at
the polls.
	   They have threatened to boycott the new National Assembly if
their allegations of fraud _ dismissed as baseless by election
authorities loyal to Hun Sen _ are not properly investigated.
	   Tol Lah hinted Saturday that if all technical and legal issues
regarding election irregularities can be resolved, there might be
an informal meeting between the party heads.
	   However, Say Bory, a representative of the Constitutional
Council _ which has rejected all protests of election
irregularities _ said Saturday that the body's rulings were
``unappealable.''
	   The elections came one year after Hun Sen ousted the king's son,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, as co-premier in a bloody coup d'etat.
	   Around-the-clock opposition protests against Hun Sen and alleged
election fraud, which have attracted thousands, entered their 13th
day Saturday.
	   Protests against Hun Sen have been largely peaceful, but angry
mobs were reported Friday to have killed as many as five ethnic
Vietnamese and severely beaten others, accusing them of being
behind a wave of fatal poisonings.
	   Opposition leaders Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, who condemned the
killings, have in their public speeches played on the
anti-Vietnamese prejudices held by many Cambodians.
	   Though Vietnamese troops toppled the genocidal Khmer Rouge
regime in 1979, a harsh, decade-long occupation followed,
exacerbating traditional suspicion and hatred of Vietnam.
	   Many Cambodians see Hun Sen, who ruled the country during
Vietnam's occupation, as too pro-Hanoi, a perception encouraged by
his opponents.
	   In the wake of the killings of the Vietnamese, the government on
Saturday issued as statement condemning the rallies which they said
have ``incited racial discrimination and caused violence against
ethnic Vietnamese.''
	   The government, ``warned opposition parties to immediately stop
their anarchical and criminal acts, and their violations of the
law.''

Omagh atrocity claims 29th fatality

 &UR; With BC-Clinton-Ireland

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The terrorist car bombing of
Omagh, already the most deadly atrocity in the 30-year history of
Northern Ireland's conflict, claimed a 29th fatal victim Saturday.
	   The man, who was not immediately identified, died in Belfast's
Royal Victoria Hospital 21 days after Irish Republican Army
dissidents detonated their bomb amid workers, shoppers and Spanish
tourists in the religiously mixed town of Omagh.
	   Medical officials said 29 of the more than 330 people wounded in
the blast remained hospitalized Saturday, including two young women
in critical condition.
	   The latest death came two days after U.S. President Clinton and
his wife, Hillary, paid respects to the dead and wounded in a visit
to the bomb-shattered center of Omagh.

Bucharest to host glittering festival of music and song
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Who says that Bucharest, in its heyday
the Paris of the East, has forgotten that life is a celebration of
music and song? Not Yehudi Menuhin, for sure.
	   And not Spanish mezzo-soprano Tereza Berganza, U.S. soprano
Barbara Hendricks or Israeli violinist Shlomo Mintz. All three will
perform at the two-week George Enesecu Festival which opens Sunday.
	   ``The great treasures and traditions of Eastern European music
are superbly represented by the Enescu Festival,'' Menuhin said in
a statement, shortly before the festival opened.
	   Menuhin, the famous American-born violinist comes to the
festival, his third time in Romania, as its director. He studied
the violin with Enescu and said the Romanian composer deeply
influenced his artistic development.
	   ``How delighted that most modest of men, my great teacher, would
have been to learn that there is a wonderful festival dedicated to
him!'' Menuhin raved.
	   This former Communist country long prided itself on its talented
artists and love of culture. On Friday, tickets were almost sold
out, despite their relatively high cost for Romania, where the
average monthly salary equals dlrs 110.
	   In a sign of their commitment to international culture,
Romania's cash-strapped government and national radio and
television spent lei 34 billion (almost dlrs 4 million) to host the
hundreds of soloists, choir singers and musicians.
	   Even Bucharest has been prettying itself up for the deluge of
international artists.
	   The Romanian Athenaeum, built in 1880 and featured in Olivia
Manning's Balkan trilogy and other books about Romania's glittering
period between the world wars, was battered by bullets during the
anti-communist revolt in 1989.
	   Now, after several years of costly restoration, its dome once
again gleams and its yellow sandstone facade stands in resplendent
harmony opposite Romania's former royal palace on a central
Bucharest square.
	   ``We had to re-offer this house to music because when hearing
music, we are closer to God,'' Culture Minister Ion Caramitru said.
	   Romanians are very proud of their cultural personalities,
including Romanian-born absurdist playwright Eugene Ionesco,
sculptor Constantin Brancusi, pianist Dinu Lipatti and the new
star, soprano Angela Gheorghiu.
	   Since February, when the tickets went on sale, Romanians have
almost exhausted the season-tickets which go for 900,000 lei (dlrs
100) or just short of the average monthly salary. A single ticket
costs from 40 to 90,000 lei (dlrs 4.4 to 10)
	   Enescu's opera Oedipe will open the festival. Romanian-born
American conductor Lawrence Foster will conduct France's national
orchestra.
	   Oedipe will be performed by the American bass-baritone Monte
Pederson and American soprano Karan Armstrong will play Iocasta.
	   George Enescu, also known as Georges Enesco, composed Oedipe in
1936. Considered one of the musical geniuses of this century,
Enescu began studying the violin at the age of 4 and entered the
Vienna Conservatory when he was 7.
	   Six years later he entered the Paris Conservatoire where he was
taught by French composers Jules Massenet and Gabriel Faure.
	   He made his debut as a conductor in 1923 in New York and between
1937-1938 he conducted New York Philharmonic Orchestra.
	   Enescu wrote two rhapsodies, a symphonic suite, three symphonies
and other chamber music works, in several musical styles.
	   Foster, who will conduct Paul McCartney's Standing Stone in its
Romanian debut, said in a recent news conference that musicians
will pay tribute ``not only to Enescu, ... but to the spirit of
Enescu.''
	   The first edition of Enescu festival was in 1958 and the
Romanian government decided last year that it would take place
every three years.
	   Among the 12 orchestras, performing at the festival, are the
British Broadcasting Corporation Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra, and Orquestra Simfonica de Barcelona.
	   ``There is a huge effort but each second of work was worth it,''
said Mihai Constantinescu, head of Artexim, the company which
organized the festival.
	   Two days before the festival, some 30 Romanians braved rain and
stood in line for the remaining tickets.
	   Fittingly, for the genteel atmosphere of the festival, there
were no reports of tickets being sold on the black market.

Chinese democracy activist sentenced to prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A court in Shaanxi province has sentenced a
democracy activist who tried to run in a local legislative election
to prison, a human rights group said Saturday.
	   The Hanzhong District Intermediate Court in Shaanxi province, in
northern China, told Zhao Changqing's brother and sister he had
been sentenced, but refused to tell them the length of the
sentence, when it was handed down or the crime for which he was
convicted, New York-based Human Rights in China said.
	   Calls to the court on Saturday went unanswered.
	   Zhao was arrested in March and accused of endangering state
security, a charge often used against dissidents, the rights group
said. He had tried to expose irregularities in a local election and
run for office in 1997, the rights group said.
	   Zhao was a teacher at a factory school. He was a student
participant in the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations and served
half a year in prison after the military crushed them.

With crisis mounting, president and parliament seek compromise

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition saying it has 9 other candidates for
prime minister, edits to conform. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Opposition leaders said Saturday they had as many
as nine alternatives to Boris Yeltsin's choice for prime minister,
including several top Soviet-era bureaucrats.
	   Their remarks kicked off a second weekend of behind-the-scenes
negotiations to end a protracted political and financial crisis
that has begun to spur anxiety among ordinary Russians worried
about further instability.
	   The Communist-dominated parliament unexpectedly postponed
hearings Friday on whether to confirm the president's pick for
prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin. Party leaders agreed to hold
face to face talks with Yeltsin on Monday before a rescheduled
debate on Chernomyrdin later in the day.
	   ``I don't expect anything good from Mr. Yeltsin'' on Monday,
Zyuganov told The Associated Press on Saturday.
	   ``We will state our opinion of the real situation. Because he
rarely meets (with lawmakers) he doesn't know the situation. He is
not governing.''
	   Zyuganov said he and his hard-line allies have nine possible
alternatives to Chernomyrdin, whom they blame for creating Russia's
current predicament during the five years he was prime minister
before being fired in March.
	   ``The Yeltsin-Chernomyrdin couple ... are distrusted by 9 out of
10 people now,'' Zyuganov said. ``By the end of September they will
be distrusted by 98 out of 100 people. They have no assets, no
resources, no brains, no will ... They have nothing.''
	   Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back to head the government on Aug.
23, saying he needed an experienced heavyweight to deal with the
country's mounting problems.
	   He has been locked in a standoff with parliament since, while
the economy deteriorates daily.
	   On Friday, the ruble dropped another 21 percent and sharp price
rises spurred consumer anxiety.
	   ``I started to get worried today for the first time,'' said one
shopper, retired theater director Nina Vasilyeva. ``The idea of
stocking up hadn't even come into my head before. But groceries are
now twice as expensive. I'm buying things I don't need because
everybody's bought the rest.''
	   The official ruble rate fell Friday to 16.99 to the U.S. dollar,
or 5.8 cents, down from 13.46 to the dollar, or 7.4 cents, on
Thursday. The street level was even lower.
	   The leader of the Communist-allied Agrarian Party said the
opposition candidates include Vladimir Gerashchenko, whose favorite
response to economic problems as Central Bank chairman in the
Soviet era was to print more money, and Yuri Maslyukov, former head
of the Soviet state planning agency.
	   Agrarian leader Nikolai Kharitonov said they would also suggest
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov; Yegor Stroyev, speaker of the Federation
Council, the upper house of parliament; and Gennady Kulik, deputy
chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Interfax said the opposition considered proposing Communist
leader Zyuganov as well.
	   ``I decided not to name Zyuganov because this name gives the
president heartburn,'' Kharitonov said.
	   Yeltsin has said he will nominate no one other than
Chernomyrdin.
	   Under the constitution, Yeltsin has three chances to propose a
prime ministerial candidate, either the same person or different
people. If the Duma votes no three times, the president can disband
the legislature and call new elections.
	   Chernomyrdin's position was strengthened Friday when the
Federation Council passed a non-binding motion 91-17 expressing
confidence in him.
	   The vote was only symbolic, but it may increase pressure on the
Duma to find a compromise. The regional governors who make up the
Council have huge power and the vote signaled they would back
Yeltsin in a showdown.
	   Before the upper house vote, Chernomyrdin tried to convince them
that he can cure Russia's economic woes.
	   ``It may be our last chance to build a normal economy in Russia.
Yes, our actions will be unpopular. Everyone will assail us. But
don't tie the government's hands, give us time to step back from
the precipice. That refers to everyone from the president on
down,'' he said.

Court upholds death sentence for most-wanted criminal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The High Court on Saturday upheld the
death sentence against a murderer who took a South African
diplomat's family hostage last year after months on the run as
Taiwan's most-wanted fugitive.
	   Chen Chin-hsin, with no expression on his face, said he deserved
the death penalty and would not appeal when the verdict was read at
the court. The court did not say when Chen would be executed.
	   Chen was sentenced to death by the Panchiao District Court in
January for four killings, three kidnappings and 18 rapes.
	   He was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of a popular
entertainer's teen-age daughter with two other suspects, who were
later killed in shootouts with police.
	   Chen and one of the suspects, Kao Tien-ming, also murdered a
plastic surgeon and two nurses after forcing the doctor at gunpoint
to surgically alter Kao's face.
	   After six months on the run, Chen entered South African military
attache E.G.M. Alexander's home in Novemer and took five family
members hostage. He demanded freedom for his wife, brother-in-law
and two friends, all in custody on charges of aiding him in various
crimes.
	   On Saturday, the High Court reversed the district court's
verdict and sentenced Chang Chih-hui, Chen's brother-in-law, to
life imprisonment for being an accomplice in the teen-age girl's
murder and kidnapping. The district court acquitted Chang because
of the lack of evidence against him.
	   The High Court also increased the sentence for Chang Su-chen,
Chen's wife, from eight months to 15 years in prison for aiding
Chen in the kidnapping.

President ends European trip dogged by Lewinsky matter

	   LIMERICK, Ireland (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton is winding
up a six-day European trip with Irish applause ringing in his ears
but the lengthening shadow of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky
awaiting him back home.
	   Clinton's role in pushing Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland toward a peaceful accommodation has earned him plaudits in
Ireland. He mused Friday in a speech at a Gateway computer facility
in Dublin that he wished he could get other warring groups to take
heed.
	   ``It's a step forward not only for Irish people but for all
people divided everywhere who are seeking new ways to think about
old problems,'' he declared.
	   The president was returning to the theme that peace inspires
economic success in a speech here Saturday. Afterward, he was
getting a chance to relax by playing golf at Ballybunion before
returning to Washington.
	   Three years ago, he missed a golfing opportunity in Ireland to
fly to Bosnia-Herzegovina to welcome U.S. troops taking up
peacekeeping duty in the war-wracked Balkans country.
	   This time, Clinton has a more difficult scenario facing him.
	   One of his closest political friends, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, in
a stern speech on the Senate floor Thursday, called the president's
affair with Ms. Lewinsky immoral and harmful to the nation.
	   Some sort of ``public rebuke'' is called for, Lieberman said,
although he said it would be premature until Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr reports on his assessment of whether Clinton had
committed any impeachable offenses and the White House has a chance
to respond to it.
	   ``I made a bad mistake,'' Clinton said Friday. ``It's
indefensible and I'm sorry about it.''
	   It was the apology critics and even some of his admirers had
been seeking, but Lieberman's speech suggests the president is by
no means out of the woods.
	   Except for a fund-raising trip to Orlando, Florida, on
Wednesday, Clinton will be at the White House in the coming week,
his conduct and contrition a national obsession.
	   Clinton, in an Aug. 17 speech to the nation, said he regretted
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern
less than half his age, and the months that he misled his family
and the American people. Lawmakers of both parties criticized him
for not apologizing directly.
	   One of those critics, Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, the Democratic
Party chairman, said Clinton's most recent, most direct statement
about being sorry is ``helpful.''
	   At a Moscow news conference Wednesday with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, Clinton for the first time said publicly that he had
made a mistake in becoming involved with Ms. Lewinsky. He also was
more direct than previously in admitting that he had sought
forgiveness.
	   The summit, itself, produced only modest results. Several
agreements were signed, including pledges by the United States and
Russia to eliminate about 50 metric tons of plutonium each and to
coordinate information on missile tests to avert mistaking them for
an attack.
	   Yeltsin's own problems distracted for serious summitry, and so
did his country's faltering economy.
	   Clinton reaffirmed U.S. friendship for Russia, offered some
practical advice, including on income tax collection, and held out
the promise of more U.S. aid if Moscow played by international
economic rules.
	   He implored Yeltsin not to revert ``to the failed policies of
the past,'' in his struggle with the economy. The Russian leader
responded with a pledge of ``no retreat'' from a commitment to
economic reforms and democracy.
	   That said, Yeltsin and his embattled choice for prime minister,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, were left after Clinton's departure with the
same problems that bore down on them before the summit.
	   Also, Clinton was leaving Ireland and going home to confront
problems shaking his own presidency at its foundation.

Former Asia-Pacific leaders propose new regional forum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former Philippine President Fidel
Ramos, former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and former
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosakawa held talks in Manila this
week and proposed a new Asian forum to help the region solve its
problems.
	   A press statement issued Saturday following the meeting by the
three former leaders said they had agreed that ``it is important to
address the need to establish a new regional focal center.''
	   The proposed ``forum organization'' aims to foster interaction
among industrial, political and academic leaders in Asia to tackle
economic, social and human resource development as well as
environment protection.
	   The proposal comes as the region tries to deal with a crushing
financial crisis.
	   The three former leaders said Asia needed a ``responsive
non-government organization of prominent stature'' similar to the
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and the Aspen Institute
in the United States.
	   The organization should be different from the 9-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the 18-nation
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The proposed organization would be an association of ``Asians
and friends of Asia, established for Asia, centered on Asia and
would aim to promote the interests of the region.''
	   The former leaders also said that China, the only Asian nation
with a permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council, would have to
be ``intimately involved'' in the project.
	   They said they will discuss the concept with the Chinese
leadership and the possible basing the forum in China.
	   Ramos, 70, stepped down at the end of his 6-year term on June
30. He is widely credited for turning the Philippine economy around
after years of stagnation.
	   Ramos said last week he would visit eight countries between this
month and December to meet top officials and businessmen to help
Estrada win foreign investments.
	   His trip will take him to the United States, Japan, Singapore,
Hungary, Spain, Australia, Finland and the United Arab Emirates.

Bucharest to host glittering festival of music and song
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Who says that Bucharest, in its heyday
the Paris of eastern Europe, has forgotten that life is a
celebration of music and song? Not Yehudi Menuhin, for sure.
	   And not Spanish mezzo-soprano Tereza Berganza, U.S. soprano
Barbara Hendricks or Israeli violinist Shlomo Mintz. All three will
perform at the two-week George Ensecu Festival which opens Sunday.
	   ``The great treasures and traditions of Eastern European music
are superbly represented by the Enescu Festival,'' Menuhin said in
a statement, shortly before the festival opened.
	   Menuhin, an American-born violinist, comes to the festival, his
third time in Romania, as its director. He studied the violin with
Enescu and said the Romanian composer deeply influenced his
artistic development.
	   ``How delighted that most modest of men, my great teacher, would
have been to learn that there is a wonderful festival dedicated to
him,'' Menuhin raved.
	   In a sign of their commitment to international culture,
Romania's cash-strapped government and national radio and
television spent lei 34 billion (almost dlrs 4 million) to host the
hundreds of soloists, choir singers and musicians.
	   Since February, when the tickets went on sale, Romanians have
almost exhausted the season-tickets which go for 900,000 lei (dlrs
100) or just short of the average monthly salary. A single ticket
costs from 40 to 90,000 lei (dlrs 4.40 to 10), and have almost sold
out.
	   Enscu's opera Oedipe will open the festival. Romanian-born
American conductor Lawrence Foster will conduct France's national
orchestra.
	   Oedipe will be performed by the American bass-baritone Monte
Pederson and American soprano Karan Armstrong will play Iocasta.
	   Enescu, also known as Georges Enesco, composed Oedipe in 1936.
Considered one of the musical geniuses of this century, Enescu
began studying the violin at the age of 4 and entered the Vienna
Conservatory when he was 7.
	   Enescu wrote two rhapsodies, a symphonic suite, three symphonies
and other chamber music works, in several musical styles.
	   Foster, who will conduct Paul McCartney's Standing Stone in its
Romanian debut, said in a recent news conference that musicians
will pay tribute ``not only to Enescu, ... but to the spirit of
Enescu.''
	   The first edition of Enescu festival was in 1958 and the
Romanian government decided last year that it would take place
every three years.
	   Among the 12 orchestras, performing at the festival, are the
British Broadcasting Corporation Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra, and Orquestra Simfonica de Barcelona.
	   ``There is a huge effort but each second of work was worth it,''
said Mihai Constantinescu, head of Artexim, the company which
organized the festival.

Clinton assures nation, 'the pillars of our prosperity stand

solid' &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: For release at 1406 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMERICK, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton assured the
American people Saturday that despite a sagging stock market ``the
pillars of our prosperity stand solid.''
	   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said he had asked Janet
Yellen, chairwoman of his Council of Economic Advisers, for a
report and what he heard back ``should be reassuring to America's
families.''
	   ``The bottom line is that for all the quicksilver volatility in
the world's financial markets, the American economy is on the right
track,'' Clinton said.
	   The Asian financial crisis has dampened U.S. farm and other
exports and caused losses for some American financial institutions,
the president acknowledged. But he said that inflation and
unemployment still were at their lowest levels and consumer
confidence near the highest level in 30 years. He also noted that
an historic boom in business investment continues and American jobs
are still being created, 365,000 last month alone.
	   Perhaps most important, Clinton said, standards of living
continue to rise, with wages growing at twice the rate of
inflation, the strongest growth in real wages in two decades.
	   Despite Clinton's optimism, many financial experts fear the
Asian crisis that has spread to other countries, including Russia,
could result in a global recession that would drag down the
American economy, which depends in part on selling to customers
overseas.
	   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Friday that U.S.
central bankers are growing more concerned about the global
financial crisis' impact on the U.S. economy.
	   ``It is just not credible that the United States can remain an
oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing
greatly increased stress,'' Greenspan said in a speech at the
University of California, Berkeley.
	   Greenspan's comments came after financial markets closed in New
York. Capping a wild week on Wall Street, the Dow Jones closed down
42 points, at 7640.25, leaving it down a total of 411 points for
the week.
	   Clinton, whose high job-approval ratings are closely tied to the
so-far stellar economy, according to polls, said he was confident
the United States can ride out the financial storm.
	   ``Markets rise and fall,'' the president concluded. ``But our
economy is the strongest it's been in a generation, and the
fundamentals are sound.''
	   On his policies, Clinton said he would insist that every penny
of any budget surplus be set aside until the Social Security system
is secure and that he would resist any tax cut or new spending plan
that squandered the surplus.

Tseng takes two-stroke lead in Fujisankei Ladies Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAWAGUCHIKO, Japan (AP) _ Taiwan's Tseng Hsiu-feng shot a
1-under-par 70 Saturday and surged ahead for a two-stroke lead
going into the final round of the 60 million yen (dlrs 448,000)
Fujisankei Ladies Classic.
	   Tseng, seeking her first victory of the season, overcame tough
pin-placements and sank four birdies against three bogeys en route
to a 4-under 138 total. She started the round one shot off the
pace.
	   The 30-year-old Tseng has won three tournaments in six years on
the Japan LPGA Tour. She last triumphed in the Gunze Cup World
ladies in May 1997.
	   Overnight leader Chieko Nishida, in contention for her first win
in four years and sixth overall, shot a 73 for 140.
	   South Korean Shin Sora carded a 72 and was alone in third place
at 141.
	   Kyoko Ono, winner of the New Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ladies two
weeks ago, shot the day's best round of 69 and shared shared fourth
at 142 with four others.

European Union analyzes Russian economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) - The European Union says there is little
point in throwing money into the bottomless pit of the Russian
economic crisis, but foreign ministers meeting here Saturday and
Sunday will press Moscow to move ahead quickly with political
reforms.
	   Comfortable in the fact that Russia represents only 4 percent of
the 15-nation EU's overall trade, the Europeans can afford to
cautious in their approach to the crisis in Moscow. In the EU view,
there is no point in doling out great amounts of financial aid
before resolving the political problems.
	   ``If such a potentially rich country runs into such financial
and economic disarray then there is something political that is
fundamentally wrong,'' EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans Van den
Broek said Thursday.
	   ``Anything we would discuss on giving assistance to Russia
cannot yield any results unless the political problems are
addressed.''
	   President Boris Yeltsin is in a desperate struggle with the
Russian Parliament over his nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin as
prime minister, a job from which he was sacked just last spring.
Chernomyrdin has promised to impose an ``economic dictatorship'' to
draw the economy out of crisis.
	   But, as the ruble continues to sink and the economy totters, the
Parliament is resisting Yeltsin.
	   ``This is something the international community cannot solve for
Russia,'' Van den Broek said.
	   The EU has pledged its strong political support for Yeltsin, but
for the moment there doesn't seem to be much it can do. The
ministers will issue a statement voicing their concerns, but are
not expected to take any action.
	   EU governments have granted dlrs 1.6 billion in development aid
programs to Russia since 1991. The European Commission suggests
these be ``retargeted'' to focus on areas crucial to reform of the
economy such as know-how in restructuring companies and developing
sound banking laws.
	   The other major topic before the foreign ministers in their
two-day session is Kosovo, the southern Yugoslav province
struggling for independence.
	   Under pressure from the Americans and Europeans, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova have agreed in principle to a formula granting self-rule to
the majority Albanian province.
	   The agreement would be reviewed in three to five years. Although
the arrangement falls short of Albanian demands for independence,
Rugova has promised to try to convince KLA hardliners to accept it.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, chairman of the EU
meeting, said this week, ``For the first time there is a glimmer of
hope'' in Kosovo.
	   ``Our discussions in Salzburg will focus on an approach for the
next months, including the role of the U.N. Security Council,''
Schuessel said in a letter to fellow foreign ministers.
	   ``Swift and efficient action is required if a humanitarian
catastrophe is to be avoided during the winter.''

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Investigators in the Aug. 7
bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania said Saturday they had
made ``great strides,'' having already determined what the bomb was
made of and who carried it to the embassy.
	   Police were also holding two suspects and three informants in
custody, Tanzanian director of criminal investigation Rajabi Adadi
said.
	   Kenneth Piernick, head of FBI investigators in Tanzania, said
the investigation had made ``great strides.''
	   ``Investigators have made extraordinary discoveries,'' Piernick
added. ``They are now well aware of the composition of the bomb and
are also well aware how the device was delivered and who delivered
it.''
	   He refused to elaborate.
	   Adadi said one of the suspects arrested is Tanzanian and the
other a foreigner. He would not identify the foreigner or his
nationality, but did not deny media reports that the suspect was
Sudanese.
	   Twin bombings at U.S. Embassies in Tanzania and the Kenyan
capital Nairobi on Aug. 7 killed 257 people, 11 of them in
Tanzania. More than 5,400 people were injured in Kenya and more
than 70 in the Tanzanian commercial capital Dar es Salaam.
	   ``Police have some leads regarding the event,'' Adadi said,
speaking in Swahili. ``They know who took the device to the
embassay, and they also know some of the people responsible for the
event and others whose roles have not yet been proven.''
	   He said the three informants had all participated in the
preparations for the bombing, mostly unwittingly, and were now
cooperating with the investigation.
	   Media reports in Tanzania have said the ingredients for the
bombs had orignated in the Middle East, and were transferred by sea
via the Comoros Islands to Tanzania. Similar reports in Nairobi
said components were also transported from Tanzania to Nairobi by
road.
	   On Wednesday, police in the island archipelago off the Tanzanian
coast raided two homes and searched for a suspect in the bombings
identified as Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul, a Comorian Muslim who had
lived with his wife in Sudan until shortly after the embassy
bombings.
	   U.S. cruise missiles on Aug. 20 struck at targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan that Washington linked to the bombings. The missiles
destroyed a pharmaceutical factory on the outskirts of Khartoum
that Washington said stocked bomb-making materials, an allegation
Khartoum has denied.
	   The missiles also targeted Afghan-based camps of Islamic
militants supporting fugitive Osama bin Laden, who investigators
believe was behind the bombings
	   Two key suspects in the Kenya bombing, who have been linked to
bin Laden, have been handed over to the United States for trial in
the murders of 10 Americans at the Nairobi embassy.

35 feared dead as boat capsizes in eastern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ As many as 35 people were feared dead in
India's eastern Assam state when an overcrowded boat carrying more
than 50 passengers capsized in a river swollen by torrential
monsoon rains, officials said Saturday.
	   Eighteen people managed to swim to the shore of the Lohit River
safely but an estimated 34 people were still missing Saturday, said
Zoiinath Sharma, revenue minister in Assam.
	   Rescue efforts by the Indian military and local villagers were
hampered because of rain and the lack of motorized boats to search
for survivors. Only one body was recovered from the river,
officials said.
	   Three days of incessant rain in Assam's hilly region has caused
water to rush down the slopes, inundating parts of the low-lying
plains. This is the second wave of floods this season, Sharma said.
In first wave in July, 50 people died in the floods and landslides.
	   In Assam's neighboring Arunachal Pradesh state, a huge cliff
fell into a tributary of the Lohit, creating an artificial dam
upstream. Officials are afraid if the artificial barrier is
breached it could cause more floods in Assam.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Islanders voted their choice Saturday _
re-elect a Labor government shy about pushing too fast for European
Union membership or return to the Nationalists, staunch advocates
of a future anchored more solidly to Europe.
	   Polls opened in early morning on a hazy, warm day amid
expectations for high turnout among the 278,000 eligible voters.
Maltese are traditionally very passionate over their politics, and
turnout was expected to be along the lines of the 96 percent figure
of 1996.
	   Polls were scheduled to close at 10 p.m. (2000 gmt). Complete
official results were likely to be announced on Monday, but enough
vote-counting was expected to be done by Sunday evening to know the
victor.
	   Only two years after the last election for parliament, Prime
Minister Alfred Sant was hoping for a new mandate, while veteran
Nationalist leader Eddie Fenech Adami was banking on his assertion
that Maltese are ready to unblock Malta's bid to join the EU club.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. official Saturday
described the human rights situation in Kosovo as ``horrendous''
and warned that combatants could face war crimes charges as a
result of the six-month conflict.
	   Another American official, Hugh Q. Parmer of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, said thousands of Kosovo refugees are in
such desperate condition that they cannot wait for politicians and
diplomats to negotiate peace. He pledged dlrs 23 million in U.S.
emergency food aid.
	   John Stattuck, the State Department's top human rights official,
was meeting Saturday with Albanian and Serbian officials to review
the situation in Kosovo, where Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence from Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   ``We continue to gather information about the human rights
situation which is quite horrendous,'' Shattuck told reporters. He
noted that the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands,
has jurisdiction over Kosovo.
	   The tribunal was founded to prosecute cases from wars in two
former Yugoslav republics _ Bosnia and Croatia. But its mandate
covers all parts of the former Yugoslavia, which now consists only
of Serbia and Montenegro.
	   ``Any cases related to violation of international humanitarian
law should be fully investigated and fully prosecuted,'' Shattuck
said. ``Certainly there is a great deal of information about human
rights abuse.''
	   An estimated 230,000 people have fled their homes in Kosovo
since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 on the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   After touring Kosovo, Parmer said Friday that the next five
weeks will be critical in determining how many of the estimated
50,000 worst-affected refugees die.
	   ``This is not the beginning and it is certainly not the end,''
Parmer said in announcing the additional U.S. assistance in the
Yugoslav capital Belgrade. ``USAID will continue to stand by those
suffering in the conflict.''
	   European Union members are also reportedly trying to put
together a relief plan for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia. The crisis is expected to figure
prominently this weekend during a meeting of EU foreign ministers
in the Austrian city of Salzburg.
	   Parmer said the damage and destruction after months of fighting
had reached devastating proportions. He warned that the world must
respond with more aid before the advent of winter.
	   ``We cannot wait for the diplomats and politicians to finish,''
Parmer said. ``We have a responsibility to produce on the ground so
that women, children and elderly do not die of starvation.''
	   Under pressure from America and Europe, both Milosevic and
moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have agreed in
principle to a formula granting self-rule to the province.
	   The agreement would be reviewed in three to five years. Although
the arrangement falls short of Albanian demands for independence,
Rugova has promised to try to convince KLA hard-liners to accept
it.
	   But Western diplomats say the deal could take months to finalize
even with goodwill on both sides. In the meantime, the advent of
winter threatens a humanitarian disaster.
	   Despite diplomatic efforts, fighting is continuing southwest of
Pristina, Kosovo's capital. Albanian sources accuse Serb police of
burning homes and driving more refugees into the fields and
forests.
	   On Friday, two top Russian foreign ministry officials met with
Milosevic. Milosevic's office said afterward that the two
reaffirmed Russia's interest in a peaceful solution.

Report: Libya pulls diplomats after police raid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Libya has recalled some of its diplomatic
staff from Uganda following a police raid on a Libyan charity
suspected of having links to Ugandan rebels, a newspaper report
said Saturday.
	   The independent daily The Monitor reported that security forces
raided the offices of the Libyan-funded World Islamic Call Society
on the outskirts of Kampala on Wendesday.
	   The raid followed the recent arrest of several WICS staff
members on suspicion of involvement with Ugandan rebels operating
in the country's west, the newspaper said.
	   The report said the Islamic charity was linked to rebels of the
Allied Democratic Forces fighting government troops in western
Uganda. The government has said the ADF is dominated by Islamic
fundamentalist youths and funded by Sudan.
	   No comment was available Saturday from police or government
offices.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Some hugged one another, others
stood alone. One woman plucked wildflowers near the base of the
lighthouse, then crouched and stared out to sea.
	   More than 300 relatives of Swissair Flight 111 victims, their
privacy protected by police and military escorts, are mourning
together and visiting Peggy's Cove _ the coastal town closest to
where their loved ones died in the crash Wednesday that killed 229
people.
	   Despite intensive efforts, including deployment of a submarine
equipped with sonar, searchers have been unable to locate the
plane's flight-data and voice recorders, which could shed light on
the cause of the crash.
	   Philippe Bruggisser, chief of Swissair's parent SAirGroup, said
in Zurich, Switzerland, Saturday morning that Canadian authorities
resumed their search for the black boxes with ships and divers.
	   Canadian authorities said they will release the conversation
between pilots and the ground station later Saturday, he said.
	   Most of the victims' bodies have not been recovered yet, and
most of the human remains retrieved so far are fragments, slowing
the identification process.
	   On Friday, about a dozen relatives who arrived on a series of
flights from New York and Geneva made the trip to the fishing
village near Halifax that has become the base for searchers.
	   Peter Gerety _ who traveled from Connecticut to be near the site
where his brother, U.N. worker Pierce Gerety, was killed _ carried
two rocks off the beach.
	   ``I just felt like having a memento. It was such a beautiful
place, and that's the irony of it.''
	   Swissair chief executive Jeff Katz said a private,
non-denominational memorial service would be held Saturday for the
victims. The time of the service was not provided to the media.
	   The plane, en route from New York to Geneva, disappeared from
radar screens 16 minutes after its pilots reported smoke in the
cockpit.
	   Air traffic controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, advised the
pilots to make an emergency landing in Halifax, but the MD-11
wide-body jet never made it, crashing into the ocean 30 miles (50
kilometers) to the south.
	   At a press conference Friday, the chief investigator defended
the actions of the cockpit crew, saying their last conversation
with controllers was conducted in a professional manner.
	   Vic Gerden of Canada's Transportation Safety Board refused to
speculate on what happened in the jet's final moments.
	   ``I don't deal in maybes, could haves and would haves,'' he
said. ``The crew indicated there was smoke in the cockpit. We don't
have further indication of specific problems.''
	   Gerden said the plane descended rapidly while trying to reach
Halifax and made a couple of sharp turns over the coast while
dumping fuel.
	   Katz told a news conference the three-engine jetliner was well
maintained, saying it ``had a clean bill of health.''
	   He said Swissair had complied with all directives from U.S.
aviation officials advising of wiring problems in MD-11 jets. Two
such advisories in 1996 and 1997 warned of potentially hazardous
wiring in the cockpit and in a rear consol for flight attendants.
	   Authorities say the wreckage is so fragmented that it may be
difficult to reconstruct the plane, as would normally be done in
the investigation.
	   The hunt has turned up no piece of wreckage bigger than a
kitchen tabletop, though 100 pieces of luggage were recovered
Friday.
	   Authorities were mapping the ocean floor in preparation for
sending down a small, remote-controlled submersible to investigate
the sea bed.
	   Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, Dr. John Butt, said X-rays
and dental charts would be needed to identify the victims. He said
relatives would not be pressured to come to a makeshift morgue at
an air base to assist with the identifications.
	   The family members who made the trip to Peggy's Cove on Friday
got an escort from soldiers as they got out of their vehicles. The
throng of reporters at the site was kept at a distance.
	   Valerie Warren was among the volunteer bus drivers who picked up
mourners at the Halifax airport.
	   ``It was a very quiet ride in,'' she said. ``A baby crying was
the only noise I heard.''
	   Many relatives chose not to accept Swissair's offer to bring
them to the crash scene, including former boxing champion Jake
LaMotta, whose son Joe was on the doomed airplane.
	   ``Why bring on the extra grief?'' said LaMotta, 76, who lost his
only other son, Jake Jr., in February. ``I'm pretty on in years. I
don't want to face it 'til I have to. ... It's just too much for me
now.''
	   One of the crash victims was Saudi Prince Bandar bin Saud bin
Saad bin Abdul-Rahman Al Saud, 45, a businessman who had lived in
the United States for eight years. He was on his way to visit his
sick father in Geneva. Although a member of the royal family, he
was not from the ruling branch.
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it would help arrange
press briefings by relatives willing to make statements, but warned
journalists not to intrude on those who wished to be left alone.
	   Staff Sgt. Keith McGuire also said police were becoming
exasperated with members of the public, both on shore and in boats,
venturing into the search area to look for debris. He said the
intruders face arrest and seizure of their boats.

Tanzania. More than 5,400 people were injured in Kenya and more
than 70 in the Tanzanian commercial capital Dar es Salaam.
	   ``Police have some leads regarding the event,'' Adadi said,
speaking in Swahili. ``They know who took the device to the
embassy, and they also know some of the people responsible for the
event and others whose roles have not yet been proven.''
	   He said the three informants had all participated in the
preparations for the bombing, mostly unwittingly, and were now
cooperating with the investigation.
	   Media reports in Tanzania have said the ingredients for the
bombs had originated in the Middle East, and were transferred by
sea via the Comoros Islands to Tanzania. Similar reports in Nairobi
said components were also transported from Tanzania to Nairobi by
road.
	   On Wednesday, police in the island archipelago off the Tanzanian
coast raided two homes and searched for a suspect in the bombings
identified as Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul, a Comorian Muslim who had
lived with his wife in Sudan until shortly after the embassy
bombings.
	   U.S. cruise missiles on Aug. 20 struck at targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan that Washington linked to the bombings. The missiles
destroyed a pharmaceutical factory on the outskirts of Khartoum
that Washington said stocked bomb-making materials, an allegation
Khartoum has denied.
	   The missiles also targeted Afghan-based camps of Islamic
militants supporting fugitive Osama bin Laden, who investigators
believe was behind the bombings
	   Two key suspects in the Kenya bombing, who have been linked to
bin Laden, have been handed over to the United States for trial in
the murders of 10 Americans at the Nairobi embassy.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Investigators in the Aug. 7
bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania said Saturday they had
made ``extraordinary discoveries,'' having determined what the bomb
was made of and who carried it to the embassy.
	   Police were also holding two suspects and three informants in
custody, Tanzanian director of criminal investigation Rajabi Adadi
said.
	   ``Investigators have made extraordinary discoveries,'' said
Kenneth Piernick, head of FBI investigators in Tanzania. ``They are
now well aware of the composition of the bomb and are also well
aware how the device was delivered and who delivered it.''
	   He refused to elaborate.
	   Adadi said one of the suspects arrested is Tanzanian and the
other is a foreigner. He would not identify the foreigner or his
nationality, but did not deny media reports that the suspect was
Sudanese.

Explosion in Dagestan kills 13 people, injures 80

	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ A car bomb probably caused the
explosion that killed at least 13 people, including two children,
and gouged a five-meter (15-foot) crater in a street in the capital
of a restive southern Russian region, officials said Saturday.
	   At least 80 people were injured in the Friday night explosion
and more than half remained in hospitals, according to the press
office of the regional administration of Dagestan.
	   The casualty toll was expected to rise, as NTV television said
100 people were trapped in the rubble.
	   The Emergency Situations Ministry initially said the explosion
was caused by an artillery shell fired from an eastern suburb of
the Dagestan capital of Makhachkala.
	   But the local administration said Saturday that shards of glass
and metal fragments found in the bodies suggested a car bomb.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, which the
Dagestani government called ``a monstrous act of terrorism,''
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Dagestan has been wracked by violence and kidnappings in recent
months as various religious and ethnic groups battle for power. It
has also been hit by spillover violence from breakaway Chechnya, on
its western border. A car bomb recently killed Dagestan's top
Islamic leader.
	   Friday's explosion occurred outside the local television center
on the street where Dagestan's prime minister, Khizri Shikhsaidov,
and Makhachkala Mayor Said Amirov live. Neither was hurt.
	   Shikhsaidov's motorcade had passed by the site only minutes
before the explosion, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, quoting
Dagestan's Interior Ministry.
	   Local TV commentator Angela Mamadibirova said the attack was
believed to be an attempt on Amirov's life. She said he has
survived 10 assassination attempts this year.
	   Later, television reporters speculated that the explosion had
been intended to destroy the television center. The TV building was
badly damaged, and 40 percent of its equipment destroyed, the
television report said.
	   A building housing an agricultural institute and 10 buildings
nearby were also damaged, the Interfax news agency said. Many
students living in a dormitory at the institute were injured by
glass shards, local television said.
	   Fifteen homes where 142 people lived were destroyed, reduced to
a pile of bricks, wood and twisted metal pipes. Fires caused by
broken gas pipes broke out in several houses.
	   The explosion left a crater 5 meters (16-1/2 feet) wide and 3
meters (nearly 10 feet) deep.
	   Rescuers with sniffer dogs, including airborne troops and
specially trained Emergency Situations Ministry workers flown in
from Moscow, searched for more victims on Saturday. Heavy rain
hampered their efforts.
	   The regional government declared Saturday and Sunday to be days
of mourning.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. official Saturday
described the human rights situation in Kosovo as ``horrendous''
and warned that combatants could face war crimes charges as a
result of the six-month conflict.
	   Another American official, Hugh Q. Parmer of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, said thousands of Kosovo refugees are in
such desperate condition that they cannot wait for politicians and
diplomats to negotiate peace. He pledged dlrs 23 million in U.S.
emergency food aid.
	   John Shattuck, the State Department's top human rights official,
was meeting Saturday with Albanian and Serbian officials to review
the situation in Kosovo, where Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence from Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.

Police investigate new reports against deposed deputy PM
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from foreign minister saying Anwar
should stop politicizing sacking, more from Anwar
 &UR; AP Photos available
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's police chief said
Saturday ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim tried to
interfere with a criminal investigation against him.
	   Inspector-General of Police Rahim Noor told a news conference
that police were investigating four new police reports accusing
Anwar of tampering with evidence and intimidating witnesses.
	   Since Anwar was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on Wednesday, he has been dogged by allegations of sexual
misconduct and leaking state secrets.
	   Most of these accusations have been published in a book entitled
``50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Be PM,'' which the police have been
scrutinizing for months. The four reports announced by Rahim on
Saturday brings to eight the number of police reports filed against
Anwar.
	   ``We have strong evidence that Anwar resorted to persistent and
consistent measures to thwart police investigations, manipulating
them for his own benefit,'' Rahim said. ``If necessary, we'll
expose all this in court.''
	   He added that he hoped to conclude the investigations ``as soon
as possible'' so they could decide whether Anwar should be arrested
and charged.
	   Rahim stressed that the ongoing police investigations weren't
politically motivated or part of a conspiracy to depose Anwar, as
the ousted minister has claimed.
	   ``We're investing the case under the jurisdiction of law.
Anything else wouldn't be professional,'' said Rahim.
	   Anwar shrugged off the new allegations.
	   ``I wouldn't be surprised if they added 20 more,'' he told
reporters at his residence, where he has been holed up since his
ouster Wednesday.
	   Anwar claimed Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad delivered an
ultimatum: Resign or be sacked and face criminal charges.
	   ``If this is not a political conspiracy, then I don't know what
is,'' he said.
	   Earlier Saturday, Anwar warmly welcomed Lim Kit Siang, the
opposition leader of Parliament and his one-time chief antagonist,
into his home.
	   Lim later emerged from a closed-door meeting and called for an
emergency Parliament session to be convened to discuss Anwar's
plight. However, he denied that Anwar was planning to align himself
with Malaysia's opposition forces.
	   Lim's son, Lim Guan Eng, recently began serving an 18-month
prison term for having questioned the country's judicial system in
a pamphlet.
	   Human rights activists fear the beginning of a political
crackdown against the opposition as Malaysia struggles with the
worst economic crisis in 13 years.
	   Anwar on Friday said that if he were arrested, ``hundreds more
will follow me.''
	   Anwar was unceremoniously dumped as deputy prime minister and
finance minister after months of political differences with his
boss, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   He was then expelled as vice president of the ruling United
Malays National Organization, after UMNO Supreme Council members
feared that police investigations against Anwar could smear their
party's reputation.
	   Anwar for years was seen as Mahathir's heir to the prime
minister's post. Many believed he would be given the nod from his
one-time mentor during next year's UMNO elections.
	   Now the conservative Muslim who once spearheaded a drive for
stronger Islamic influence over the secular government of this
Southeast Asian nation, stands accused of sexual misconduct and
treason.
	   Mahathir loyalist and foreign minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said Saturday that Anwar shouldn't politicize his sacking and stir
up public sympathy from the streets.
	   ``His action is irresponsible,'' Abdullah said. ``He fully knows
that we are facing economic problems and this is the time that we
need political stability.''
	   Abdullah, who's among the front-runners for the vacant deputy
prime minister position, told Anwar to seek justice in the courts
if he felt he'd been victimized.
	   ``He has brought upon himself all these troubles,'' Abdullah
said.

With crisis mounting, president and parliament seek compromise

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Opposition leaders said Saturday they had as many
as nine alternatives to Boris Yeltsin's choice for prime minister,
including several top Soviet-era bureaucrats.
	   Their remarks kicked off a second weekend of behind-the-scenes
negotiations to end a protracted political and financial crisis
that has begun to spur anxiety among ordinary Russians worried
about further instability.
	   The Communist-dominated parliament unexpectedly postponed
hearings Friday on whether to confirm the president's pick for
prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   Party leaders agreed to hold face-to-face talks with Yeltsin on
Monday before a rescheduled debate on Chernomyrdin later in the
day. Yeltsin was spending the weekend at his country residence, his
press service said.
	   ``I don't expect anything good from Mr. Yeltsin'' on Monday,
Zyuganov told The Associated Press on Saturday.
	   ``We will state our opinion of the real situation. Because he
rarely meets (with lawmakers) he doesn't know the situation. He is
not governing,'' Zyuganov added.
	   Zyuganov said he and his hard-line allies have nine possible
alternatives to Chernomyrdin, whom they blame for creating Russia's
current predicament during the five years he was prime minister
before being fired in March.
	   ``The Yeltsin-Chernomyrdin couple ... are distrusted by 9 out of
10 people now,'' Zyuganov said. ``By the end of September they will
be distrusted by 98 out of 100 people. They have no assets, no
resources, no brains, no will ... They have nothing.''
	   Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back to head the government on Aug.
23, saying he needed an experienced heavyweight to deal with the
country's mounting problems.
	   He has been locked in a standoff with parliament since, while
the economy deteriorates daily.
	   On Friday, the ruble dropped another 21 percent and sharp price
rises spurred consumer anxiety.
	   ``I started to get worried today for the first time,'' said one
shopper, retired theater director Nina Vasilyeva. ``The idea of
stocking up hadn't even come into my head before. But groceries are
now twice as expensive. I'm buying things I don't need because
everybody's bought the rest.''
	   The official ruble rate fell Friday to 16.99 to the U.S. dollar,
or 5.8 cents, down from 13.46 to the dollar, or 7.4 cents, on
Thursday. The street level was even lower.
	   The leader of the Communist-allied Agrarian Party said the
opposition candidates include Vladimir Gerashchenko, whose favorite
response to economic problems as Central Bank chairman in the
Soviet era was to print more money, and Yuri Maslyukov, former head
of the Soviet state planning agency.
	   Agrarian leader Nikolai Kharitonov said they would also suggest
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov; Yegor Stroyev, speaker of the Federation
Council, the upper house of parliament; and Gennady Kulik, deputy
chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Interfax said the opposition considered proposing Communist
leader Zyuganov as well.
	   ``I decided not to name Zyuganov because this name gives the
president heartburn,'' Kharitonov said.
	   Yeltsin has said he will nominate no one other than
Chernomyrdin.
	   Under the constitution, Yeltsin has three chances to propose a
prime ministerial candidate, either the same person or different
people. If the Duma votes no three times, the president can disband
the legislature and call new elections.
	   Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky predicted Saturday that
Chernomyrdin would be confirmed if Monday's vote is a secret one,
rather than an open vote where every lawmaker's position can be
seen. The Communists have called for an open vote, apparently
hoping to keep their members from secretly supporting Chernomyrdin
to avoid early elections that they could lose.
	   Chernomyrdin's position was strengthened Friday when the
Federation Council passed a non-binding motion 91-17 expressing
confidence in him.
	   The vote was only symbolic, but it may increase pressure on the
Duma to find a compromise. The regional governors who make up the
Council have huge power and the vote signaled they would back
Yeltsin in a showdown.
	   ``Viktor Chernomyrdin, if approved for the premiership, will be
able to take real steps for taking the country out of the crisis in
a short time,'' said Alexander Lebed, the former national security
adviser recently elected governor of the huge Krasnoyarsk region of
Siberia.

Polish slave laborers who worked in Austria may receive
</HEADLINE>
compensation

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Poles who worked as slave laborers for
the Nazis in Austria during World War II will be able to claim
pension benefits under an Austrian-Polish accord to be signed next
week, it was announced Friday.
	   Social Minister Leonore Hostasch told Austrian television that
the Social Insurance Agreement between the two countries will ``in
effect benefit this disadvantaged group.''
	   The accord is expected to be signed next week when Austrian
President Thomas Klestil visits Warsaw.
	   Under the agreement, she said Polish slave laborers or their
heirs will be able to claim benefits for the time they worked in
Austria if they were registered here.
	   Austrian television estimated that 130,000 Polish civilians and
28,000 prisoners of war were transported to Austria as slave
laborers during the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Libya has recalled some of its diplomatic
staff from Uganda following a police raid on a Libyan charity
suspected of having links to Ugandan rebels, a newspaper report
said Saturday.
	   The independent daily The Monitor reported that security forces
raided the offices of the Libyan-funded World Islamic Call Society
on the outskirts of Kampala on Wendesday.
	   The raid followed the recent arrest of several WICS staff
members on suspicion of involvement with Ugandan rebels operating
in the country's west, the newspaper said.
	   The report said the Islamic charity was linked to rebels of the
Allied Democratic Forces fighting government troops in western
Uganda. The government has said the ADF is dominated by Islamic
fundamentalist youths and funded by Sudan.
	   No comment was available Saturday from police or government
offices.

Report: Athletes warned not to walk around in the nude.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian officials at the
Commonwealth Games village have received complaints that some
athletes have been seen walking around in the nude, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   ``We have received complaints about some athletes being seen
naked in the corridors of their apartment blocks at the Games
Village,'' an official of Sukom Ninety Eight Berhad, the Games'
organizers, told the Malay Mail.
	   The official has reportedly told various teams to make sure
their athletes respect the local culture and values.
	   ``We can't allow such indecency. It may be fine in the Western
world but others are more sensitive and are not amused,'' he was
quoted as saying.
	   The Games Village outside of Kuala Lumpur, currently houses
about 5,000 athletes from 70 British Commonwealth countries. There
are six days to go before the Games begin.

Suharto's children won't flee the country, half-brother says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former President Suharto's children
won't flee the country to avoid being investigated for fraud, says
Probosutedjo, the ex-leader's half-brother.
	   Probosutedjo was quoted Saturday by the daily Media Indonesia as
saying that business competitors were trying to hide their own
crimes by blaming the Suharto children.
	   Indonesian police plan to interrogate Bambang Trihatmodjo,
Suharto's second son and head of one of the country's
conglomerates, on charges of misappropriating funds at the troubled
Andromeda bank, which he partly owns.
	   Andromeda is one of 14 insolvent banks liquidated in April, when
Suharto was still in power.
	   Probosutedjo said the police warrant was inconsistent with
government policy, because the chief of the armed forces, Gen.
Wiranto, has guaranteed security for the ex-president and his
family.
	   Suharto resigned in May amid widespread student-led protests
against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   He was allegedly showering his family and friends with
privileges that allowed them to become rich and influential. He has
three sons and three daughters.
	   Suharto's own enterprises are being investigated, and the
government recently disclosed that there were indications that
charities set up and controlled by Suharto have misused their
funds.
	   Critics have alleged that funds from the charities were funneled
into companies owned by his family.
	   Indonesia new President B.J. Habibie, is a longtime friend of
Suharto, but is under pressure to wipe out corruption and nepotism
that flourished under his predecessor's reign.

Thai military dismisses army captain accused of murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai army captain accused of killing
an academic working for Thailand's top think tank has been
dismissed from the military, a Thai newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Controversy has raged over the case of Capt. Patchara Prompao
since he was arrested last Monday, because it emerged he had been
reinstated into the Thai army after serving a jail term for heroin
trafficking in Australia.
	   Although the murder case is a particular sordid one _ the victim
was beaten for hours before being raped and killed _ most attention
has been on the issue of why Patchara was allowed to stay in the
military.
	   Army officers insisted they were not made aware of any criminal
record when he was admitted to the military after returning from
Australia. But critics note that Patchara was twice dismissed from
the service _ for insubordination and going absent without leave.
	   There are strong suspicions that he may have had a ``protector''
in the top ranks of the military.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai received a report from the military
Friday on the case.
	   Chuan is worried that there may be other criminals who have been
allowed into the armed forces, said Akaphol Sorasuchart, the
government spokesman.
	   Upon his arrest, officials at the National Security Council
released information that Patchara's real name was Manas and he had
served as lieutenant in the Thai navy until he was arrested and
imprisoned in 1993 in Australia for heroin trafficking.
	   After he was released, he changed his name and was admitted into
the Thai army as a captain and assigned to the office of the
supreme command.

European Union analyzes Russian economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes, G-7 meeting, EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) - The European Union says there is little
point in throwing money into the bottomless pit of the Russian
economic crisis, but EU foreign ministers meeting here will press
Moscow to move ahead quickly with political reforms.
	   ``We do not want a return to communism and a command economy in
Russia,'' said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, arriving in
Salzburg for a two-day informal meeting of the EU's 15 foreign
ministers.
	   ``Russia is going through stormy times. We must not turn away
from Russia now that the weather is turning bad,'' he said. But he
added: ``Russia must sail its own course and help itself get out of
its problems.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called a meeting in London
next week of officials from the world's biggest industrial powers,
known as the G-7, a British spokesman in London said Saturday. That
involves the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy
and Japan.
	   Blair decided on the meeting after consulting President Bill
Clinton in Northern Ireland this week, with the main aim of being
ready to respond quickly when the new Russian government is formed,
a spokesman at the prime minister's office said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``The message we are getting across to the Russians, and that we
have agreed among ourselves, is that we are ready to help, but that
all international assistance must be conditional on further
economic reform or it does not make sense,'' the spokesman told the
AP.
	   A German official here said the EU plans to send a delegation to
Moscow next week. The ``troika,'' as the EU calls the envoys, will
represent Britain, Austria and Germany, the past, present and
future presidents of the EU. The German official said the point
will be to show the EU's political support for Moscow.
	   Comfortable in the fact that Russia represents only 4 percent of
the 15-nation EU's overall trade, the Europeans can afford to be
cautious in their approach to the crisis in Moscow. In the EU view,
there is no point in doling out great amounts of financial aid
before resolving the political problems.
	   ``We must be careful not to rush and take action for action for
action's sake, as long as the government situation in Moscow is not
clear,'' Kinkel said.
	   EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans Van den Broek said when
such a potentially rich country runs into such big economic
problems, that means something is wrong politically.
	   ``Russia is a very important partner and we sympathize with
their problem,'' Van den Broek said. ``But in order to help, we
need a strong government there. Our highest priority is to resolve
the political crisis.''
	   President Boris Yeltsin is in a desperate struggle with the
Russian Parliament over his nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin as
prime minister, a job from which he was sacked just last spring.
Chernomyrdin has promised to impose an ``economic dictatorship'' to
draw the economy out of crisis.
	   But, as the ruble continues to sink and the economy totters, the
Parliament is resisting Yeltsin.
	   ``This is something the international community cannot solve for
Russia,'' Van den Broek said.
	   The EU has pledged its strong political support for Yeltsin, but
for the moment there doesn't seem to be much it can do. The
ministers will issue a statement voicing their concerns, but are
not expected to take any action.
	   EU governments have granted dlrs 1.6 billion in development aid
programs to Russia since 1991. The European Commission suggests
these be ``retargeted'' to focus on areas crucial to reform of the
economy such as know-how in restructuring companies and developing
sound banking laws.
	   The other major topic before the foreign ministers in their
two-day session is Kosovo, the southern Yugoslav province
struggling for independence.
	   Under pressure from the Americans and Europeans, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova have agreed in principle to a formula granting self-rule to
the majority Albanian province.
	   The agreement would be reviewed in three to five years. Although
the arrangement falls short of Albanian demands for independence,
Rugova has promised to try to convince KLA hardliners to accept it.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, chairman of the EU
meeting, said this week, ``For the first time there is a glimmer of
hope'' in Kosovo.
	   ``Our discussions in Salzburg will focus on an approach for the
next months, including the role of the U.N. Security Council,''
Schuessel said in a letter to fellow foreign ministers.
	   ``Swift and efficient action is required if a humanitarian
catastrophe is to be avoided during the winter.''

Tributes at Vatican, Calcutta slums mark first anniversary of
</HEADLINE>
Mother Teresa's death &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Nuns in the simple cotton saris of Mother
Teresa's order stood among purple-robed princes of the church in
the gold and marble of St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday, paying
tribute to a woman who made her message of humble service a world
mission.
	   The memorial Mass was part of a day of commemorations at the
Vatican and in India on the first anniversary of Mother Teresa's
death.
	   Italian Cardinal Pio Laghi presided over the service at St.
Peter's, speaking before followers in suits and in blue jeans, in
wheelchairs and bandages, and in the blue-bordered white saris of
her Missionaries of Charity.
	   Citing her own words, Laghi reminded her followers of the
simplicity of both Mother Teresa _ ``I am only a poor woman who
prays'' _ and of her message _ ``God has not called us to be
successful, but to be faithful.''
	   The church's extraordinary homage comes as Mother Teresa's
followers at her charitable order's base in Calcutta already are
gathering evidence of miracles for her canonization.
	   Laghi spoke of Mother Teresa's response when asked once if she
had ever assisted in any miracles: ```Each day is a kind of
miracle. ... The greatest miracle of all is that God uses someone
as insignificant as us for accomplishing the work of his love.'''
	   Pope John Paul II was expected to speak in commemoration later
in the day. The Vatican also was opening one of its halls for a TV
special on the anniversary, featuring tributes from everybody from
Kofi Annan and Yasser Arafat to actor Ben Kingsley.
	   In the eastern city of Calcutta, housewives, beggars and
schoolchildren were among thousands who joined nuns of the
Missionaries of Charity to pray for Mother Teresa.
	   Since dawn on Saturday, hundreds of visitors lined up at her
tomb to pay their respects to the nun who became famous as the
``Saint of the Gutter'' for her work among India's poorest people.
She went on to help create charitable missions worldwide.
	   Among them was 50-year-old Arun Nath, a disabled man whose
treatment Mother Teresa funded over the years.
	   ``I came here to pay tribute to the great soul. In her death
last year, I lost my mother again,'' he said.
	   Nuns of her charity stood near her tomb, decorated plainly with
white roses and marigolds, while followers filed by and laid
bouquets at her grave.
	   Later, Sister Nirmala, a Hindu-born Indian convert to
Catholicism who became Mother Teresa's successor, held an all-faith
prayer in her honor.
	   ``Today is a great day as mother has gone home to God and she is
resting there. She is very powerful with god to intercede for us,
pray for us and bless us,'' Sister Nirmala said to the Hindus,
Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs and members of India's other
religious minorities who had gathered there.
	   Hourly prayers were to be held throughout the day at Mother
House, while nuns of the order continued their daily work of
feeding Calcutta's hungry.

Britain calls emergency G-7 meeting over Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With EU-Foreign Ministers

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain has called am emergency meeting of
officials of the Group of Seven next week about Russia's economic
crisis in order to help the world's top industrialized nations
respond quickly when the new Russian government is announced, the
government said Saturday.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair decided on the meeting of top civil
servants _ led by treasury officials _ after consulting visiting
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Northern Ireland this week, said a
spokesman at Blair's Downing Street office.
	   ``The message we are getting across to the Russians and that we
have agreed among ourselves is that we are ready to help, but that
all international assistance must be conditional on further
economic reform or it does not make sense,'' said the spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Britain holds the rotating presidency of the G-7 which groups
the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and
Britain. The group also meets as the G-8 with the inclusion of
Russia.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The terrorist car bombing of
Omagh, already the most deadly atrocity in the 30-year history of
Northern Ireland's conflict, claimed a 29th fatal victim Saturday.
	   Sean McGrath, 61, died in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital 21
days after Irish Republican Army dissidents detonated their bomb
amid workers, shoppers and Spanish tourists in the religiously
mixed town of Omagh.
	   Medical officials said 29 of the more than 330 people wounded in
the blast remained hospitalized Saturday, including two young women
in critical condition.
	   The latest death came two days after U.S. President Clinton and
his wife, Hillary, paid respects to the dead and wounded in a visit
to the bomb-shattered center of Omagh.

Mob burns to death ten suspected witches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMORENDA, Kenya (AP) _ A raging mob badly beat and then burned
to death Saturday 10 people believed to have tortured a villager in
a sorcery ritual in western Kenya, police said.
	   Witnesses said the killing Saturday followed the killings of two
other suspected witches on Friday after a teenager who was abducted
and tortured identified his assailants.
	   ``I can confirm ten people (were killed),'' said a police
inspector at the scene, who failed to give his name. ``According to
our sources they were killed because they were (believed to be)
practicing witchcraft.''
	   Witnesses and police said the incident began Thursday night when
18-year-old Bernard Nyasoko was abducted from his home in Bomorenda
village in the Kisii district, 250 kilometers (155 miles) west of
the capital Nairobi.
	   Nyasoko said his abductors took him to a location he did not
recognize, inflicted several punctures in his chest in a witchery
ritual, and then forced him to exhume the body of a person recently
buried and eat parts of it.
	   After managing to escape Friday, Nyasoko, who was left mute from
the experience but later regained his speech, wrote the names of
some of his assailants on a paper. Police arrested six people and
two more were killed by an angry mob in the village, villagers
said.
	   During the pre-dawn hours of Saturday, however, Nyasoko was
again abducted and villagers went to the homes of others the boy
had identified Friday, seeking the names of the kidnappers.
	   The angry mob, numbering at more than 1,000, rounded up their
suspects, beat them unconscious and then burned ten, police said.

including several top Soviet-era bureaucrats. Their remarks kicked
off a second weekend of behind-the-scenes negotiations to end a

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Investigators in the Aug. 7
bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania said Saturday they had
made ``extraordinary discoveries,'' having determined what the bomb
was made of and who carried it to the embassy. Police were holding
two suspects and three informants, Tanzanian director of criminal
investigation Rajabi Adadi said. ``Investigators have made
extraordinary discoveries,'' said Kenneth Piernick, head of FBI
investigators in Tanzania. ``They are now well aware of the
composition of the bomb and are also well aware how the device was
delivered and who delivered it.'' He refused to elaborate. Adadi
said one of the suspects arrested is Tanzanian and the other is a
foreigner. He would not identify the foreigner or his nationality,
but did not deny media reports that the suspect was Sudanese.

	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ A car bomb probably caused the
explosion that killed at least 13 people, including two children,
and gouged a five-meter (15-foot) crater in a street in the capital
of a restive southern Russian region, officials said Saturday. At
least 80 people were injured in the Friday night explosion and more
than half remained in hospitals, according to the press office of
the regional administration of Dagestan. The casualty toll was
expected to rise, as NTV television said 100 people were trapped in
the rubble. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, which the
Dagestani government called ``a monstrous act of terrorism,''
according to the Interfax news agency. (RUSSIA-DAGESTAN)
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ No breakthroughs were reported
Saturday on the first day of talks on ending Cambodia's current
political crisis, but participants described the atmosphere as
positive. The meeting, chaired by King Norodom Sihanouk, is being
held just a short distance from the famous temples of Angkor Wat in
the northwestern province of Siem Reap. It brings together
representatives from three rival political parties, the election
committee, and the country's highest appeals body to discuss the
stalemate that has followed parliamentary elections in July.
Sihanouk said Saturday the goal of the planned three-day meeting is
to find out what concessions rival parties are willing to make so
that ``calm'' can return to Phnom Penh, a new National Assembly can
convene and a new government can form. (CAMBODIA)
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Maltese islanders voted their choice
Saturday _ re-elect a Labor government shy about pushing too fast
for European Union membership or return to the Nationalists,
staunch advocates of a future anchored more solidly to Europe.
Polls opened on a hazy, warm day amid expectations for high turnout
among the 278,000 eligible voters. Maltese are traditionally
passionate about their politics, and turnout was expected to be
along the lines of the 96 percent figure of 1996. Complete official
results were likely Monday, but enough vote-counting was expected
to be done by Sunday evening to know the victor. Only two years
after the last election for parliament, Prime Minister Alfred Sant
was hoping for a new mandate, while veteran Nationalist leader
Eddie Fenech Adami was banking on his assertion that Maltese are
ready to unblock Malta's bid to join the EU club. (MALTA-ELECTION)

Explosion in Dagestan kills 17 people, injures dozens

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with death toll at 17. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ A car bomb probably caused the
explosion that killed at least 17 people, including two children,
and gouged a five-meter (15-foot) crater in a street in the capital
of a restive southern Russian region, officials said Saturday.
	   At least 80 people were injured in the Friday night explosion
and more than half remained in hospitals, according to the press
office of the regional administration of Dagestan.
	   The death toll was 17 as of Saturday afternoon, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said, citing the Emergency Situations Ministry. The
casualty toll was expected to rise, as NTV television said about
100 people were trapped in the rubble.
	   The Emergency Situations Ministry initially said the explosion
was caused by an artillery shell fired from an eastern suburb of
the Dagestan capital of Makhachkala.
	   But the local administration said Saturday that shards of glass
and metal fragments found in the bodies suggested a car bomb.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, which the
Dagestani government called ``a monstrous act of terrorism,''
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Dagestan has been wracked by violence and kidnappings in recent
months as various religious and ethnic groups battle for power. It
has also been hit by spillover violence from breakaway Chechnya, on
its western border. A car bomb recently killed Dagestan's top
Islamic leader.
	   Friday's explosion occurred outside the local television center
on the street where Dagestan's prime minister, Khizri Shikhsaidov,
and Makhachkala Mayor Said Amirov live. Neither was hurt.
	   Shikhsaidov's motorcade had passed by the site only minutes
before the explosion, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, quoting
Dagestan's Interior Ministry.
	   Local TV commentator Angela Mamadibirova said the attack was
believed to be an attempt on Amirov's life. She said he has
survived 10 assassination attempts this year.
	   Later, television reporters speculated that the explosion had
been intended to destroy the television center. The TV building was
badly damaged, and 40 percent of its equipment destroyed, the
television report said.
	   A building housing an agricultural institute and 10 buildings
nearby were also damaged, the Interfax news agency said. Many
students living in a dormitory at the institute were injured by
glass shards, local television said.
	   Fifteen homes where 142 people lived were destroyed, reduced to
a pile of bricks, wood and twisted metal pipes. Fires caused by
broken gas pipes broke out in several houses.
	   The explosion left a crater 5 meters (16-1/2 feet) wide and 3
meters (nearly 10 feet) deep.
	   Rescuers with sniffer dogs, including airborne troops and
specially trained Emergency Situations Ministry workers flown in
from Moscow, searched for more victims on Saturday. Heavy rain
hampered their efforts.
	   The regional government declared Saturday and Sunday to be days
of mourning.

Volunteer groups provide aid to flood-hit northern India
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SITTAUR, India (AP) _ Villagers huddled under roadside tents
Saturday in the Indian countryside as they waited for volunteers to
distribute food, clothes and medicines after floods submerged large
parts of a populous state.
	   ``We're doing whatever we can to help these unfortunate
people,'' said Rev. G.P. Dutt, whose team of 50 church volunteers
gave food and medicine to people camping on a road beside submerged
rice paddies.
	   Government relief has not reached many places in Uttar Pradesh
after the worst flooding in decades hit half of the state's 83
districts, submerging over 8 million acres of farm fields (3.2
million hectares) in the last month. The area is 650 kilometers
(400 miles) southeast of New Delhi.
	   About 70 percent of the 13 million people marooned or made
homeless by the floods are vulnerable to illness, doctors say.
	   The floods have left 1, 570 dead from drowning or waterborne
diseases, according to the government.
	   Dozens of volunteer groups have been working round the clock in
Uttar Pradesh, distributing clothes, providing safe drinking water
or hot meals to the victims.
	   The groups met informally Friday and allocated specific
responsibilities to each group. ``We decided to avoid duplication
of relief work,'' said Mathew Alexander, director of Catholic
Relief Services.
	   Exact figures of aid were not available immediately, but could
be around 200 million rupees (dlrs 480,000), said Shiraj Wahij of
the independent Voluntary Health Association of India.
	   Allegations were rife in flood-hit areas that government
officials were siphoning off as much as 40 percent of government
relief aid.

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The turbulent water off this
picturesque village where Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the sea
turned from a scene of fishermen frantically searching for
survivors to a painstaking military operation.
	   Authorities gave up Friday on the possibility they would find
any of the 229 people aboard the flight alive. They officially
called off rescue attempts, and focused on cleaning up.
	   Shrouded by a gray, soupy mist, officials in small military
boats fished out personal belongings, debris and the remains of
victims of Wednesday night's crash and delivered their cargo to the

the operation.

President urges Irish to stand by peace pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout with Clinton speech &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMERICK, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton appealed to the
Irish people Saturday to reject ``enemies of peace'' who would
undercut the accord ending violence in Northern Ireland. ``Do not
let them break your will,'' he told an enthusiastic turnout of
flag-waving admirers.
	   In a passionate, rallying speech to crowds clogging O'Connell
Street, Clinton said Ireland's negotiated peace makes it a shining
example for peoples everywhere, from Rwanda to the Middle East to
Kosovo.
	   ``Because of what you have done in Ireland in 1998 you have made
it possible for me ... to tell every warring, feuding, hating group
of people trapped in the prison of their past conflicts to look at
Ireland and know there can be a better day,'' he said.
	   Clinton was winding up a six-day European trip with Irish
applause ringing in his ears but the lengthening shadow of the
Monica Lewinsky affair awaiting him back home.
	   His role in pushing Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland toward a peaceful accommodation has earned him plaudits. It
was marked Saturday with a scroll presented on behalf of the
universities of Ireland praising his ``critical contributions'' to
peace.
	   The people of Limerick, who turned out a crowd of 20,000 or more
on this rainy morning that turned to sun for Clinton, also gave him
a certificate of freedom.
	   But Clinton said the major credit for progress belonged to the
people in the north and in the republic who voted for the accord
reached last April to set up a new assembly and spur sectarian
reconciliation.
	   ``The demons of the past are losing their power to divide you,''
he said. ``This is you at your best. Do not let them break your
will.''
	   On the stage he shared with his wife, Hillary, and Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern, winds buffeted a tall wall of bulletproof
glass that left exposed only the small lectern where Clinton
delivered his remarks.
	   After speaking, the president shook hands with many of the
hundreds of people pressing up against metal barricades. Clinton
leaned far over the barrier to reach outstretched hands and Secret
Service agents supported him by clinging to his belt.
	   Later Saturday, he gets a chance to relax by playing golf at
Ballybunion before returning to a Washington bound up by the
Lewinsky controversy and increasingly critical of the president's
behavior. Except for a fund-raising trip to Florida on Wednesday,
Clinton will be at the White House in the coming week, his conduct
and contrition a national obsession.
	   New trouble also loomed overseas.
	   Tensions between Iran and Afghanistan have increased in recent
days after Tehran massed more than 70,000 elite troops at the
border to conduct military exercises. The maneuvers are apparently
directed against Afghanistan where, according to Tehran, the ruling
Taliban militia is holding four dozen Iranians, including several
diplomats who are feared dead.
	   But, for the present, Clinton basked in the promise of peace.
	   ``Three years ago in Dublin, I promised the people of Ireland
that as long as Ireland walks the road of peace, America will walk
with you. You have more than kept your part of the deal and we will
keep ours,'' Clinton said.
	   To wit, the U.S.-based Dell Computer Corp. announced plans to
create a $90 million facility and add 1,700 jobs in the
southwestern city. Dell also said it was donating computers to the
schools of Omagh, Northern Ireland, where an Aug. 15 car bombing _
the worst terrorist attack in the province's 30 years of violence _
claimed its 29th victim on Saturday.
	   An unidentified male bombing victim died in Belfast's Royal
Victoria Hospital.
	   ``As we mourn the losses of Omagh, remember there will still be
efforts by the enemies of peace to break your will, to get you to
turn back, to get you to lose your faith,'' Clinton exhorted.
``Don't do it. Don't do it.''

Iranian vice president to travel to Iraq in landmark visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian Vice President Hassan Habibi will
visit former foe Iraq later this month, the highest-ranking
official to make the trip in two decades, an Iranian newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   During the landmark visit, Habibi will sign agreements on the
exchange of prisoners from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, war
reparations, water sharing, border security and an end to support
for each other's opposition groups, the Tehran Times reported.
	   The paper did not give a date for the visit.
	   The two sides will also discuss the safety of pilgrims visiting
holy sites in Iraq and Iran, it said.
	   The Iran-Iraq War ended with a U.N.-brokered cease-fire, but
animosity has persisted over a number of issues.
	   Iran claims Iraq still holds 4,000 prisoners of war while Iraq
says Iran is holding about 20,000 prisoners.
	   Tehran accuses Baghdad of helping Iranian opposition groups and
the two sides accuse each other of allowing infiltrators to sneak
across their borders for acts of sabotage.
	   The unsolved murders of two Iranian clerics in Iraq earlier this
year also soured relations.
	   The paper reported that Iraq has agreed to expel the Mujahedeen
Khalq Organization, an Iranian opposition group operating from
bases in Iraq.
	   Baghdad agreed in July to allow 12,000 Iranian pilgrims to visit
the holy Shiite cities of Najaf and Karbala each month and the two
sides have agreed on guarantees for their security, the paper said.
	   Baghdad and Tehran have agreed to implement the U.N. resolution
that ended the war, which called for Iraq to pay war damages to
Iran, the paper said.
	   They will also discuss sharing the waters of the Shatt al-Arab
river, which flows along the border and is Iraq's main gateway to
the Gulf.
	   More than 1 million people were killed or wounded on both sides
during the war.

Prime minister visits bedside of comatose interior minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Saturday paid a
visit to the bedside of France's interior minister, in his fourth
day of a coma induced by an allergic reaction to anesthesia.
	   Jean-Pierre Chevenement, a key figure in Jospin's leftist
government, remained in what doctors called a ``reactive coma,''
meaning he responds to his name with a blinking of the eyes.
	   Chevenement, 59, fell into the coma during an operation for
gallstones at the Val de Grace military hospital in southern Paris,
where the nation's top leaders receive medical treatment. He
suffered a heart attack during the procedure then fell into the
coma. Doctors said he suffered a rare reaction to a component in
the anesthesia.
	   France's deputy minister for overseas territories, Jean-Jack
Queyranne, was immediately appointed interim minister of the
interior.
	   Doctors have said Chevenement has been making a ``progressive
improvement'' but refuse to give a prognosis on his outcome.
	   Chevenement, in charge of the nation's police, is a key
political ally of Jospin, who made no comment after the visit.

Mob burns to death ten suspected witches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to clarify attribution to police officer at scene &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMORENDA, Kenya (AP) _ A raging mob badly beat and then burned
to death Saturday 10 people believed to have tortured a villager in
a sorcery ritual in western Kenya, a police officer at the scene
said.
	   Witnesses said the killing Saturday followed the killings of two
other suspected witches on Friday after a teenager who was abducted
and tortured identified his assailants.
	   ``I can confirm ten people (were killed),'' said a police
inspector at the scene. ``According to our sources they were killed
because they were (believed to be) practicing witchcraft.''
	   Witnesses and police said the incident began Thursday night when
18-year-old Bernard Nyasoko was abducted from his home in Bomorenda
village in the Kisii district, 250 kilometers (155 miles) west of
the capital Nairobi.
	   Nyasoko said his abductors took him to a location he did not
recognize, inflicted several punctures in his chest in a witchery
ritual, and then forced him to exhume the body of a person recently
buried and eat parts of it.
	   After managing to escape Friday, Nyasoko, who was left mute from
the experience but later regained his speech, wrote the names of
some of his assailants on a paper. Police arrested six people and
two more were killed by an angry mob in the village, villagers
said.
	   During the pre-dawn hours of Saturday, however, Nyasoko was
again abducted and villagers went to the homes of others the boy
had identified Friday, seeking the names of the kidnappers.
	   The angry mob, numbering at more than 1,000, rounded up their
suspects, beat them unconscious and then burned ten, police said.

North Korea reelects Kim Jong Il as military chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea's newly convened
parliament on Saturday reelected Kim Jong Il as head of its 1.1
million-strong military, the backbone of the reclusive Stalinist
regime, an official news report said.
	   The move reconfirms Kim's grip on power, said Seoul's Naewoe
Press, which monitored the North Korean state media that reported
Kim's reelection as chairman of the National Defense Commission, a
post he has held since 1993.
	   The Supreme People's Assembly convened Saturday to elect key
government posts for the first time since Kim's father, longtime
President Kim Il Sung, died of heart failure in 1994.
	   It has widely been expected to consolidate the junior Kim's
power by electing him as state president. But a presidential
election was not on the assembly's agenda.
	   Instead, the assembly discussed rewriting the North Korean
constitution, said the North's official Korean Central News Agency.
	   That raised speculation among South Korean and Japanese
observers that the North may abolish the post of president or leave
it vacant a sign of respect for Kim's late father, who had ruled
the country for nearly half a century until his demise four years
ago.
	   ``It's too early to predict, but one thing is clear: Whether Kim
Jong Il becomes president or not will make no difference to his
absolute grip on power,'' said Chang Yong-hoon, a Naewoe Press
analyst.
	   Even without being president, the junior Kim already is firmly
in control.
	   Since his father's demise, Kim, 56, has ruled his country as
communist party chief and head of the North's military, the world's
fifth largest.
	   Kim represents the first hereditary succession of power in a
communist state.
	   Making a rare public appearance, Kim attended the assembly, KCNA
said.
	   An estimated 680 deputies were chosen in a July 26 election for
a parliament that largely serves to rubber stamp legislation in the
tightly controlled country.
	   North Korea abolished the premiership and adopted the state
president in a constitutional amendment in 1972.
	   North Korea last amended its constitution in 1992 to give more
power to the National Defense Commission chief.
	   North Korean parliament last convened in 1994.

Yemen executes soldier for murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A Yemeni soldier has been executed in a
public square for murdering two relatives, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   Hamad Ali Mohammed was executed by firing squad Thursday in a
square in a suburb of the capital San`a, the al-Thawra newspaper
reported.
	   Mohammed shot his brother-in-law, Yahya Mohammed Ali, and
another relative, Hussein Hamad Muneif, in the street outside their
home earlier this year following a dispute, the paper reported.
	   A large crowd including government officials and relatives of
the victims attended Mohammed's execution, the paper said.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country at the tip of the Arabian
Peninsula, imposes the death penalty for rape and murder. Most
executions are carried out in public.

European Union analyzes Russian economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ The European Union says there is little
point in throwing money into the bottomless pit of the Russian
economic crisis, but EU foreign ministers meeting here will press
Moscow to move quickly with political reforms.
	   ``We do not want a return to communism and a command economy in
Russia,'' said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, arriving in
Salzburg on Saturday for an informal two-day meeting of the EU's 15
foreign ministers.
	   ``Russia is going through stormy times. We must not turn away
from Russia now that the weather is turning bad,'' he said. But he
added, ``Russia must sail its own course and help itself get out of
its problems.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called a meeting in London
next week of officials from the world's biggest industrial powers,
known as the G-7, a British spokesman in London said Saturday. That
is the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and
Japan.
	   Blair decided on the meeting after consulting U.S. President
Bill Clinton in Northern Ireland this week, with the goal of
preparing to respond quickly when the new Russian government is
formed, a spokesman at the prime minister's office said on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   ``The message we are getting across to the Russians, and that we
have agreed among ourselves, is that we are ready to help, but that
all international assistance must be conditional on further
economic reform or it does not make sense,'' the spokesman told The
Associated Press.
	   A German official in Salzburg said the EU plans to send a
delegation to Moscow next week. The ``troika,'' as the EU calls the
envoys, will represent Britain, Austria and Germany, the past,
present and future presidents of the EU. The German official said
the point will be to show the EU's political support for Moscow.
	   Comfortable in the fact that Russia represents only 4 percent of
the 15-nation EU's overall trade, the Europeans can afford to be
cautious. In the EU view, there is no point in doling out great
amounts of financial aid before resolving political problems.
	   ``We must be careful not to rush and take action for action for
action's sake, as long as the government situation in Moscow is not
clear,'' Kinkel said.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin is in a desperate struggle with
the parliament over his nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime
minister, a job from which he was sacked just last spring.
Chernomyrdin has promised to impose an ``economic dictatorship'' to
draw the economy out of crisis.
	   The EU has pledged strong political support for Yeltsin, but for
the moment there doesn't seem to be much it can do. The ministers
will issue a statement voicing their concerns, but are not expected
to take action.
	   EU governments have granted dlrs 1.6 billion in development aid
programs to Russia since 1991. The European Commission suggests
these be ``retargeted'' to focus on areas crucial to reform, such
as know-how in restructuring companies and developing sound banking
laws.
	   The other major topic before the foreign ministers in their
two-day session is Kosovo, the southern Yugoslav province
struggling for independence.
	   Under pressure from the Americans and Europeans, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and moderate ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova have agreed in principle to a formula granting
self-rule to the majority Albanian province.
	   Although the arrangement falls short of Albanian demands for
independence, Rugova has promised to try to convince Kosovo
Albanian hard-liners to accept it.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Maltese voted Saturday for a new
parliament in what was widely seen as a referendum on whether to
anchor their tiny island nation more solidly in Europe.
	   The election pitted Prime Minister Alfred Sant's Labor
government, which froze Valletta's bid for European Union
membership shortly after taking office in 1996, against Nationalist
leader Eddie Fenech Adami, Sant's predecessor, who pushed for
Malta's entry into the EU fold.
	   First results of the hand-counting of the written ballots were
expected Sunday evening at the earliest. In Malta, a one or
two-seat majority in the 65-member parliament is not unusual, and
given traditionally close margins of victory, exit polls haven't
caught on here.
	   Maltese are very passionate over their politics, and turnout
among the 278,000 eligible voters was expected to run close to the
96 percent figure of 1996.
	   Sant called the election three years early in hope of
strengthening his government, which was rocked by ministerial
resignations and the defection on key votes by ex-premier Dom
Mintoff.
	   Shortly after Labor's 1996 victory ended a nine-year run by the
arch-rival Nationalists, Sant froze the EU bid, which had been
favorably reviewed by Brussels in 1993.
	   Waiting to vote near the waterfront in the capital's historic
center, worker John Chircop said he was thinking of his three young
children before casting his ballot.
	   If the Nationalists win, ``we'll have the opportunity to go
everywhere in Europe'' to look for jobs, said Chircop, a crane
operator at a container port. Sant ``doesn't know where he's
going,'' added Chircop. ``For us, it's very good'' to join the
European Union.
	   Others thought Sant would come out stronger, despite widespread
grumbling over sharply higher utility rates raised by the
government as a budget-paring measure.
	   ``It will be better'' for Sant after the vote, said Lino Cauchi,
walking his dog up one of Valletta's steep streets.
	   Sant, a 50-year-old Harvard Business School graduate management
consultant, has advocated a free-trade agreement with the EU but
insisted Malta isn't ready to make the sacrifices that Brussels
demands.
	   Maltese industries enjoy heavy goverment protection, and the
extensive state sector helps keep unemployment low, at 4 percent.
	   Fenech Adami contended that freezing the EU bid has scared away
badly needed foreign investors.
	   One familiar name was missing from the ballots. Mintoff, 82, was
not running for a seat for the first time in 53 years. The former
Labor premier is largely remembered abroad for his staunchly
pro-Libyan stance.
	   But under Sant, relations with Libya, a major investor in Malta,
were more low key. Diplomats said the Sant government recently
urged the Libyan envoy here to push Tripoli to agree to a
U.S.-British proposal to have a Scottish court in the Netherlands
try two Libyans suspected in the 1988 Pan Am bombing.

Arms systems illegally exported to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ After the fall of Communism here,
the Czech Republic continued to export arms and military equipment
to Communist countries, including North Korea, a newspaper said
Saturday.
	   Between 1992 and 1997, a total of 365 military vehicles and
other weapons systems were exported to North Korea, China and
Slovakia by a Czech company ran by a Russian businessman, according
to the newspaper Lidove Noviny.
	   The businessman, identified only as A.K., was accused last
October of exporting military equipment without a government
license and is in custody, the paper said.
	   The chief of staff for the Czech armed forces, Gen. Jiri Sedivy,
told the newspaper that illegal arms exports may turn into a ``big
problem'' for the Czech Republic.
	   The chairman of the parliamentary security committee, Petr
Necas, said that the sales may harm the Czech Republic's
credibility abroad, which rose dramatically after the 1989 ``Velvet
Revolution'' brought down the Communist regime.
	   ``Both the army and military intelligence services should be
accountable for this,'' Necas said. ``How can you hide the export
of 300 (armored vehicles)?''
	   The defense ministry refused to comment on the incident but said
it would issue a statement ``within a couple of days,'' the
newspaper said.
	   The ministry was closed Saturday and no one was available for
comment.

Israeli jets attack guerrilla targets in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Saturday, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   Two fighter jets fired two air-to-surface missiles at the hills
of Mazraat Iqmata and Mlita in the Iqlim al Tuffah province, a
Hezbollah stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied border enclave
in south Lebanon, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the targeted area, but there
were no immediate reports of casualties from the raid.
	   Iqlim al Tuffah, a frequent target of Israeli warplanes, is used
by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group as a base to launch
attacks on Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen in
the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has led the fight to oust some
1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 members of the Israeli-allied
South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to try to protect its northern
settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Some hugged one another, others
stood alone. One woman plucked wildflowers near the base of the
lighthouse, then crouched and stared out to sea.
	   More than 300 relatives of Swissair Flight 111 victims, their
privacy protected by police and military escorts, are mourning
together and visiting Peggy's Cove _ the coastal town closest to
where their loved ones died in the crash Wednesday that killed 229
people.
	   Despite intensive efforts, including deployment of a submarine
equipped with sonar, searchers have been unable to locate the
plane's flight-data and voice recorders, which could shed light on
the cause of the crash.
	   Philippe Bruggisser, chief of Swissair's parent SAirGroup, said
Saturday in Zurich, Switzerland, that Canadian authorities resumed
their search for the black boxes with ships and divers.
	   Canadian authorities said they will release the conversation
between pilots and the ground station later Saturday, he said.
	   Most of the victims' bodies have not been recovered yet, and
most of the human remains retrieved so far are fragments, slowing
the identification process.
	   On Friday, about a dozen relatives who arrived on a series of
flights from New York and Geneva made the trip to the fishing
village near Halifax that has become the base for searchers.
	   Peter Gerety _ who traveled from Connecticut to be near the site
where his brother, U.N. worker Pierce Gerety, was killed _ carried
two rocks off the beach.
	   ``I just felt like having a memento. It was such a beautiful
place, and that's the irony of it.''
	   Swissair chief executive Jeff Katz said a private,
non-denominational memorial service would be held Saturday for the
victims. The time of the service was not provided to the media.
	   Family members were set up in rubber army tents on a bluff
overlooking the ocean with clergy from different denominations
available for counseling.
	   Several people got off a blue charter bus Saturday morning with
bouquets and wreaths of yellow and purple flowers. A few people put
their hands to their faces as they saw the crash site for the first
time.
	   The plane, en route from New York to Geneva, disappeared from
radar screens 16 minutes after its pilots reported smoke in the
cockpit.
	   Air traffic controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, advised the
pilots to make an emergency landing in Halifax, but the MD-11
wide-body jet never made it, crashing into the ocean 30 miles (50
kilometers) to the south.
	   At a press conference Friday, the chief investigator defended
the actions of the cockpit crew, saying their last conversation
with controllers was conducted in a professional manner.
	   Vic Gerden of Canada's Transportation Safety Board refused to
speculate on what happened in the jet's final moments.
	   ``I don't deal in maybes, could haves and would haves,'' he
said. ``The crew indicated there was smoke in the cockpit. We don't
have further indication of specific problems.''
	   Gerden said the plane descended rapidly while trying to reach
Halifax and made a couple of sharp turns over the coast while
dumping fuel.
	   Katz told a news conference the three-engine jetliner was well
maintained, saying it ``had a clean bill of health.''
	   He said Swissair had complied with all directives from U.S.
aviation officials advising of wiring problems in MD-11 jets. Two
such advisories in 1996 and 1997 warned of potentially hazardous
wiring in the cockpit and in a rear consol for flight attendants.
	   Authorities say the wreckage is so fragmented that it may be
difficult to reconstruct the plane, as would normally be done in
the investigation.
	   The hunt has turned up no piece of wreckage bigger than a
kitchen tabletop, though 100 pieces of luggage were recovered
Friday.
	   Authorities were mapping the ocean floor in preparation for
sending down a small, remote-controlled submersible to investigate
the sea bed.
	   Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, Dr. John Butt, said X-rays
and dental charts would be needed to identify the victims. He said
relatives would not be pressured to come to a makeshift morgue at
an air base to assist with the identifications.
	   The family members who made the trip to Peggy's Cove on Friday
got an escort from soldiers as they got out of their vehicles. The
throng of reporters at the site was kept at a distance.
	   Valerie Warren was among the volunteer bus drivers who picked up
mourners at the Halifax airport.
	   ``It was a very quiet ride in,'' she said. ``A baby crying was
the only noise I heard.''
	   Many relatives chose not to accept Swissair's offer to bring
them to the crash scene, including former boxing champion Jake
LaMotta, whose son Joe was on the doomed airplane.
	   ``Why bring on the extra grief?'' said LaMotta, 76, who lost his
only other son, Jake Jr., in February. ``I'm pretty on in years. I
don't want to face it 'til I have to. ... It's just too much for me
now.''
	   One of the crash victims was Saudi Prince Bandar bin Saud bin
Saad bin Abdul-Rahman Al Saud, 45, a businessman who had lived in
the United States for eight years. He was on his way to visit his
sick father in Geneva. Although a member of the royal family, he
was not from the ruling branch.
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it would help arrange
press briefings by relatives willing to make statements, but warned
journalists not to intrude on those who wished to be left alone.
	   Staff Sgt. Keith McGuire also said police were becoming
exasperated with members of the public, both on shore and in boats,
venturing into the search area to look for debris. He said the
intruders face arrest and seizure of their boats.
	   Police said metal barriers and yellow tape to keep people away
from the shore were for their own protection.
	   ``Remember one thing, we might have someone suicidal,'' Sgt. Ray
Russell said. ``They might be distraught, we don't know. We have to
stay alert.''

Angolan gov't breaks off talks with leader of former rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Tension surrounding Angola's troubled
peace process mounted after the government said it was severing all
contact with the leader of the former rebel group UNITA, Jonas
Savimbi.
	   Deputy Minister for Territorial Administration Gen. Higino
Carneiro said late Friday that the government would deal only with
a group of UNITA dissidents who have set up a rival leadership in
the capital Luanda.
	   ``Our contact with Jonas Savimbi has been cut,'' Gen. Carneiro
told reporters.
	   Savimbi's representatives and the government were negotiating
implementation of the outstanding provisions of the United
Nations-brokered 1994 peace deal, which ended a two-decade civil
war.
	   Implementation has been stymied by lingering hostility between
the former foes, and the government's move to isolate Savimbi
increased fears of a renewed war.
	   In contravention of the peace deal, UNITA has refused to hand
over its central highland strongholds to the government.
	   Gen. Carneiro accused Savimbi of maintaining a guerilla army
hidden in the bush and hinted that the government could take
military action against UNITA.
	   ``The international community should have demilitarized UNITA.
Since it hasn't, we'll have to do it,'' he said, but declined to
say what action the government might take.
	   UNITA said in a written statement that the government's decision
had ``further sharpened the current crisis'' in the peace process,
but added that the group remained committed to the peace agreement.
	   The U.N. has imposed sanctions on UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ for
its failure to comply with the peace accord, including a freeze on
its bank accounts and a travel ban on its officials.
	   U.N. officials in Luanda were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Two prominent UNITA officials announced Thursday that they would
no longer follow Savimbi and would create their own dissident
leadership in Luanda.
	   Jorge Valentim, formerly UNITA's main spokesman, and Eugenio
Manuvakola, who signed the peace deal for UNITA, accused Savimbi of
not wanting peace.
	   The governing MPLA party last week expelled UNITA officials from
the government of national unity and reconciliation, in which the
former rebels had four ministers because, it said, the movement
still had armed forces.
	   UNITA last month broke off contacts with U.S., Russian and
Portuguese observers who are monitoring Angola's peace process for
the U.N., saying they were biased towards the government.
	   A 1991 peace agreement collapsed the following year when Savimbi
rejected his defeat in the country's first democratic elections and
returned to war.
	   The fighting between UNITA and the MPLA _ the Popular Movement
for the Liberation of Angola _ erupted after the country's 1975
independence from Portugal.

North Korea reelects Kim Jong Il as military chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from the North Korean media; minor edits
thruout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea's newly convened
parliament on Saturday reelected Kim Jong Il as head of its 1.1
million-strong military, the backbone of the reclusive Stalinist
regime, an official news report said.
	   Kim's reelection as chairman of the National Defense Commission
_ a post he has held since 1993 _ reconfirms his grip on power,
said the North's official Korean Central News Agency.
	   ``It is a token of absolute support for and deep trust in him by
all the people and servicemen,'' KCNA said.
	   The Supreme People's Assembly convened Saturday to elect top
government posts for the first time since Kim's father, longtime
President Kim Il Sung, died of heart failure in 1994.
	   It has widely been expected to consolidate the junior Kim's
power by electing him as state president. But a presidential
election was not on the assembly's agenda, and it discussed
rewriting the North Korean constitution instead, KCNA said.
	   That raised speculation among South Korean and Japanese
observers that the North may abolish the post of president or leave
it vacant as a sign of respect for Kim's late father, who had ruled
the country for nearly half a century until his death four years
ago.
	   ``It's too early to predict, but one thing is clear: Whether Kim
Jong Il becomes president or not will make no difference to his
absolute grip on power,'' said Chang Yong-hoon, an analyst at
Seoul's Naewoe Press, which monitors North Korean news media.
	   Since his father's death, Kim, 56, has ruled his country as
communist party chief and head of the North's military, the world's
fifth largest. He represents the first hereditary succession of
power in a communist state.
	   Making a rare public appearance, Kim attended the assembly, KCNA
said.
	   An estimated 680 deputies were chosen in a July 26 election for
a parliament that largely serves to rubber stamp legislation in the
tightly controlled country.
	   North Korea abolished the premiership and adopted the state
president in a constitutional amendment in 1972.
	   North Korea last amended its constitution in 1992 to give more
power to the National Defense Commission chief.
	   North Korean parliament last convened in 1994.

Poland, Germany and Denmark set up joint military unit

	   SZCZECIN, Poland (AP) _ Defense ministers of Poland, Germany and
Denmark signed an agreement on Saturday on the functioning of a
joint military corps, which will begin operation after Poland's
entry into NATO next year.
	   The unit, made up of three armored divisions of 8,000-10,000
troops each and three communications battalions, is to serve
defense purposes and will be designed take part in peacekeeping and
humanitarian missions, such as flood relief.
	   During a ceremony at the Pomeranian Princes' Castle in Szczecin
Polish defense chief, Janusz Onyszkiewicz, and his German and
Danish counterparts, Volker Ruehe and Hans Haekkerup, celebrated
the agreement with champagne.
	   ``This is a historical milestone,'' Ruehe told a brief news
conference afterwards. He said the military cooperation with Poland
was an important element of European integration and that it had
strong support of the Germans.
	   Haekkerup stressed that the new force, nor NATO's eastward
expansion, were in no way aimed against Russia. We are open to
talks and cooperation with Russia, he said.
	   Saturday's meeting in Szczecin was the the seventh in the series
of trilateral meetings that have been held since August 1995 to
work out the details of the joint force.
	   Last September the three ministers established a special working
group to prepare operating details.
	   The ministers estimated the cost of creating the Northeastern
Multinational Corps at about 15 million zlotys (dlrs 4 million) for
each country.
	   Its headquarters, where 40 officers from each nation will serve,
will be in Szczecin, the city located on the Baltic coast near the
Polish-German border. A Danish officer will be appointed to take
the rotating command of the corps during the first three years of
operation.
	   The force is expected to pave the way for future multinational
units involving Czech and Hungarian troops, the ministers said.
	   Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, were the first former
Soviet Bloc nations invited to join NATO at the alliance's summit
in July.

Myanmar newspapers denounce opposition as World Bank bars loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS exile group statement on student protest in grafs 13-14

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ As one college campus remained closed
Saturday for fear of student unrest, the state-run press accused
the pro-democratic opposition of demanding the impossible in a bid
to destabilize the country.
	   The commentary, which also took note of Southeast Asia's
economic turmoil, comes at a time when the military government is
facing increasing challenges.
	   The World Bank on Friday announced that Myanmar _ also known as
Burma _ would be ineligible for new loans from the international
lending body because of a failure to pay old debts. The move
doesn't affect any existing World Bank programs for Myanmar, but it
sends a signal around the world that the country is a bad credit
risk.
	   The World Bank's last project in Myanmar closed in 1995, after
the agency gave Myanmar its last loan in 1987. After that, the
macroeconomic environment became so severe that the bank felt it
was unable to operate in Myanmar.
	   The commentary in Saturday's state-run newspapers said that
while economies in Southeast Asia are in turmoil and countries
around the world are facing economic crisis, the Myanmar government
has tried hard to overcome difficulties within its capacity.
	   ``Taking advantage of the economic crisis in the region, some
people are trying to create anarchy by demanding for the
impossible,'' it said. ``They are instigating the public to revolt
and protest, leading towards the disintegration of the country.''
	   It warned that anyone trying to disrupt the national convention
will have to face the punishment of the people.
	   Although the commentary did not refer to any organization by
name, it appeared to be talking about the National League for
Democracy.
	   The NLD, led by Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi, won
82 percent of the seats in parliament in a 1990 election, but the
military refused to honor the result.
	   Suu Kyi and her colleagues have vowed they will convene
parliament sometime during September. The government has threatened
to arrest the opposition leaders and ban her party if they try.
	   The military has said that a constitution is necessary to
convene parliament and accused the opposition of going against the
law. A national convention to draw up guidelines for a constitution
began in 1993 has been in recess since 1996.
	   Access to the Hlaing campus of the Yangon Institute of
Technology remained closed Saturday morning. The campus was closed
Thursday after students began chanting and demanding examinations
be delayed.
	   An exile student opposition group, the All Burma Students'
Democratic Front, claimed Saturday that 1,200 students staying at
hostels on the campus are continuing to make a series of demands
about educational issues.
	   The exile group, in a fax sent to The Associated Press in
Bangkok, Thailand said the students fear police will soon raid the
campus to end their protest.
	   Hundreds of students have demonstrated publicly at least three
times during the past two weeks, the first public protests in
Yangon in almost two years.
	   Students last demonstrated in December 1996. The military put
down the protests without excessive force, but sentenced dozens of
students to long prison terms. Universities have been shut since.
	   Some were reopened within the last few months so students could
prepare for and take long-delayed exams. Examinations are scheduled
for Monday, and students at the Hlaing campus said they wanted them
delayed.
	   The military government is extremely wary of any activism on the
part of students, as they have historically played pivotal roles
Myanmar's political movements.

APEC council supports bond guarantees to ease financial crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A committee of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum agreed Saturday to help guarantee government
bonds issued by countries that have been hit hard by Asia's
financial crisis.
	   The forum's Business Advisory Council agreed that countries less
affected by the financial crisis should guarantee bonds issued by
the more battered economies, said Jeffrey Koo, the top Taiwanese
delegate.
	   The Asian Development Bank should oversee the operation of the
bonds to help restore the issuing countries' credibility, he said.
	   The proposal will be submitted to the APEC summit meeting
scheduled to be held in Malaysia in November, Koo told reporters.
	   He said Taiwan, for instance, is willing to guarantee a quarter
of the total bonds to be issued.
	   Members of the Council began a three-day meeting in Taipei
Friday to seek ways to ease the Asian economic crisis.
	   On Friday, Tan Tajudin Ramli, the chief Malaysian delegate,
warned that the 18-member APEC forum could collapse if it fails to
provide any solutions to the economic crisis.

International banks will help Bangladesh cope with floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ International lending agencies have
authorized Bangladesh to spend current development loans to repair
roads and homes damaged by this year's deadly floods, their
officials said Saturday.
	   ``Bangladesh can start using the bank's loans to repair damaged
roads and help farmers to replant crops as soon as the floodwaters
recede,'' said Pierre Landell-Mills, head of the World Bank mission
in Dhaka.
	   The bank has loaned Bangladesh dlrs 700 million for building
roads, schools and health centers.
	   Landell-Mills said the bank will work with Bangladesh's
government in assessing damage caused by two months of floods that
inundated much of the country and affected 30 million people, a
fourth of the population.
	   The Manila-based Asian Development Bank will also send a mission
of experts next week to assess the damage.
	   ``We are ready to commit funds to Bangladesh in addition to our
normal annual credit of dlrs 300 million to help repair damaged
embankments and roads,'' Francesco Pittore, head of a visiting team
from Asian Development Bank, said Saturday.
	   Both officials said that their banks will concentrate on
post-flood rehabilitation instead of immediate relief, for which
they have no mandate.
	   Overwhelmed by the century's most prolonged floods, Bangladesh
has appealed for international aid of dlrs 879 million to buy
emergency food and medicine. The U.S. and other donors have so far
committed more than dlrs 80 million, mainly to buy food.
	   On Saturday, the United Nations appealed for dlrs 223 million in
emergency relief and rehabilitation aid for Bangladesh. The U.N.
system has already provided an initial dlrs 1.16 million.
	   The U.N. said in a statement that Bangladesh needs about dlrs
108 million for food, dlrs 36 million for agriculture and the rest
for health, shelter, safe drinking water, sanitation and education.

Two children killed in Yemen while playing with land mine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Two Yemeni children have been killed while
playing with a land mine, a police official said Saturday.
	   The 12-year-old boy and 10-year old girl were herding sheep in
the central province of al-Dhal`e Thursday when they discovered the
land mine. Not recognizing what it was, they started throwing it to
each other, the police spokesman said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The land mine detonated when it fell, the spokesman said.
	   He did not give the children's names.
	   An estimated 100,000 land mines were planted during Yemen's 1994
civil war. The mines have killed and maimed hundreds of people,
mainly children.

Stalled talks with Pakistan will resume, India's prime minister
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India will resume formal talks with
Pakistan that stalled after tensions heightened between the two
hostile neighbors following their nuclear tests, Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee said Saturday.
	   ``Talks have already started,'' Vajpayee told reporters in New
Delhi on his return from an eight-day tour of African nations.
	   ``The modalities for the dialogue have been drawn up and all
issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, will be discussed ... without
any third-party intervention,'' he said.
	   The Himalayan territory of Kashmir, which was divided between
the two countries following two wars, has been the main issue of
dispute since Pakistan was carved out in 1947 by British
colonialists.
	   Several rounds of talks between prime ministers have yielded
little or no results.
	   Talks broke off after both nations tested nuclear weapons.
Pakistan says it was provoked into retaliating following India's
tests. India said it needed the tests because of threats from
Pakistan and China.
	   Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in its entirety. The only
Muslim-majority state in India, where Hindus form 82 percent of the
nearly 1 billion population, has been wracked by an insurrection
since 1989. More than 16,000 people have been killed in almost
daily gunbattles between separatist guerrillas and Indian security
forces.
	   Vajpayee highlighted the Kashmir dispute in his talks with the
leaders of Oman, Namibia, South Africa and Mauritius.
	   ``There has been a forward movement in the discussions between
Indian and Pakistani delegations'' which met on the sidelines of
the Nonaligned Movement meeting in South Africa.
	   Vajpayee met with Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, in
the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, in July. But their meeting yielded
no results. Sharif did not take part in the NAM summit. But
informal talks were held between foreign ministers and officials of
both nations.

Red Cross to help victims of military operation in Aceh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Red Cross will provide aid for the
victims of a military operation against separatists in Indonesia's
northernmost province of Aceh, a report said Saturday.
	   The eight-year military campaign against Islamic separatist
rebels has created thousands of widows and orphans in the
predominantly Muslim province. At least 781 people have been killed
since 1990.
	   The International Commission of the Red Cross will set up
education funds for orphans and provide counseling for the widows
of men who have died in the campaign, said Rasidin Aba Aminy of the
local Indonesian Red Cross agency, according to the official Antara
news agency.
	   Rasidin was quoted as saying that the assistance will come by
the end of the year at the latest.
	   Last month, the military decided to withdraw troops from the
region, which lies about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest
of Jakarta.
	   Aceh is one of three Indonesian provinces where separatist
rebels are fighting for independence. The other two are former
Portuguese colony of East Timor and Irian Jaya on western New
Guinea.

Khatami, newspapers condemn assault on senior officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian President Mohammad Khatami ordered
the police and judicial authorities Saturday to bring to justice
swiftly the militants who assaulted a deputy president and a
Cabinet minister.
	   Some 80 hard-liners chanting ``Death to liberals!'' scuffled
Friday with Deputy President Abdollah Nouri and Culture Minister
Ataollah Mohajerani as they were separately leaving Tehran
University after prayers.
	   In a statement broadcast on national radio and television,
Khatami said the authorities should ``spare no effort against the
ugly behavior of a small group of people who are grudgingly opposed
to the establishment of freedom and justice.''
	   The president called on the authorities to ``teach a lesson to
the violators of the law, who, because of ignorance or in pursuance
of their missions, understand only the language of force.''
	   The militants knocked off Nouri's white cleric turban, tore open
Mohajerani's shirt and slapped both officials in the face.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Saturday that
both men, who are close allies of Khatami, were reported to be ``in
good condition.''
	   Khatami also urged the judiciary, a stronghold of the hard-line
sympathy within the ruling hierarchy, to cooperate in bringing the
assailants to justice.
	   Vigilantes suspected of acting on orders from hard-line
officials have often resorted to violence to intimidate opponents
and try to derail the reforms of Khatami, a moderate who has
liberalized political debate and relaxed the Islamic social code
since taking office in August 1997.
	   However, Friday's incident was the first time that militants
have attacked persons of Cabinet rank. Furthermore, it is rare for
a clergyman, even a controversial one such as Nouri, to be
physically assaulted in Iran. Nouri was interior minister until
hard-line legislators impeached him in June for allowing political
demonstrations and relaxing the dress code.
	   The Expediency Council, a body that settles political and
legislative disputes, condemned the beatings. Its chairman, former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, called for the culprits to be
punished quickly.
	   The moderate newspaper Iran News warned that if such attacks
were not dealt with severely, ``the enemies of the Islamic Republic
will rejoice.''
	   Another moderate newspaper, Ruznameh Zan, said it had received
unconfirmed reports that a senior intelligence officer, wearing
plainclothes and dark glasses, observed the assaults from the back
of the crowd. The report suggested the attacks were orchestrated by
senior hard-line officials.

One Kosovo Albanian leader warns the other against making deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The political representative of
ethnic Albanian rebels casy doubt over a possible peace deal for
Kosovo recently announced by Serbian authorities and the chief
Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Adem Demaci, the designated representative of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, said Rugova, his archrival in the Kosovo Albanian
community, would be making a mistake if he agrees to the
U.S.-mediated deal, currently being negotiated with the country's
strongman, President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``I don't believe Milosevic could have any serious proposal
concerning the Kosovo problem,'' Demaci told the Albanian-language
daily Bujku, published in Kosovo. ``I don't believe him. He is
constantly lying.''
	   Under pressure from America and Europe, both Milosevic and
Rugova have agreed in principle to a formula granting self-rule to
the province, subject to revision in 3-5 years.
	   A factional feud within the Kosovo Albanian camp between Demaci
and Rugova has been one of the stumbling blocks in peace efforts
for Kosovo. The West considers Rugova as the top representative,
but Demaci has support of the guerrillas, a key factor in the
conflict.
	   ``If the Serbian regime really wants something serious with
Kosovo, it would not continue to burn and bomb settlements and
homes of Albanians and to kill them,'' Demaci said.
	   Rugova has also demanded the government stop attacks on the KLA
as a pre-condition for any deal or for the start of face-to-face
talks. Nevertheless, Rugova continues diplomatic contacts with
Milosevic through U.S. and other envoys.
	   ``Although (the agreement) is in a preliminary phase, I am
afraid that Dr. Rugova will make a mistake,'' Demaci said. ``Serbia
wants to have both hands free. With one hand, it wants to simulate
a dialogue. And with the other, it continues to exert force against
our population.''

Eight of 10 Thai army vehicles idle because of cutbacks: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Eight of 10 Thai army motor vehicles
have been left idle because of an 80 percent budget cutback due to
Thailand's economic crisis, a newspaper report said Saturday.
	   The Bangkok Post, citing an anonymous source, said 25,000
vehicles were left parked with tires and batteries removed as part
of cost-cutting measures ordered by Army Commander Gen. Chettha
Thanajaro.
	   It said that army officers who used to receive a 200-liter
(52-gallon) per month allowance of fuel for their cars must now pay
for it themselves, as well as for repairs.
	   The army has also launched a program to have soldiers grow their
own food on their bases.

Hatakeyama beats Choi, winning WBA super featherweight title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Takanori Hatakeyama of Japan beat defending
champion Choi Yong-soo of South Korea in a split decision Saturday,
winning the World Boxing Association junior featherweight title.
	   There were no knockdowns throughout the 12 rounds.
	   Judge Pinit Prayadsab from Thailand scored the fight 114-114,
while Henk Meijiers of the Netherlands and another judge, Rodolfo
Maldonado of Panama, both had it 116-113 for Hatakeyama.
	   The champion and No. 2 contender Hatakeyama never ceased
exchanging punches, although none of the blows were powerful enough
to send the other down.
	   ``I'm not satisfied with today's fight,'' said Hatakeyama. ``I
just couldn't fight the way I wanted.''
	   Choi refused to make any comment.
	   It was Choi's eighth attempted defense of the title he won from
Argentine Victor Hugo Paz in Salta, Argentina, on Oct. 21, 1995.
	   The 23-year-old, undefeated Hatakeyama now is 22-0-1 with 17
knockouts. He drew once in his previous title match against Choi in
October last year.
	   Choi falls to 24-3-1 with 14 knockouts.

 &UR; Eds: TOPS with Diagana beating Bronson, other results. will be

 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ France's Stephane Diagana overtook a fading Bryan
Bronson in the final 30 meters Saturday to win the 400-meter
hurdles at the IAAF Grand Prix Finals and deny the American a share
of the dlrs 1 million Golden League jackpot.
	   Diagana, the world champion, finished in 48.30 seconds and ended
Bronson's 17-race winning streak at the distance. Bronson lost
steam coming off the next-to-last hurdle and struggled home in
sixth place in 48.94.
	   Dinsdale Morgan was second in 48.60, with Samuel Matete third in
48.73.
	   Bronson barely edged Diagana in a photo finish at Berlin Tuesday
to keep alive his shot at the jackpot, which is split among
athletes who win their event at all six Golden League meets plus
the Grand Prix Final.
	   Diagana picked up dlrs 50,000 for his victory and earned some
satisfaction after tripping in the semifinals at the European
Championships last month.
	   ``It was tough for Bronson, because seven races are a lot to
have to win,'' Diagana said. ``It feels good to win a Grand Prix
Final and the season this way. It's also some consolation for the
Europeans.''
	   With Bronson out of contention, Marion Jones, Hicham El Guerrouj
and Haile Gebrselassie were left to aim for the big prize in later
events.
	   Meanwhile, Hungary's Tibor Gecsek was a surprise winner of the
men's hammer toss with a top effort of 81.21 meters (266 feet, 5
1/2 inches). Olympic champion Balazs Kiss was second with 79.71
(261-6), while world titlist Heinz Weis finished a disappointing
seventh.
	   Gete Wami, a former world cross country champion, won the
women's 3,000 meters in 8 minutes, 40.11 seconds, surging past
Zohra Ouaziz in the final stretch.
	   Jones was on the verge of perfection at the refurbished Luzhniki
Olympic Stadium.
	   The American had won all 33 events she entered this year before
competing in the 100 meters and long jump Saturday and led Russian
middle-distance runner Svetlana Masterkova 88-83 in the women Grand
Prix standings.
	   The 100 world champion has been particularly dominant in that
event, turning in eight of the year's 10 fastest times. Florence
Griffith Joyner _ whose world record of 10.49 seconds in 1988 was
once thought untouchable _ is the only woman to run faster than the
10.71 Jones has clocked twice.
	   El Guerrouj (1,500) and Gebrselassie (3,000) also arrived in
Moscow unbeaten in their specialties.
	   A total of 17 reigning Olympic or world champions were
competing, putting aside concerns about security or the impropriety
of competing for huge prizes in a country gripped by an economic
and political crisis.
	   Bronson and El Guerrouj were among about 50 athletes who signed
a petition last week urging the International Amateur Athletic
Federation to switch venues. But with extra security ensured, most
competitors showed.
	   Of the big-name qualifiers for the Finals, only sprinters
Michael Johnson, Maurice Greene and Ato Boldon withdrew, for what
the IAAF said were personal reasons.

Loren isolated in convalescence in New York, husband says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ Sophia Loren's doctors have her under such
close care that she wasn't allowed to tape or telephone her thanks
for a Venice Film Festival award _ and even her own husband hasn't
been allowed to see her, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   ``The doctors are inflexible: Sophia must not become emotional,
must not speak of anything that would remind her of work,''
producer-husband Carlo Ponti was quoted as saying in an interview
with Corriere della Sera daily.
	   The Italian-born actress, 63, fell ill on an Aug. 10 flight from
Geneva to New York; in New York, she was diagnosed as having an
irregular heartbeat and hospitalized for a few days, aides and
family members said.
	   Ponti read a message from Loren on Thursday in Venice, thanking
the festival for its lifetime achievement award.
	   Organizers had hoped that Loren would be allowed to send a
greeting by video or live by telephone, Mauro Miccio was quoted as
telling Corriere della Sera.
	   ``Nothing doing,'' Miccio reportedly told the paper. ``The
doctors didn't want it _ she was to rest.''
	   Loren's doctor has mandated at least a month of rest in New
York, Ponti said. He was headed there from the festival, after a
stop in New York.
	   Once there, he said, ``I really hope that they'll let me see
her.''

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Maltese voted Saturday for a new
parliament in what was widely seen as a referendum on whether to
anchor their tiny island nation more solidly in Europe.
	   The election pitted Prime Minister Alfred Sant's Labor
government, which froze Valletta's bid for European Union
membership shortly after taking office in 1996, against Nationalist
leader Eddie Fenech Adami, Sant's predecessor, who pushed for
Malta's entry into the EU fold.
	   First results of the hand-counting of the written ballots were
expected Sunday evening at the earliest. In Malta, a one or
two-seat majority in the 65-member parliament is not unusual, and
given traditionally close margins of victory, exit polls haven't
caught on here.
	   Maltese are very passionate over their politics, and turnout
among the 278,000 eligible voters was expected to run close to the
96 percent figure of 1996.
	   Sant called the election three years early in hope of
strengthening his government, which was rocked by ministerial
resignations and the defection on key votes by ex-premier Dom
Mintoff.
	   Shortly after Labor's 1996 victory ended a nine-year run by the
arch-rival Nationalists, Sant froze the EU bid, which had been
favorably reviewed by Brussels in 1993.
	   Waiting to vote near the waterfront in the capital's historic
center, worker John Chircop said he was thinking of his three young
children before casting his ballot.
	   If the Nationalists win, ``we'll have the opportunity to go
everywhere in Europe'' to look for jobs, said Chircop, a crane
operator at a container port. Sant ``doesn't know where he's
going,'' added Chircop. ``For us, it's very good'' to join the
European Union.
	   Others thought Sant would come out stronger, despite widespread
grumbling over sharply higher utility rates raised by the
government as a budget-paring measure.
	   ``It will be better'' for Sant after the vote, said Lino Cauchi,
walking his dog up one of Valletta's steep streets.
	   Sant, a 50-year-old Harvard Business School graduate management
consultant, has advocated a free-trade agreement with the EU but
insisted Malta isn't ready to make the sacrifices that Brussels
demands.
	   Maltese industries enjoy heavy goverment protection, and the
extensive state sector helps keep unemployment low, at 4 percent.
	   Fenech Adami contended that freezing the EU bid has scared away
badly needed foreign investors.
	   One familiar name was missing from the ballots. Mintoff, 82, was
not running for a seat for the first time in 53 years. The former
Labor premier is largely remembered abroad for his staunchly
pro-Libyan stance.
	   But under Sant, relations with Libya, a major investor in Malta,
were more low key. Diplomats said the Sant government recently
urged the Libyan envoy here to push Tripoli to agree to a
U.S.-British proposal to have a Scottish court in the Netherlands
try two Libyans suspected in the 1988 Pan Am bombing.

Explosion in Dagestan kills 17 people, injures dozens

	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ A car bomb probably caused an
explosion that killed at least 17 people, including two children,
and gouged a five-meter (15-foot) crater in a street in the capital
of a restive southern Russian region, officials said Saturday.
	   At least 80 people were injured in the Friday night explosion
and more than half remained in hospitals, according to the press
office of the regional administration of Dagestan.
	   The death toll was 17 as of Saturday afternoon, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said, citing the Emergency Situations Ministry. The
casualty toll was expected to rise, as NTV television said about
100 people were trapped in the rubble.
	   The Emergency Situations Ministry initially said the explosion
was caused by an artillery shell fired from an eastern suburb of
the Dagestan capital of Makhachkala.
	   But the local administration said Saturday that shards of glass
and metal fragments found in the bodies suggested a car bomb.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, which the
Dagestani government called ``a monstrous act of terrorism,''
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin blamed ``the criminal
world,'' according to the Interfax news agency. ``Actually, they
have declared war on us, and we accept it,'' he said.
	   Dagestan has been wracked by violence and kidnappings in recent
months as various religious and ethnic groups battle for power. It
has also been hit by spillover violence from breakaway Chechnya, on
its western border. A car bomb recently killed Dagestan's top
Islamic leader.
	   Friday's explosion occurred outside the local television center
on the street where Dagestan's prime minister, Khizri Shikhsaidov,
and Makhachkala Mayor Said Amirov live. Neither was hurt.
	   Shikhsaidov's motorcade had passed by the site only minutes
before the explosion, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, quoting
Dagestan's Interior Ministry.
	   Local TV commentator Angela Mamadibirova said the attack was
believed to be an attempt on Amirov's life. She said he has
survived 10 assassination attempts this year.
	   Later, television reporters speculated that the explosion had
been intended to destroy the television center. The TV building was
badly damaged, and 40 percent of its equipment destroyed, the
television report said.
	   A building housing an agricultural institute and 10 buildings
nearby were also damaged, the Interfax news agency said. Many
students living in a dormitory at the institute were injured by
glass shards, local television said.
	   Fifteen homes where 142 people lived were destroyed, reduced to
a pile of bricks, wood and twisted metal pipes. Fires caused by
broken gas pipes broke out in several houses.
	   The explosion left a crater 5 meters (16-1/2 feet) wide and 3
meters (nearly 10 feet) deep.
	   Rescuers with sniffer dogs, including airborne troops and
specially trained Emergency Situations Ministry workers flown in
from Moscow, searched for more victims on Saturday. Heavy rain
hampered their efforts.
	   The regional government declared Saturday and Sunday to be days
of mourning.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait has bought 157 fuel stations in Belgium
from British Petroleum, raising the number of stations it owns in
that European country to 340, Al-Watan daily reported Saturday.
	   A spokesman for the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp. told the
newspaper the sale will be effective Oct. 1, but he did not say how
much the deal was worth.
	   All 150 employees who worked at the stations will now become the
employees of Kuwait Petroleum International, said the spokesman,
who was not identified. KPI is a KPC subsidiary that runs more than
5,100 fuel stations in Europe and Asia.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has stopped importing beef from the
Netherlands because of fears of ``mad cow'' disease, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Saturday.
	   The decision was announced Friday by Iran's ambassador to the
Netherlands, Shamsedin Khareqani, following reports of a fresh
outbreak of the disease in the Netherlands, the agency said.
	   Mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
has been linked to the fatal human ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Investments in five economic sectors rose
32 percent to 345.2 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 485.5 million)
between January and September of this year as compared to the same
time period in 1997.
	   The Investment Promotion Corp. said Saturday the money was spent
on 150 projects in industry, agriculture, maritime and railway
transport, hospitals and hotels.
	   Foreign investment amounted to 19 percent of the money spent,
the corporation said in a report obtained by The Associated Press.
	   Muntasser Uqlah, IPC's director, attributed the increase to
growing confidence in the Jordanian economy and to an investment
law enacted three years ago.
	   The law provides incentives such as tax exemptions to encourage
investment in economic sectors that have long been monopolized by
the state. It also allows foreigners equal ownership rights.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Iraqi government and Iraqi businessmen
own 657 firms in Jordan with a total capital of 38.6 million
Jordanian dinars (dlrs 54.3 million), the Jordanian Ministry of
Trade and Industry said Saturday.
	   The ministry said 30.3 million dinars (dlrs 42.7 million) were
spent on setting up 536 Iraqi firms in Jordan in 1991 after the
Gulf War, which ended Baghdad's occupation of Kuwait.
	   Some 7 million dinars (dlrs 10 million) were invested in Jordan
during the 1988 Iran-Iran War. The rest has been invested in Jordan
since 1991.
	   The Iraqi investment is mostly in transportation,
pharmaceuticals, food and vegetable oil.
	   Jordan has been accused of harboring firms acting as front
companies for Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Many of those firms,
however, were placed under government scrutiny and ultimately
closed under pressure from the United States and Europe.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former President Suharto's children
won't flee the country to avoid being investigated for fraud, says
Probosutedjo, the ex-leader's half-brother.
	   Probosutedjo was quoted Saturday by the daily Media Indonesia as
saying that business competitors were trying to hide their own
crimes by blaming the Suharto children.
	   Indonesian police plan to interrogate Bambang Trihatmodjo,
Suharto's second son and head of one of the country's
conglomerates, on charges of misappropriating funds at the troubled
Andromeda bank, which he partly owns.
	   Andromeda is one of 14 insolvent banks liquidated in April, when
Suharto was still in power.
	   Probosutedjo said the police warrant was inconsistent with
government policy, because the chief of the armed forces, Gen.
Wiranto, has guaranteed security for the ex-president and his
family.
	   Probosutedjo also blamed Suharto's successor, President B.J.
Habibie, for Indonesia's food shortages, saying the the government
failed to anticipate the situation and allowed unemployment to
widen.
	   Suharto resigned in May amid widespread student-led protests
against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   He was allegedly showering his family and friends with
privileges that allowed them to become rich and influential. He has
three sons and three daughters.
	   Suharto's own enterprises are being investigated, and the
government recently disclosed that there were indications that
charities set up and controlled by Suharto have misused their
funds.
	   Critics have alleged that funds from the charities were funneled
into companies owned by his family.
	   Habibie, is a longtime friend of Suharto, but is under pressure
to wipe out corruption and nepotism that flourished under his
predecessor's reign.

Protestant party agrees to meeting IRA ally; new Omagh fatality

 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with main Protestant party votes for Sinn Fein
meeting; background latest Omagh fatality &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Clinton-Ireland

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The main Protestant party on
Saturday agreed to its leader meeting Gerry Adams, president of the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, paving the way for an encounter of huge
symbolic significance and a new landmark in the peace process.
	   The vote by the 110-member executive committee of the Ulster
Unionist Party came as U.S. President Bill Clinton, winding up a
tour of both parts of Ireland, hailed the negotiated peace in this
British province as a shining example to people around the globe.
	   Executive committee member Dermott Nesbitt said a meeting
between Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and Adams was part of
the ``natural progress'' in the peace process. He said there were
no dissenting votes.
	   Trimble, who is First Minister in Northern Ireland's new
assembly, sat in the same room as Adams during negotiations which
led to the deal this year, but refused to speak to him.
	   Nesbitt said that meeting the leader of the Irish Republican
Army's political ally was something ``the First Minister will be
doing.''
	   ``There is nothing untoward, unnatural or unexpected about
that,'' Nesbitt told reporters after the closed door party meeting.
	   Trimble has already invited Adams and all the other party
leaders in the assembly to a meeting on Monday. The face-to-face
meeting alone with Adams is expected later next week.
	   Earlier, the terrorist car bombing of Omagh, already the most
deadly atrocity in the 30-year history of Northern Ireland's
conflict, claimed a 29th life.
	   Sean McGrath, 61, retired owner of a bakery business, died in
Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital 21 days after IRA dissidents
detonated their bomb amid workers, shoppers and Spanish tourists in
the religiously mixed town of Omagh.
	   ``This just highlights the fact that the suffering in far from
over,'' said William Thompson, an Ulster Unionist lawmaker in
Omagh.
	   ``The visits of famous people have come and gone. The people
will now be trying to get back to normality and that will probably
be the most difficult time of all,'' added Thompson.
	   On Thursday, Clinton and his wife, Hillary, paid respects to the
dead and wounded in a visit to the bomb-shattered center of Omagh.

African presidents fly to Libya, violating U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Three African presidents flew to Libya on
Saturday, breaking a U.N. embargo against the north African
country, Libyan television reported.
	   Presidents Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of Niger, Alpha Oumar Konare
of Mali and Idriss Deby of Chad landed at the airport of the
capital, Tripoli, in planes that had flown ``in the face of the
embargo,'' the state-run television reported.
	   It was the second time in eight weeks that Mainassara and Deby
had violated the air embargo which the U.N. Security Council
imposed on Libya in 1992.
	   Mainassara flew directly from Niger to Tripoli while Deby and
Konare traveled together from the Chadian capital of N'djamena,
said the television, which ran live broadcasts of their arrivals.
	   The three presidents were invited to attend the ceremony late
Saturday marking the 30th anniversary of the bloodless coup that
brought Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to power.
	   The Security Council imposed the embargo in a bid to force Libya
to hand over for trial two suspects wanted for the 1988 bombing of
an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270
people.
	   Libya has refused to extradite the suspects on grounds that they
would not receive a fair trial in the United States or Britain.
	   Last month, Washington and London persuaded the Security Council
to endorse a compromise solution by which the trial would be held
in the Netherlands with Scottish judges and under Scottish law.
	   Libya has accepted the deal, but Gadhafi has insisted on further
negotiations to provide ``guarantees'' for the suspects' safe
custody and fair trial. Washington and London say the offer is
non-negotiable.
	   The Organization of African Unity announced at its June summit
that it will no longer respect the embargo on Libya.
	   In July, Mainassara, Deby and four other African leaders
violated the sanctions to attend an Islamic prayer ceremony in
Al-Bayda, northeast Libya, marking the birth of the Prophet
Mohammed.
	   Deby violated the sanctions again in August to check on
Gadhafi's health after the Libyan leader underwent a hip operation.

Palestinians attack ambulance, spark clashes with Israeli troops

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian residents of a refugee camp outside
of Jerusalem threw firebombs and rocks Saturday at an Israeli
ambulance and its police escort called to the neighborhood to treat
a heart attack patient.
	   The violence sparked clashes between a handful of Palestinians
and Israeli troops. Five Israeli policemen and six Palestinians
were hurt in the melee, Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby
said.
	   Israel's main ambulance service, Magen David Adom, treats
Palestinians living under Israeli rule, but will only enter
Palestinian areas with a police escort because they are often
attacked by residents there.

With Russian crisis mounting, president and parliament seek deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES with Chernomyrdin quotes, CHANGES
byline. &QL;

 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's economy crumbling by the day,
President Boris Yeltsin's allies and opponents scrambled to forge a
weekend compromise that will install a prime minister to deal with
the worsening crisis.
	   Yeltsin dismissed the previous government Aug. 23 as the economy
began its latest nose dive, and acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin has focused his energies on winning confirmation from
a hostile parliament.
	   The Communists and other hard-line opponents said Saturday they
had as many as nine alternatives to Chernomyrdin for the prime
minister's post, including several Soviet-era bureaucrats.
Communist Party leaders plan face-to-face talks Monday with Yeltsin
before voting on Chernomyrdin's candidacy.
	   ``I don't expect anything good from Mr. Yeltsin'' on Monday,
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov told The Associated Press
on Saturday. ``He rarely meets (with lawmakers and) he doesn't know
the situation. He is not governing.''
	   The Communist-dominated parliament overwhelmingly rejected
Chernomyrdin last Monday and postponed a second vote on Friday. The
move suggested the Communists were open to negotiations, though
they maintained their tough rhetoric.
	   Zyuganov and his hard-line allies blame Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin
for creating Russia's current predicament.
	   The Russian ruble, which was trading at about 6 to the U.S.
dollar (16 cents each) just last month, was down to around 18 to
the dollar (5.5 cents) in street trading, and has yet to stabilize.
	   The crisis has not sparked unrest, but prices have soared and
some Russians are buying extra supplies out of fear that the prices
will continue skyrocket, as they did in the early 1990s.
	   At one supermarket in central Moscow, shoppers were buying up
coffee, spaghetti, flour and other food that can be stored for
months. Most shelves were bare.
	   ``I don't think everything will disappear, but stores will be
out of one thing, then another,'' said Ivan Naumov, a travel agency
manager. ``I have no time to run around the city looking for
things.''
	   Like many of the Russians, Naumov said he was trying to buy as
many goods as possible now because many people expect prices to
leap upward when stores get in new inventories.
	   Because the ruble has been falling daily, Naumov was exchanging
just enough dollars to cover his ruble purchases for the day. He
didn't want any rubles left in his pocket because they are losing
their value so quickly.
	   Hoping to ease the crisis, Chernomyrdin outlined a vague and
somewhat contradictory economic program Friday.
	   He said he intended to let the ruble exchange rate float against
the dollar, but also entertained the notion of a government
currency board that would set the rate.
	   He said the government might start printing more money to pay
workers who have gone months without their salaries _ but also said
their would be tight controls on the money supply.
	   ``This is a program which will require tight discipline and
responsibility,'' Chernomyrdin said in an interview broadcast on
Russian television Saturday. ``But this is also a program which
will alleviate a great deal of social problems.''
	   Chernomyrdin was prime minister for more than five years until
he was dismissed in March, a period during which Russia suffered a
wrenching economic decline as it moved to a market economy. Few
Russians believe that he will fare better this time around.
	   ``The Yeltsin-Chernomyrdin couple ... are distrusted by 9 out of
10 people now,'' Zyuganov said. ``By the end of September they will
be distrusted by 98 out of 100 people. They have no assets, no
resources, no brains, no will ... They have nothing.''
	   Meanwhile, the leader of the Communist-allied Agrarian Party
said the opposition candidates for prime minister include Vladimir
Gerashchenko, whose favorite response to economic problems as
Central Bank chairman in the Soviet era was to print more money,
and Yuri Maslyukov, former head of the Soviet state planning
agency.
	   But Yeltsin has said he will nominate no one other than
Chernomyrdin.
	   Under the constitution, Yeltsin has three chances to propose a
prime ministerial candidate. If parliament votes ``no'' three
times, the president must disband the legislature and call new
elections, a development that add to the current turmoil.

President urges Irish to stand by peace pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATE with Clinton playing golf, minor editing &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMERICK, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton appealed to the
Irish people Saturday to reject ``enemies of peace'' who would
undercut the accord ending violence in Northern Ireland. ``Do not
let them break your will,'' he told an enthusiastic turnout of
flag-waving admirers.
	   In a passionate, rallying speech to crowds clogging O'Connell
Street, Clinton said Ireland's negotiated peace makes it a shining
example for peoples everywhere, from Rwanda to the Middle East to
Kosovo.
	   ``Because of what you have done in Ireland in 1998 you have made
it possible for me ... to tell every warring, feuding, hating group
of people trapped in the prison of their past conflicts to look at
Ireland and know there can be a better day,'' he said.
	   Clinton was winding up a six-day European trip with Irish
applause ringing in his ears but the lengthening shadow of the
Monica Lewinsky affair awaiting him back home.
	   His role in pushing Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland toward a peaceful accommodation has earned him plaudits. It
was marked Saturday with a scroll presented on behalf of the
universities of Ireland praising his ``critical contributions'' to
peace.
	   The people of Limerick, who turned out a crowd of 20,000 or more
on this rainy morning that turned to sun for Clinton, also gave him
a certificate of freedom.
	   But Clinton said the major credit for progress belonged to the
people in the north and in the republic who voted for the accord
reached last April to set up a new assembly and spur sectarian
reconciliation.
	   ``The demons of the past are losing their power to divide you,''
he said. ``This is you at your best. Do not let them break your
will.''
	   On the stage he shared with his wife, Hillary, and Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern, winds buffeted a tall wall of bulletproof
glass that left exposed only the small lectern where Clinton
delivered his remarks.
	   After speaking, the president shook hands with many of the
hundreds of people pressing up against metal barricades. Clinton
leaned far over the barrier to reach outstretched hands and Secret
Service agents supported him by clinging to his belt.
	   Later, he played golf at Ballybunion before he was to return to
a Washington bound up by the controversy over his affair with the
White House intern and increasingly critical of the president's
behavior. Except for a fund-raising trip to Florida on Wednesday,
Clinton will be at the White House in the coming week, his conduct
and contrition a national obsession.
	   New trouble also loomed overseas.
	   Tensions between Iran and Afghanistan have increased in recent
days after Tehran massed more than 70,000 elite troops at the
border to conduct military exercises. The maneuvers are apparently
directed against Afghanistan where, according to Tehran, the ruling
Taliban militia is holding four dozen Iranians, including several
diplomats who are feared dead.
	   But, for the present, Clinton basked in the promise of peace.
	   ``Three years ago in Dublin, I promised the people of Ireland
that as long as Ireland walks the road of peace, America will walk
with you. You have more than kept your part of the deal and we will
keep ours,'' Clinton said.
	   To wit, the U.S.-based Dell Computer Corp. announced plans to
create a dlrs 90 million facility and add 1,700 jobs in the
southwestern city. Dell also said it was donating computers to the
schools of Omagh, Northern Ireland, where an Aug. 15 car bombing _
the worst terrorist attack in the province's 30 years of violence _
claimed its 29th victim on Saturday.
	   Sean McGrath, 61, died in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital.
	   ``As we mourn the losses of Omagh, remember there will still be
efforts by the enemies of peace to break your will, to get you to
turn back, to get you to lose your faith,'' Clinton exhorted.
``Don't do it. Don't do it.''

Proposed peace overture to ETA gets cool reception in Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's government and mainstream parties
reacted coolly Saturday to a Socialist Party call for the prime
minister to make a peace overture to the Basque extremist group
ETA.
	   Socialist Party chairman Joaquin Almunia proposed Friday that
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar set a deadline for ETA's
separatists to benefit from a program offering reduced jail terms
in exchange for laying down weapons and renouncing terrorism.
	   Almunia said Aznar should convene a special summit of political
parties to formulate what Almunia called a joint ``peace offer'' to
ETA. He gave no details, saying his party needed to talk to the
government and other parties first.
	   Reacting Saturday, the government accused the Socialists of
acting out of turn, saying two political forums on how to end
political violence in the Basque country already existed. One is
among parties represented in the Basque parliament, the other among
those in the national legislature.
	   ``All initiatives unveiled publicly and unilaterally are doomed
to failure,'' Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said.
	   But he did not reject the Socialist appeal outright. ``If Mr.
Almunia is trying to say with this proposal that we as democratic
parties should talk more thoroughly, I agree.''
	   The ruling Popular Party and the moderate Basque Nationalist
Party also said the Socialist proposal added nothing new to efforts
to bring peace to the troubled Basque region of northern Spain.
	   ``We do not need to make up new forums, we need to carry through
with the ones we already have,'' the head of the Popular Party's
Basque branch, Carlos Iturgaiz, said in Bilbao.
	   Almunia's move appeared aimed at seizing back the initiative
from Basque nationalist parties that are maneuvering furiously in
the run-up to Basque regional elections on October 25.
	   ETA's legal political wing, for instance, Herri Batasuna,
changed its name on Thursday and said it was incorporating a
broader cross-section of Basque society, including church and labor
groups, to boost its electoral appeal. The new name is Euskal
Herritarrok, which means Basque People.
	   And the Basque Nationalist Party has broken with other parties
in the region by holding talks with ETA's political wing in a bid
to wrest a ceasefire from the armed separatists.
	   ETA, a Basque-language acronym that stands for Basque Homeland
and freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in an independence drive
that began in the late 1960s under the dictator Gen. Francisco
Franco.
	   The Socialist government of then Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
held secret negotiations with ETA in Algiers in 1987 but the talks
went nowhere.
	   ETA's most recent attack was on June 25 of this year when it
killed a Popular Party town councilor in the Basque country, the
sixth such politician to die in ETA in 1998.
	   Moderate Basque nationalists say this lull in violence is a de
facto ceasefire brought about by the talks with ETA's political
wing and that the truce will soon be formalized into an open-ended
ceasefire.
	   But the government says ETA is simply regrouping after a series
of successful raids against ETA commando groups and has no plans to
stop killing.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Condemning ``horrendous'' killings
of Kosovo's civilians, America's top human rights official said
Saturday he is collecting evidence of atrocities for investigation
by the U.N. war crimes tribunal.
	   ``We are going to gather information and provide it to the
authorities at the ... tribunal, so they will further investigate
and prosecute'' suspects, said John Shattuck, assistant secretary
of state for human rights.
	   His announcement marked a new international attempt to contain
the six-month conflict that has killed hundreds and made refugees
of an estimated 265,000 Kosovo civilians, mostly Albanians.
	   Militant Albanians in the Serbian province are fighting for
independence but are losing to the vastly better-equipped police of
Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic, and the Yugoslav army.
	   ``All ... violations of international humanitarian law in Kosovo
should be fully investigated and prosecuted'' Shattuck told
reporters. ``The horrendous killing and shelling of civilians must
stop.''
	   The U.N. tribunal's prosecution of war criminals in Bosnia has
kept attention on atrocities in that conflict long after they were
committed. It has also sent a message that war criminals will be
held accountable for their actions.
	   Still, top suspects Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the
former Bosnian Serb political and military leaders, remain at
large. Serbia has refused to hand over the two and is even less
likely to do so for suspects in Kosovo, an integral part of the
Serbian state.
	   Yugoslavia's constitution bars extraditing Yugoslav citizens to
a foreign country.
	   Shattuck said his message was directed to both sides of the
conflict. Serbian authorities last week announced that Albanian
militants had killed dozens of Serb civilians and burned their
remains in a remote village southwest of Pristina.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army and the province's Albanian human
rights organizations disputed the claim. Overall, most civilian
casualties have been ethnic Albanian villagers shelled and shot in
what Serbian authorities say are collateral victims in their hunt
for ``terrorists.''
	   Additionally, scores of villages have been burned after their
inhabitants fled. Tens of thousands of refugees are camped out in
the open, afraid to return home. Humanitarian officials warn of
mass deaths by the time winter comes, unless they can return and
rebuild.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has said returning
villagers have nothing to fear. Serbian police took Associated
Press television to an area about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southwest of Pristina on Saturday and ordered hundreds of refugees
to move closer to an abandoned village in an effort to reinforce
that message.
	   But many villagers tell foreign reporters of renewed shelling if
they try to go home.
	   The conflict has also resulted in scores of missing on both
sides. Former Sen. Bob Dole arrived Saturday as head of the
non-governmental International Commission for Missing Persons to
investigate.
	   The refugees' plight is generating increasing offers of aid from
foreign countries. On Friday, Hugh Q. Parmer of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, pledged dlrs 23 million in U.S.
emergency food aid.
	   European Union members are also reportedly trying to put
together a relief plan for Kosovo. The crisis is expected to figure
prominently this weekend during a meeting of EU foreign ministers
in the Austrian city of Salzburg.
	   Under pressure from America and Europe, both Milosevic and
moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have agreed in
principle to a formula granting self-rule to the province.
	   The agreement would be reviewed in three to five years. Although
the arrangement falls short of Albanian demands for independence,
Rugova has promised to try to convince KLA hardliners to accept it.
	   But Western diplomats say the deal could take months to finalize
even with goodwill on both sides, taking the refugees into winter.

African presidents fly to Libya, violating U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sudanese president's violation; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Four African presidents flew to Libya on
Saturday, breaking a U.N. embargo against the north African
country, Libyan television reported.
	   Presidents Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of Niger, Alpha Oumar Konare
of Mali, Idriss Deby of Chad and Omar el-Bashir of Sudan landed at
the airport of the capital, Tripoli, in planes that had flown ``in
the face of the embargo,'' the state-run television reported.
	   It was the second time in eight weeks that Mainassara and Deby
had violated the air embargo which the U.N. Security Council
imposed on Libya in 1992.
	   Mainassara flew directly from Niger to Tripoli, el-Bashir from
the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, while Deby and Konare traveled
together from the Chadian capital of N'djamena, said the
television, which ran live broadcasts of their arrivals.
	   The four presidents were invited to attend a ceremony late
Saturday marking the 30th anniversary of the bloodless coup that
brought Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to power.
	   The Security Council imposed the embargo in a bid to force Libya
to hand over for trial two suspects wanted for the 1988 bombing of
an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270
people.
	   Libya has refused to extradite the suspects on grounds that they
would not receive a fair trial in the United States or Britain.
	   Last month, Washington and London persuaded the Security Council
to endorse a compromise solution by which the trial would be held
in the Netherlands with Scottish judges and under Scottish law.
	   Libya has accepted the deal, but Gadhafi has insisted on further
negotiations to provide ``guarantees'' for the suspects' safe
custody and fair trial. Washington and London say the offer is
non-negotiable.
	   The Organization of African Unity announced at its June summit
that it will no longer respect the embargo on Libya.
	   In July, Mainassara, Deby and four other African leaders
violated the sanctions to attend an Islamic prayer ceremony in
Al-Bayda, northeast Libya, marking the birth of the Prophet
Mohammed.
	   Deby violated the sanctions again in August to check on
Gadhafi's health after the Libyan leader underwent a hip operation.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tatsuya Shindo batted in a tie-breaking run on a
sacrifice fly in the eighth inning Friday as the Central League's
front-running Yokohama BayStars came from behind to beat the
Chunichi Dragons 3-2 at Nagoya.
	   Pinch hitter Takanori Suzuki singled in a run in the seventh to
give the BayStars a 2-2 tie.
	   The BayStars now have a four-game lead over the second-place
Dragons.
	   At Toyama, Kozo Shoda batted in the winning run in the bottom of
the ninth to lift the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 4-3 over the Hanshin
Tigers.
	   Kenjiro Nomura hit a solo homer, his 12th this season, in the
sixth and drove in another run in the seventh.
	   At Jingu, Shinichi Murata singled home two runs in the top of
the eighth inning as the Yomiuri Giants beat the Yakult swallows
5-3.
	   Toshihisa Nishi cracked a solo homer in the third. He has seven
homers this season.
	   In the Pacific League, Koichi Oshima drove in two runs on a
single in the top of the second inning at Tokyo Dome as the Orix
BlueWave thrashed the first-place Nippon Ham Fighters 9-0 for their
eighth victory in a row.
	   BlueWave starter Koichi Takahashi gave up five hits, walked five
and struck out two over six-plus innings as he picked up his first
win this season. The Fighters are now only two games ahead of the
BlueWave.
	   At Chiba, Kenji Morozumi drove in three runs with a clutch
two-out double in the bottom of the seventh inning as the Chiba
Lotte Marines beat the Kintetsu Buffaloes 9-6 at home.
	   The Buffaloes' five-run attack in the eighth inning came too
late to reverse the game.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, Nobuhiko Matsunaka cracked two two-run homers,
his first and second home runs in his pro baseball career, as the
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks beat the Seibu Lions at home.
	   With Saturday's victory, Hawks are tied with Buffaloes in third
place.
	   Hawks starter Kazuhiro Takeda went the distance as threw a
six-hitter, struck out two and walked two for his league-leading
12th win.

Relieved passengers on diverted Canadian charter arrive in
</HEADLINE>
Scotland &QL; 
 &UR; With Swiss Air Crash

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Passengers on a Canadian charter jet
which made an unscheduled landing within 36 hours of a Swissair
plane crashing off the coast of Canada arrived Saturday _ late,
relieved, and on a replacement aircraft.
	   ``It was all very tense when we could smell something like
plastic burning and we knew we had to make an emergency landing _
especially after the Swiss flight crash which weighed on all our
minds,'' said Liz French, 39, from Glasgow.
	   ``There was pandemonium and hysterical kids on the plane, but
the cabin crew did very well and everything was cleared away in two
minutes flat,'' added Ms. French.
	   The Royal Airlines plane en route from Toronto to Glasgow with
225 people aboard made the unscheduled landing at Goose Bay
airforce base, about 500 miles (800 kms) from where the Swissair
jet plunged into the sea, killing all 229 aboard.
	   Royal Air, based in Montreal, said the pilot had noticed low oil
and high temperature levels in one of the two engines, but there
was no significant problem.
	   However, there was no way that , once safely on the ground
again, the passengers were getting back into the place.
	   ``Everyone on the plane smelt the smoke and when the crash
procedures were put in place it was very scary, but the pilot and
all the staff did very well,'' said Sandra Gray, a Scot now living
in Toronto.
	   ``''The only problem once we had landed was that we refused to
go back on the same plane, but as soon as Royal realized they
provided other planes.''
	   Another passenger, John Taylor, of Ottawa, said he was sitting
near the front and smelled smoke.
	   ``We were treated like a million dollars at the airforce base,''
he added.

El Guerrouj wins GP Final for big payday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with El Guerrouj, Jones wins, other results. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ World champion Hicham El Guerrouj guaranteed
himself at least a half-million dollars Saturday by dominating the
1,500 meters at the IAAF Grand Prix Finals.
	   The Moroccan, who set the world record in July, ran alone for
the final lap in clocking 3 minutes, 32.03 seconds _ a full second
better than runner-up Noah Ngeny. El Guerrouj crossed the line with
his arms extended and jumped into the arms of his coach.
	   He picked up no less than a third of the dlrs 1 million Golden
League jackpot, plus dlrs 200,000 as overall men's Grand Prix
champion and 50,000 for winning his race on the sport's single
biggest payday.
	   Marion Jones (100 meters)and Haile Gebrselassie (3,000 meters)
had shots at splitting the jackpot, which is for athletes who win
their event at all six Golden League meets plus the Grand Prix
Final.
	   The only other person in contention for the big prize heading to
Moscow was Bryan Bronson, but the American faded to sixth in the
400 hurdles Saturday as France's Stephane Diagana won.
	   Diagana, the world champion, finished in 48.30 seconds and ended
Bronson's 17-race winning streak at the distance. Bronson lost
steam coming off the next-to-last hurdle and struggled home in
sixth place in 48.94. Dinsdale Morgan was second in 48.60, with
Samuel Matete third in 48.73.
	   Bronson barely edged Diagana in a photo finish at Berlin Tuesday
to keep alive his shot at the jackpot.
	   Diagana picked up dlrs 50,000 for his victory and earned some
satisfaction after tripping in the semifinals at the European
Championships last month.
	   ``It was tough for Bronson, because seven races are a lot to
have to win,'' Diagana said. ``It feels good to win a Grand Prix
Final and the season this way. It's also some consolation for the
Europeans.''
	   Elsewhere, Russia's Natalya Sadova won the women's discus with a
season-best effort of 68.50 meters (224 feet, 9 inches). World
champion Beatrice Faumuina was fourth.
	   Hungary's Tibor Gecsek was a surprise winner of the men's hammer
toss with a top effort of 81.21 meters (266 feet, 5 inches).
Olympic champion Balazs Kiss was second with 79.71 (261-6), while
world titlist Heinz Weis finished a disappointing seventh.
	   Britain's Mark Richardson won the men's 400 in 44.88 seconds.
World and Olympic champion Michael Johnson, citing fatigue, was not
entered.
	   Gete Wami, a former world cross country champion, won the
women's 3,000 meters in 8 minutes, 40.11 seconds, surging past
Zohra Ouaziz in the final stretch, Michelle Freeman led from the
start in taking the women's 100 hurdles in 12.56, and Falilat
Ogunkoya captured the women's 400 in 49.73.
	   Jones was on the verge of perfection at the refurbished Luzhniki
Olympic Stadium.
	   The American won the long jump _ her second-best event and not
part of the Golden League series _ Saturday with a top effort of
7.13 meters (23-4 3/4) to give her victories in all 34 events she's
entered this year.
	   Later Saturday, Jones was to line up for the 100 meters. A win
would give her a share of the dlrs 1 million prize and the women's
overall Grand Prix title.
	   The world champion has been particularly dominant in the 100,
turning in eight of the year's 10 fastest times. Florence Griffith
Joyner _ whose world record of 10.49 seconds in 1988 was once
thought untouchable _ is the only woman to run faster than the
10.71 Jones has clocked twice.
	   A total of 17 reigning Olympic or world champions were
competing, putting aside concerns about security or the impropriety
of competing for huge prizes in a country gripped by an economic
and political crisis.
	   Bronson and El Guerrouj were among about 50 athletes who signed
a petition last week urging the International Amateur Athletic
Federation to switch venues. But with extra security ensured, most
competitors showed.
	   Of the big-name qualifiers for the Finals, only Johnson, Maurice
Greene and Ato Boldon withdrew, for what the IAAF said were
personal reasons.

European Union analyzes Russian economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) - The European Union says there is little
point in throwing money into the bottomless pit of the Russian
economic crisis, but EU foreign ministers meeting here will press
Moscow to move quickly with political reforms.
	   ``We do not want a return to communism and a command economy in
Russia,'' said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, arriving in
Salzburg Saturday for a two-day meeting of the EU's 15 foreign
ministers.
	   ``Russia is going through stormy times. We must not turn away
from Russia now that the weather is turning bad,'' he said.
	   What the EU can do, said Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg
Petersen, ``is demonstrate our very active interest in what happens
in Russia.''
	   ``Stability in Europe ... must be built with Russia,'' Petersen
said. ``But Russia has to sort out its own problems. It would not
be advisable for the EU to sort out Russians problems.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called a meeting in London
next week of officials from the world's biggest industrial powers,
known as the G-7, a British spokesman in London said Saturday. That
involves the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy
and Japan.
	   Blair decided on the meeting after consulting President Bill
Clinton in Northern Ireland this week. The principal aim of the
meeting is to be ready to respond quickly when the new Russian
government is formed, a spokesman at the prime minister's office
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The message we are getting across to the Russians, and that we
have agreed among ourselves, is that we are ready to help, but that
all international assistance must be conditional on further
economic reform or it does not make sense,'' the spokesman told The
Associated Press.
	   A German official here said the EU plans to send a delegation to
Moscow next week. The ``troika,'' as the EU calls the envoys, will
represent Britain, Austria and Germany, the past, present and
future presidents of the EU, and will show the EU's political
support for Moscow.
	   Comfortable in the fact that Russia represents only 4 percent of
the 15-nation EU's overall trade, the Europeans can afford to be
cautious in their approach to the crisis in Moscow. In the EU view,
there is no point in doling out great amounts of financial aid
before resolving the political problems.
	   ``We must be careful not to rush and take action for action for
action's sake, as long as the government situation in Moscow is not
clear,'' Kinkel said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin is in a desperate struggle with the
Russian Parliament over his nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin as
prime minister, a job from which he was sacked just last spring.
But, as the ruble continues to sink and the economy totters, the
Parliament is resisting Yeltsin.
	   EU governments have granted dlrs 1.6 billion in development aid
programs to Russia since 1991. The European Commission suggests
these be ``retargeted'' to focus on areas crucial to reform of the
economy such as know-how in restructuring companies and developing
sound banking laws.
	   The other major topic before the foreign ministers in their
two-day session is Kosovo, the southern Yugoslav province
struggling for independence.
	   Under pressure from the Americans and Europeans, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova have agreed in principle to a formula granting self-rule to
the majority Albanian province.
	   The agreement would be reviewed in three to five years. Although
the arrangement falls short of Albanian demands for independence,
Rugova has promised to try to convince hardliners to accept it.
	   ``Swift and efficient action is required if a humanitarian
catastrophe is to be avoided during the winter,'' said Austrian
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Scheussel.

Khatami, newspapers condemn assault on senior Iranian officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian President Mohammad Khatami ordered
the police and judicial authorities Saturday to swiftly bring to
justice the militants who assaulted a deputy president and a
Cabinet minister.
	   Some 80 hard-liners chanting ``Death to liberals!'' scuffled
Friday with Deputy President Abdollah Nouri and Culture Minister
Ataollah Mohajerani as each of them left Tehran University after
prayers.
	   In a statement broadcast on national radio and television,
Khatami said the authorities should ``spare no effort against the
ugly behavior of a small group of people who are grudgingly opposed
to the establishment of freedom and justice.''
	   The president called on the authorities to ``teach a lesson to
the violators of the law, who, because of ignorance or in pursuance
of their missions, understand only the language of force.''
	   The militants knocked off Nouri's white cleric's turban, tore
open Mohajerani's shirt and slapped both officials in the face.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Saturday that
both men, who are close allies of Khatami, were ``in good
condition.''
	   Khatami also urged the judiciary, a stronghold of the
hard-liners within the ruling hierarchy, to cooperate in bringing
the assailants to justice.
	   Vigilantes suspected of acting on orders from hard-line
officials have often resorted to violence to intimidate opponents
and try to derail the reforms of Khatami, a moderate who has
liberalized political debate and relaxed the Islamic social code
since taking office in August 1997.
	   However, Friday's incident was the first time that militants
have attacked people of Cabinet rank. Furthermore, it is rare for a
clergyman, even a controversial one such as Nouri, to be physically
assaulted in Iran.
	   Nouri was interior minister until hard-line legislators
impeached him in June for allowing political demonstrations and
relaxing the dress code.
	   The Expediency Council, a body that settles political and
legislative disputes, condemned the beatings. Its chairman, former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, called for the culprits to be
punished quickly.
	   The moderate newspaper Iran News warned that if such attacks
were not dealt with severely, ``the enemies of the Islamic Republic
will rejoice.''
	   Another moderate newspaper, Ruznameh Zan, said it had received
unconfirmed reports that a senior intelligence officer wearing
plain clothes and dark glasses observed the assaults from the back
of the crowd. The report suggested the attacks were orchestrated by
senior hard-line officials.

African presidents fly to Libya, violating U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Four African presidents flew to Libya on
Saturday, breaking a U.N. embargo on the north African country,
Libyan television reported.
	   Presidents Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of Niger, Alpha Oumar Konare
of Mali, Idriss Deby of Chad and Omar el-Bashir of Sudan landed in
the capital, Tripoli, in planes that had flown ``in the face of the
embargo,'' state-run television reported.
	   It was the second time in eight weeks that Mainassara and Deby
had violated the air embargo which the U.N. Security Council
imposed on Libya in 1992.
	   The four presidents were invited to attend a ceremony later
Saturday to mark the 30th anniversary of the bloodless coup that
brought Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to power.
	   The Security Council imposed the embargo in a bid to force Libya
to hand over two suspects wanted for the 1988 bombing of an
American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Libya has refused to extradite the suspects on grounds that they
would not receive a fair trial in the United States or Britain.
	   Last month, Washington and London persuaded the Security Council
to endorse a compromise in which the trial would be held in the
Netherlands with Scottish judges and under Scottish law.
	   Libya has accepted the deal, but Gadhafi has insisted on further
negotiations to provide ``guarantees'' for the suspects' safe
custody and fair trial. Washington and London say the offer is
non-negotiable.
	   The Organization of African Unity announced at its June summit
that it will no longer respect the embargo on Libya.

	   ORVIETO, Italy (AP) _ A 3-feet-long (1 meter) chunk of mosaic
fell without warning Saturday from Ovieto's painstakingly restored
medieval duomo, smashing to bits on the pavement 160 feet (50
meters) below.
	   Tourists ran to try to collect pieces as souvenirs, Italy's ANSA
news service reported. Police blocked off the church plaza to await
the arrival of restoration experts from Rome, 60 miles to the
south.
	   The gold mosaic broke off a work in the center of the dome
showing the coronation of the Virgin Mary. The accident laid bare a
3-feet by 2-feet (1 meter by 0.5 meter) patch, just above the heads
of 10 angels looking on at the coronation.
	   ``Fortunately, the figures of the angels are just below _ they
remain in their place,'' the duomo's Rev. Italo Mattia said.
	   Started in 1290, the Romanesque-Gothic Duomo was completed more
than a century later. The 20th century has been a rough one for it:
In 1997, the same earthquake that hit the Basilica of St. Francis
in Assisi shook loose marble and statues on its sumptuous main
facade _ just years after a major restoration.

Church roof collapses, killing at least 21 people in Brazil

<TEXT>
	   OSASCO, Brazil (AP) _ A church roof collapsed during services in
a Brazilian town Saturday, killing at least 21 people and injuring
500 more, firefighters said.
	   A congregation of 1,300 was in the church in Osasco, 9 miles (15
kms) southwest of Sao Paulo, when the roof came crashing down,
firefighter Fabio Leite said.
	   ``We are not sure why the roof collapsed. We know the building
was over 40 years old and used to house a cinema,'' Leite said.
	   Twenty-one people were killed immediately and more may have died
since, he said. About 500 people are being treated for injuries,
some serious, at seven hospitals.
	   The accident was at the Universal do Reino de Deus church
(Universal Church of the Kingdom of God), in a mixed residential
and business district, Leite said.
	   The evangelical place of worship is part of a network of
churches of the same name across Brazil and Latin America.
	   Forty-eighty members of firefighting crews helped pull bodies
from the rubble and assist survivors, Leite said.

Unpaid wages, rising prices deepen Russian's quiet desperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TULA, Russia (AP) _ Taisa Yevmanenko hadn't been paid in 11
months, but she kept on working. Weeks of seeing the ruble fall and
prices soar were too much for her dignity, so she left her factory
for the picket line.
	   ``We get dribs and drabs so we don't starve to death,'' she said
inside the tent before the Tula government building that has been
her home for the last two weeks. ``We're tired of being trampled
and oppressed.''
	   The combination of chronically unpaid wages and mass
unemployment in industrial cities like Tula, compounded by the
plunging ruble and rising prices, are eroding Russians' ability to
endure further hardship.
	   So far only a few protesters have joined the picket line, but
the quiet desperation of the people of Tula, an old city 200
kilometers (120 miles) south of Moscow, runs deep.
	   ``We can't go down any farther. We have to get up, but there is
no way,'' said Valentin Ponamarev, who oversees economic planning
for the city. ``If things don't change, people will be out in the
streets, and I'll join them.''
	   Visiting Tula is like taking a trip back in time to a poorer,
more run- down Soviet Union. The prosperity that has come to Moscow
has not reached this industrial city of 580,000 on the Upa River.
	   There are some modern shops and a couple of banks, but much of
the commerce is carried out on the streets, in kiosks, sidewalks or
markets scattered throughout the city.
	   Apartments in working-class neighborhoods are decaying, and the
streets are lined with half-finished buildings begun in the flush
of reforms. Even Tula's water supply is suffering.
	   ``Our water is terrible. Ten years ago, you could drink water
from the tap. Now you can't even take a bath in it,'' Ponamarev
said.
	   The Soviet-era proletariat that could rely on full employment
and a secure retirement now lives in a state of anxiety and
bewilderment.
	   At least 70,000 people have lost their jobs because of economic
reforms introduced in 1992. Industrial production has virtually
collapsed, and the government hasn't paid for state orders for the
last several years.
	   Even the local vodka factory is only working at only 25 percent
capacity.
	   ``The situation is very critical,'' Ponamarev said.
``Unemployment is a colossal problem. Federal policies give us no
optimism. Fighting inflation and making the ruble convertible just
made things worse.''
	   City officials haven't been paid for three months, teachers for
the last three to four months and some factory workers in Tula
haven't seen a full month's pay in a year.
	   Most Tula residents had learned to cope with the problem of
unpaid wages, but the devaluation of the ruble on Aug. 17 and the
prices increases that followed stirred up a deep well of resentment
and old fears of shortages.
	   Unemployed workers and miners have placed a straw dummy of
President Boris Yeltsin _ a couple of apples in his arms and a
bottle of vodka in his hand _ across a railway track laid in front
of the government building.
	   Several red Soviet flags flaunting the golden hammer and sickle
fly in front of the makeshift tents where the demonstrators sleep
at night.
	   ``Capitalism _ Dung. Zionism _ Dung,'' read one poster.
``President, get a cold and die,'' said another. ``Socialism or
death,'' and ``If you vote, you lose,'' said others.
	   Pro-communist sentiment is not surprising in Tula.
	   The governor is Vasily Starodubstev, a hard-liner and former
head of a party representing workers on collective farms. He spent
time in jail as one of the coup plotters against then-Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
	   But even Yeltsin's supporters are turning against him.
	   Dmitry Dzurtsev Irbek, 42, said he was a defender of the White
House, the former Russian parliament building where Yeltsin stood
up to the hard-liners who tried to overthrow Gorbachev in 1991.
	   Now Dzurtsev Irbek wears the button of the radical Russian Labor
movement.
	   ``I wanted reforms. I wanted to be a farmer. I waited, and
waited, but there were no reforms,'' said the unemployed coal
miner. The politicians are criminals. Except for imports, there are
no reforms.''
	   But like local officials, the protesters don't really have much
of an idea about how to right the economy. And they don't know when
_ or whether _ more workers will join them.
	   ``I don't want to go back to the old system,'' said Taisa
Yevmanenko, who worked in a defense factory for 30 years. ``I want
the government to make sure the reforms are carried out for the
people.''
	   Out in the ``Proletariat District'' just off Metallurgy Street,
the mood was grimmer than usual. Men with nothing to do stood
around on the streets, hoping for jobs that never came.
	   On a street corner, dozens of women lined up with plastic bags
to buy flour before the price went up. Sugar was in great demand
because this is the time of year for making jam and compote from
apples and pears.
	   Zoya Mikhailova was selling pears from her garden for 2 rubles
(about 11 U.S. cents) a kilo (2.2 pounds). At that rate she needs
to sell 11 kilos (22 pounds) of pears to buy one package of chicken
legs, which she uses to make soup stock.
	   Nobody in Tula expects life to get better soon.
	   ``In Moscow, the politicians see what's happening,'' said
Vladimir Matveyev, Tula's deputy mayor. ``But they don't do
anything about it.'

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Urawa Reds again gave up no goals as they beat
Verdy Kawasaki 3-0 Saturday, staying atop the second-stage table on
goal difference in the professional Japan-League.
	   Aitor Beguiristain from Spain scored the winner in the 44th
minute, striking the ball after Shinji Ono's shot rebounded off the
crossbar. Yasushi Fukunaga and Italian defender Giuseppe Zappella
added goals for Urawa's winning cause in the second half.
	   Brazilian Bentinho scored twice before the interval as Kashiwa
Reysol edged Yokohama Flugels 2-1 and kept the pace with Urawa on
points also with a 3-0 record.
	   Yokohama Marinos remained one point behind the leaders with a
3-2 victory over Vissel Kobe.
	   Elsewhere, Masanobu Matsunami headed home his first goal of the

President Clerides rejects Ecevit demand to recognize division
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
rejected a fresh Turkish demand Saturday for a confederal solution
to the island's division.
	   Turkey's Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit said on arrival earlier
Saturday in the Turkish-occupied north of Cyprus that this week's
Turkish Cypriot proposal of a confederation of two states should
not be turned down.
	   ``It is the last chance to eliminate the perpetual division of
the island,'' Ecevit told the Turkish Cypriot news agency, TAK.
	   Arriving on the other side of the U.N.-patroled demilitarized
zone, Clerides dismissed Ecevit's remark.
	   ``Mr Ecevit repeated his well-known stand that the Cyprus
problem has been solved by the 1974 Turkish invasion and occupation
of north Cyprus. Then why are we negotiating?'' Clerides told
reporters on his return from the Nonaligned Movement summit in
South Africa.
	   ``The U.N. Security Council says we must negotiate to reach a
mutually acceptable settlement. Does Mr Ecevit believe we will ever
accept the result of the invasion?'' Clerides added.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974 in
the wake of a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Turkish Cypriots have set up a breakaway state. Its independence
is recognized only by Ankara which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Ecevit, who was prime minister of Turkey in 1974, told the
private Turkish NTV television that ``for Turks and the Turkish
Cypriots the Cyprus problem has been resolved.''
	   The Cypriot government, with the support of the five permanent
members of the Security Council, rejects any proposal that would
consolidate the island's division.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hicham El Guerrouj and Haile Gebrselassie wrapped
up undefeated outdoor seasons Saturday and claimed shares of the
dlrs 1 million Golden League jackpot by dominating their events at
the IAAF Grand Prix Finals.
	   Morocco's El Guerrouj, who set the world record in July, ran
alone for the final lap of the 1,500 meters in clocking 3 minutes,
32.03 seconds _ six seconds off his best but a full second better
than runner-up Noah Ngeny.
	   The world champion crossed the line with his arms extended and
jumped into the arms of his coach. He picked up no less than a
third of the jackpot, plus dlrs 200,000 as overall men's Grand Prix
champion and 50,000 for winning his race on the sport's single
biggest payday.
	   Gebrselassie also had little trouble in capturing the 3,000
meters in a relatively slow 7:50.00 on a cool and overcast
afternoon at the refurbished Luzhniki Olympic Stadium. Luke
Kipkosgei, the only athlete to threaten the Ethiopian's preeminance
at the longer distances this season, was second in 7:50.87.
	   Gebrselassie has 20 straight outdoor wins and set world records
for the 5,000 and 10,000 (in which he's the world and Olympic
champion) within a two-week span in June.
	   Marion Jones (100 meters) had a later shot at splitting the
jackpot, which is for athletes who win their event at all six
Golden League meets plus the Grand Prix Final.
	   The only other person in contention for the big prize heading to
Moscow was Bryan Bronson, but the American faded to sixth in the
400 hurdles Saturday as France's Stephane Diagana won.
	   Diagana, the world champion, finished in 48.30 seconds and ended
Bronson's 17-race winning streak at the distance. Bronson lost
steam coming off the next-to-last hurdle and struggled home in
sixth place in 48.94. Dinsdale Morgan was second in 48.60, with
Samuel Matete third in 48.73.
	   Bronson barely edged Diagana in a photo finish at Berlin Tuesday
to keep alive his shot at the jackpot.
	   Diagana picked up dlrs 50,000 for his victory and earned some
satisfaction after tripping in the semifinals at the European
Championships last month.
	   ``It was tough for Bronson, because seven races are a lot to
have to win,'' Diagana said. ``It feels good to win a Grand Prix
Final and the season this way. It's also some consolation for the
Europeans.''
	   Elsewhere, Russia's Natalya Sadova won the women's discus with a
season-best effort of 68.50 meters (224 feet, 9 inches). World
champion Beatrice Faumuina was fourth.
	   Hungary's Tibor Gecsek was a surprise winner of the men's hammer
toss with a top effort of 81.21 meters (266 feet, 5 inches).
Olympic champion Balazs Kiss was second with 79.71 (261-6), while
world titlist Heinz Weis finished a disappointing seventh.
	   Veteran Frankie Fredericks took the men's 100 in 10.10 seconds,
edging Obadele Thompson by one one-hundredth of a second.
	   Britain's Mark Richardson won the men's 400 in 44.88 seconds.
World and Olympic champion Michael Johnson, citing fatigue, did not
enter.
	   Gete Wami, a former world cross country champion, won the
women's 3,000 meters in 8 minutes, 40.11 seconds, surging past
Zohra Ouaziz in the final stretch, Michelle Freeman led from the
start in taking the women's 100 hurdles in 12.56, and Falilat
Ogunkoya captured the women's 400 in 49.73.
	   Jones won the long jump _ her second-best event and not part of
the Golden League series _ Saturday with a top effort of 7.13
meters (23-4 3/4) to give her victories in all 34 events she's
entered this year.
	   Later Saturday, Jones was to line up for the 100 meters. A win
would give her a share of the dlrs 1 million prize and the women's
overall Grand Prix title.
	   The world champion has been particularly dominant in the 100,
turning in eight of the year's 10 fastest times. Florence Griffith
Joyner _ whose world record of 10.49 seconds in 1988 was once
thought untouchable _ is the only woman to run faster than the
10.71 Jones has clocked twice.
	   A total of 17 reigning Olympic or world champions were
competing, putting aside concerns about security or the impropriety
of competing for huge prizes in a country gripped by an economic
and political crisis.
	   Bronson and El Guerrouj were among about 50 athletes who signed
a petition last week urging the International Amateur Athletic
Federation to switch venues. But with extra security ensured, most
competitors showed.
	   Of the big-name qualifiers for the Finals, only Johnson, Maurice
Greene and Ato Boldon withdrew, for what the IAAF said were
personal reasons.

<TEXT>
	   LIMERICK, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton appealed to the
Irish people Saturday to reject ``enemies of peace'' who would
undercut the accord ending violence in Northern Ireland. ``Do not
let them break your will,'' he told an enthusiastic turnout of
flag-waving admirers.
	   In a passionate, rallying speech to crowds clogging O'Connell
Street, Clinton said Ireland's negotiated peace makes it a shining
example for peoples everywhere, from Rwanda to the Middle East to
Kosovo.
	   ``Because of what you have done in Ireland in 1998 you have made
it possible for me ... to tell every warring, feuding, hating group
of people trapped in the prison of their past conflicts to look at
Ireland and know there can be a better day,'' he said.
	   Clinton was winding up a six-day European trip with Irish
applause ringing in his ears but the lengthening shadow of the
Monica Lewinsky affair awaiting him back home.
	   His role in pushing Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland toward a peaceful accommodation has earned him plaudits. It
was marked Saturday with a scroll presented on behalf of the
universities of Ireland praising his ``critical contributions'' to
peace.
	   The people of Limerick, who turned out a crowd of 20,000 or more
on this rainy morning that turned to sun for Clinton, also gave him
a certificate of freedom.
	   But Clinton said the major credit for progress belonged to the
people in the north and in the republic who voted for the accord
reached last April to set up a new assembly and spur sectarian
reconciliation.
	   ``The demons of the past are losing their power to divide you,''
he said. ``This is you at your best. Do not let them break your
will.''
	   On the stage he shared with his wife, Hillary, and Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern, winds buffeted a tall wall of bulletproof
glass that left exposed only the small lectern where Clinton
delivered his remarks.
	   After speaking, the president shook hands with many of the
hundreds of people pressing up against metal barricades. Clinton
leaned far over the barrier to reach outstretched hands and Secret
Service agents supported him by clinging to his belt.
	   Later, he played golf at Ballybunion before he was to return to
a Washington bound up by the controversy over his affair with the
White House intern and increasingly critical of the president's
behavior. Except for a fund-raising trip to Florida on Wednesday,
Clinton will be at the White House in the coming week, his conduct
and contrition a national obsession.
	   New trouble also loomed overseas.
	   Tensions between Iran and Afghanistan have increased in recent
days after Tehran massed more than 70,000 elite troops at the
border to conduct military exercises. The maneuvers are apparently
directed against Afghanistan where, according to Tehran, the ruling
Taliban militia is holding four dozen Iranians, including several
diplomats who are feared dead.
	   But, for the present, Clinton basked in the promise of peace.
	   ``Three years ago in Dublin, I promised the people of Ireland
that as long as Ireland walks the road of peace, America will walk
with you. You have more than kept your part of the deal and we will
keep ours,'' Clinton said.
	   To wit, the U.S.-based Dell Computer Corp. announced plans to
create a dlrs 90 million facility and add 1,700 jobs in the
southwestern city. Dell also said it was donating computers to the
schools of Omagh, Northern Ireland, where an Aug. 15 car bombing _
the worst terrorist attack in the province's 30 years of violence _
claimed its 29th victim on Saturday.
	   Sean McGrath, 61, died in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital.
	   ``As we mourn the losses of Omagh, remember there will still be
efforts by the enemies of peace to break your will, to get you to
turn back, to get you to lose your faith,'' Clinton exhorted.
``Don't do it. Don't do it.''

North Korea reelects Kim Jong Il head of state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with details
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Kim Jong Il was elevated to the
``highest post of the state'' Saturday, given greatly expanded
powers as the head of communist North Korea's 1.1-million strong
military.
	   Kim had been expected to be named president of the belligerant,
Marxist state, but instead North Korea's newly elected parliament
enhanced his existing role, and that of the military, as the
country's central authority.
	   The Supreme People's Assembly reelected Kim as chairman of the
National Defense Commission, a post he has held since 1993, but
boosted the power of the position with a constitutional amendment.
	   It is ``the highest post of the state with which to organize and
lead the work of defending the state system ... and increasing the
defense capabilities of the country and the state power as a whole
through command over all the political, military and economic
forces,'' the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.
	   That effectively completed a long process to enthrone Kim as the
North's supreme leader, replacing his father, longtime President
Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994 at age 82. Theirs is the first
hereditary succession of power in a communist state.
	   The previous highest post, state president, was apparently
abolished or will be left vacant permanently as a sign of respect
for Kim's late father, analysts said.
	   Kim has been running the country since his father's death as
chairman of the ruling Workers' Party and head of the military, the
world's fifth largest and the backbone of the reclusive regime,
analysts said.
	   ``This marks the North's growing emphasis on the military,''
said Kim Doo-hwan, a chief analyst at Seoul's Naewoe Press, which
monitors North Korean news media. ``We see a shift into what we
might call a military state.''
	   Naewoe Press is run by South Korea's intelligence agency.
	   Kim's reelection as chairman of the National Defense Commission
was a ``token of absolute support for and deep trust in him by all
the people and servicemen,'' KCNA said.
	   The North Korean parliament also elected Hong Song Nam, 74, as
premier. Hong, a Czech-educated engineer, has been acting premier
since 1997, replacing the sick Kang Song San.
	   The list of new Cabinet members was not immediately available.
	   Also elected were the heads of the assembly and its presidium as
well as the prosecutor general and the chief justice.
	   In a rare public appearance, Kim attended the assembly session
but was not reported to have made a speech.
	   His ascension to power comes amid growing international concern
over North Korea's missile capabilities.
	   On the eve of Kim's election, North Korea launched what it
called a scientific satellite. But U.S. and Japanese defense
officials said the launch was the test firing of a two-stage Taepo
Dong 1 ballistic missile that sailed over northern Japan and
crashed into the Pacific Ocean.
	   Whether a missile or satellite, analysts said, it showed a
worrisome increase in North Korea's missile capability as well as
its brinksmanship diplomacy.
	   ``The launch shows Kim will play hard ball in dealing with the
United States,'' said Chon Hyun-joon, an analyst at Seoul's
state-funded Research Institute of National Unification. ``He will
use the military threats to extract more economic concessions from
Washington.''
	   Kim takes over an isolated, impoverished country dependent on
outside aid to feed its 24 million people.

U.S. official warns that Kosovo war criminals will be prosecuted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Condemning ``horrendous'' killings
of Kosovo's civilians, America's top human rights official said
Saturday that he is collecting evidence of atrocities for an
investigation by the U.N. war crimes tribunal.
	   ``We are going to gather information and provide it to the
authorities at the ... tribunal, so they will further investigate
and prosecute'' suspects, said John Shattuck, assistant U.S.
secretary of state for human rights.
	   His announcement marked a new international attempt to contain
the six-month conflict that has killed hundreds and made refugees
of an estimated 265,000 Kosovo civilians, mostly ethnic Albanians.
	   Militant ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province are fighting
for independence but are losing to the vastly better-equipped
police of Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic, and the Yugoslav
army.
	   ``All ... violations of international humanitarian law in Kosovo
should be fully investigated and prosecuted'' Shattuck said. ``The
horrendous killing and shelling of civilians must stop.''
	   The U.N. tribunal's prosecution of war criminals in Bosnia has
kept attention on atrocities in that conflict long after they were
committed. It has also sent a message that war criminals will be
held accountable for their actions.
	   Still, top suspects Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the
former Bosnian Serb political and military leaders, remain at
large. Serbia has refused to hand them over and is even less likely
to do so for suspects in Kosovo, an integral part of the Serbian
state.
	   Yugoslavia's constitution bars extradition of Yugoslav citizens
to any foreign country.
	   Shattuck said his message was directed at both sides in Kosovo.
Serbian authorities last week announced that ethnic Albanian
militants had killed dozens of Serb civilians and burned their
remains in a remote village southwest of Pristina.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army and the province's ethnic Albanian
human rights organizations denied the claim.
	   Overall, most civilian casualties have been ethnic Albanian
villagers shelled and shot. Serbian authorities call them
collateral victims in their hunt for ``terrorists.''
	   The conflict has also resulted in scores of missing on both
sides. Former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole arrived Saturday as head of the
non-governmental International Commission for Missing Persons to
investigate their plight.
	   Additionally, scores of villages have been burned after their
inhabitants fled. Tens of thousands of refugees are camped out in
the open, afraid to return home. Humanitarian officials warn of
mass deaths by the time winter comes, unless refugees can return
and rebuild.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has said that returning
villagers have nothing to fear. Serbian police took Associated
Press Television to an area about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southwest of Pristina on Saturday and ordered hundreds of refugees
to move closer to an abandoned village in an effort to reinforce
that message.
	   But many villagers tell foreign reporters of renewed shelling if
they try to go home.
	   The refugees' situation is generating increasing offers of aid
from foreign countries. On Friday, Hugh Q. Parmer of the U.S.
Agency for International Development pledged dlrs 23 million in
U.S. emergency food aid.
	   European Union members are also reportedly trying to put
together a relief plan. The crisis is expected to figure
prominently this weekend at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in
the Austrian city of Salzburg.
	   Under pressure from America and Europe, both Milosevic and
moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova have agreed in
principle to a formula granting self-rule to the province. The
agreement would be reviewed in three to five years. Although the
arrangement falls short of Albanian demands for independence,
Rugova has promised to try to convince hard-liners to accept it.
	   But Western diplomats say the deal could take months to finalize
even with goodwill on both sides, taking the refugees into winter.

Ruling coalition to support the cabinet's economic reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Shaken by the crisis in Russia,
leaders of the ruling coalition affirmed their commitment Saturday
to economic reforms despite threats by the ethnic Hungarian party
to bolt over the contentious education issue.
	   Following the joint declaration, the Romanian Cabinet met in an
unusual Saturday session and agreed to budget cuts for five
ministries _ health, education, defense, culture and research _
totalling the equivalent of dlrs 843 million.
	   The Cabinet is expected to take other measures soon including
tax increases on cars, real estate, tobacco and alcohol, officials
said. The cuts and tax increases are subject to parliamentary
approval.
	   Leaders of the four ruling parties met Friday night with
President Emil Constantinescu, who urged them to carry on market
reforms and end the political bickering which has stagnated the
government for months.
	   Early Saturday, the parties issued a statement declaring that at
a time when ``several countries around Romania'' face ``economic,
financial and political crises,'' the government must ``assure the
country real political stability.''
	   The statement included each ministry's priorities for the next
six months in an effort to carry through privatization, market
reforms, social policies and fight corruption.
	   One of the four parties, the Hungarian Democratic Union, said it
would support the economic reform program. But the HDU, which
represents Romania's 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians, said it would
decide later whether to back other government programs.
	   The party leader, Bela Marko, was meeting Saturday with other
HDU figures in Cluj, 325 kilometers (203 miles) northwest of
Bucharest, to decide whether to withdraw from the coalition.
	   On Thursday, Marko said the party, which controls 36 of the 486
seats in the national assembly, was ``withdrawing support'' for the
government to protest a decision by a parliamentary committee to
scrap plans for a Hungarian language university.
	   The announcement meant the Hungarian party no longer felt
obliged to vote with its coalition partners on every issue.
	   The other major coalition parties prefer a ``multicultural''
university open to all ethnic minorities.
	   Marko, considered a moderate, is under pressure from nationalist
hardliners in the party to take a strong stand in defense of what
they consider Hungarian rights.

Stork triggers short-circuit, and scare, for Spanish farm minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALMERIA, Spain (AP) _ A stork triggered a short-circuit that
sent an electrical cable falling onto two cars in a motorcade
carrying Spain's Agriculture Minister Loyola de Palacio on
Saturday. The minister was not injured, officials said.
	   The stork caused the mess by flying into a high-voltage wire
that stretches over a road leading to the airport in this southern
town, the state news agency Efe said.
	   The cable draped down onto the road, hitting four passing cars.
Two were in the government motorcade, but it was not known if de
Palacio was in either of them. The four cars suffered minor damage.

European Union analyzes Russian economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with fresh quotes, TRIM. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ The European Union says there is little
point in throwing money into the bottomless pit of the Russian
economic crisis, but EU foreign ministers meeting here will press
Moscow to move quickly with political reforms.
	   ``We do not want a return to communism and a command economy in
Russia,'' said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, arriving in
Salzburg on Saturday for a two-day meeting of the EU's 15 foreign
ministers.
	   ``Russia is going through stormy times. We must not turn away
from Russia now that the weather is turning bad,'' he said.
	   What the EU can do, said Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg
Petersen, ``is demonstrate our very active interest in what happens
in Russia.''
	   ``Stability in Europe ... must be built with Russia,'' Petersen
said. ``But Russia has to sort out its own problems. It would not
be advisable for the EU to sort out Russians' problems.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called a meeting on Russia
in London next week of officials from the world's biggest
industrial powers, known as the G-7, a British spokesman in London
said Saturday. That is the United States, Canada, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy and Japan.
	   A German official in Salzburg said the EU plans to send a
delegation to Moscow next week. The ``troika,'' as the EU calls the
envoys, will represent Britain, Austria and Germany, the past,
present and future presidents of the EU, and will show the EU's
political support for Moscow.
	   Comfortable in the fact that Russia represents only 4 percent of
the 15-nation EU's overall trade, the Europeans can afford to be
cautious.
	   ``We must be careful not to rush and take action for action for
action's sake, as long as the government situation in Moscow is not
clear,'' Kinkel said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin is struggling with the Russian
parliament over his nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime
minister, a job from which he was sacked just last spring. As the
ruble continues to sink and the economy totters, parliament is
resisting Yeltsin.
	   EU governments have granted dlrs 1.6 billion in development aid
programs to Russia since 1991. The European Commission suggests
these be ``retargeted'' to focus on areas crucial to economic
reform, such as know-how in restructuring companies and developing
sound banking laws.
	   The other major topic before the foreign ministers in their
two-day session is Kosovo, the southern Yugoslav province
struggling for independence.
	   Under pressure from the Americans and Europeans, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and moderate ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova have agreed in principle to a formula granting
self-rule to the majority Albanian province. Although the
arrangement falls short of Albanian demands for independence,
Rugova has promised to try to convince hard-liners to accept it.

French govt ready to reduce 50 percent stake in Arianespace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French government is ready to cut its 50
percent stake in Arianespace, which commercializes the European
satellite launcher, in an effort to meet growing competition, the
newspaper Le Monde reported Saturday.
	   Gerard Brachet, head of the National Center for Space Studies,
known as the CNES, gave the green light Friday, according to Le
Monde, saying the company is ready to bring down its 32.2 percent
stake in Arianespace to about 20 percent.
	   The French state's holdings in Arianespace are through
state-owned agencies, led by the CNES.
	   Such a sale would open the way for European industrial groups to
raise their participation in Arianespace. Among them are France's
Aerospatiale, the German Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA) and the
Italian Fiat Avio and Finmeccanica. They are among some 40
shareholders from a dozen European countries.
	   Shifting from state-control to industrial logic is aimed at
enabling Arianespace to meet growing competition from the United
States, Russia and China.
	   According to Le Monde, intensified competition means Arianespace
must reduce by 50 percent launch costs of the Ariane-5 series
rocket, the most powerful of the unmanned rockets in the program.
	   Arianespace is leader in satellite launches with a 60 percent
share of the world market.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four Russian soldiers seized 24 hostages Saturday
in a remote northern region and demanded to be flown to the
troubled southern republic of Dagestan, a news agency reported.
	   Interfax said the soldiers, believed to be from Dagestan, seized
17 students, six teachers and a principal from a school in Novaya
Zemlya, an island in the Barents Sea about 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) north of Moscow.
	   The group was reported to be en route to a military airport by
bus. No other details were immediately available.
	   The incident occurred the day after an explosion apparently
caused by a car bomb killed at least 17 people, including two
children, in the capital of Dagestan. There was no indication the
hostage-taking was related.
	   Desertion and violence have become relatively commonplace in the
Russian military as it grapples with severe economic and morale
problems.

Hutu rebels storm western prison, free 3,000 inmates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels attacked a prison in western
Rwanda and freed about 3,000 inmates suspected of involvement in
the 1994 genocide, authorities said Saturday.
	   Details were sketchy, but authorities in Kibuye, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) west of capital Kigali, said a group of
rebels on Friday overpowered the guards at Kivumu prison and set
people free.
	   Most of the inmates who had escaped returned voluntarily to the
prison by Saturday, officials said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The inmates were apparently afraid of army reprisals if
associated with the rebels.
	   No other details were immediately available.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for the 1994 Hutu government-organized slaughter of more than
500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994 and ended the
killing. But rebels continued to launch attacks from their hideouts
in neighboring Congo, targeting road convoys, Tutsi genocide
survivors and Hutus suspected of collaborating with the
authorities.
	   Thousands of people are thought to have died since.
	   Rwandan prisons are crowded with about 130,000 people awaiting
genocide trials. The rebels often target prisons hoping to mobilize
the inmates _ most of whom Hutus _ into their ranks.
	   Popular support for the rebels among the majority Hutu
population appears to be declining and the rebels are increasingly
turning against Hutus who refuse to provide them with money, food
and shelter.
	   The jailbreak is the most serious incident in Rwanda since the
insurgents in eastern Congo, who include ethnic Tutsis, took
control of the east of the country Aug. 2 which the Hutu rebels
used as their rear base.

Jones caps unbeaten season with six-figure payday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jones victory in dash. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Marion Jones capped an undefeated season and
pocketed over dlrs 600,000 Saturday by winning the 100 meters and
the long jump at the IAAF Grand Prix Finals.
	   The American pulled away after a slow start in the 100 and
clocked 10.83 seconds to beat runner-up Sevatheda Fynes by more
than a quarter-second _ a lifetime in the dash.
	   That victory gave Jones a third of the dlrs 1 million Golden
League jackpot, in addition to dlrs 200,000 for the women's overall
Grand Prix title and dlrs 50,000 for the race win. She got another
50,000 for taking the long jump with a top leap of 7.13 meters
(23-4 3-4).
	   She won all 35 events she entered in 1998, which includes 60-
and 200-meter races.
	   Jones split the jackpot _ for athletes who win their events at
all six Golden League meets plus the GP Finals _ with Hicham El
Guerrouj and Haile Gebrselassie, who also stayed unbeaten for the
year with dominating wins.
	   Morocco's El Guerrouj ran alone for the final lap of the 1,500
meters in clocking 3 minutes, 32.03 seconds _ six seconds off his
best but a full second better than runner-up Noah Ngeny. The world
champion and record holder crossed the line with his arms extended
and jumped into the arms of his coach. He wrapped up the men's
overall Grand Prix title.
	   Gebrselassie also had little trouble in capturing the 3,000
meters in a relatively slow 7:50.00 on a cool and overcast
afternoon at the refurbished Luzhniki Olympic Stadium. Luke
Kipkosgei, the only athlete to threaten the Ethiopian's preeminance
at the longer distances this season, was second in 7:50.87.
	   Gebrselassie has 20 straight outdoor wins and set world records
for the 5,000 and 10,000 (in which he's the world and Olympic
champion) within a two-week span in June.
	   The only other person in contention for the big prize heading to
Moscow was Bryan Bronson, but the American faded to sixth in the
400 hurdles Saturday as France's Stephane Diagana won.
	   Diagana, the world champion, finished in 48.30 seconds and ended
Bronson's 17-race winning streak at the distance. Bronson lost
steam coming off the next-to-last hurdle and struggled home in
sixth place in 48.94. Dinsdale Morgan was second in 48.60, with
Samuel Matete third in 48.73.
	   Bronson barely edged Diagana in a photo finish at Berlin Tuesday
to keep alive his shot at the jackpot.
	   Diagana picked up dlrs 50,000 for his victory and earned some
satisfaction after tripping in the semifinals at the European
Championships last month.
	   ``It was tough for Bronson, because seven races are a lot to
have to win,'' Diagana said. ``It feels good to win a Grand Prix
Final and the season this way. It's also some consolation for the
Europeans.''
	   Elsewhere, Russia's Natalya Sadova won the women's discus with a
season-best effort of 68.50 meters (224 feet, 9 inches). World
champion Beatrice Faumuina was fourth.
	   Hungary's Tibor Gecsek was a surprise winner of the men's hammer
toss with a top effort of 81.21 meters (266 feet, 5 inches).
Olympic champion Balazs Kiss was second with 79.71 (261-6), while
world titlist Heinz Weis finished a disappointing seventh.
	   Veteran Frankie Fredericks took the men's 100 in 10.10 seconds,
edging Obadele Thompson by one one-hundredth of a second.
	   Britain's Mark Richardson won the men's 400 in 44.88 seconds.
World and Olympic champion Michael Johnson, citing fatigue, did not
enter.
	   Gete Wami, a former world cross country champion, won the
women's 3,000 meters in 8 minutes, 40.11 seconds, surging past
Zohra Ouaziz in the final stretch, Michelle Freeman led from the
start in taking the women's 100 hurdles in 12.56, and Falilat
Ogunkoya captured the women's 400 in 49.73.
	   A total of 17 reigning Olympic or world champions competed,
putting aside concerns about security or the impropriety of
competing for huge prizes in a country gripped by an economic and
political crisis.
	   Bronson and El Guerrouj were among about 50 athletes who signed
a petition last week urging the International Amateur Athletic
Federation to switch venues. But with extra security ensured, most
competitors showed.
	   Of the big-name qualifiers for the Finals, only Johnson, Maurice
Greene and Ato Boldon withdrew, for what the IAAF said were
personal reasons.

Gross leaves Tottenham
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Under fire Tottenham head coach Christian Gross
finally relented to the pressure of a poor start to the Premier
League season Saturday by leaving the struggling club.
	   Gross initially refused to resign after hundreds of angry fans
demonstrated outside the club's White Hart Lane ground two weeks
ago after Spurs started with two heavy losses.
	   He promised changes and produced a 1-0 win over Everton in the
third round, which tentatively lengthened his tenure.
	   But weeks of speculation about the future of the 44-year-old
Swiss coach ended Saturday _ on a day when no Premier League games
were being played due to Euro 2000 qualifiers _ when Spurs released
a statement announcing that Gross and Tottenham had parted company.
	   ``The board of Tottenham Hotspur regretfully announce the
departure of head coach Christian Gross with immediate effect,''
the statement said.
	   ``For the present, our director of football David Pleat will
take temporary charge together with Chris Hughton and the existing
coaching staff.
	   ``This will enable the club to take a sensible time in making
the next very important appointment of our new head coach.''
	   Tottenham, which struggled to avoid relegation last season,
conceded six goals in losing its first two games to Wimbledon and
Sheffield Wednesday but reversed its fortune in the third round,
beating Everton at Liverpool.
	   German striker Jurgen Klinsmann, whose playing contract with
Spurs finished at the end of last season, is tipped to return to
the club as coach.
	   His row with Gross in March last year was a factor in his
decision to leave the club.
	   Gross was appointed Tottenham coach in November 1997 after
coaching Grasshoppers to successive Swiss championships.
	   But his first stint in England started poorly as Spurs struggled
all season against relegation, finally securing a place in the
penultimate game of the season with a 6-2 win over Wimbledon.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four armed Russian sailors seized 24 hostages
Saturday in a remote northern region and demanded to be flown to
the troubled southern republic of Dagestan, a news agency reported.
	   Interfax said the seamen, believed to be from Dagestan, seized
17 students, six teachers and a principal from a school in Novaya
Zemlya, an island in the Barents Sea about 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) north of Moscow.
	   The group was reported to have been taken to a military airfield
by bus. A plane with a team of anti-terrorist troops landed at the
airport a short time later, Interfax said.
	   The sailors were stationed on Novaya Zemlya to guard nuclear
installations at a port, the news agency said. It did not describe
the nature of the installations.
	   The incident occurred the day after an explosion apparently
caused by a car bomb killed at least 17 people, including two
children, in the capital of Dagestan. There was no indication the
hostage-taking was related.
	   Desertion and violence have become relatively commonplace in the
Russian military as it grapples with severe economic and morale
problems.

Hutu rebels storm Rwandan prison, free 3,000 inmates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels attacked a Rwandan prison and
freed about 3,000 inmates suspected of involvement in the 1994
genocide, authorities said Saturday. Many later returned
voluntarily.
	   Details were sketchy, but authorities in Kibuye, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) west of the capital, Kigali, said a group of
rebels overpowered the guards at Kivumu prison and freed inmates
Friday.
	   Most of the inmates who fled had returned by Saturday, officials
said on condition of anonymity. They were apparently afraid of
facing army reprisals if associated with the rebels.
	   No other details were immediately available.
	   The rebels are Hutu former soldiers and militiamen responsible
for the 1994 Hutu government-organized slaughter of more than
500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994 and ended the
killing. But rebels continued to launch attacks from their hideouts
in neighboring Congo, targeting road convoys, Tutsi genocide
survivors and Hutus suspected of collaborating with the
authorities. Thousands of people are thought to have died.
	   Rwandan prisons are crowded with about 130,000 people awaiting
genocide trials. The rebels often target prisons hoping to mobilize
the inmates _ most of whom Hutus _ into their ranks.
	   Popular support for the rebels among the majority Hutu
population appears to be declining and the rebels are increasingly
turning against Hutus who refuse to provide them with money, food
and shelter.
	   The Rwandan genocide trials are separate from those conducted by
the U.N. tribunal based in Arusha, Tanzania.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Numerous showers and thunderstorms moved west across the
Atlantic waters of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands during
the night. Some of these showers and thunderstorms brushed the
north coast of Puerto Rico producing rainfall amounts of up to an

region by Sunday. This will create very unstable conditions over
the local area. A tropical wave located about 500 miles east of the
Lesser Antilles will move rapidly westward and will be affecting
our region by Sunday afternoon. The combination of this tropical
wave and the upper level system will result in an increase in
showers and thunderstorms over our local area Sunday and Sunday
night.

International Monetary Fund approves long-awaited loan for Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - In a positive signal for Ukraine's shaky
financial system, the International Monetary Fund approved a
long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan for the former Soviet republic.
	   In a decision approved Friday, the IMF board agreed to provide
dlrs 257 million of the three-year loan immediately, the fund said
in a statement cited Saturday by the Interfax news agency.
	   Disbursement of further tranches would depend on Ukraine's
compliance with the reform program jointly agreed by the IMF and
the country's government, the IMF said.
	   The Ukrainian government, which has struggled desperately in
recent weeks with the spillover of Russia's crisis into Ukraine,
hailed the IMF's decision as crucial in helping Ukraine avoid a
deep crisis.
	   President Leonid Kuchma forwarded his thanks to leaders of the
United States, Great Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy, France,
Japan, Austria and Poland for their support of Ukraine's bid for
the IMF loan, Kuchma's press service said.
	   Ukraine, which declared independence in 1991, has since
experienced a severe economic decline, but has been slow to
introduce market reforms.
	   An unstable tax and legal environment, along with corruption,
have scared away foreign investors who have directed less than dlrs
2.5 billion in investment to Ukraine to date.
	   The IMF and World Bank suspended their cooperation with Ukraine
last spring after the government ignored their proposals to cut
state spending and boost business development.
	   But the approaching financial crisis and economic collapse
forced Ukraine to change its policies, and in recent months Kuchma
has moved to adopt a series of economic reform measures, including
a tight 1998 budget and deregulation reforms.
	   However, the IMF said that despite approval of its loan
Ukraine's hryvna currency would remain under pressure in coming
months due to the crisis in Russia.
	   Ukraine, which maintains close trade and economic links with
Russia, has already suffered heavily from the financial turmoil its
northern neighbor is enduring.
	   Unable to cope with growing demand for dollars throughout the
country, the government was forced to devalue the hryvna Friday by
announcing a new, wider trading corridor.
	   The decision followed extensive spending by the Central Bank of
its hard currency reserves, which fell to dlrs 800 million by this
week, down from dlrs 1.75 billion a month ago.
	   Ukrainian officials have said the IMF loan would be used
primarily to replenish the Central Bank's reserves.
	   Ukraine also expects approval of some dlrs 800 million in loans
by the World Bank as early as next week, Kuchma's economic aide
Valery Lytvytsky said.
	   He said the country may receive ``several hundred million
dollars'' of that aid by the end of the month.

Muslim activist in London fears new law will curb human rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A leading Egyptian exile urged Britain on
Saturday not to use its new anti-terror law to silence Muslim exile
groups.
	   ``The law should not turn the United Kingdom into a graveyard of
human rights, by muffling mouths,'' Yasser Tawfiq el-Siri, who runs
the Islamic Observation Center in London, said in a telephone
interview with The Associated Press in Cairo.
	   On Friday, the British Parliament passed legislation aimed at
crushing violent Northern Ireland groups, such as the so-called
Real IRA which killed 28 people in a car bombing in Omagh on Aug.
15
	   A provision in the law makes it a crime for British-based exile
groups to conspire to cause violence abroad.
	   While el-Siri fears the legislation could be used to muzzle
foreign dissident groups, he is confident it will not affect his
organization.
	   He said the Islamic Observation Center monitors human rights in
the Muslim world and ``works in the open and abides by British
laws.''
	   ``We are not an armed group, and we do not fund militant Muslim
groups,'' he said.
	   However, el-Siri's statements to the press reveal that his
center appears to have strong contacts with Egyptian militants.
	   El-Siri was sentenced to death in absentia by an Egyptian
military court for taking part in 1993 attempted assassination of
then Prime Minister Atef Sedki.
	   He has lived in England since April 1994 and is seeking
political asylum.
	   Egypt, which has been fighting an insurgency by Muslim militants
since 1992, has long asked Britain to extradite him.

War-hardened Afghan villagers mock U.S. missile strikes
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A U.S. missile barrage aimed at
terrorist training camps in Afghanistan's mountains did so little
damage that war-hardened villagers mocked America's weapons, the
first journalist allowed into the region said Saturday.
	   The United States fired about 30 Tomahawk missiles at camps used
to train radical Muslims as terrorists. According to Washington,
the camps were run by Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, the man it
blames for financing the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East
Africa last month.
	   Rahimullah Yousfzai, a respected Pakistani journalist escorted
into the area this week by Afghanistan's hard-line Taliban army,
said the Aug. 20 missile strike mainly destroyed simple mud huts
and mosques, killing about a dozen people.
	   ``These are very primitive camps, with no roads but paths. They
are very rudimentary, with little to damage,'' he said.
	   However, he said the strikes did appear to have driven out the
terrorists, who were mainly from outside Afghanistan.
	   ``All of the foreigners have left. The Taliban say they are now
fully in control of the area, and the camps are now Taliban
bases,'' he told The Associated Press by telephone from Peshawar, a
Pakistani town on the Afghan border.
	   The religious warriors of the Taliban, which controls most of
Afghanistan, heaped fragments of U.S. missiles up in three camps
along with copies of the Islamic holy book, the Koran, that were
damaged in the raid, said Yousfzai, who is of the same Pashtun
ethnic group as most of the Taliban.
	   Around the camps, goats, cows and poultry wandering freely, and
farmers chopped grass, appearing unconcerned when asked if they
feared new strikes, he said.
	   ``One old man told me, `I am not frightened because I have seen
what the American weapons can do,''' said Yousfzai, 45.
	   Immediately after the strike, the Taliban sealed off the area to
outsiders. The training base includes scattered small camps amid
five villages that are home to roughly 1,000 people. The base
starts about 150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Kabul, the
Afghan capital.
	   Yousfzai said he was allowed to visit the camps for five hours
on Thursday after weeks of trying. There have been conflicting
reports about damage and deaths, so Yousfzai convinced the Taliban
to let him see for himself.
	   He said most damage was at the Al-Bahr camp, which mainly housed
the radical Harakat ul-Ansar group.
	   ``It had received about 11 (missile) hits and also the most
visible destruction of all the camps,'' said Yousfzai, Peshawar
bureau chief for the Pakistani newspaper The News.
	   He said a mosque was destroyed, two mud huts were badly damaged
and one missile fell a few meters (yards) short of the camp's main
building. Other reports said four mosques, in all, were destroyed.
He was told six men were killed at that camp.
	   The journalist said other camps suffered less damage. He said
one hut in a camp called Zhavara, on the Pakistan border, was
destroyed, and that villagers said three women, a child and an
elderly man were killed.
	   Yousfzai said an elderly villager named Pir Ghaffar started
shouting ``Death to America'' at the sight of a reporter.
	   ```He was very bitter against the Americans. He said the
Americans would have to get better weapons and a better strategy if
they wanted accomplish anything. He said all they managed to kill
was one of his hens,'' said Yousfzai.
	   But the reporter said villagers were hardened after missile
strikes and air raids during the 1979-89 Soviet invasion and
attacks during the continuing war between the Taliban and its
northern-based opponents. Villagers were using the meter- (yard-)
deep craters dug by U.S. missiles as water basins for washing.
	   ``Life seemed normal,'' said Yousfzai.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A U.S. missile barrage aimed at
suspected terrorist training camps in Afghanistan's mountains did
so little damage that war-hardened villagers mocked America's
weapons, the first journalist allowed into the region said
Saturday.
	   The United States fired about 30 Tomahawk missiles at camps that
Washington says were used to train radical Muslims as terrorists.
The United States says the camps were run by Saudi dissident Osama
bin Laden, the man it blames for financing the bombing of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa last month.
	   Rahimullah Yousfzai, a respected Pakistani journalist escorted
into the area this week by Afghanistan's hard-line Taliban army,
said the Aug. 20 missile strike mainly destroyed simple mud huts
and mosques, killing about a dozen people.
	   ``These are very primitive camps, with no roads but paths. They
are very rudimentary, with little to damage,'' he said.
	   However, he said the strikes did appear to have driven out the
suspected terrorists, who were mainly from outside Afghanistan.
	   ``All of the foreigners have left. The Taliban say they are now
fully in control of the area, and the camps are now Taliban
bases,'' he told The Associated Press by telephone from Peshawar, a
Pakistani town on the Afghan border.
	   The religious warriors of the Taliban, which controls most of
Afghanistan, heaped fragments of U.S. missiles up in three camps
along with copies of the Islamic holy book, the Koran, that were
damaged in the raid, said Yousfzai, who is of the same Pashtun
ethnic group as most of the Taliban.
	   Around the camps, goats, cows and poultry wandering freely, and
farmers chopped grass, appearing unconcerned when asked if they
feared new strikes, he said.
	   ``One old man told me, `I am not frightened because I have seen
what the American weapons can do,''' said Yousfzai, 45.
	   Immediately after the strike, the Taliban sealed off the area to
outsiders. The alleged training base includes scattered small camps
amid five villages that are home to roughly 1,000 people. The base
starts about 150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Kabul, the
Afghan capital.
	   Yousfzai said he was allowed to visit the sites for five hours
on Thursday after weeks of trying. There have been conflicting
reports about damage and deaths, so Yousfzai convinced the Taliban
to let him see for himself.
	   He said most damage was at the Al-Bahr camp, which allegedly
mainly housed the radical Harakat ul-Ansar group.
	   ``It had received about 11 (missile) hits and also the most
visible destruction of all the camps,'' said Yousfzai, Peshawar
bureau chief for the Pakistani newspaper The News.
	   He said a mosque was destroyed, two mud huts were badly damaged
and one missile fell a few meters (yards) short of the camp's main
building. Other reports said four mosques, in all, were destroyed.
He was told six men were killed at that camp.
	   The journalist said other sites suffered less damage. He said
one hut in a camp called Zhavara, on the Pakistan border, was
destroyed, and that villagers said three women, a child and an
elderly man were killed.

Muslim activist in London fears new law will curb human rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A leading Egyptian exile urged Britain on
Saturday not to use its new anti-terror law to silence Muslim exile
groups.
	   ``The law should not turn the United Kingdom into a graveyard of
human rights, by muffling mouths,'' Yasser Tawfiq el-Siri, who runs
the Islamic Observation Center in London, said in a telephone
interview with The Associated Press in Cairo.
	   On Friday, the British Parliament passed legislation aimed at
crushing violent Northern Ireland groups, such as the so-called
Real IRA which killed 28 people in a car bombing in Omagh on Aug.
15
	   A provision in the law makes it a crime for British-based exile
groups to conspire to cause violence abroad.
	   While el-Siri fears the legislation could be used to muzzle
foreign dissident groups, he is confident it will not affect his
organization.
	   He said the Islamic Observation Center monitors human rights in
the Muslim world and ``works in the open and abides by British
laws.''
	   ``We are not an armed group, and we do not fund militant Muslim
groups,'' he said.
	   However, el-Siri's statements to the press reveal that his
center appears to have strong contacts with Egyptian militants.
	   El-Siri was sentenced to death in absentia by an Egyptian
military court for taking part in 1993 attempted assassination of
then Prime Minister Atef Sedki.
	   He has lived in England since April 1994 and is seeking
political asylum.
	   Egypt, which has been fighting an insurgency by Muslim militants
since 1992, has long asked Britain to extradite him.

	   OSASCO, Brazil (AP) _ A church roof collapsed during services in
a Brazilian town Saturday, killing at least 21 people and injuring
500 more, firefighters said.
	   A congregation of 1,300 was in the church in Osasco, 9 miles (15
kms) southwest of Sao Paulo, when the roof came crashing down,
firefighter Fabio Leite said.
	   ``We are not sure why the roof collapsed. We know the building
was over 40 years old and used to house a cinema,'' Leite said.
	   The roof was made of heavy wooden beams that may have rotted,
said Lourdes Faccinalli, a spokeswoman for the town. It had been
raining for several hours before the accident.
	   Twenty-one people were killed immediately, Leite said. About 500
people are being treated for injuries, some serious, at seven
hospitals.
	   The roof came down about 1:30 a.m. (0430 GMT) at the Universal
Church of the Kingdom of God, which is in a mixed residential and
business district, Leite said.
	   ``The worshippers were praying at a night-time vigil, as is
common in the evangelical church,'' Faccinalli said.
	   The church is part of an evangelical network across Brazil and
Latin America. There are also branches in the United States.

President urges Irish to stand by peace pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATE with Clinton playing golf, minor editing &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMERICK, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton appealed to the
Irish people Saturday to reject ``enemies of peace'' who would
undercut the accord ending violence in Northern Ireland. ``Do not
let them break your will,'' he told an enthusiastic turnout of
flag-waving admirers.
	   In a passionate, rallying speech to crowds clogging O'Connell
Street, Clinton said Ireland's negotiated peace makes it a shining
example for peoples everywhere, from Rwanda to the Middle East to
Kosovo.
	   ``Because of what you have done in Ireland in 1998 you have made
it possible for me ... to tell every warring, feuding, hating group
of people trapped in the prison of their past conflicts to look at
Ireland and know there can be a better day,'' he said.
	   Clinton was winding up a six-day European trip with Irish
applause ringing in his ears but the lengthening shadow of the
Monica Lewinsky affair awaiting him back home.
	   His role in pushing Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland toward a peaceful accommodation has earned him plaudits. It
was marked Saturday with a scroll presented on behalf of the
universities of Ireland praising his ``critical contributions'' to
peace.
	   The people of Limerick, who turned out a crowd of 20,000 or more
on this rainy morning that turned to sun for Clinton, also gave him
a certificate of freedom.
	   But Clinton said the major credit for progress belonged to the
people in the north and in the republic who voted for the accord
reached last April to set up a new assembly and spur sectarian
reconciliation.
	   ``The demons of the past are losing their power to divide you,''
he said. ``This is you at your best. Do not let them break your
will.''
	   On the stage he shared with his wife, Hillary, and Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern, winds buffeted a tall wall of bulletproof
glass that left exposed only the small lectern where Clinton
delivered his remarks.
	   After speaking, the president shook hands with many of the
hundreds of people pressing up against metal barricades. Clinton
leaned far over the barrier to reach outstretched hands and Secret
Service agents supported him by clinging to his belt.
	   Later, he played golf at Ballybunion before he was to return to
a Washington bound up by the controversy over his affair with the
White House intern and increasingly critical of the president's
behavior. Except for a fund-raising trip to Florida on Wednesday,
Clinton will be at the White House in the coming week, his conduct
and contrition a national obsession.
	   New trouble also loomed overseas.
	   Tensions between Iran and Afghanistan have increased in recent
days after Tehran massed more than 70,000 elite troops at the
border to conduct military exercises. The maneuvers are apparently
directed against Afghanistan where, according to Tehran, the ruling
Taliban militia is holding four dozen Iranians, including several
diplomats who are feared dead.
	   But, for the present, Clinton basked in the promise of peace.
	   ``Three years ago in Dublin, I promised the people of Ireland
that as long as Ireland walks the road of peace, America will walk
with you. You have more than kept your part of the deal and we will
keep ours,'' Clinton said.
	   To wit, the U.S.-based Dell Computer Corp. announced plans to
create a dlrs 90 million facility and add 1,700 jobs in the
southwestern city. Dell also said it was donating computers to the
schools of Omagh, Northern Ireland, where an Aug. 15 car bombing _
the worst terrorist attack in the province's 30 years of violence _
claimed its 29th victim on Saturday.
	   Sean McGrath, 61, died in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital.
	   ``As we mourn the losses of Omagh, remember there will still be
efforts by the enemies of peace to break your will, to get you to
turn back, to get you to lose your faith,'' Clinton exhorted.
``Don't do it. Don't do it.''

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Four African presidents flew to Libya on
Saturday, breaking a U.N. embargo against the north African
country, Libyan television reported.
	   Presidents Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of Niger, Alpha Oumar Konare
of Mali, Idriss Deby of Chad and Omar el-Bashir of Sudan landed at
the airport of the capital, Tripoli, in planes that had flown ``in
the face of the embargo,'' the state-run television reported.
	   The television later showed the four presidents meeting Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   It was the second time in eight weeks that Mainassara and Deby
had violated the air embargo which the U.N. Security Council
imposed on Libya in 1992.
	   Mainassara flew directly from Niger to Tripoli, el-Bashir from
the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, while Deby and Konare traveled
together from the Chadian capital of N'djamena, said the
television, which ran live broadcasts of their arrivals.
	   The four presidents were invited to attend a ceremony late
Saturday marking the 30th anniversary of the bloodless coup that
brought Gadhafi to power.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Condemning ``horrendous'' killings
of Kosovo's civilians, America's top human rights official said
Saturday that he is collecting evidence of atrocities for an
investigation by the U.N. war crimes tribunal.
	   ``We are going to gather information and provide it to the
authorities at the ... tribunal, so they will further investigate
and prosecute'' suspects, said John Shattuck, assistant U.S.
secretary of state for human rights.
	   His announcement marked a new international attempt to contain
the six-month conflict that has killed hundreds and made refugees
of an estimated 265,000 Kosovo civilians, mostly ethnic Albanians.
	   Militant ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province are fighting
for independence but are losing to the vastly better-equipped
police of Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic, and the Yugoslav
army.
	   ``All ... violations of international humanitarian law in Kosovo
should be fully investigated and prosecuted'' Shattuck said. ``The
horrendous killing and shelling of civilians must stop.''
	   The U.N. tribunal's prosecution of war criminals in Bosnia has
kept attention on atrocities in that conflict long after they were
committed. It has also sent a message that war criminals will be
held accountable for their actions.
	   Still, top suspects Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the
former Bosnian Serb political and military leaders, remain at
large. Serbia has refused to hand them over and is even less likely
to do so for suspects in Kosovo, an integral part of the Serbian
state.
	   Yugoslavia's constitution bars extradition of Yugoslav citizens
to any foreign country.
	   Shattuck said his message was directed at both sides in Kosovo.
Serbian authorities last week announced that ethnic Albanian
militants had killed dozens of Serb civilians and burned their
remains in a remote village southwest of Pristina.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army and the province's ethnic Albanian
human rights organizations denied the claim.
	   Overall, most civilian casualties have been ethnic Albanian
villagers shelled and shot. Serbian authorities call them
collateral victims in their hunt for ``terrorists.''
	   The conflict has also resulted in scores of missing on both
sides. Former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole arrived Saturday as head of the
non-governmental International Commission for Missing Persons to
investigate their plight.
	   Additionally, scores of villages have been burned after their
inhabitants fled. Tens of thousands of refugees are camped out in
the open, afraid to return home. Humanitarian officials warn of
mass deaths by the time winter comes, unless refugees can return
and rebuild.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has said that returning
villagers have nothing to fear.
	   The Serb Media Center reported more than 5,000 Albanians
returned Saturday to villages west of Pristina. But many villagers
have told foreign reporters of renewed shelling if they try to go
home.
	   Serbian police said they arrested about 450 ethnic Albanian men
of fighting age over the past two days in the same area, some
suspected KLA fighters. All were being questioned.
	   After meeting with Shattuck, Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate Kosovo
Albanian leader who enjoys Western support, urged greater U.S.
involvement.

Ireland scores shock 2-0 win over Croatia in Euro Champs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ World Cup semifinalist Croatia tumbled
2-0 to Ireland and had two players sent off in a European
Championship qualifying game Saturday.
	   Ireland stunned the Croats with two goals in the opening 15
minutes through a Denis Irwin penalty and a header by his
Manchester United team-mate Roy Keane.
	   Croatia, desperate to peg back the home team, had two men sent
off within two minutes and was reduced to nine men in the last 20
minutes.
	   Mario Stanic was first to be sent off in the 70th minute when he
committed his second bookable offense. He was followed off the
field two minutes later when Krunoslav Jurcic was red-carded for a
serious foul.
	   Irwin opened the scoring for Ireland in the fourth minute by
converting a penalty from the spot after he had been pulled down in
the goal box by a combination of Robert Jarni and Jurcic.
	   Within 11 minutes, new captain Keane had doubled the lead,
bringing a full house at Lansdowne Road to its feet.
	   Croatia failed to clear an Ireland corner and the ball rebounded
to Jason McAteer, who took a shot from 20 meters (yards). The ball
deflected off a defender before Keane headed it inside the far
post.
	   Keane and midfielder Mark Kinsella inspired the Irish defense
with some fierce tackling late in the half.
	   Croatia had its best opportunity in the 66th minute when Stanic
had an open goal and was unmarked but headed into the Ireland
goalkeeper.
	   The Croatian striker received his first yellow card minutes
later with a foul on Steve Staunton and then repeated the offense
within three minutes to earn his dismissal.
	   Staunton was the target again when he was taken out in a late
tackle by Jurcic, who was punished with a red card.

Grobbelaar lines up for Bury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce
Grobbelaar made an expected return to English soccer action
Saturday when he lined up for Bury at Birmingham City.
	   The 40-year-old Zimbabwean 'keeper, cleared last year of
matchfixing charges, was named as a late replacement for Irish
international goalkeeper Dean Kiely.
	   Although he made a brilliant reflex-action save to foil
Birmingham's Nicky Forster, Grobbelaar was beaten in the 20th
minute by Dele Adebola as the Blues won 1-0 at St. Andrews.
	   Grobbelaar, who is under a suspended six-month ban after he
admitted breaking Football Association rules by predicting results
for a betting syndicate, also has been turning out this season for
semi-pro Chesham United.
	   During a 19-year career in English soccer starting in 1979,
Grobbelaar helped Liverpool wins a European Champions Cup and six
domestic league titles before he moved on to Southampton and later
Plymouth Argyle.

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Four African presidents flew to Libya on
Saturday, breaking a U.N. embargo on the north African country,
Libyan television reported.
	   Presidents Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of Niger, Alpha Oumar Konare
of Mali, Idriss Deby of Chad and Omar el-Bashir of Sudan landed in
the capital, Tripoli, in planes that had flown ``in the face of the
embargo,'' state-run television reported.
	   It was the second time in eight weeks that Mainassara and Deby
had violated the air embargo which the U.N. Security Council
imposed on Libya in 1992.
	   Television showed the four presidents meeting Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi.
	   The four presidents were invited to attend a ceremony Saturday
to mark the 30th anniversary of the bloodless coup that brought
Gadhafi to power.

Iran warns Taliban it will act unless Iranians are freed

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ With its troops, tanks and fighter planes
massed on the border, Iran warned Afghanistan's Taliban militia
Saturday that it would take steps unless 11 diplomats and 31 other
Iranians were freed.
	   State-run Tehran radio said Iran would take ``the necessary
measures within the framework of legitimate defense'' if the
Iranians were not freed.
	   The radio did not specify what action Iran would take, but
Tehran newspapers and analysts have spoken increasingly in past
days of a possible military strike against the Taliban.
	   ``I think that whether we like it or not, we are heading toward
some kind of military confrontation with the Taliban,'' Sadegh
Zibakalam, professor of politics at Tehran University, said in an
interview with the newspaper Toos.
	   Iran carried out military maneuvers on its Afghan border this
week in which 70,000 troops, more than 150 tanks and squadrons of
fighter planes were involved. Tehran has said the forces will
remain in the area.
	   But, with memories of the 1980-88 war still fresh in Iranian
minds, newspapers have warned the government against stepping into
a quagmire.
	   The hard-line Qods daily said Saturday that the Taliban must be
given an ``unforgettable lesson.''
	   ``But this lesson must follow a thorough understanding of all
the aspects and consequences,'' the paper warned.
	   Iran accuses the Taliban, which controls most of Afghanistan, of
seizing 47 Iranians when its forces captured the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the 11 diplomats, but it
freed five Iranian truck drivers on Thursday.
	   Iranian officials say there is a growing awareness that the
diplomats have probably been killed.
	   A member of an Iranian delegation that traveled to Afghanistan
last week said their mission was only to find and retrieve the
remains of the diplomats.
	   Iran's newspaper Abrar has quoted Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed
Mutawakil as saying the diplomats were probably killed by
opposition forces during the battle for Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   He said there was no one inside the Iranian consulate in
Mazar-e-Sharif when the Taliban entered the city.
	   ``The only likely possibility is that they were killed. We'll
try ... to find their bodies,'' the Farsi-language paper quoted
Mutawakil as saying.

	   LIMERICK, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton appealed to the
Irish people Saturday never to allow ``the enemies of peace to
break your will'' as Northern Ireland's Protestant leader announced
he would finally end his long war of nerves with Sinn Fein.
	   As Clinton concluded a fruitful three-day swing through both
parts of Ireland, he told more than 20,000 people crowding
Limerick's central crossroads that the Northern Ireland agreement
should provide inspiration to entrenched conflicts worldwide.
	   ``You have made it possible for me ... to tell every warring,
feuding, hating group of people, trapped in the prison of their
past conflict, to look at Ireland and know there can be a better
day,'' Clinton declared to cheers and applause.
	   In Belfast, Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble scheduled
a meeting with Gerry Adams, ending his three-year refusal to talk
directly with the leader of the IRA-allied party and providing the
White House's with its hoped-for outcome from the trip.
	   Clinton had urged direct discussions on Thursday when he was in
Belfast.
	   ``It's another positive development,'' said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
	   The meeting between Adams and Trimble will happen Tuesday or
Wednesday, said Dermot Nesbitt, a Trimble colleague.
	   Trimble, the would-be leader of Belfast's unformed new
government, and Adams both led their parties to accept April's
accord on how Northern Ireland should be governed. Trimble had sat
in the same room but refused to talk directly to Adams because of
the Irish Republican Army's unwillingness to start disarming as
evidence that the outlawed group's July 1997 truce is permanent.
	   Saturday's decision followed Trimble's earlier announcement
Monday in Belfast that he would lead round-table discussions with
all party leaders, including Adams, to start the process of forming
a government between the north's British Protestants and Irish
Catholics. Sinn Fein wants two of the expected 12 seats in the new
Belfast administration.
	   At Limerick, Clinton basked in the promise of peace and vowed to
continue U.S. support.
	   ``Three years ago in Dublin, I promised the people of Ireland
that as long as Ireland walks the road of peace, America will walk
with you,'' the president said. ``You have more than kept your part
of the deal and we will keep ours.''
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern led the president, Hillary
Clinton and the crowd in a moment's silent for the latest fatality
from political violence in Northern Ireland.
	   Retired Catholic baker Sean McGrath, 61, died Saturday of his
wounds three weeks after an IRA dissidents' car bomb killed 28 and
wounded more than 330 people in Omagh.
	   Clinton, in his remarks, mourned the Aug. 15 atrocity _ the
deadliest in Northern Ireland's 30-year conflict _ as well as
July's burning deaths of three Catholic boys.
	   ``There will be still efforts by the enemies of peace to break
your will, to get you to turn back, to get you to lose faith. Don't
do it. Don't do it,'' Clinton urged the crowd, which braved
monsoon-like cloudbursts to see him.
	   ``Remember what it was like when you were here on this day,'' he
said, gesturing past bullet-proof glass walls to the sea of faces,
now warmed by sunny skies, filling narrow streets in three
directions. ``This is you at your best. Do not let them break your
will.''
	   Clinton's visit coincided with a fresh U.S. contribution to
Ireland's ``Celtic tiger'' economy.
	   Dell Computer Corp., America's largest direct seller of personal
computers, announced plans to open a new dlrs 90 million factory in
Limerick next year.
	   The company, which located its main European manufacturing site
in the city in 1991, already has two plants here employing 2,600,
and could add jobs for 1,700 more in the new factory.
	   Dell also announced it is donating 100 computers to civil
authorities in Omagh to help organize reconstruction of the bomb
site and coordinate services for victims.
	   City leaders gave Clinton Limerick's ``freedom of the city'' _
an honorary citizenship also bestowed on President Kennedy here in
1963. Both presidents have Irish ancestry.
	   ``You have made us feel very much at home,'' a smiling Clinton
said.
	   The president also received a joint peace prize from the
chancellors of all nine universities in Ireland for his support for
the 22-month-long Belfast negotiations.
	   Clinton finished his Ireland trip with a challenging round of
golf at the cliffside resort of Ballybunion.

Slated peace talks seek cease fire, withdrawal of foreign troops
</HEADLINE>
from Congo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congo peace talks will seek to work out
a cease fire and a scheduled withdrawal of foreign troops from the
central African country, President Robert Mugabe said Saturday.
	   Neither Congo President Laurent Kabila's forces nor rebels
seeking his ouster and their allies want to continue fighting,
Mugabe asserted.
	   The talks are scheduled for Monday in Victoria Falls. Zimbabwe
officials said they still had no complete information on who the
participants will be.
	   George Charamba, Mugabe's spokesman, said Zimbabwe rejected
objections by
	   Congolese rebels that another venue should be chosen as Zimbabwe
was not neutral.
	   Zimbabwe has sent more than 2,800 troops to support Kabila and
defend Kinshasa, the capital of Congo.
	   Zimbabwe's state-controlled Herald newspaper reported Saturday
the death of a Zimbabwe air force officer in Congo.
	   It said Wing Commander Titus Sharaunga died when a Congolese
SF260 aircraft crashed, apparently in bad weather. It gave no date
of the crash or further details.
	   The Herald said Sharaunga's death brought to five the number of
Zimbabweans killed in Congo in the past two weeks. At least 30 have
been reported wounded.

Lithuania 0, Scotland 0 in Euro Champs qualifier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Veteran goalkeeper Jim Leighton made a
stunning first half save as Scotland labored to a 0-0 tie with
Lithuania in a European Championship qualifying game Saturday.
	   The 40-year-old 'keeper rescued his team in the 22nd minute when
defender Matt Elliott conceded a free-kick on the edge of the area,
and Davidas Semberas delivered a cross.
	   Edgarras Jankauskas met it cleanly but Leighton managed to push
his header away with a reflex-action save.
	   Lithuania went close again seven minutes before halftime when
Darren Jackson headed off the line after Leighton failed to deal
with a corner from Semberas.
	   Jankauskas also scared the Scots with a 20-meter (yard) shot
that flew wide of the post.
	   Ally McCoist, Scotland's most experienced striker who was left
off the World Cup squad, was recalled by coach Craig Brown to
partner Kevin Gallacher but made little impact.
	   Colin Hendry had a clear header during injury time from
Gallacher's leftwing cross but it was too high.
	   Lithuania _ Gintras Stauce, Andrius Skerla, Davidas Semberas,
Raimondas Zutautas, Baltus, Zvirgzdauskas, Saulius Mikulenas,
Fugdza, Aidas Preiksaitis, Aurelijus Skarbalius, Edgaras
Jankauskas.
	   Scotland _ Jim Leighton, Matt Elliott, Tommy Boyd, Colin
Calderwood, Colin Hendry, Christian Dailly, Kevin Gallacher, Paul
Lambert, Ally McCoist, Darren Jackson, John Collins.

Two Britons killed in Spanish campground when tree falls on tent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANT PERE PESCADOR, Spain (AP) _ Two young Britons died Saturday
when a tree fell on their tent at a campground in northeast Spain,
officials said.
	   Neither police nor the owner of the campground would release the
victims' names, saying only that they were a 23-year-old woman and
a 26-year-old man.
	   The two worked for a company called Eurocamp, which rents tents
to campgrounds. They had arrived Friday night to start taking down
tents at Las Dunas camp site, its owner Federic Sune said.
	   The site is located in this town about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
north of the city of Gerona.
	   A fierce gust of wind knocked a poplar tree onto the Britons'
tent at around 12:30 a.m. Saturday (2230 GMT Friday), killing the
man instantly. The woman died while being rushed to hospital in the
town of Figueres, Sune said.

Horn steps down, Socialists elect new president after election
</HEADLINE>
defeat

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Socialists chose former Foreign
Minister Laszlo Kovacs as their new leader Saturday as the party
tries to recover from a bitter defeat in last May's general
elections.
	   Kovacs, 59, is the most popular public figure of the party. He
received 384 votes at a leadership meeting, well ahead of Sandor
Nagy with 144 votes.
	   ``We have to work on becoming a modern social democratic party,
because otherwise, in the long run, we can't expect to remain a
decisive factor of the country's political life,'' Kovacs said
before the vote.
	   The change in leadership was seen by many members as long
overdue.
	   The former prime minister and party leader, Gyula Horn,
announced a few weeks ago that he would step down and not compete
for any post in the party.
	   ``With this, I want to contribute to the rejuvenation of the
party,'' Horn told the leadership congress in his farewell address.
	   Horn had led the Socialist party since 1989, after it split from
the old-line communists, and led them to victory in the 1994
elections.
	   Under his presidency, Hungary was invited to join the two most
prestigious western clubs, NATO and the European Union.
	   Austerity measures that were introduced to avoid economic
collapse earned Horn's government praise from the International
Monetary Fund but raised tension among those who had voted the
Socialists into power in 1994, in the hopes their lives would
become easier.
	   ``Had we won the elections, we would have gone to heaven, but as
we lost we went to hell,'' Horn said.
	   Horn, as foreign minister of the last Communist government,
earned a favorable reputation among Western democracies by opening
the Iron Curtain in 1989 to allow East Germans to cross to Austria.
	   The surge that followed contributed to the collapse of the East
German state and the reunification of Germany in 1990.
	   However, his domestic popularity faded, and his resignation was
welcomed even by Socialist party supporters.

Sjoland conserves lead at European Masters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CRANS-SUR-SIERRE, Switzerland (AP) _ Patrik Sjoland fired a
sizzling 9-under par 62 on a soggy course Saturday, giving the
Swede a comfortable four-stroke lead going into the final round of
the European Masters.
	   Sjoland, winner of the Italian Open in April, closed out his
third round in brilliant fashion with four consecutive birdies, his
62 just two shots off the Plan-Bramois course record.
	   ``Today was a 9-out-of-10,'' said Sjoland, his 54 hole total of
193 one stroke above the course record. ``Fingers crossed for
tomorrow.
	   ``I know it's going to be hard. All the pressure is on me
tomorrow.''
	   Germany's Sven Struver fired a solid round 6-under 65 but will
still go into Sunday's final round trailing the 27-year-old Swede
by four shots.
	   Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, No. 2 on the European Tour
money list, sits one stroke further back after carding a third
round 5-under 66.
	   Last year's winner Costantino Rocca of Italy remained in
contention for a second consecutive title, sitting seven shots back
after finishing the day with a 4-under 67.
	   Switzerland's Christophe Bovet, second behind Sjoland after
firing a second round 64 on Friday, struggled in the wet
conditions, falling nine shots off the pace after carding a 1-under
70.
	   Europe's No. 1 Lee Westwood of England carded his best round of
the tournament finishing with a 5-under 66 but still sits 11 shots
back of the lead.
	   Colin Montgomerie, who missed his last two cuts, continued to
struggle, double-bogeying the 18th hole to finish with a 2-under
69.
	   The 1996 European champion and five-time European No. 1 sits one
shot back of Westwood, 12 shots off the pace.
	   Former European Ryder Cup captain Seve Ballesteros of Spain had
a 1-under 70 for the third consecutive day, leaving him 17 shots
back, one shot behind countryman Jose Maria Olazabal, who had a
third round 2-under 69.
	   Start of third round play was delayed two hours while workers
cleared the waterlogged fairways and bunkers after a night of
torrential rain.
	   The delay, however, failed to slow Sjoland who began his round
with an eagle on the par-5 opening hole, draining a 20-yard putt.
	   Play was further delayed at noon, with golfers and spectators
observing a minute of silence for the 229 victims of Swissair
flight 111, which crashed off the east coast of Canada on Thursday,
killing all onboard.
	   ``I've only been in the lead once in Italy and I had a
three-shot lead there,'' said Sjoland, who was fourth in Crans
Montana last year. ``I've got one more tomorrow. I shot 62 today
but probably somebody's going to do that tomorrow so I need to keep
playing as I am and not think too much about what the other guys
are doing.''
	   Aside from the 2 million franc (dlrs 1.2 million) purse up for
grabs, the tournament is the first European event which counts
valuable Ryder Cup points. Europe will attempt to defend its title
against the United States at the Country Club in Brookline, New

	   ``I haven't thought much of Ryder Cup,'' said Sjoland. ``We'll
see at the end of the year. If I'm in a good position I'll put it
up as a goal.
	   ``I think three Swedes have realistic chances of the Ryder
Cup,'' estimated Sjoland. ``Hopefully I will be one of them. Yes, I
think I'm one of them.''

Ruling coalition to support the cabinet's economic reforms

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Hungarians setting Sept. 30 deadline on
university issue; EDITS to conform. no pickup &QL;

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Shaken by the crisis in Russia,
leaders of the ruling coalition affirmed their commitment Saturday
to economic reforms despite a threat by the ethnic Hungarian party
to break with its partners over the issue of Hungarian education.
	   Following the joint declaration, the Romanian Cabinet met in an
unusual Saturday session and agreed to budget cuts for five
ministries _ health, education, defense, culture and research _
totaling the equivalent of dlrs 843 million.
	   The Cabinet is expected to take other measures soon including
tax increases on cars, real estate, tobacco and alcohol, officials
said. The cuts and tax increases are subject to parliamentary
approval.
	   Leaders of the four ruling parties met Friday night with
President Emil Constantinescu, who urged them to carry on market
reforms and end the political bickering which has stagnated the
government for months.
	   Early Saturday, the parties issued a statement declaring that at
a time when ``several countries around Romania'' face ``economic,
financial and political crises,'' the government must ``assure the
country real political stability.''
	   The statement included each ministry's priorities for the next
six months in an effort to carry through privatization, market
reforms, social policies and fight corruption.
	   One of the four parties, the Hungarian Democratic Union, said it
would support the economic reform program. But the HDU, which
represents Romania's 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians, said it would
decide later whether to back other government programs.
	   On Thursday, HDU leader Bela Marko said the party, which
controls 36 of the 486 seats in the national assembly, was
``withdrawing support'' for the government to protest a decision by
a parliamentary committee to oppose a Hungarian language
university.
	   The announcement meant the Hungarian party no longer felt
obliged to vote with its coalition partners on every issue. The
other parties prefer a ``multicultural'' university open to all
ethnic minorities.
	   Following a meeting Saturday in Cluj, 325 kilometers (203 miles)
northwest of Bucharest, HDU leaders announced they would leave the
coalition altogether unless parliament agrees by Sept. 30 to open
the Hungarian university.
	   ``This is a chance offered by the HDU to the ruling coalition,''
HDU vice president Attila Verestoy said. ``This is our firm
decision.''
	   Marko, considered a moderate, is under pressure from nationalist
hardliners in the party to take a strong stand in defense of what
they consider Hungarian rights.

Jones caps unbeaten season with six-figure payday

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Marion Jones capped an undefeated season and
pocketed over dlrs 600,000 Saturday by winning the 100 meters and
the long jump at the IAAF Grand Prix Finals.
	   The American pulled away after a slow start in the 100 and
clocked 10.83 seconds to beat runner-up Sevatheda Fynes by more
than a quarter-second _ a lifetime in the dash.
	   That victory gave Jones a third of the dlrs 1 million Golden
League jackpot, in addition to dlrs 200,000 for the women's overall
Grand Prix title and dlrs 50,000 for the race win. She got another
50,000 for taking the long jump earlier with a top leap of 7.13
meters (23-4 3-4) on the cool, overcast afternoon at Luzhniki
Olympic Stadium.
	   ``I know anybody's capable of challenging me, so I have to make
sure I'm on each time,'' said Jones, who has won all 35 events she
entered in 1998, which includes 60- and 200-meter races. ``The 100
today was a little difficult because I'm not used to jumping first
and then running.''
	   Jones split the jackpot _ for athletes who win their events at
all six Golden League meets plus the GP Finals _ with Hicham El
Guerrouj and Haile Gebrselassie, who also stayed unbeaten for the
year with dominating wins.
	   El Guerrouj was among the athletes who had asked organizers to
switch venues because of the financial and political crisis in
Russia. The 80,000 capacity stadium, the main venue for the 1980
Summer Olympics, was only about one-fourth full.
	   Jones had to endure four false starts before taking off in the
100. She took control after 40 meters and cruised home with both
arms raised over her head.
	   ``Obviously it was unfortunate to have all those (false starts)
today,'' the 22-year-old said. ``We don't want to be out there as
long as we were. I just tried to shake each one off and re-focus.''
	   She has been outstanding all season, twice clocking 10.71 in the
dash. Only one woman _ record-holder Florence Griffith-Joyner _ has
ever run faster.
	   Jones only dedicated herself to track and field two years ago,
putting aside basketball, in which she helped North Carolina with
the U.S. NCAA college championship.
	   El Guerrouj ran alone for the final lap of the 1,500 meters in
clocking 3 minutes, 32.03 seconds _ six seconds off his best but a
full second better than runner-up Noah Ngeny. The world champion
and record holder crossed the line with his arms extended and
jumped into the arms of his coach. He wrapped up the men's overall
Grand Prix title.
	   Gebrselassie also had little trouble in capturing the 3,000
meters in a relatively slow 7:50.00. Luke Kipkosgei, the only
athlete to threaten the Ethiopian's dominance at the longer
distances this season, was second in 7:50.87.
	   ``It doesn't matter if the money was there or not,''
Gebrselassie said. ``The most important thing is to win and be the
best.''
	   He has 20 straight outdoor wins and set world records for the
5,000 and 10,000 (in which he's the world and Olympic champion)
within a two-week span in June.
	   The only other person in contention for the jackpot heading to
Moscow was Bryan Bronson, but the American faded to sixth in the
400 hurdles as France's Stephane Diagana won.
	   Diagana, the world champion, finished in 48.30 seconds and ended
Bronson's 17-race winning streak at the distance. Bronson lost
steam coming off the next-to-last hurdle and struggled home in
sixth place in 48.94. Dinsdale Morgan was second in 48.60, with
Samuel Matete third in 48.73.
	   Bronson barely edged Diagana in a photo finish at Berlin Tuesday
to keep alive his shot at the jackpot.
	   ``It was tough for Bronson, because seven races are a lot to
have to win,'' Diagana said. ``It feels good to win a Grand Prix
Final and the season this way. It's also some consolation'' for
last month's European Championships, where he tripped in the
semifinals.
	   Elsewhere, Russia's Natalya Sadova won the women's discus with a
season-best effort of 68.50 meters (224 feet, 9 inches). World
champion Beatrice Faumuina was fourth.
	   Hungary's Tibor Gecsek was a surprise winner of the men's hammer
toss with a top effort of 81.21 meters (266 feet, 5 inches).
Olympic champion Balazs Kiss was second with 79.71 (261-6), while
world titlist Heinz Weis finished a disappointing seventh.
	   Other men's winners included veteran Frankie Fredericks in men's
100 in 10.10 seconds, edging Obadele Thompson by one one-hundredth
of a second; record-holder Javier Sotomayor in the high jump;
Maksim Tarasov in the pole vault; Charles Friedek in the triple
jump; and world champion John Godina in the shot put.
	   Britain's Mark Richardson won the men's 400 in 44.88 seconds.
World and Olympic champion Michael Johnson, citing fatigue, did not
enter.
	   Gete Wami, a former world cross country champion, won the
women's 3,000 meters in 8 minutes, 40.11 seconds, surging past
Zohra Ouaziz in the final stretch, Michelle Freeman led from the
start in taking the women's 100 hurdles in 12.56, and Falilat
Ogunkoya captured the women's 400 in 49.73. Other winners were
Svetlana Masterkova in the 1,500 and Tanja Damaske in the javelin.

Report: Russian sailors seize 24 hostages, demand to be flown home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with hostage-taking linked to Dagestan
bombing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four armed Russian sailors seized 24 hostages
Saturday in a remote northern region and demanded to be flown to
the troubled southern republic of Dagestan, a news agency reported.
	   The hostage-taking apparently stemmed from an explosion,
believed to have been caused by a car bomb, that killed at least 17
people in the capital of Dagestan on Friday.
	   The Interfax news agency said one of the sailors explained his
action by saying that one of his relatives might have died in the
blast. The other three were described as participating out of
solidarity.
	   Interfax said the seamen, believed to be from Dagestan, seized
17 students, six teachers and a principal from a school in Novaya
Zemlya, an island in the Barents Sea about 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) north of Moscow.
	   The group was reported to have been taken to a military airfield
by bus. A plane with a team of anti-terrorist troops landed at the
airport a short time later, Interfax said.
	   In addition to demanding a plane to take them to Dagestan, the
four were reportedly demanding arms.
	   The sailors were stationed on Novaya Zemlya to guard nuclear
installations at a port, the news agency said. It did not describe
the nature of the installations.
	   Desertion and violence have become relatively commonplace in the
Russian military as it grapples with severe economic and morale
problems.

Castro honors students killed in Soweto uprising

	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro laid a
wreath Saturday at a memorial to a schoolboy slain during a 1976
uprising against white rule.
	   As about 1,000 onlookers chanted Castro's name and sang, the
Cuban leader said Hector Peterson and others who had died in the
anti-apartheid fight did not give their lives in vain.
	   The 1976 uprising was sparked by schoolchildren who protested
being taught in the Afrikaans language of their white apartheid
rulers. Peterson was the first of hundreds of people killed by
police in the uprising.
	   Castro was in South Africa to attend a Nonaligned Movement
summit, which ended early Friday.

Prime minister visits bedside of comatose interior minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with hospital saying Chevenement condition unchanged &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Saturday paid a
visit to the bedside of France's interior minister, in his fourth
day of a coma induced by an allergic reaction to anesthesia.
	   Jean-Pierre Chevenement, a key figure in Jospin's leftist
government, remained in what doctors called a ``reactive coma,''
meaning he responds to his name with a blinking of the eyes.
	   By Saturday evening, his condition was reported as unchanged.
	   ``It is still not possible to formulate a stable prognosis,''
said a statement from the chief doctor at Val de Grace military
hospital, Yves Cudennec.
	   Doctors said Friday that Chevenement had been making
``progressive improvement.''
	   Chevenement, 59, fell into the coma during an operation for
gallstones at Val de Grace in southern Paris, where the nation's
top leaders receive medical treatment. He suffered a heart attack
during the procedure then fell into the coma. Doctors said he
suffered a rare reaction to a component in the anesthesia.
	   France's deputy minister for overseas territories, Jean-Jack
Queyranne, was immediately appointed interim minister of the
interior.
	   Chevenement, in charge of the nation's police, is a key
political ally of Jospin, who made no comment after the visit.

Singapore downs Vietnam in final; Indonesia beats Thailand

 &UR; EDS: Stands as 1st Ld-Writethru to Asian lines to restore score of
third-place match. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ R. Sasi Kumar scored in the 70th minute
and a 10-man Singapore withstood a desperate Vietnamese attack for
the last 13 minutes to win the Tiger Cup 1-0 Saturday night.
	   Singapore's strategy of using long balls to take advantage of a
height advantage seemed futile for most of the match.
	   But Vietnam keeper Tien Anh, a hero in the semifinals, failed to
punch away one in front of the goal and Kumar easily rammed it home
to silence the boisterous capacity crowd.
	   Seven minutes after the goal, Singapore's Latiff Ahmad was sent
off with his second yellow card, but Vietnam was unable to finish
several opportunities.
	   Vietnam repeatedly gave the ball away and Singapore, which
played to a 0-0 draw with Vietnam in group action, was able to shut
down the hosts.
	   The match was very physical contest from the start, with
virtually every touch challenged.
	   A sea of red _ Vietnam's national color _ greeted both teams as
they took the field on a beautiful evening. One Vietnamese flag
covered nearly half of one section of seats. The pitch was in fine
shape despite earlier showers.
	   But the crowd, expected to explode in a motorbike-riding frenzy
through the streets of Hanoi if they had been rewarded, finally
filed out quietly.
	   ``We were not as lucky as two days ago'' in a 3-0 semifinal
victory over Thailand, said Vietnam coach Alfred Riedl. ``We made
one or two bad mistakes. (But) our players fought very hard
tonight. We should be proud how they did under pressure.''
	   The consolation game, in Ho Chi Minh City, was a rematch of
Monday's controversial Indonesia-Thailand group game that ended
with Indonesia scoring an intenational own goal in the final minute
to give Thailand a 3-2 victory.
	   Both teams had said they didn't want to face Vietnam in the
semifinals and the both played like they were trying to lose.
	   This time, both teams _ stinging from dlrs 40,000 fines issued
Friday by the ASEAN Football Federation _ played more forward and
fought to a 3-3 draw before Indonesia prevailed on penalties 5-4.
	   Yusuf Ekodono, who scored the own goal to hand Thailand the
victory on Monday, was the hero this time, scoring his second goal
of the game with a minute left to force the penalty shootout.
	   The stadium was only a quarter-full, and those who did show up
said they only wanted to see good soccer, not cheer for either
team.
	   ``I don't care who wins becuase they're both losers,'' said
Nguyen Duc, 34. ``They have no pride in the game. They have no
pride in their country. They make a mockery of the game.''

	   LIMERICK, Ireland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton appealed to the
Irish people Saturday never to allow ``the enemies of peace to
break your will'' as Northern Ireland's Protestant leader announced
he would finally end his long war of nerves with Sinn Fein.
	   As Clinton concluded a fruitful three-day swing through both
parts of Ireland, he told more than 20,000 people crowding
Limerick's central crossroads that the Northern Ireland agreement
should provide inspiration to entrenched conflicts worldwide.
	   ``You have made it possible for me ... to tell every warring,
feuding, hating group of people, trapped in the prison of their
past conflict, to look at Ireland and know there can be a better
day,'' Clinton declared to cheers and applause.
	   In Belfast, Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble scheduled
a meeting with Gerry Adams, ending his three-year refusal to talk
directly with the leader of the IRA-allied party and providing the
White House with its hoped-for outcome from the trip.
	   Clinton had urged direct discussions on Thursday when he was in
Belfast.
	   ``It's another positive development,'' said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
	   The meeting between Adams and Trimble will happen Tuesday or
Wednesday, said Dermot Nesbitt, a Trimble colleague.
	   Trimble, the would-be leader of Belfast's unformed new
government, and Adams both led their parties to accept April's
accord on how Northern Ireland should be governed. Trimble had sat
in the same room but refused to talk directly to Adams because of
the Irish Republican Army's unwillingness to start disarming as
evidence that the outlawed group's July 1997 truce is permanent.
	   Saturday's decision followed Trimble's earlier announcement
Monday in Belfast that he would lead round-table discussions with
all party leaders, including Adams, to start the process of forming
a government between the north's British Protestants and Irish
Catholics. Sinn Fein wants two of the expected 12 seats in the new
Belfast administration.
	   At Limerick, Clinton basked in the promise of peace and vowed to
continue U.S. support.
	   ``Three years ago in Dublin, I promised the people of Ireland
that as long as Ireland walks the road of peace, America will walk
with you,'' the president said. ``You have more than kept your part
of the deal and we will keep ours.''
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern led the president, Hillary
Clinton and the crowd in a moment's silence for the latest fatality
from political violence in Northern Ireland.

Gays testing new freedoms in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The groom wore a flashy gold
suit to Saturday's wedding reception. The bride wore a white satin
dress, a single strand of pearls adorning his neck. Yes, HIS neck.
	   Four years after apartheid ended in favor of racial equality,
gays are breaking barriers of their own. Two men, married secretly
by an Anglican cleric, plan to push those boundaries even further
when they seek to legalize their marriage before a magistrate _ the
first time it's been attempted, according to gay activists.
	   ``We put our hearts into this, and it wasn't a mock wedding,''
Desmond Kleynhans shouted above the din at his wedding reception.
``There's no reason why the state can't accept this as a normal
wedding and make it legal.''
	   The wedding is notable not only because it's a potential test
case, but also because it comes one month after the Anglican church
denounced homosexuality as a sin at a worldwide conference of
bishops in England.
	   The pastor conducted the wedding in a private home on Friday
night, declaring the couple married ``in the name of God'' after an
exchange of vows and rings. Because of church prohibitions against
same-sex marriages, it was not an Anglican wedding, and the pastor
fears retribution.
	   ``If word goes out that I conducted a gay wedding, I will lose
my job tomorrow,'' said the pastor, a bisexual who was interviewed
on condition of anonymity.
	   The revolutionary changes that have come to South Africa since
apartheid ended with all-race elections in 1994 have not been
restricted to race relations. Gay rights have also flourished.
	   Under apartheid, homosexual sex was a crime. Two members of the
same sex could not legally display any intimacy in public. Police
frequently beat up gays, who led an underground social life.
	   In 1996, South Africa became the first country to adopt a
constitutional clause preventing discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation. In May, a high court struck down apartheid-era
laws against gay and lesbian sex. And also this year, several
insurance companies allowed same-sex partners to be listed as
dependents for insurance benefits.
	   ``In the apartheid era it was dangerous to be gay,'' said Gavin
Hayward, publisher of Exit, a gay newspaper, as he sipped champagne
at the wedding reception in a gay bar. ``Now you can flaunt it
anywhere.''
	   But changing long-held opinions is another matter.
	   After Kleynhans revealed his homosexuality 10 years ago, his
family rejected him, prompting him to consider suicide. His
brother, a policeman, still cannot accept it. His mother, Susan
Lemmer, has come to.
	   After Kleynhans and his bride Malcolm Fella pulled up at the
reception in a chauffeured luxury convertible, their mothers joined
them, entwining arms with their sons. The mothers' eyes brimmed
with tears.
	   ``I feel both happy and sad,'' Mrs. Lemmer murmured afterward,
standing in the bar amid bridesmaids in drag and posters urging
safe sex.
	   ``I think every parent wants their kids to have a normal
wedding,'' she continued. ``But he's my son, and I love him for the
way he is. I'm happy, now, with what has happened.''
	   Her voice cracking, Fellas' mother added, ``I'm sad in a way,
but happy that they found each other.''
	   After honeymooning in a South African resort, the couple plans
to visit a magistrate to legalize the marriage. If they're refused,
they intend to appeal to the courts.

Son kills mother for marrying another man in east Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ A 20-year-old son has confessed to
killing his mother for marrying another man shortly after the death
of his father, police said Saturday.
	   A civil defense team and Lebanese army intelligence agents
retrieved the decomposed body of Nazeha al-Faqih, 65, from a well
in the town of Al Qaa, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of the city
of Baalbek, eastern Lebanon, on Saturday, police said. Baalbek is
85 kilometers (53 miles) northeast of the Lebanese capital, Beirut.
	   Police were acting on information from al-Faqih's son, Hussein
al-Hoq, who was arrested a few days ago.
	   Officials said al-Hoq confessed to police investigators that he
had killed his mother because she married another man shortly after
the death of his father.
	   A government coroner found al-Faqih died on Aug. 16. of severe
haemorrage caused by her head hitting stones in the well.

Explosion in Dagestan kills 17 people, injures dozens

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ A car bomb probably caused an
explosion that killed at least 17 people, including two children,
and gouged a five-meter (15-foot) crater in a street in the capital
of a restive southern Russian region, officials said Saturday.
	   The explosion apparently triggered a hostage-taking incident
later Saturday on the far northern island of Novaya Zemlya,
Interfax reported. Four sailors seized 24 students and teachers
from a school and demanded to be flown to Dagestan.
	   One of the sailors said he believed a relative might have died
in the explosion in Makhachkala, the news agency said. The sailors
and hostages were reported to be waiting at an airport, and
anti-terrorist troops had been deployed.
	   At least 80 people were injured in the Friday night explosion
and more than half remained in hospitals, according to the press
office of the regional administration of Dagestan.
	   The death toll was 17 as of Saturday afternoon, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said, citing the Emergency Situations Ministry. The
casualty toll was expected to rise, as NTV television said about
100 people were trapped in the rubble.
	   The Emergency Situations Ministry initially said the explosion
was caused by an artillery shell fired from an eastern suburb of
the Dagestan capital of Makhachkala.
	   But the local administration said Saturday that shards of glass
and metal fragments found in the bodies suggested a car bomb.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, which the
Dagestani government called ``a monstrous act of terrorism,''
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin blamed ``the criminal
world,'' according to the Interfax news agency. ``Actually, they
have declared war on us, and we accept it,'' he said.
	   Both President Boris Yeltsin and acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin sent condolence messages to authorities in Dagestan,
Interfax said.
	   Dagestan has been wracked by violence and kidnappings in recent
months as various religious and ethnic groups battle for power. It
has also been hit by spillover violence from breakaway Chechnya, on
its western border. A car bomb recently killed Dagestan's top
Islamic leader.
	   Friday's explosion occurred outside the local television center
on the street where Dagestan's prime minister, Khizri Shikhsaidov,
and Makhachkala Mayor Said Amirov live. Neither was hurt.
	   Shikhsaidov's motorcade had passed by the site only minutes
before the explosion, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, quoting
Dagestan's Interior Ministry.
	   Local TV commentator Angela Mamadibirova said the attack was
believed to be an attempt on Amirov's life. She said he has
survived 10 assassination attempts this year.
	   Later, television reporters speculated that the explosion had
been intended to destroy the television center. The TV building was
badly damaged, and 40 percent of its equipment destroyed, the
television report said.
	   A building housing an agricultural institute and 10 buildings
nearby were also damaged, the Interfax news agency said. Many
students living in a dormitory at the institute were injured by
glass shards, local television said.
	   Fifteen homes where 142 people lived were destroyed, reduced to
a pile of bricks, wood and twisted metal pipes. Fires caused by
broken gas pipes broke out in several houses.
	   The explosion left a crater 5 meters (16-1/2 feet) wide and 3
meters (nearly 10 feet) deep.
	   Rescuers with sniffer dogs, including airborne troops and
specially trained Emergency Situations Ministry workers flown in
from Moscow, searched for more victims on Saturday. Heavy rain
hampered their efforts.
	   The regional government declared Saturday and Sunday to be days
of mourning.

Report: Russian sailors arrested after seizing 24 hostages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with hostage-takers arrested, hostages freed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four armed Russian sailors were arrested Saturday,
hours after they seized 24 hostages in a remote northern region and
demanded to be flown to the troubled southern republic of Dagestan,
a news agency reported.
	   One of the hostage-takers was wounded when he and the others
were overpowered by special troops of the Federal Security Service,
Interfax reported. No hostage was reported hurt.
	   The hostage-taking apparently stemmed from an explosion,
believed to have been caused by a car bomb, that killed at least 17
people in the capital of Dagestan on Friday.
	   Interfax said one of the sailors explained his action by saying
that one of his relatives might have died in the blast. The other
three were described as participating out of solidarity.
	   Interfax said the seamen, believed to be from Dagestan, seized
17 students, six teachers and a principal from a school in Novaya
Zemlya, an island in the Barents Sea about 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) north of Moscow.
	   The group was taken to a military airfield by bus. A short time
later, the Federal Security Service (FSB) troops arrived and began
negotiating with the hostage-takers. After several hours of
negotiations, the troops carried out a successful operation to free
the hostages and seize the four sailors, Interfax reported.
	   Details of the operation were not immediately available.
	   In addition to demanding a plane to take them to Dagestan, the
four sailors had reportedly demanded arms.
	   The sailors were stationed on Novaya Zemlya to guard nuclear
installations at a port, the news agency said. It did not describe
the nature of the installations.
	   Desertion and violence have become relatively commonplace in the
Russian military as it grapples with severe economic and morale
problems.

	   OSASCO, Brazil (AP) _ A church roof collapsed during services in
a Brazilian town Saturday, killing 30 people and injuring 538 more,
firefighters said.
	   A congregation of 1,300 was in the church in Osasco, 9 miles (15
kms) southwest of Sao Paulo, when the roof came crashing down,
firefighter Fabio Leite said.
	   ``We were praying and had our eyes closed. When we opened them
the building was falling,'' worshipper Maria Aparecida Costa said
in a televised interview from a first-aid station. ``I fainted and
when I woke up I was buried.''
	   The roof's heavy wooden beams may have rotted, said Lourdes
Faccinalli, a spokeswoman for the town. It had been raining for
several hours before the accident.
	   ``We are not sure why the roof collapsed. We know the building
was over 40 years old and used to house a cinema,'' Leite said.
	   ``People had splinters and pieces of wood from the beams in
their bodies,'' Vitor Martins, director of a first-aid station,
said in a televised interview.
	   Twenty-one people were killed immediately and nine more died
later, Leite said. A further 538 people were being treated for
injuries, some serious, at seven hospitals.

Swiss rider wins first leg of Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CORDOBA, Spain (AP) _ Markus Zberg of Switzerland won the first
leg of the Tour of Spain on Saturday under a punishing Andalusian
sun.
	   A member of the Post Swiss team, he covered the 161.7-kilometer
(101 mile) route in and around the southern city of Cordoba in 4
hours, 11 minutes and eight seconds.
	   Second place went to Italy's Giuliano Figueras of the Mapei
team. The third place finisher was Frenchman Laurent Jalabert of
ONCE-Deutsche Bank. Both were four seconds behind Zberg.
	   It was cycling's first big race since the Tour de France in July
was marred by doping scandals.
	   Among the 22 teams taking part is Festina, the top-rated French
squad that was ejected from the Tour de France after admitting to
systematic use of performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Zberg won on Saturday by nipping ahead of the pack as it closed
in on the finish line.
	   Sunday's second leg is a 234.6 kilometer (147 mile) route from
Cordoba to the southern coastal city of Cadiz.

Island senator calls for U.S. bailout of territory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ If the federal
government can help bail out Asian and Russian economies, it should
consider taking over the dlrs 1 billion debt of this U.S. Caribbean
territory, a local lawmaker said.
	   The Virgin Islands has been hit by three devastating hurricanes
in the last decade and deserves help as much as the countries being
assisted by the U.S.-supported International Monetary Fund, said
territory Sen. David Jones.
	   ``Charity begins at home,'' said Jones. ``The United States has
a moral obligation to help the territory.''
	   Jones said Friday he will introduce a resolution calling for a
federal bailout when the Senate convenes late this month.
	   Others note, however, that bailout packages often come with
difficult strings attached.
	   The idea ``sounds good,'' said Republican legislator Holland
Redfield II. ``But tugging on Uncle Sam's beard has a price. We're
always complaining about the federal government being colonialist.
You can't have it both ways.''
	   Local lawmakers often complain that the federal government
imposes many unfunded mandates on the islands, such as the earned
income tax credit and welfare reform. They also note that many
federal programs designed for states are simply imposed on the
islands, which have a population smaller than many U.S. cities.
	   The territory's debt has risen to nearly dlrs 1 billion. A
recent dlrs 541 million bond issue refinanced older bond issues in
May. In addition, close to dlrs 200 million is owed to unionized
workers for salary increases. More than dlrs 100 million is owed in
overdue income tax refunds and vendor payments.

`Turandot' opens in Puccini's setting: China's imperial palace

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The opera ``Turandot'' opened in its authentic
setting for the first time Saturday _ the gardens, courtyards and
800 imperial buildings of the Forbidden City.
	   The backdrop for Puccini's Chinese fairy tale was an ancestral
temple, built, like other halls in the imperial compound, on a
stone platform, with a roof of gold tiles that sweeps up at the
edges and a facade of dark, earth-red latticed doors and pillars.
	   Sharon Sweet appeared as Turandot, the cruel Chinese princess
finally won over by the love of Calaf, sung by Kristjan Johannson.
Barbara Hendricks was Liu, the self-sacrificing slave.
	   Zubin Mehta conducted the orchestra of the Florence opera house,
and its chorus represented the masses of old Peking.
	   Director Zhang Yimou, known for films such as the
Oscar-nominated ``Raise the Red Lantern,'' wove in a variety of
Chinese arts: Peking Opera gestures, strong strokes of giant
calligraphy on the set, martial arts and dance.
	   All this and the shimmering silk costumes evoked Ming Dynasty
China (1368-1644), when the palace was new.
	   The costumes were silks of vivid blues, greens, oranges and
reds, all lavishly embroidered in a style similar to that of the
imperial court. They were made in Suzhou, the eastern Chinese city
famed for silk since the days of the emperors, by cottage-industry
artisans.
	   The most elaborate was the emperor's yellow robe sprawled over
with green dragons and a repeated pattern of the gold character
meaning longevity, a piece of handwork that took more than three
months to complete.
	   Top acoustical equipment ensured that the music soared for the
audience, a crowd of 3,500, instead of echoing off into the
Forbidden City.
	   Backstage before Act One, young Chinese soldiers in green
camouflage uniforms stood patiently for makeup. They played
soldiers on stage, wearing orange silk robes decorated with gold
brocade and red trim, matching material around their faces and
under their chins, and black helmets topped with upright red
plumes.
	   Zhang said in an interview that he envisioned the opera not as a
story focused on Turandot's vengeance but on the ultimate
``feelings of human community,'' and ``in the end, a beautiful
unity.''
	   Producer Michael Eckert said Zhang brought authenticity and a
Chinese point of view, making this version like none of the Western
productions of the opera.
	   Eckert said Saturday's performance was sold out and the weather
was a relief _ hot and muggy, but with a full moon and no rain.
	   The opera's publicity material promised that Beijing would be
mild and dry in September, ideal for open-air performances.
Wednesday, however, wasn't.
	   Gusty wind and a thunderstorm that night buffeted an audience of
about 2,000 Chinese waiting for a dress rehearsal. Clad in pastel
plastic ponchos distributed by opera staff, they waited nearly two
hours until the show was finally canceled.
	   The Chinese audience has been restricted by the price of tickets
at dlrs 150 to 1,200, compared with an average annual salary in
Beijing of about 10,000 yuan (dlrs 1,200).
	   Tickets were sold at reduced prices to Chinese for the dress
rehearsal and one of the nine performances.
	   Most of the full-price tickets have gone to foreigners living in
Beijing, said Joy Gong, a spokeswoman for the China Performing Arts
Agency, which is handling the Chinese side of the venture.
	   Other famous operas also have been staged in famous settings.
Verdi's ``Aida'' was done in 1994 amid the temples of the Valley of
the Queens in Luxor, Egypt, and ``Tosca'' was performed in 1992 in
the church, palace and castle in Rome where the tragedy is set.

Sjoland shoots 62 for four-shot lead

1999 Ryder Cup wil be staged at Brookline, Massachusetts. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CRANS-SUR-SIERRE, Switzerland (AP) _ Patrik Sjoland shot a
9-under par 62 on a soggy course Saturday, giving the Swede a
comfortable four-stroke lead going into the final round of the
European Masters.
	   Sjoland, winner of the Italian Open in April, closed out his
third round with four consecutive birdies and just two shots off
the Plan-Bramois course record.
	   ``Today was a nine out of 10,'' said Sjoland, whose 54-hole
total of 20-under 193 was one off the PGA European Tour record set
by comptatriot Anders Forsbrand on the same course 11 years ago.
``Fingers crossed for tomorrow.
	   ``I know it's going to be hard. All the pressure is on me
tomorrow.''
	   Germany's Sven Struver will be the closest to the 27-year-old
Swede after a 6-under 65 Saturday.
	   Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, No. 2 on the European Tour
money list, is another stroke further back after a 5-under 66.
	   Defending champion Costantino Rocca of Italy remained in
contention for a second consecutive title, sitting seven shots back
after finishing the day with a 4-under 67.
	   Switzerland's Christophe Bovet, second behind Sjoland after a
second-round 64 on Friday, struggled in the wet conditions and fell
nine shots off the pace with a 1-under 70.
	   Lee Westwood of England carded his best round of the tournament
finishing with a 5-under 66 but was 11 back of the lead at 204.
	   Colin Montgomerie, who missed his last two cuts, continued to
struggle, double-bogeying the 18th hole to finish with a 2-under 69
and was at 205.
	   Former European Ryder Cup captain Seve Ballesteros of Spain had
a 1-under 70 for the third consecutive day, leaving him at 210 and
one shot behind countryman Jose Maria Olazabal, who had a
third-round 69.
	   Start of third-round play was delayed two hours while workers
cleared the waterlogged fairways and bunkers after a night of
torrential rain.
	   The delay, however, failed to slow Sjoland who began his round
with an eagle on the par-5 opening hole, draining a 18-meter
(60-foot) putt.
	   Play was further delayed at noon, with golfers and spectators
observing a minute of silence for the 229 victims of Swissair
flight 111, which crashed off the east coast of Canada on Thursday,
killing all onboard.
	   ``I've only been in the lead once in Italy and I had a
three-shot lead there,'' said Sjoland, who finished fourth in Crans
Montana last year. ``I've got one more tomorrow. I shot 62 today
but probably somebody's going to do that tomorrow so I need to keep
playing as I am and not think too much about what the other guys
are doing.''
	   Aside from the 2 million franc (dlrs 1.2 million) purse up for
grabs, the tournament is the first European event which counts
valuable Ryder Cup points. Europe will attempt to defend its title
against the United States in Brookline, Massachusetts, next year.
	   ``I haven't thought much of Ryder Cup,'' said Sjoland. ``We'll
see at the end of the year. If I'm in a good position I'll put it
up as a goal.
	   ``I think three Swedes have realistic chances of the Ryder
Cup,'' estimated Sjoland. ``Hopefully I will be one of them. Yes, I
think I'm one of them.''

Grobbelaar lines up for Bury
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce
Grobbelaar made an expected return to English soccer action
Saturday when he lined up for Bury at Birmingham City.
	   The 40-year-old Zimbabwean 'keeper, cleared last year of
matchfixing charges, was named as a late replacement for Irish
international goalkeeper Dean Kiely.
	   Although he made a brilliant reflex-action save to foil
Birmingham's Nicky Forster, Grobbelaar was beaten in the 20th
minute by Dele Adebola as the Blues won 1-0 at St. Andrews.
	   ``Bruce is a credit to the game,'' said Bury manager Neil
Warnock. ``He is still a fine goalkeeper and I'm surprised that no
second or third division club have offered him a contract.''
	   Grobbelaar, who is under a suspended six-month ban after he
admitted breaking Football Association rules by predicting results
for a betting syndicate, also has been turning out this season for
semi-pro Chesham United.
	   ``I hope I've done myself some good playing against
Birmingham,'' he said after Saturday's game.
	   During a 19-year career in English soccer starting in 1979,
Grobbelaar helped Liverpool wins a European Champions Cup and six
domestic league titles before he moved on to Southampton and later
Plymouth Argyle.

Market slide makes economics priority at Rio Group summit

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Falling currency values and stock
selloffs dominated talks Saturday at the start of the 14-member Rio
Group summit of Latin American leaders, whose region has been
battered by fallout from the Asian and Russian crises.
	   Economic worries became the top priority at the annual one-day
session after Latin America's largest market, the Sao Paulo Stock
Exchange, suffered a 13.9 percent midday slide Friday and financial
markets throughout the region suffered declines.
	   ``The impact of the last two days on Latin America was something
that we probably hadn't expected so soon,'' Mexican Foreign
Secretary Rosario Green said.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico _ where the market also fell
and the peso hit a new low _ spoke with summit host Ernesto Perez
Balladares of Panama and other leaders before the summit's start to
suggest that they make the global financial crisis their focus,
Green said.
	   ``They are worried because it's a crisis that greatly affects
... themes such as commerce, investment and public spending,''
Green said.
	   Delegates, 10 presidents and stand-ins from four other nations,
were to sign a declaration Saturday expressing support for open
markets and concern about the financial instability sparked by
economic disasters in Asia and now Russia.
	   Zedillo and presidents Andres Pastrana of Colombia and Rafael
Caldera of Venezuela, who represent the ``Group of Three'' within
the Rio Group, met earlier Saturday.
	   They called on developed countries and international groups to
``adopt the necessary actions to confront the current world
financial crisis.''
	   They agreed that Latin American nations should be able to
withstand the troubles because their economic structures are
distinct from those of Asia and Russia.
	   Green said the Rio Group would examine the crisis overall and
discuss what steps each nation must take to keep the region's
economies healthy.
	   ``It's true that each country has to take its own
responsibility,'' she said. ``But it's a fact that we live in ...
an economy that is extraordinarily globalized and interconnected.
... In this sense, the consideration must be collective.''
	   The 59-point plan under discussion addresses regional unity, the
need to protect democracy and promote security, human rights
responsibilities, poverty, drug trafficking, terrorism, and the
promotion of sustainable development.
	   It calls for ``open and frank dialogue'' with the European Union
on economic relations.
	   It criticizes the U.S. Helms-Burton law, which punishes
businesses that trade with Cuba, as harmful to international
commerce and an example of one nation wrongly attempting to impose
its laws outside its territory.
	   Eight nations _ Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, Argentina,
Brazil, Peru and Uruguay _ founded the group in Rio de Janeiro in
1986. Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, and Paraguay joined later.
	   Two countries are the temporary representatives for their
regions: El Salvador for Central America and Guyana for the
Caribbean.

Rafter, Ivanisevic move into fourth round
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with early Saturday results; WILL be UPDATED. &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ His game again coming together at just the right
time, defending champion Patrick Rafter easily moved into the
fourth round at the U.S. Open on Saturday with a 6-1, 6-1, 6-1
victory over South African David Nainkin.
	   The third-seeded Rafter, who needed only 66 minutes to eliminate
Nainkin, dominated in every phase of the game. The Australian made
only seven unforced errors to go along with 28 winners. Nainkin, a
qualifier, had eight winners and 23 unforced errors.
	   Rafter, a surprise winner a year ago when he was the 13th seed,
came into this year's Grand Slam tournament after winning five
tournaments. With Rafter taking control in every way, Nainkin
didn't have a chance in a match that opened the day's proceedings
at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
	   Hard-serving Goran Ivanisevic needed a little longer to win his
third-round match. The Croatian left-hander beat Paul Haarhuis of
the Netherlands 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-4 in 1 hour, 49 minutes.
	   Two seeded players also moved into the fourth round in the
women's singles.
	   No. 5 Venus Williams advanced when Larisa Neiland retired after
five games with a bad back, and No. 13 Amanda Coetzer of South
Africa overcame Barbara Schett of Austria 3-6, 6-0, 6-3.
	   Neiland, a doubles specialist from Russia, was in pain almost
from the beginning of the match. She never moved from the baseline
when Williams would hit a drop shot, and she would stand and just
watch whenever the ball was hit close to the sideline.
	   During the changeover following the third game, Neiland asked
for a trainer. After dropping her serve for the third time, giving
Williams a 5-0 lead, WTA Tour trainer Liz Chaffin examined Neland's
back.
	   ``I can't still play,'' Neiland said.
	   She then went to Williams and shook hands.
	   ``Are you OK?'' Williams asked.
	   Neiland just dropped her head and walked off the court.

Swiss rider wins first leg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CORDOBA, Spain (AP) _ Markus Zberg of Switzerland surged ahead
at the line and won the first leg of the Vuelta de Espana on
Saturday under a punishing Andalusian sun.
	   A member of the Post Swiss team, he covered the 161.7-kilometer
(101 mile) route in and around the southern city of Cordoba in 4
hours, 11 minutes and eight seconds.
	   Italy's Giuliano Figueras of the Mapei team finished four
seconds behind Zberg in second place with Frenchman Laurent
Jalabert of ONCE-Deutsche Bank team beside him in third.
	   The tour of Spain is cycling's first big race since the Tour de
France in July was marred by doping scandals.
	   Among the 22 teams taking part is Festina, the top-rated French
squad that was ejected from the Tour de France after admitting to
systematic use of performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Sunday's second leg is a 234.6-kilometer (147-mile) route from
Cordoba to the southern coastal city of Cadiz.

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Saturday, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   Two fighter jets fired four missiles at the hills of Mazraat
Iqmata and Mlita in the Iqlim al Tuffah province, a Hezbollah
stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied border enclave in south
Lebanon, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the targeted area, but there
were no immediate reports of casualties from the raid.
	   Lebanese army anti-aircraft guns and Hezbollah fighters fired at
the Israeli jets, but missed, the official National News Agency
reported.
	   Iqlim al Tuffah, a frequent target of Israeli warplanes, is used
by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group as a base to launch
attacks on Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen in
the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has led the fight to oust some
1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 members of the Israeli-allied
South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to try to protect its northern
settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Indonesia takes no prizes in JVC Asian badminton tourney

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chen Gang swept past Indonesia's
Marleve Mainaky 15-6, 15-9 Saturday to take the men's crown and
help give China three of the five titles at Asian Badminton
Championships.
	   Mainaky's defeat sent perennial power Indonesia home without any
titles from the dlrs 136,000 tournament.
	   It was a shock result for a country that has produced a host of
world-class players over the years.
	   What was even more agonizing for the Indonesians was the overall
victory for the Chinese, expected to be their main rivals at the
Asian Games in Bangkok in December.
	   Ye Zhaoying took the women's singles title and Ge Fei and Gu Jun
the women's doubles crown. South Korea claimed the other two
titles, the men's doubles and mixed doubles.
	   Ye, who won the Singapore Open last month, claimed her crown by
beating Gong Zhichao 11-5, 13-12 in all-Chinese final.
	   In another all-Chinese tussle, the top-seeded duo of Ge and Gu
routed Qin Yiyuna and Tang Hetian 15-8, 15-7.
	   The top-seeded South Korean mixed doubles tandem of Kim
Dong-moon and Ra Kyung-min, ranked third in the world, had little
trouble with No. 2-ranked and last year's singles champion Sun Jun
and his partner Ge 15-7, 15-8 defeat.
	   In the men's doubles final, South Korea's Kang Kyung-jin and Ha
Tae-kwon defeated the Chinese duo of Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei 12-15,
15-11, 15-13.

<TEXT>
	   CORDOBA, Spain (AP) _ Markus Zberg of Switzerland won the first
leg of the Tour of Spain on Saturday under a punishing Andalusian
sun.
	   A member of the Post Swiss team, he covered the 161.7-kilometer
(101 mile) route in and around the southern city of Cordoba in 4
hours, 11 minutes and eight seconds.
	   Second place went to Italy's Giuliano Figueras of the Mapei
team. The third place finisher was Frenchman Laurent Jalabert of
ONCE-Deutsche Bank. Both were four-tenths of a second behind Zberg.
	   It was cycling's first big race since the Tour de France in July
was marred by doping scandals.
	   Among the 22 teams taking part was Festina, the top-rated French
squad that was ejected from the Tour de France after admitting to
systematic use of performance-enhancing drugs. None of its nine
riders finished in the top 20 on Saturday.
	   Zberg won by nipping ahead of the pack as it closed in on the
finish line.
	   Sunday's second leg is a 234.6 kilometer (147 mile) route from
Cordoba to the southern coastal city of Cadiz.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II exalted Mother Teresa on
Saturday as ``a gift from God,'' leading a day of tributes amid the
grandeur of St. Peter's Square and the gold of St. Peter's Basilica
to the cotton-robed nun of India's slums.
	   In Calcutta, thousands gathered at the Mother House of her
Missionaries of Charity order to lay flowers at her grave and hear
prayers marking the first anniversary of Mother Teresa's death.
	   Nuns of her order also stayed with their daily routine of
providing free meals across the city, headquarters of charitable
missions that feed the poor and tend the sick around the world.
	   ``This little lady, coming from a humble family, what marvelous
work she was able to accomplish!'' John Paul told a lay conference
of Italian Catholics spread out across vast St. Peter's Square.
	   ``In reality, Mother Teresa was a gift from God to the poorest
of the poor,'' the pope said.
	   Exhorting her admirers, he said: ``Let us not forget the great
example left by Mother Teresa, and let us not limit our
commemorations to words.''
	   Italian Cardinal Pio Laghi presided over a memorial Mass earlier
in the day in St. Peter's Basilica _ a tribute more commonly
extended to princes of the church than to nuns. Cardinals in rich
robes stood among plain nuns in blue-bordered saris, all paying
homage.
	   Citing her own words, Laghi reminded her followers of the
simplicity of both Mother Teresa _ ``I am only a poor woman who
prays'' _ and of her message _ ``God has not called us to be
successful, but to be faithful.''
	   Later, the Vatican was opening one of its halls for taping of a
TV special marking the anniversary, featuring tributes from
personalities ranging from Kofi Annan and Yasser Arafat to actor
Ben Kingsley.
	   The pope's remarks were to air as part of the special, although
he himself was to take no direct part in the glitz of a
commemoration that was to feature Italian TV celebrities, singers
and models, all in a building decked out in Mother Teresa's blue
and white.
	   Despite the Vatican's lavish tributes, John Paul has made clear
that the church will wait the mandated five years after death
before allowing the process of canonization to begin.
	   Supporters of Mother Teresa already are trying to gather
evidence of miracles for sainthood, although her successor at the
order, Sister Nirmala, said Saturday in Calcutta no such miracles
had yet been confirmed.
	   In the Mass, Laghi cited Mother Teresa's own response when asked
once if she had ever assisted in any miracles:
	   ```Each day is a kind of miracle. ... The greatest miracle of
all is that God uses someone as insignificant as us for
accomplishing the work of his love.'''
	   In a project with her own blessing, followers are seeking to
commemorate her by opening a hospital in impoverished Albania, her
homeland. Her order is pushing her mission as well, with plans to
establish 19 more homes around the world by year's end, Sister
Nirmala said.
	   In Calcutta, where Mother Teresa died at 87, hundreds lined up
starting at dawn to place bouquets at her tomb, simply decorated
with white roses and marigolds.
	   ``I came here to pay tribute to the great soul. In her death
last year, I lost my mother again,'' said Arun Nath, 50, a disabled
man whose treatment Mother Teresa funded.
	   A year after Mother Teresa's death, the sense of loss and sorrow
remains fresh, Sister Nirmala said. At the same time, ``We are
aware that Mother is with us, spiritually.''

	   GOEPPINGEN, Germany (AP) _ Six people were injured when radical
rightists and leftists clashed Saturday during a political
demonstration in Goeppingen, police said. Twenty-two people were
arrested.
	   Police said the trouble started when some 100 members of the
radical rightist National Party of Germany attempted to hold a
rally in the city about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Stuttgart.
	   About 1,000 anti-rightists and leftist held a sit-in and started
throwing bottles and rocks at party members attempting to reach the
site of the rally in city center, police said.
	   The rally was called off following the arrests.
	   Most of those arrested, which included both rightists and
leftist, were released after identity checks, police said.

Tension rises in Bosnia as OSCE bans 15 Croat candidates; denounces
</HEADLINE>
state media in nearby Croatia
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Croatian television statement &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDAR S. DRAGICEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In a showdown with Bosnia's
main Croat party, international overseers banned 15 of its
candidates from next week's election and threatened to ban another
every 24 hours until the party stops broadcasting ``propaganda''
from neighboring Croatia.
	   The Bosnian branch of the Croatian Democratic Union, led by
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, denounced the action as an
indirect attempt to ``impose election results.''
	   In a statement Saturday, the party, known by its Croatian
language initials HDZ, threatened to ``reconsider our
participation'' in the Sept. 12-13 elections if the decision is not
reversed.
	   Last month, the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe ordered Croatia's state-run television to
provide fair coverage and equal access for all political parties
competing in Bosnia's Sept. 12-13 election.
	   Since Croatian television is controlled by the HDZ-dominated
government in Zagreb, the OSCE, which is overseeing Bosnia's
election, threatened to ban the party's candidates in Bosnia if the
station did not comply.
	   In a statement Friday, the OSCE said Croatian television had
ignored the warning, serving instead as ``a propaganda device'' for
candidates of the HDZ party.
	   ``If Croatian Radio-Television doesn't comply with the decision
... every 24 hours another (HDZ) candidate will be struck from the
list until (the station) complies,'' the statement added.
	   In the Croatian capital Zagreb, the director of Croatian Radio
and Television, Ivica Vrkic, expressed ``shock and dismay'' at the
``ungrounded accusations'' and accused the OSCE of ``championing
its own interests'' in Bosnia.
	   Although the station is located in Croatia, signals are relayed
from transmitters in parts of Bosnia seized by Bosnian Croat
fighters in the 1992-1995 Bosnian war.
	   OSCE maintains that this gives it the authority to hold a
station in a foreign, sovereign country to election rules
established following the Dayton Peace Accord which ended the
Bosnian war. Tudjman signed the Dayton pact.
	   Five of the banned candidates were running for the national
parliament and the others for a local, or cantonal, assembly.
	   Hundreds of HDZ candidates are running for various offices
during the two-day election, including the Croat seat on the
three-member joint presidency as well as national, regional and
local posts.
	   The action could favor a second Croat part, the New Croat
Initiative, which broke away from Tudjman's party in June. The
Intiative, led by Kresimir Zubak, supports a multi-ethnically
integrated Bosnia as foreseen by the Dayton accords.
	   Zubak holds the Croat seat on the collective Bosnian presidency
along with representatives of the Muslims and Serbs.
	   During the Bosnian war, each of the three ethnic groups
controlled broadcast media in its on territory. A major goal of the
internationally directed reconstruction effort has been to build a
media which transcends ethnic and cultural rivalries.

Savage axed from Welsh team for being disrepectful to opponent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Welsh soccer player Robbie Savage was
ordered out of his team hotel for being ``disrespectful'' to an
opponent hours before Wales was due to play Italy in a Euro 2000
qualifier at Liverpool.
	   Welsh coach Bobby Gould dropped the Leicester midfielder from
the team on Saturday morning after watching a television interview
in which Savage threw away a t-shirt which clearly displayed the
name of Italian captain Paolo Maldini.
	   The Welsh Football Association released a statement Saturday
saying Savage had been ``both disrespectful to his team-mates and
highly derogatory to Italian defender Palol Maldini by throwing
away his shirt.''
	   The statement said Gould dropped Savage from the team for the
match against Italy but there were indications that the midfielder
may have been reprieved.
	   ``A decision will be taken later as to whether Savage will be
offered the chance to rejoin the squad,'' the statement said.
	   ``The other members of the squad and members of the backroom
staff offer their sincere apologies to Paolo Maldini for this
disrespectful act.''
	   Gould said players should be more respectful about the game.
	   ``Players must realise that they have a duty to put-up on the
field of play and shut-up off it, otherwise this game, which is
loved by millions, will be in very serious trouble indeed,'' the
Welsh manager said.
	   The interview was recorded for Sky TV on Wednesday and was
screened on Friday and again on Saturday. Producers of the program
said the Welsh officials had misinterpreted Savage's actions and a
Sky spokesman said the interview was not intended to be
disrespectful.
	   ``It was clear that the feature was a lighthearted piece about
fashions. It must be seen in the correct context,'' he said.
	   ``Anyone watching the whole feature would know that it was not a
serious gesture and that no offense was intended.
	   ``There should be a spirit of fun in football and the reaction
to such an obviously lighthearted feature is very disappointing.''
	   Savage declined to discuss the matter and reportedly visited
family in neigbouring Wrexham after being ordered to leave the team
hotel.

Jones caps unbeaten season with six-figure payday

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Not bad for 10.83 seconds of work.
	   That's how long Marion Jones needed to win the 100 meters dash
Saturday at the IAAF Grand Prix Finals and pocket over dlrs 600,000
on track and field's biggest single payday, capping a spectacular,
undefeated season.
	   The American, who only committed to the sport full-time two
years ago, also won the long jump about an hour earlier as she
improved to 35-for-35 for all events in 1998.
	   ``I know anybody's capable of challenging me, so I have to make
sure I'm on each time,'' said Jones, who overcame a slow start to
beat Sevatheda Fynes of the Bahamas by 0.27 seconds in the dash.
	   That victory gave Jones one-third of the dlrs 1 million Golden
League jackpot, in addition to dlrs 200,000 for the women's overall
Grand Prix title and dlrs 50,000 for the race win. She got another
50,000 by winning the long jump with a top effort of 7.13 meters
(23 feet, 4 3-4 inches) on the cool, overcast afternoon at Luzhniki
Olympic Stadium.
	   Jones shared the jackpot _ for athletes who win their events at
all six Golden League meets plus the GP Finals _ with Hicham El
Guerrouj of Morocco and Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia, who also
remained unbeaten for the year with dominating wins.
	   World champion and record-holder El Guerrouj ran the final lap
of the 1,500 meters alone and won in 3:32.03, while Gebrselassie
took the 3,000 in a relatively slow 7:50.
	   ``It doesn't matter if the money was there or not,'' said
Gebrselassie, who extended his outdoor winning streak to 20 races.
``The most important thing is to win and be the best.''
	   Jones certainly lives up to that credo.
	   After putting aside basketball _ she steered North Carolina to
the 1994 NCAA championship _ Jones burst onto the scene with U.S.
and world titles in the 100 last year. She continues to improve and
make clear that her stated ambition of winning four gold medals at
the 2000 Olympics is not out of reach.
	   ``I'm not going to blow everyone away just by walking on the
track. But I am very confident,'' Jones said.
	   For the first time this season, she had to do the long jump
before the dash _ and then had to endure four false starts in the
100. But she was still unstoppable.
	   ``Obviously it was unfortunate to have all those (false starts)
today,'' the 22-year-old said. ``We don't want to be out there as
long as we were. I just tried to shake each one off and re-focus.''
	   She finished the Grand Prix season with 130 points, 23 more than
overall runner-up Svetlana Masterkova of Russia, who won the
women's 1,500 Saturday in 4:03.79.
	   El Guerrouj was among the athletes who had asked organizers to
switch venues because of the financial and political crisis in
Russia. But he showed up _ ``We were a little bit worried, but once
we arrived everything was fine,'' he said _ and wrapped up the
men's overall Grand Prix title with 136 points, to 114 for
Gebrselassie.
	   The only other person in contention for the Golden League
jackpot heading to Moscow was Bryan Bronson, but the American faded
to sixth in the 400 hurdles as France's Stephane Diagana won in
48.30. Bronson lost steam coming off the next-to-last hurdle and
struggled home in sixth place in 48.94, snapping a 17-race unbeaten
streak.
	   All event winners picked up dlrs 50,000 as the
anachronistically-named International Amateur Athletic Federation
handed out a total of about dlrs 4.2 million.
	   Russia's Natalya Sadova won the women's discus with a
season-best effort of 68.50 meters (224 feet, 9 inches). World
champion Beatrice Faumuina was fourth.
	   Other women's winners were Gete Wami in the 3,000, Michelle
Freeman in the 100 hurdles, Falilat Ogunkoya in the 400, and Tanja
Damaske in the javelin.
	   On the men's side, winners included Hungary's Tibor Gecsek in
the hammer, veteran Frankie Fredericks in the 100, record-holder
Javier Sotomayor in the high jump, Maksim Tarasov in the pole
vault, Charles Friedek in the triple jump, world champion John
Godina in the shot put, and Mark Richardson in the 400. World and
Olympic champion Michael Johnson, citing fatigue, did not enter the
400.

Rafter into Open's round of 16

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Patrick Rafter's compact ponytail peeked out
from under his baseball cap as he came to the net against
overmatched David Nainkin at the U.S. Open Saturday.
	   With zinc oxide smeared across his face, protecting him from the
sun, the defending U.S. Open champion looked like a racoon on the
prowl, wiping out Nainkin 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 in only 66 minutes.
	   ``He kept firing first serves down, not giving me any rhythm,''
Nainkin said. ``He never gave me a chance to get back into it.
That's why he's a top five player, because he'll just close you out
if you're not having a good day.''
	   Rafter won 33 of 39 first-serve points and converted seven of 10
break-point opportunities, eventually just squeezing the resolve
out of Nainkin on a windy, tricky afternoon.
	   ``He's a smart player,'' Nainkin said. ``He doesn't miss too
many balls from the back. He's different. He's dangerous.''
	   After a five-set first-round struggle against Hicham Arazi,
Rafter is taking no chances.
	   ``There's a certain pressure that goes with Grand Slams,''
Rafter said. ``It was very important to get through that first
round. You feel big relief. The first round is always more
difficult in a major and the defending champion has never lost in
the first round at the U.S. Open.''
	   Rafter came close. He was down two sets and down a break point
at 3-3 in the third before recovering against Arazi. ``I wasn't
exactly confident,'' he said. ``At crunch time, I was taking risks
and it worked for me.''
	   He hasn't lost a set since, sweeping Hernan Gumy and Nainkin and
now he's in the round of 16. ``Now I can relax even more,'' he
said.
	   Well, not really.
	   Repeating a first championship at the U.S. Open is no simple
matter. Only three times in the Open era has a first-time winner
successfully defended his title. The others were John McEnroe in
1979 and 1980, Ivan Lendl, who won three straight from 1985-87, and
Stefan Edberg in 1991 and 1992.
	   Next up for Rafter is Goran Ivanisevic, who was a straight-sets
winner over Paul Haarhuis 7-6, 6-3, 6-4 Saturday. Rafter expects
the Wimbledon finalist will be a tough test.
	   ``I think he'll be very dangerous,'' Rafter said, ``I've got to
get his serve back. If I concentrate, there's no reason I can't
win.''
	   Ivanisevic is something of a wild card and Rafter knows it.
	   ``He's very unpredictable,'' the Australian said. ``Even he'll
admit it. When he's on, he's on. We're good mates. He's open and he
likes to have fun. We'll do our business and when we get off, we'll
be good mates.''

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Some hugged one another, others
stood alone. One woman plucked wildflowers near the base of the
lighthouse, then crouched and stared out to sea.
	   More than 300 relatives of Swissair Flight 111 victims, their
privacy protected by police and military escorts, are mourning
together and visiting Peggy's Cove _ the coastal town closest to
where their loved ones died in the crash Wednesday that killed 229
people.
	   Despite intensive efforts, including deployment of a submarine
equipped with sonar, searchers have been unable to locate the
plane's flight-data and voice recorders, which could shed light on
the cause of the crash.
	   Philippe Bruggisser, chief of Swissair's parent SAirGroup, said
Saturday in Zurich, Switzerland, that Canadian authorities resumed
their search for the black boxes with ships and divers.
	   Canadian authorities said they will release the conversation
between pilots and the ground station later Saturday, he said.
	   Most of the victims' bodies have not been recovered yet, and
most of the human remains retrieved so far are fragments, slowing
the identification process.
	   On Friday, about a dozen relatives who arrived on a series of
flights from New York and Geneva made the trip to the fishing
village near Halifax that has become the base for searchers.
	   Tim Larson of East Hartford, Connecticut, said it was a painful
journey to see the site where his wife's uncle Victor Rizza, 58,
had died.
	   ``I think most people are resigned that their loved ones are
with their God and their maker,'' Larson said. ``You hear about
this stuff and you see it. It's not supposed to happen to you and
when it does, it hurts.''
	   Peter Gerety _ who lost his brother, U.N. worker Pierce Gerety,
in the crash _ carried two rocks off the beach.
	   ``I just felt like having a memento. It was such a beautiful
place, and that's the irony of it.''
	   Swissair chief executive Jeff Katz said a private,
non-denominational memorial service would be held Saturday for the
victims. The time of the service was not provided to the media.
	   Family members were set up in rubber army tents on a bluff
overlooking the ocean with clergy from different denominations
available for counseling.
	   Several people got off a blue charter bus Saturday morning with
bouquets and wreaths of yellow and purple flowers. A few people put
their hands to their faces as they saw the crash site for the first
time.
	   The plane, en route from New York to Geneva, disappeared from
radar screens 16 minutes after its pilots reported smoke in the
cockpit.
	   Air traffic controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, advised the
pilots to make an emergency landing in Halifax, but the MD-11
wide-body jet never made it, crashing into the ocean 30 miles (50
kilometers) to the south.
	   At a press conference Friday, the chief investigator defended
the actions of the cockpit crew, saying their last conversation
with controllers was conducted in a professional manner.
	   Vic Gerden of Canada's Transportation Safety Board refused to
speculate on what happened in the jet's final moments.
	   ``I don't deal in maybes, could haves and would haves,'' he
said. ``The crew indicated there was smoke in the cockpit. We don't
have further indication of specific problems.''
	   Gerden said the plane descended rapidly while trying to reach
Halifax and made a couple of sharp turns over the coast while
dumping fuel.
	   Katz told a news conference the three-engine jetliner was well
maintained, saying it ``had a clean bill of health.''
	   He said Swissair had complied with all directives from U.S.
aviation officials advising of wiring problems in MD-11 jets. Two
such advisories in 1996 and 1997 warned of potentially hazardous
wiring in the cockpit and in a rear consol for flight attendants.
	   Authorities say the wreckage is so fragmented that it may be
difficult to reconstruct the plane, as would normally be done in
the investigation.
	   The hunt has turned up no piece of wreckage bigger than a
kitchen tabletop, though 100 pieces of luggage were recovered
Friday.
	   Authorities were mapping the ocean floor in preparation for
sending down a small, remote-controlled submersible to investigate
the sea bed.
	   Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, Dr. John Butt, said X-rays
and dental charts would be needed to identify the victims. He said
relatives would not be pressured to come to a makeshift morgue at
an air base to assist with the identifications.
	   The family members who made the trip to Peggy's Cove on Friday
got an escort from soldiers as they got out of their vehicles. The
throng of reporters at the site was kept at a distance.
	   Valerie Warren was among the volunteer bus drivers who picked up
mourners at the Halifax airport.
	   ``It was a very quiet ride in,'' she said. ``A baby crying was
the only noise I heard.''
	   Many relatives chose not to accept Swissair's offer to bring
them to the crash scene, including former boxing champion Jake
LaMotta, whose son Joe was on the doomed airplane.
	   ``Why bring on the extra grief?'' said LaMotta, 76, who lost his
only other son, Jake Jr., in February. ``I'm pretty on in years. I
don't want to face it 'til I have to. ... It's just too much for me
now.''
	   The tragedy continued Saturday in the wake of the crash as the
brother of one of the victims died after becoming ill on a Swissair
flight from Chicago to Zurich.
	   The aircraft made an unscheduled landing overnight in Toronto
and the 37-year-old man, who was not identified, later died in
hospital, Swissair said in a statement.

Iran warns Taliban it will act unless Iranians are freed

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ With its troops, tanks and fighter planes
massed on the border, Iran warned Afghanistan's Taliban militia
Saturday that it would take steps unless 11 diplomats and 31 other
Iranians were freed.
	   State-run Tehran radio said Iran would take ``the necessary
measures within the framework of legitimate defense'' if the
Iranians were not freed.
	   The radio did not specify what action Iran would take, but
Tehran newspapers and analysts have spoken increasingly in past
days of a possible military strike against the Taliban.
	   ``I think that whether we like it or not, we are heading toward
some kind of military confrontation with the Taliban,'' Sadegh
Zibakalam, professor of politics at Tehran University, said in an
interview with the newspaper Toos.
	   Iran carried out military maneuvers on its Afghan border this
week in which 70,000 troops, more than 150 tanks and squadrons of
fighter planes were involved. Tehran has said the forces will
remain in the area.
	   But, with memories of the 1980-88 war still fresh in Iranian
minds, newspapers have warned the government against stepping into
a quagmire.
	   The hard-line Qods daily said Saturday that the Taliban must be
given an ``unforgettable lesson.''
	   ``But this lesson must follow a thorough understanding of all
the aspects and consequences,'' the paper warned.
	   Iran accuses the Taliban, which controls most of Afghanistan, of
seizing 47 Iranians when its forces captured the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the 11 diplomats, but it
freed five Iranian truck drivers on Thursday.
	   Iranian officials say there is a growing awareness that the
diplomats have probably been killed.
	   A member of an Iranian delegation that traveled to Afghanistan
last week said their mission was only to find and retrieve the
remains of the diplomats.
	   Iran's newspaper Abrar has quoted Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed
Mutawakil as saying the diplomats were probably killed by
opposition forces during the battle for Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   He said there was no one inside the Iranian consulate in
Mazar-e-Sharif when the Taliban entered the city.
	   ``The only likely possibility is that they were killed. We'll
try ... to find their bodies,'' the Farsi-language paper quoted
Mutawakil as saying.
	   Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Saturday
that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is to send a mission to
Afghanistan to investigate the fate of the Iranians, Iranian
television said.
	   Kharrazi said Annan's decision followed their talks Friday on
the sidelines of the Nonaligned Movement summit in South Africa.

Report: Russian sailors arrested after seizing 24 hostages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with reports now saying five sailors involved,
guard killed, no suspects injured, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five armed Russian sailors were arrested Saturday,
hours after they allegedly killed a guard and seized 47 hostages in
a remote northern region, a news agency reported.
	   All the hostages were released unharmed, and no hostage-takers
were hurt when they were overpowered by special troops of the
Federal Security Service (FSB), Interfax said.
	   The sailors had demanded a plane to take them to the southern
Russian region of Dagestan, a troubled area in the Caucasus
mountains, Interfax said, citing the director of the FSB, Vladimir
Putin.
	   The hostage-taking apparently stemmed from a suspected car-bomb
explosion that killed at least 17 people in the capital of Dagestan
on Friday.
	   Interfax said one of the sailors explained his action by saying
one of his relatives might have died in the blast. The others were
described as participating out of solidarity.
	   Putin said the seamen, believed to be from Dagestan, began their
rampage by killing a guard and taking a small cache of arms from
the base where they were stationed in Novaya Zemlya, an island in
the Barents Sea about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) north of
Moscow.
	   They later seized 40 students, six teachers and one other sailor
from the small community of Rogachevo, the official said.
	   The group was taken to a military airfield by bus. A short time
later, FSB troops arrived and began negotiating with the
hostage-takers. After several hours of negotiations, the troops
carried out a successful operation to free the hostages and seize
the five sailors, Interfax reported.
	   In addition to demanding a plane to take them to Dagestan, the
sailors had reportedly demanded arms.
	   The sailors were stationed on Novaya Zemlya to guard nuclear
installations at a port, the news agency said. It did not describe
the nature of the installations.
	   Desertion and violence have become relatively commonplace in the
Russian military as it grapples with severe economic and morale
problems.

Explosion in Dagestan kills 17 people, injures dozens

hostage-takers, hostages &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ A car bomb probably caused an
explosion that killed at least 17 people, including two children,
and gouged a five-meter (15-foot) crater in a street in the capital
of a restive southern Russian region, officials said Saturday.
	   The explosion apparently triggered a hostage-taking incident
later Saturday on the far northern island of Novaya Zemlya,
Interfax reported. Five sailors reportedly seized 47 people,
including 40 students, and demanded to be flown to Dagestan.
	   They were later arrested and the hostages freed, the news agency
said.
	   One of the sailors had said he believed a relative might have
died in the explosion in Makhachkala, the news agency said.
	   At least 80 people were injured in the Friday night explosion
and more than half remained in hospitals, according to the press
office of the regional administration of Dagestan.
	   The death toll was 17 as of Saturday afternoon, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said, citing the Emergency Situations Ministry. The
casualty toll was expected to rise, as NTV television said about
100 people were trapped in the rubble.
	   The Emergency Situations Ministry initially said the explosion
was caused by an artillery shell fired from an eastern suburb of
the Dagestan capital of Makhachkala.
	   But the local administration said Saturday that shards of glass
and metal fragments found in the bodies suggested a car bomb.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, which the
Dagestani government called ``a monstrous act of terrorism,''
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin blamed ``the criminal
world,'' according to the Interfax news agency. ``Actually, they
have declared war on us, and we accept it,'' he said.
	   Both President Boris Yeltsin and acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin sent condolence messages to authorities in Dagestan,
Interfax said.
	   Dagestan has been wracked by violence and kidnappings in recent
months as various religious and ethnic groups battle for power. It
has also been hit by spillover violence from breakaway Chechnya, on
its western border. A car bomb recently killed Dagestan's top
Islamic leader.
	   Friday's explosion occurred outside the local television center
on the street where Dagestan's prime minister, Khizri Shikhsaidov,
and Makhachkala Mayor Said Amirov live. Neither was hurt.
	   Shikhsaidov's motorcade had passed by the site only minutes
before the explosion, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, quoting
Dagestan's Interior Ministry.
	   Local TV commentator Angela Mamadibirova said the attack was
believed to be an attempt on Amirov's life. She said he has
survived 10 assassination attempts this year.
	   Later, television reporters speculated that the explosion had
been intended to destroy the television center. The TV building was
badly damaged, and 40 percent of its equipment destroyed, the
television report said.
	   A building housing an agricultural institute and 10 buildings
nearby were also damaged, the Interfax news agency said. Many
students living in a dormitory at the institute were injured by
glass shards, local television said.
	   Fifteen homes where 142 people lived were destroyed, reduced to
a pile of bricks, wood and twisted metal pipes. Fires caused by
broken gas pipes broke out in several houses.
	   The explosion left a crater 5 meters (16-1/2 feet) wide and 3
meters (nearly 10 feet) deep.
	   Rescuers with sniffer dogs, including airborne troops and
specially trained Emergency Situations Ministry workers flown in
from Moscow, searched for more victims on Saturday. Heavy rain
hampered their efforts.
	   The regional government declared Saturday and Sunday to be days
of mourning.

Finland 3, Moldova 2 in Euro Champs qualifying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Mika-Matti Paatelainen headed the
winner as Finland came from behind to defeat Moldova 3-2 Saturday
in the initial Group 3 European championship qualifier.
	   Paatelainen, a pro for Wolves in the English division one,
received a ball from Jonatan Johansson and beat the keeper from a
few meters in the 63rd minute.
	   Finland took an early lead as Joonas Kolkka stretched a foot to
hit the net first-time on a set piece, a throw-in by Jarkko Wiss
touched on by towering Sami Hyypia after seven minutes.
	   But Finland was shocked by two goals by Igor Oprea in less than
two minutes. The first was a 10th minute strike inside the penalty
box and the second, 90 seconds later, a shot after a long throw-in
over the defense.
	   The elusive Moldovans played a crisp passing game along the
ground and held their own well, tightly marking Finlands playmaker
Jari Litmanen on defense. But late in the first half Johansson was
played through with a penetrating pass by Paatelainen to even the
game at 2-2, at 44 minutes.
	   After Paatelainen's strike, Finland needed a first class save
ten minutes from the end by goalkeeper Antti Niemi, left one-on-one
against Alexandru Suharev, to preserve the lead.
	   Genadie Pusca of Moldova was ejected in the closing minutes for
a heavy clash on Litmanen.
	   Finland _ Antti Niemi; Harri Ylonen; Aarno Turpeinen (Juha Reini
46th), Marko Tuomela, Sami Hyypia, Tommi Kautonen; Jarkko Wiss,
Jari Litmanen, Joonas Kolkka (Sami Mahlio 72nd); Jonatan Johansson
(Antti Sumiala 79th), Mika-Matti Paatelainen.
	   Moldova _ Vasili Coselev; Oleg Fistican (Ion Tabanov 75th),
Sergei Stroyenko, Radu Rebeya (Ghenadie Pusca 46th), Ion
Titemitanu; Alexandru Guzun, Sergiu Epureanu (Alexandru Suharev
71st); Alexandr Curtianu, Vladimir Gaidamascu, Igor Oprea; Sergei

Switzerland remembers victims in national memorial service
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Canada-Swissair Crash &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland on Saturday held a national memorial
service for the victims of Swissair Flight 111, among them 41 Swiss
passengers and crew.
	   As church bells tolled, thousands filed silently into Geneva's
protestant cathedral for the early-evening interfaith service.
	   Many more stood outside the main door of the Saint-Pierre
cathedral, which remained open throughout the hour-long memorial.
	   In all, almost 3,000 people attended the public service, among
them relatives of some of those killed.
	   The simple memorial comprised mainly prayers from Protestant,
Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox priests, and from the Jewish,
Muslim and Buddhist faiths.
	   They were interrupted only by restrained music. Vincent Schmid,
the vicar of the cathedral, said prayer and music would say what
words could not.
	   During the proceedings 229 candles, one for each victim of
Thursday's crash off Nova Scotia, were lit in the cathedral.
	   ``The candles will burn on as we leave the cathedral,'' said
protestant priest William McComish as he concluded the service,
which was televised nationally.
	   Flowers were laid at the altar in memory of the victims.
	   The flags of Switzerland and the canton (state) of Geneva were
flown at half-staff throughout this city of 180,000.
	   Swiss Vice President Ruth Dreifuss represented the ruling
coalition cabinet at the service, organized by Geneva's Protestant
Church.
	   More services in memory of the crash victims are planned over
the next week.
	   Swissair is planning official memorial services next Friday in
New York, Geneva and Zurich. The United Nations, eight of whose
staff were killed, will hold its own service in midweek at the
organization's New York headquarters.

Hutu rebels storm western prison, free 3,000 inmates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rwandan radio saying the rebels killed three
teachers, details, in grafs 4-6; ADDS number of attackers in graf
2. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels attacked a prison in western
Rwanda and freed about 3,000 inmates suspected of involvement in
the 1994 genocide, authorities said Saturday.
	   Details were sketchy, but authorities in Kibuye, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) west of capital Kigali, said a group of 2,000
rebels on Friday overpowered the guards at Kivumu prison and set
people free.
	   Most of the inmates who had escaped returned voluntarily to the
prison by Saturday, officials said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The inmates were apparently afraid of army reprisals if
associated with the rebels.
	   State-run Radio Rwanda reported the rebels, attacking from the
nearby Mukura forest, had also attacked the Nyange secondary
school, killing three teachers.
	   ``Security forces intervened and inflicted a heavy defeat on the
infiltrators. Five guns were seized and many infiltrators killed,''
the radio said.
	   Unconfirmed reports put to 20 the number of those killed.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for the 1994 Hutu government-organized slaughter of more than
500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994 and ended the
killing. But rebels continued to launch attacks from their hideouts
in neighboring Congo, targeting road convoys, Tutsi genocide
survivors and Hutus suspected of collaborating with the
authorities.
	   Thousands of people are thought to have died since.
	   Rwandan prisons are crowded with about 130,000 people awaiting
genocide trials. The rebels often target prisons hoping to mobilize
the inmates _ most of whom Hutus _ into their ranks.
	   Popular support for the rebels among the majority Hutu
population appears to be declining and the rebels are increasingly
turning against Hutus who refuse to provide them with money, food
and shelter.
	   The jailbreak is the most serious incident in Rwanda since the
insurgents in eastern Congo, who include ethnic Tutsis, took
control of the east of the country Aug. 2 which the Hutu rebels
used as their rear base.

Government House renovation halted by discovery of pre-Columbian
</HEADLINE>
bones &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Part of the renovation
work at Government House on St. Croix was halted this week when
workers found pre-Columbian human bones at the site.
	   Workers digging a trench along the southeast corner of the
property found the skull and leg bones. Thomas R. Wheaton, an
archeologist for the Georgia-based New South Associates Inc., has
concluded that the bones date prior to 1492.
	   Under federal law, moving the bones could be difficult because
Native American groups must be consulted first. But descendants of
the original Taino and Carib Indian tribes that first inhabited
these islands are few and far between.
	   Territory officials are currently searching territorial statutes
to determine local guidelines regarding such finds.
	   Construction company officials said that the bones were found in
shallow ground with no other artifacts or additional human bones.
	   Workers are currently searching the site for more bones or other
burial sites before construction can resume on that area.
Meanwhile, work continues on the exterior and interior of the
building.
	   Government House was owned by the federal government until 1984.
After being damaged by hurricanes in 1989 and 1995, the local
government undertook the renovation in April 1997. While the
original cost was set at dlrs 8.9 million, costs have risen
steadily in recent years.

Swedes beat England despite Shearer strike, Ireland upsets Croatia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with later matches &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sweden shrugged off an early Alan Shearer strike
to hit back and beat England 2-1 in a European Championship
qualifying game Saturday.
	   The England captain fired his team ahead with a bending free
kick only two minutes into the game in Stockholm. But the Swedes,
who have not lost to England in Stockholm for 61 years, replied
with two goals in two minutes by Andreas Andersson (30th) and Johan
Mjallby (32nd).
	   ``It was a good start for us in the championship,'' said
Mjallby, after scoring his first goal in his seventh appearances
for Sweden. ``We had a nightmare start in the game.''
	   England also had Paul Ince sent off midway through the second
half for his second yellow card and Shearer had a penalty appeal
turned down in injury time.
	   Shearer couldn't believe that Italian referee Pierluigi Collina
didn't award a penalty when he went down near the end.
	   ``It was a penalty. I don't know why he didn't give it,'' the
Newcastle striker said. ``The player clipped my ankles. Maybe it
was the last minute and he was too frightened to do it.''
	   The Sweden-England Group 5 match was one of 21 qualifying games
spread over the weekend.
	   World Cup winner France was in action against Iceland in
Reykjavik in Group 5 while Ireland stunned World Cup semifinalist
Croatia 2-0 in Group 8 with early goals by Dennis Irwin and his
Manchester United colleague Roy Keane.
	   The Croats had two players, Mario Stanic and Krunoslav Jurcic,
expelled in the space of 90 seconds late in the game.
	   Irwin stroked home a fourth minute penalty after he had been
brought down and Keane added the second in the 15th minute to give
Ireland, which failed to qualify for the World Cup, a
confidence-boosting start.
	   ``It might surprise you but I was more worried when Croatia went
down to nine men,'' said Ireland coach Mick McCarthy. ``They seemed
to create more chances then and we became a little bit slack.''
	   Scotland, coming off its latest World Cup failure having never
made the second round in eight attempts, had to thank veteran
goalkeeper Jim Leighton for a 0-0 Group 9 tie in Lithuania. The
40-year-old 'keeper brilliantly kept out a header from Edgarras
Jankauskas.
	   Among other leading matches Saturday, Italy went to Liverpool to
face Wales and Denmark visited Belarus in Group 1, Ukraine faced
Russia in Kiev and Spain traveled to Cyprus.
	   In Sunday's games, Greece hosts Slovenia and Latvia goes to
Norway in Group 2, Bulgaria and Poland meet in Group 5, Hungary
hosts Portugal in Group 7, Malta visits Macedonia in Group 8 and
the Faeroe Islands welcome the Czech Republic in Group 9.

Congolese rebels leave for peace talks in Zimbabwe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Despite last-minute objections, Congolese
rebels sent a team to peace talks in Zimbabwe on Saturday in hopes
of negotiating a cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign troops.
	   Arthur Zahidi Ngoma, vice president of the rebel Congolese
Democratic Coalition, said the rebels decided to go despite
objections to receiving an invitation through their ally, Rwanda,
and not directly.
	   President Laurent Kabila has accused Rwanda and Uganda of
sponsoring the month-long rebellion against him, and demands their
withdrawal from Congolese soil. Uganda and Rwanda deny backing the
rebels.
	   The rebels also objected to Zimbabwe's mediation. Along with
Angola and Namibia, Zimbabwe has sent more than 2,800 troops to
support Kabila and defend the capital, Kinshasa, from rebel
advances.
	   The rebels insist that the revolt is a Congolese affair and must
be resolved within Congo.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ accuse Kabila of incompetence,
nepotism and corruption, problems Kabila promised to eradicate when
he toppled longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   There were no reports of fighting on Saturday.
	   In Harare, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said neither
Kabila nor the rebels wanted to continue fighting.
	   ``We should not continue to kill and subject the people of the
Congo to harsh treatment,'' he told reporters.
	   Mugabe said the next round of peace talks, set for Monday in the
Zimbabwean resort of Victoria Falls, received the backing of
leaders of the world's nonaligned nations at last week's summit in
Durban, South Africa. The rebels did not attend.
	   Rwanda will send a representative to the talks, but as an
observer.
	   It wasn't clear who would represent the rebels at Victoria
Falls. Ngoma said he was traveling with Bizima Karaha, who was
Kabila's foreign minister until he defected to the rebels, and who
has close ties to Rwanda.

Ukraine beats Russia 3-2 in Euro Champs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine delivered a 3-2 defeat to its
biggest soccer rival, Russia, in a European Championship qualifying
game Saturday.
	   Ukraine stunned the Russians in the 14th minute when Serhiy
Popov scored a powerful header, despite heavy resistance from
Russian defenders.
	   Then Ukrainian Serhiy Skachenko, who plays for the Russian club
Torpedo Moscow, went one-on-one with Russia's goalkeeper, Dmitri
Kharin, in the 25th minute and kicked the ball over him.
	   The Ukrainians controlled the ball for most of the game, not
allowing a single scoring opportunity for their opponents in the
first half. The situation did not change in the second half, but
mistakes made by Ukraine's defense allowed the Russians to score.
	   The Russians scored their first goal in the 66th minute after
Yevgeni Varlamov headed the ball into the net after getting a pass
from the left side.
	   However, Russia's rising spirits were crushed in the 74th minute
when Kharin was given a red card for pulling down Ukraine's leading
striker, Serhiy Rebrov. Rebrov then kicked in a powerful penalty
shot past Russia's second goalie, Stanislav Cherchesov.
	   The Russians, however, had their chances revived again in the
88th minute, when Viktor Onopko, who played his 60th match for the
national team, scored a header.
	   But the Ukrainian team, supported by more than 80,000 spectators
who filled Kiev's Respublikansky stadium, did not allow the Russian
side to create a single scoring opportunity in the remaining time.
	   Russia's Yuri Kovtun and Igor Yanovskiy and Ukraine's Serhiy
Kovalyov were all given yellow cards.
	   Lineups:
	   Ukraine - Oleksandr Shovkovsky, Andriy Husin, Volodymyr Mykytyn,
Oleksandr Holovko, Vladyslav Vashchuk, Yuriy Dmytrulin, Serhiy
Skachenko (Yuriy Kalitvintsev, 46th), Serhiy Popov, Serhiy Kovalyov
(Valery Kryventsov, 87th), Andriy Shevchenko, Serhiy Rebrov.
	   Russia - Dmitri Kharin , Valeri Minko, Igor Chugainov, Yuri

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland held a national memorial service
Saturday for the victims of Swissair Flight 111, which included 41
Swiss passengers and crew.
	   As church bells tolled, thousands of people filed silently into
Geneva's Protestant cathedral for the early-evening interfaith
service.
	   Many more stood outside the main door of the Saint-Pierre
cathedral, which remained open throughout the hour-long memorial.
	   In all, almost 3,000 people attended the public service, among
them relatives of some of those aboard the McDonnell-Douglas MD-11.
	   The simple memorial included prayers from Protestant, Roman
Catholic and Greek Orthodox priests, and from the Jewish, Muslim
and Buddhist faiths.
	   These were interspersed with restrained music. Vincent Schmid,
the vicar of the cathedral, said prayer and music would say what
words could not.
	   During the proceedings, 229 candles were lit, one for each
victim of Wednesday's crash of the Geneva-bound jet off Nova
Scotia.
	   ``The candles will burn on as we leave the cathedral,'' said
Protestant minister William McComish as he concluded the service,
which was televised nationwide.
	   Flowers were laid at the altar in memory of the victims.
	   The flags of Switzerland and the canton (state) of Geneva were
flown at half-staff throughout this city of 180,000.
	   Swiss Vice President Ruth Dreifuss represented the ruling
coalition cabinet at the service, organized by Geneva's Protestant
Church.
	   More services in memory of the crash victims are planned over
the next week.
	   Swissair is planning official memorial services Friday in New
York, which was the plane's departure point, Geneva and Zurich. The
United Nations, which lost eight staff members in the crash, will
hold its own service in midweek at the organization's New York
headquarters.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Some sobbing and stumbling, others
shivering silently in a brisk breeze, relatives of Swissair Flight
111's victims sent wreaths out to sea Saturday and carried away
jars of water from the ocean where their loved ones died.
	   Offshore from the mourners' granite rock viewpoint, more than 70
divers and a fleet of naval vessels, including a submarine,
intensified the search for the jumbo jet's missing fuselage and
flight-recorders. Their recovery would provide clues as to why the
plane crashed late Wednesday, killing all 229 people on board.
	   In all, more than 300 family members have flown to Halifax from
New York, the plane's starting point, and Geneva, its intended
destination. Most of them were driven in chartered buses Saturday
to Peggy's Cove, the tiny, picturesque fishing village that has
become the base for the search operation.
	   Police and soldiers kept a large media contingent well away from
a rocky ledge cordoned off for the mourners, and only a few agreed
to speak with journalists.
	   One of them was Claire Mortimer, 45, of Berkeley, California,
whose father, John Mortimer, a former executive of The New York
Times, was among the victims.
	   ``My father would have wanted me to be here,'' she said. ``It's
ironic that he has died in the ocean that he loved... In an odd
way, it's very comforting to me to come here and see this beautiful
place.''
	   Tim Larson of East Hartford, Connecticut, said earlier that it
was a painful journey to see the site where his wife's uncle Victor
Rizza, 58, had died.
	   ``I think most people are resigned that their loved ones are
with their God and their maker,'' Larson said. ``You hear about
this stuff and you see it. It's not supposed to happen to you and
when it does, it hurts.''
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police deployed boats to take wreaths
out to the crash site, a few miles (kilometers) from shore, and
bring back jars of seawater to be kept by relatives in remembrance.
	   One sobbing man stumbled as he walked along the rocks. A woman
wrapped in a blanket handed her baby to a companion and ran past a
barricade toward the sea, only to be stopped by grief counselors
who led her back to a tent.
	   Saturday afternoon, scores of the relatives gathered in a
Halifax convention center for a private memorial service.
	   Swissair also released a statement saying that the brother of
one of the victims had died Saturday after becoming ill on a
Swissair flight from Chicago to Zurich.
	   The aircraft made an unscheduled landing overnight in Toronto
and the 37-year-old man, who was not identified, later died in
hospital, according to the statement.
	   The day began with an expanded effort to search the ocean floor
for the plane's fuselage and flight recorders. The HMCS Okanagan, a
Canadian submarine, was deployed for a second day to make a sonar
map of the seabed, and 75 police and military divers were in action
for the first time.
	   Lt. Commander Mike Considine, a navy spokesman, said searchers
still had found no piece of wreckage larger than a car roof. Divers
and unmanned submersibles would be checking areas where sonar
probes suggested the possible presence of larger pieces, he said.
	   Security forces have declared the entire search area _ including
several miles (kilometers) of coastline _ a no-go zone for people,
boats and planes not involved in the search. About 250 soldiers
were combing the shoreline in search of debris and body parts.
	   The process of identifying the bodies was expected to take
weeks, because most of the human remains found so far have been
fragments.
	   Swissair's chief executive officer, Jeff Katz, said at a news
conference late Friday that the three-engine MD-11 had been well
maintained.
	   He said Swissair had complied with all directives from U.S.
aviation officials advising of wiring problems in MD-11 jets. Two
such advisories in 1996 and 1997 warned of potentially hazardous
wiring in the cockpit and in a rear console for flight attendants.
	   The pilot of Flight 111 reported smoke in the cockpit shortly
before crashing. The plane began heading toward Halifax to attempt
an emergency landing, made a couple of turns while descending and
dumping fuel, then disappeared from radar.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The opera ``Turandot'' opened in its authentic
setting for the first time Saturday _ the gardens, courtyards and
800 imperial buildings of the Forbidden City.
	   The backdrop for Puccini's Chinese fairy tale was an ancestral
temple, built, like other halls in the imperial compound, on a
stone platform, with a roof of gold tiles that sweeps up at the
edges and a facade of dark, earth-red latticed doors and pillars.
	   Sharon Sweet appeared as Turandot, the cruel Chinese princess
finally won over by the love of Calaf, sung by Kristjan Johannson.
Barbara Hendricks was Liu, the self-sacrificing slave.
	   Zubin Mehta conducted the orchestra of the Florence opera house,
and its chorus represented the masses of old Peking.
	   Director Zhang Yimou, known for films such as the
Oscar-nominated ``Raise the Red Lantern,'' wove in a variety of
Chinese arts: Peking Opera gestures, strong strokes of giant
calligraphy on the set, martial arts and dance.
	   All this and the shimmering silk costumes evoked Ming Dynasty
China (1368-1644), when the palace was new.
	   The costumes were silks of vivid blues, greens, oranges and
reds, all lavishly embroidered in a style similar to that of the
imperial court. They were made in Suzhou, the eastern Chinese city
famed for silk since the days of the emperors, by cottage-industry
artisans.
	   The most elaborate was the emperor's yellow robe sprawled over
with green dragons and a repeated pattern of the gold character
meaning longevity, a piece of handwork that took more than three
months to complete.
	   Top acoustical equipment ensured that the music soared for the
audience, a crowd of 3,500, instead of echoing off into the
Forbidden City.
	   Backstage before Act One, young Chinese soldiers in green
camouflage uniforms stood patiently for makeup. They played
soldiers on stage, wearing orange silk robes decorated with gold
brocade and red trim, matching material around their faces and
under their chins, and black helmets topped with upright red
plumes.
	   Zhang said in an interview that he envisioned the opera not as a
story focused on Turandot's vengeance but on the ultimate
``feelings of human community,'' and ``in the end, a beautiful
unity.''
	   Producer Michael Eckert said Zhang brought authenticity and a
Chinese point of view, making this version like none of the Western
productions of the opera.
	   Eckert said Saturday's performance was sold out and the weather
was a relief _ hot and muggy, but with a full moon and no rain.
	   The opera's publicity material promised that Beijing would be
mild and dry in September, ideal for open-air performances.
Wednesday, however, wasn't.
	   Gusty wind and a thunderstorm that night buffeted an audience of
about 2,000 Chinese waiting for a dress rehearsal. Clad in pastel
plastic ponchos distributed by opera staff, they waited nearly two
hours until the show was finally canceled.
	   The Chinese audience has been restricted by the price of tickets
at dlrs 150 to 1,200, compared with an average annual salary in
Beijing of about 10,000 yuan (dlrs 1,200).
	   Tickets were sold at reduced prices to Chinese for the dress
rehearsal and one of the nine performances.
	   Most of the full-price tickets have gone to foreigners living in
Beijing, said Joy Gong, a spokeswoman for the China Performing Arts
Agency, which is handling the Chinese side of the venture.
	   Other famous operas also have been staged in famous settings.
Verdi's ``Aida'' was done in 1994 amid the temples of the Valley of
the Queens in Luxor, Egypt, and ``Tosca'' was performed in 1992 in
the church, palace and castle in Rome where the tragedy is set.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey easily defeated Northern Ireland
3-0 on Saturday in its opening qualifier for the 2000 European
soccer Championship.
	   Oktay Derelioglu opened the score in the 18th minute when he
chipped the ball over the head of exposed Northern Ireland
goalkeeper Alan Fettis.
	   The northern Irish struggled throughout the first 45 minutes,
with the Turks camped outside their penalty area. But Turkey
squandered many chances to double the score lacking the finishing
touch each time.
	   Four minutes into the second half, defender Tayfur Havutcu
doubled the score, converting a penalty after Sergen Yalcin was
downed in the penalty area.
	   In the 58th minute, the northern Irish defense again failed to
stop Derelioglu from charging into the penalty area and bulleting
the ball past Fettis.
	   Northern Ireland became more aggressive in the second half but
never enough to worry Turkish goalie Rustu Rencber, while Turkish
team captain Tugay Kerimoglu missed at least two good occasions to
increase his team's advantage.
	   The two teams are in Group 3 with Germany, Finland, and Moldova.
In another game Saturday, Finland edged Moldova 3-2 in Helsinki.
	   Lineups:
	   Turkey: Rustu Rencber, Mert Korkmaz, Saffet Akbas, Tayfur
Havutcu, Alpay Ozalan, Abdullah Ercan, Okan Buruk, Tugay Kerimoglu,
Hakan Sukur, Sergen Yalcin, Oktay Derelioglu.
	   Northern Ireland: Alan Fettis, Kevin Horlock, Colin Hill, Steve
Morrow, Aaron Hughes, Keith Rowland, Neil Lennon, Philip Mulryne,
Keith Gillespie, Michael Hughes, Iain Dowie.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Christian Nerlinger scored five minutes
before the end to salvage a 1-1 draw for Germany against Romania in
his international debut Saturday.
	   The exhibition match was played on this Mediterranean island
where the new-look German team has been training for a week.
	   Nerlinger, a Bayern Munich midfielder and one of the eight
rookies called up by coach Berti Vogts, blasted home a low,
left-foot shot from the edge of the area after Romanian goalkeeper
Bogdan Stelea had punched the ball away from his goal.
	   Romania went ahead 35 minutes into the match when Viorel
Moldovan converted a penalty awarded for a foul on Catalin Munteanu
by Jens Jeremies.
	   Romania outplayed the reigning European champion in the first
half and Adrian Ilie hit the post in the 38th.
	   But Germany bounced back in he second halftime, with Ulf Kirsten
missing two early chances.
	   Paulo Rink, a Brazilian-born forward who is now a German
citizen, also came close in the 74th and Stelea made a good save
when he punched away a tricky Mario Basler free kick two minutes
later.
	   Germany, which struggled to a 2-1 victory over Malta on
Wednesday, failed to produce a convincing performance and Vogts is
sure to face more criticism and calls for his resignation.
	   ``We can't by happy,'' Vogts said. ``We have a lot of work to
do. We were lucky to escape with a draw.''
	   Both teams are rebuilding after unsuccessful World Cup
campaigns. Romania was knocked out in the second round by Croatia,
which then upset Germany 3-0 in the quarterfinals.
	   Romania thrashed weak Liechtenstein 7-0 in its opening Euro 2000
qualifier Wednesday. Germany travels to Turkey Oct. 10.

Ukraine holds off Russia 3-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Serhiy Rebrov converted a 74th-minute
penalty and Ukraine, boosted by a capacity crowd of 80,000, held
off a 10-man Russia 3-2 in the European Championship qualifying
opener for both teams Saturday.
	   Rebrov's penalty, created when he was brought down by Russian
keeper Dmitri Kharin, gave Ukraine a 3-1 lead and saw Kharin
ejected.
	   Victor Onopko, playing in his 60th international match, scored
on a header with two minutes remaining to pull the Russians within
a goal. But the man advantage and crowd support were too much to
overcome.
	   Ukraine controlled all of the first half and much of the second,
taking a 2-0 lead on Serhiy Popov's 14th-minute header and Serhiy
Skachenko's goal in the 25th.
	   Skachenko, who plays for Torpedo Moscow, beat Kharin one-on-one
by lofting the ball over the Russian keeper.
	   Russia failed to get a clear chance throughout the first half
but finally scored on Yevgeni Varlamov's header in the 66th.
	   After Rebrov's penalty, Russia struggled until Onopko's goal in
the 88th. Despite the lift, Russia was unable to create another
chance for the remainder of the game.

Hutu rebels storm western prison, free 3,000 inmates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rwandan radio saying the rebels killed three
teachers, in grafs 4-6; ADDS number of attackers in graf 2. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels attacked a prison in western
Rwanda and freed about 3,000 inmates suspected of involvement in
the 1994 genocide, authorities said Saturday.
	   Details were sketchy, but authorities in Kibuye, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) west of capital Kigali, said a group of 2,000
rebels on Friday overpowered the guards at Kivumu prison and set
people free.
	   Most of the inmates who had escaped returned voluntarily to the
prison by Saturday, officials said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The inmates were apparently afraid of army reprisals if
associated with the rebels.
	   State-run Radio Rwanda said the rebels, attacking from the
nearby Mukura forest, had also attacked Nyange secondary school,
killing three teachers.
	   ``Security forces intervened and inflicted a heavy defeat on the
infiltrators. Five guns were seized and many infiltrators killed,''
the radio said.
	   Unconfirmed reports said 20 people were killed.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for the 1994 Hutu government-organized slaughter of more than
500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994 and ended the
killing. But rebels continued to launch attacks from their hideouts
in neighboring Congo, targeting road convoys, Tutsi genocide
survivors and Hutus suspected of collaborating with the
authorities.
	   Thousands of people are thought to have died since.
	   Rwandan prisons are crowded with about 130,000 people awaiting
genocide trials. The rebels often target prisons hoping to mobilize
the inmates _ most of whom Hutus _ into their ranks.
	   Popular support for the rebels among the majority Hutu
population appears to be declining and the rebels are increasingly
turning against Hutus who refuse to provide them with money, food
and shelter.
	   The jailbreak is the most serious incident in Rwanda since the
insurgents in eastern Congo, who include ethnic Tutsis, took
control of the east of the country Aug. 2 which the Hutu rebels
used as their rear base.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Chartered planes, chauffeured
minivans, police protection and cash payments.
	   Swissair has lavished the grieving families of those killed on
Flight 111 with services and money since Wednesday's crash. Like
protective parents, airline officials have fiercely guarded the
privacy of the families while trying to provide for their every
need.
	   The airline's actions stand in stark contrast to TWA's treatment
of the families of those killed aboard Flight 800 two years ago. In
that tragedy, TWA officials said their first priority was to
investigate the possibility that a terrorist attack downed the
plane.
	   Swissair officials have said repeatedly that their first concern
is caring for the relatives of the 229 people killed when the plane
plunged into the ocean off Nova Scotia's coast.
	   ``I think it's a little bit our tradition to provide them with
the best we can,'' said Hand Klaus, a Swissair spokesman.
	   Arthur Wolk, a Philadelphia aviation attorney who has been
involved in lawsuits over many major airline crashes in the United
States, said Swissair is doing the right thing.
	   ``From a publicity standpoint, they don't look like they're hard
and evil. They look like they're sorry and compassionate,'' he
said.
	   TWA, he said, treated the families of victims ``like dirt.''
	   ``TWA didn't come up with a passenger list for days,'' he said.
``There was no offer of expense money so people could gather their
families, and there was no concerted effort...to bring them to the
site.''
	   A lawsuit seeking millions was brought by some of the families
of the 230 killed July 17, 1996, when the TWA plane exploded
shortly after it left Kennedy International Airport in New York
City. The civil trial was not expected to start before next summer.
	   The cause of the explosion has not been clearly defined by the
government despite an unprecedented civil and criminal
investigation.
	   Wolk predicted that Swissair's efforts would not prevent
survivors from filing a lawsuit. No airline crash has gone
unlitigated.
	   But the thoughtful treatment might make families more willing to
negotiate a settlement, he said.
	   Immediately after the Swissair crash Wednesday, airline
officials went to work notifying the families of the 229 people
aboard. Within a day, they had notified virtually everyone and
arranged for their travel to Canada.
	   The airline also offered each family dlrs 20,000 to pay for
their immediate needs.
	   On Friday, Swissair representatives greeted relatives as they
arrived in Nova Scotia on chartered flights from New York and
Geneva. Officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police made sure
they were left alone.
	   The passengers were quickly taken through customs in a private
room at Halifax Airport, then buses and taxi cabs took them to
their hotels.
	   Reporters and photographers were kept at least 100 yards (90
meters) away. But because the media were eager for access to the
families, the authorities made a deal: reporters could seek
interviews from relatives willing to talk, but there would be
further restrictions if the families were bothered.
	   Russell MacLellan, the premier of Nova Scotia, said it was the
regional government's duty to make sure the mourners were treated
well. His government helped set aside hundreds of hotel rooms.
	   Swissair, in coordination with Canadian authorities, arranged a
group meeting at the Lord Nelson Hotel late Friday to tell more
than 300 family members where the investigation stood and what
services would be available to them. German and French translators
also were hired to help.
	   At least 100 ``care team'' members, including priests, rabbis,
psychiatrists and social workers, wore badges on their lapels
identifying themselves by name and profession. Most said they were
simply making themselves available to the families.
	   ``There's no textbook on this,'' said Anglican pastor Richard
Walsh. ``You listen to what they say, and what they don't say.
You're basically there to be a sounding board.''
	   Saturday morning, many mourners traveled to the rocky shoreline
in Peggy's Cove, where Canadian soldiers had cordoned off an area
and set up tents for families to grieve away from the media.
	   Red Cross and Salvation Army officials escorted some to the
rocky ledge near the red and white lighthouse, the point closest to
the crash site. Firefighters lined the shoreline and police boats
patrolled the waters to be sure no news cameras intruded.
	   Swissair's Klaus said he had no idea how much the effort would
cost. The airline was not even thinking about that at this point,
he said.
	   Jeffrey Katz, Swissair's CEO, said after meeting with families
that he thought his company was doing a good job.
	   ``The group is, I believe, being well tended,'' he said.

	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Heavy rains flooded an Alpine cavern
southwest of here Saturday, trapping 14 tourists, six of them
children, police said.
	   The Austria Press Agency said the tourists were visiting the
``Lamprechtsofenhohle,'' a sprawling network of subterranean
chambers and underground streams, which swelled because of
torrential rains.
	   The rising waters cut off the normal route to the surface,
police said.
	   Late Saturday, APA quoted police as saying a rescue team was
trying to enter the chamber where they believed the tourists had
taken refuge.
	   The Austrian Red Cross said they numbered eight adults and six
children.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ After England's national team lost to
Sweden 2-1 Saturday, hooligans kicked out man-sized panes of
transparent plastic on the top tier of the stadium and threw beer
and debris.
	   Police said 11 people were arrested, only one of them from
England, according to the news agency TT. However, police told The
Associated Press that details of the arrests were not available.
	   Several fights broke out around the Rasunda stadium after the
match ended about 8 p.m. (1800 GMT), but there were no immediate
reports of injuries.
	   Dozens of police in riot gear and accompanied by snarling German
shepherds surrounded the hooligans and cleared the scene using
minimal violence.
	   Downtown Stockholm's nightlife neighborhoods were loud and
lively after the game, but well-behaved.
	   Several hundred fans watching from the street in the residential
neighborhood about five kilometers (three miles) from central
Stockholm, cheered when police dispersed the groups of young men,
who shouted and sang through the destroyed window frames, kicking
and punching out more in full view of police.
	   Several were led away in handcuffs. Two police helicopters with
searchlights circled overhead.

Iran masses troops on border, warns Afghanistan to free hostages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ With tens of thousands of troops, tanks and
fighter planes massed on the border, Iran warned Afghanistan's
Taliban religious army Saturday that it would take ``necessary
measures'' to win the release of 11 diplomats and 31 other Iranian
hostages.
	   Meanwhile, American intelligence analysts alerted senior
administration officials of the ``potential for incursion'' by
Iran, a U.S. intelligence source said.
	   State-run Tehran radio said Saturday that Iran would take ``the
necessary measures within the framework of legitimate defense,''
but it did not specify what that action could be.
	   The military buildup and threat comes with Iranian newspapers
and analysts speaking increasingly of a possible military strike
against the Taliban Islamic militia, which controls nearly all of
Afghanistan.
	   Iran carried out military maneuvers on its Afghan border this
week in which 70,000 troops, more than 150 tanks and squadrons of
fighter planes were involved. Tehran has said the forces will
remain in the area.
	   ``They've got some forces assembled and they're making noises,''
said the U.S. intelligence source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   For the past week U.S. spy satellites have been monitoring
Iranian troop movements, but the exercise quickly developed into an
operation aimed at getting troops in position to spring across the
Afghan border, the source said.
	   ``They certainly are positioned for something,'' the
intelligence official said.
	   Iran accuses the Taliban of seizing 47 Iranians when its forces
captured the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the 11 diplomats, but it
freed five Iranian truck drivers on Thursday.
	   ``I think that whether we like it or not, we are heading toward
some kind of military confrontation with the Taliban,'' Sadegh
Zibakalam, professor of politics at Tehran University, said in an
interview with the newspaper Toos.
	   But, with memories of a costly 1980-88 war against Iraq still
fresh in Iranian minds, newspapers in Iran have warned the
government against stepping into a quagmire.
	   The hard-line Qods daily said Saturday that the Taliban must be
taught a lesson.
	   ``But this lesson must follow a thorough understanding of all
the aspects and consequences,'' the paper warned.
	   Iranian officials say there is a growing sense that the
diplomats have probably been killed.
	   A member of an Iranian delegation that traveled to Afghanistan
last week said their mission was only to find and retrieve the
remains of the diplomats.
	   Iran's newspaper Abrar has quoted Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed
Mutawakil as saying the diplomats were probably killed by
opposition forces during the battle for Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   He said there was no one inside the Iranian consulate in
Mazar-e-Sharif when the Taliban entered the city.
	   ``The only likely possibility is that they were killed. We'll
try ... to find their bodies,'' the Farsi-language paper quoted
Mutawakil as saying.

Cyprus shocks Spain 3-2 in Euro Champs qualifier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) - The semi-pros of little Cyprus shocked
the polished professionals of Spain with a 3-2 victory in their
opening European Championship qualifier here Saturday.
	   Neither side shone during a dull first half. But Cyprus improved
greatly after Yiotis Engomitis scored the Cypriots first goal with
a distant lob just one minute before the end of the first half.
	   Just four minutes into the second half Sinica Gogic sent the
local fans wild with Cyprus' second goal during a melee infront of
the Spanish goal.
	   The Cypriot fans and players were admitting before the game that
their main effort would be to prevent the Spaniards from
humiliating them with a half a dozen goals. But the local players
gained so much confidence after their second goal that they
dominated the rest of the game, backed by the wild enthusiasm of
4,000 supporters in the stadium.
	   Spain grabbed a chance at the 72nd minute when the Cypriots left
the goal undefended, allowing star striker Raul Gonzalez to score.
	   Five minutes later Cyprus scored its third goal through a header
by Milenko Spoliaric.
	   The final 10 minutes proved the most dramatic, particularly
after the 85th minute when Fernando Moriertes banged in Spain's
second goal, spurring both sides to try harder than ever to score
again, but without success.
	   The Cypriot players and fans danced and cheered at the end
hardly beliving that they had managed to win over Spain, one of the
finalists in this years World Cup.
	   Lineups:
	   Cyprus - Nicos Panayiotou, Costas Costa, Charalambos Pittas,
Dimitris Ioannou (Ioakim Ioakim 86th), Marios Charalambous, Vassos
Melanarkitis, Yiotis Engomitis, Milenko Spoliaric, Sinica Gogic
(Marios Agarhocleous 62nd), Costas Malekos (Panikos Pounas 55th),
Marios Christodoulou.
	   Spain _: Santiago Canizares, Michel Salgado, Sergi Barjuan,
Rafael Alkorta, Miguel Angel Nadal (Guillermo Amor 65th), Fernando
Hiero, Joseba Exteberria, Louis Enrique Martinez, Fernando
Moriertes, Raul Gonzalez, Alfonso Peres (Francisco Narvaez ``Kiko''
39th).

Savage reprieve for Wales
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Savage reprieve, result

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Welsh soccer player Robbie Savage came
on as a late second-half replacement against Italy in the Euro 2000
qualifier at Liverpool Saturday despite being expelled from the
team earlier in the day.
	   Savage was ordered out of his team hotel for being
``disrespectful'' to an opponent hours before Wales' 0-2 loss to
Italy.
	   Welsh coach Bobby Gould dropped the Leicester midfielder from
the team on Saturday morning after watching a television interview
in which Savage threw away a t-shirt which clearly displayed the
name of Italian captain Paolo Maldini.
	   The Welsh Football Association released a statement saying
Savage had been ``both disrespectful to his team-mates and highly
derogatory to Italian defender Palol Maldini by throwing away his
shirt.''
	   The statement said Gould dropped Savage from the team for the
match against Italy but there were indications that the midfielder
may have been reprieved.
	   ``A decision will be taken later as to whether Savage will be
offered the chance to rejoin the squad,'' the statement said.
	   ``The other members of the squad and members of the backroom
staff offer their sincere apologies to Paolo Maldini for this
disrespectful act.''
	   Gould said players should be more respectful about the game.
	   ``Players must realise that they have a duty to put-up on the
field of play and shut-up off it, otherwise this game, which is
loved by millions, will be in very serious trouble indeed,'' the
Welsh manager said.
	   The interview was recorded for Sky TV on Wednesday and was
screened on Friday and again on Saturday. Producers of the program
said the Welsh officials had misinterpreted Savage's actions and a
Sky spokesman said the interview was not intended to be
disrespectful.
	   ``It was clear that the feature was a lighthearted piece about
fashions. It must be seen in the correct context,'' he said.
	   ``Anyone watching the whole feature would know that it was not a
serious gesture and that no offense was intended.
	   ``There should be a spirit of fun in football and the reaction
to such an obviously lighthearted feature is very disappointing.''

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ An Israeli team reduced to 10 men scored
a late equalizer and held on to clinch a 1-1 draw against Austria
in a foul-plagued Group 6 European Championship match Saturday.
	   Struggling in pouring rain, Israel upset the Austrians, who had
been among the World Cup finalists in France this summer.
	   Austria took an early lead through Hannes Reinmayr in the
seventh minute, with the ball spattering water and mud as it ambled
into the goal following a cross by Ivica Vastic.
	   The Austrians missed several good chances to increase the score
and are now winless in their last six games.
	   Israel had a lot of trouble adjusting to the sodden field, but
surprised the home side and its 20,000 fans at the Ernst Happel
stadium with the equalizer.
	   Israel, already reduced to 10 men by then, tied the score in the
69th when Avi Nimny converted a penalty following a foul on Alon
Mizrahi.
	   In the 59th, Swedish referee Andres Frisk had sent off Israel's
David Ansamel following scuffling in the Austrian penalty area
involving several players.
	   Lineups:
	   Austria_Franz Wohlfahrt; Wolfgang Feiersinger, Peter Schoettel,
Anton Pfeffer; Harald Cerny (Peter Stoeger, 74), Dietmar Kuehbauer,
Roman Maehlich, Hannes Reinmayr, Martin Amerhauser; Ivica Vastic,
Mario Haas (Christian Mayrleb, 71).
	   Israel_Refael Cohen; Ben-Simon Ran, Ariel Banado, Amir Shelah;
Alon Harazi, Josef Abukasis (Alon Mizrahi, 46), Barcoviz, Valeed
Badeer, David Ansamel; Ronen Harazi (Ghraib Nahwan, 61), Haim
Revivo.

Italy 2, Wales 0 in European qualifying game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ A shocking mishap by Wales defense
helped Italy's unimpressive 2-0 victory in a European Championship
qualifying game Saturday night.
	   Midfielder Diego Fuser kicked in the opening goal in the 19th
minute taking advantage from a ``pass'' by Welsh defender Chris
Coleman.
	   Coleman failed to clear a few meters from the Welsh net, lost
the ball to Fuser who kicked into the empty net from an angled
position.
	   World Cup striker Christian Vieri, fed by veteran star Roberto
Baggio, outdribbled two Welsh defenders and made it two with 13
minutes left.
	   Vieri, who transferred from Atletico Madrid to Lazio last week
on a record contract, put the ball into the Welsh net with a
precise and soft left-footed shot.
	   The success at the Anfield Road stadium marked the debut of Dino
Zoff on Italy's bench, two months after the elimination of the
``Azzurri'' by France in the World Cup quarterfinals which led to
the dismissal of coach Cesare Maldini.
	   The Italian team, unexpectedly starting Alessandro Del Piero and
fielding Baggio only in the last 15 minutes, showed a questionable
form prior to the start of the Serie A campaign and was often put
in trouble by Wales fast attacks.
	   Welsh star Ryan Giggs was a steady threat for the Italian
defense and hit the bar with a powerful free kick in the 42nd
minute.
	   Nathan Blake had the best scoring chance for the home team in
the 10th minute, but Italian keeper Angelo Peruzzi made a
sensational save on the powerful header by the Welsh forward from a
few meters.
	   The victory on the road gave Italy three points and first place
in the standings of Group One, also including Switzerland, Denmark
and Belarus.
	   Italy plays Switzerland next, in Udine, on Oct. 10.

Battling Iceland holds France to 1-1 draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   REYKJAVIK, Iceland _ World champion France was unable to turn
possession into goalscoring chances Saturday as it was held to a
1-1 draw by Iceland in its first European Championship qualifying
match.
	   France dominated its first competitive match since beating
Brazil 3-0 in the World Cup final, but was frustrated by a rugged
Icelandic team.
	   Against the run of play, the home team took a shock lead in the
33rd minute thanks to a schoolboy error by World Cup hero Fabien
Barthez.
	   From inside the Iceland half, Runar Kristinsson pumped a
harmless-looking free kick toward the edge of the France penalty
area, but Barthez sprinted to a ball that he never looked like
reaching and Rikhardur Dadason headed into an empty net.
	   The goal, Dadason's fourth in 18 matches for Iceland, sparked
frenzied celebrations amongst the home supporters, but also spurred
the French into action.
	   In the 36th minute, Zinedine Zidane left Kristinsson dazed with
a superb piece of ball control on the left edge of the penalty area
and crossed to Robert Pires.
	   Goalkeeper Birkir Kristinsson did well to push Pires' left foot
shot onto a post, but the French player's Marseille teammate
Christophe Dugarry easily smashed the ball into the net from three
yards to record his fourth goal for France.
	   Soon after, goalkeeper Kristinsson made a superb save from a
close range Pires shot to keep Iceland on level terms.
	   France rarely threatened again until the final minutes, when
Youri Djorkaeff wriggled free of the home defense but saw his
delicate lob come back off the crossbar.
	   In his first competitive match as coach, Roger Lemerre fielded
an offensive 4-3-3 formation.
	   Two attack-minded players - Zidane, operating in a more
withdrawn role than normal and Djorkaeff - lined up in midfield.
	   ''We came to attack but didn't play as well as we could. But at
least we have won a point away from home,'' Lemerre said.
	   Despite the lion's share of possession the world champions,
which had won six and drawn two of the previous eight meetings
between the two countries, struggled to make chances against
Iceland's five-man defense.
	   Lineups:
	   Iceland: Birkir Kristinsson - Eyjolfur Sverrisson, Larus
Sigurdsson, Hermann Hreidarsson, Petur Marteinsson, Audun Helgason
- Runar Kristinsson, Arnar Gunnlaugsson, Helgi Kolvidsson - Thordur
Gudjonsson (Stefan Thordarson 70th), Rikhardur Dadason.
	   Substitutes (not used): Arni Arason, Steinar Adolfsson, Sigurdur
Jonsson, Sverrir Sverrisson, Olafur Bjarnason, Tryggvi Gudmundsson.
	   France: Fabien Barthez - Christian Karembeu, Bixente Lizarazu,
Frank Leboeuf, Lilian Thuram - Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane,
Youri Djorkaeff - Robert Pires, Christophe Dugarry (Thierry Henry,
67th), Lilian Laslandes.
	   Substitutes (not used): Lionel Letizi, Vincent Candela, Alain
Goma, Alain Boghossian, Patrick Vieira, Tony Vairelles.

several scoring chances.

Martin Jorgensen found himself one-on-one with the Belarusian
goalkeeper, Andrei Satsunkevich. But defender Andrei Ostrovsky
cleared the ball from the goal line.
	   The game drew 30,000 to Republican Dinamo Stadium.

Protestant party agrees to meeting IRA ally; new Omagh fatality

 &UR; Eds: Grafs 1-5 UPDATE with dissidence within Ulster Unionist
executive, CORRECTS no vote taken. Last 2 grafs add firebombs in
Portadown &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Clinton-Ireland

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The main Protestant party on
Saturday agreed to its leader meeting Gerry Adams, president of the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, paving the way for an encounter of huge
symbolic significance and a new landmark in the peace process.
	   As U.S. President Bill Clinton wound up a tour of both parts of
Ireland, hailing the negotiated peace in this British province as a
shining example to people around the globe, the 110-member
executive committee of the Ulster Unionist Party indicated its
support for leader David Trimble's meeting with Adams.
	   No vote was taken, but executive committee member Dermott
Nesbitt said the meeting was part of the ``natural progress'' in
the peace process. He said there were no dissenting voices in the
executive.
	   But hours later, five members of the party executive _ including
four of its 10 members of Parliament _ indicated no endorsement had
been sought or given for the meeting.
	   ``In fact at the executive meeting there were various voices
expressing concern about such a meeting,'' said member Arlene
Foster. Four MPs supported her statement.
	   Trimble, who is First Minister in Northern Ireland's new
assembly, sat in the same room as Adams during negotiations which
led to the deal this year, but refused to speak to him.
	   Nesbitt said that meeting the leader of the Irish Republican
Army's political ally was something ``the First Minister will be
doing.''
	   ``There is nothing untoward, unnatural or unexpected about
that,'' Nesbitt told reporters after the closed door party meeting.
	   Trimble has already invited Adams and all the other party
leaders in the assembly to a meeting on Monday. The face-to-face
meeting alone with Adams is expected later next week.
	   Earlier, the terrorist car bombing of Omagh, already the most
deadly atrocity in the 30-year history of Northern Ireland's
conflict, claimed a 29th life.
	   Sean McGrath, 61, retired owner of a bakery business, died in
Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital 21 days after IRA dissidents
detonated their bomb amid workers, shoppers and Spanish tourists in
the religiously mixed town of Omagh.
	   ``This just highlights the fact that the suffering in far from
over,'' said William Thompson, an Ulster Unionist lawmaker in
Omagh.
	   ``The visits of famous people have come and gone. The people
will now be trying to get back to normality and that will probably
be the most difficult time of all,'' added Thompson.
	   On Thursday, Clinton and his wife, Hillary, paid respects to the
dead and wounded in a visit to the bomb-shattered center of Omagh.
	   In the hardline Protestant town of Portadown on Saturday, police
were involved in scuffles between an anti-British faction and
pro-British Loyalist marchers before their parade. A Catholic-owned
store was attacked by Loyalist gasoline bombers and was gutted by
fire. A second Catholic-owned store also was damaged in the town,
where two other Catholic-owned shops were damaged by arsonists
earlier in the week.
	   Police, backed up by army reinforcements, swamped the town
center to restore order. No injuries or arrests were reported.

 &UR; With Canada-Swissair Crash

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ To the slow tolling of church bells, thousands
filed silently into Geneva's Protestant cathedral for an interfaith
service Saturday to remember those who died when Swissair Flight
111 fell out of the sky in Canada.
	   Many more stood outside the main door of Saint-Pierre cathedral,
which remained open throughout the hour-long memorial at dusk.
	   In all, almost 3,000 people attended, among them relatives of
those killed in Wednesday's crash off Nova Scotia. Forty-one of the
victims on the New York to Geneva flight were Swiss.
	   The simple memorial included prayers offered by Protestant,
Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox priests, and from the Jewish,
Muslim and Buddhist faiths. The prayers were punctuated by
restrained music_Vincent Schmid, vicar of the cathedral, said
prayer and music would express what words could not.
	   During the nationally televised service, flowers were laid
against the altar and 229 candles_one for each victim_ were lit.
	   ``The candles will burn on as we leave the cathedral,'' said
Protestant priest William McComish as he ended the service.
	   The flags of Switzerland and the canton (state) of Geneva were
flown at half-staff throughout this city of 180,000.
	   Swiss Vice President Ruth Dreifuss represented the ruling
coalition cabinet at the service, organized by Geneva's Protestant
Church.
	   More services in memory of the crash victims are planned over
the next week.
	   Swissair is planning official memorial services next Friday in
New York, Geneva and Zurich. The United Nations, eight of whose
staff were killed, will hold a service midweek at the
organization's New York headquarters.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Zoff comment, lineups &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ A shocking mishap by Wales defense
helped Italy's unimpressive 2-0 victory in a European Championship
qualifying game Saturday night.
	   Midfielder Diego Fuser kicked in the opening goal in the 19th
minute taking advantage from a ``pass'' by Welsh defender Chris
Coleman.
	   Coleman failed to clear a few meters from the Welsh net, lost
the ball to Fuser who kicked into the empty net from an angled
position.
	   World Cup striker Christian Vieri, fed by veteran star Roberto
Baggio, outdribbled two Welsh defenders and made it two with 13
minutes left.
	   Vieri, who transferred from Atletico Madrid to Lazio last week
on a record contract, put the ball into the Welsh net with a
precise and soft left-footed shot.
	   The success at the Anfield Road stadium marked the debut of Dino
Zoff on Italy's bench, two months after the elimination of the
``Azzurri'' by France in the World Cup quarterfinals which led to
the dismissal of coach Cesare Maldini.
	   The Italian team, unexpectedly starting Alessandro Del Piero and
fielding Baggio only in the last 15 minutes, showed a questionable
form prior to the start of the Serie A campaign and was often put
in trouble by Wales fast attacks.
	   Welsh star Ryan Giggs was a steady threat for the Italian
defense and hit the bar with a powerful free kick in the 42nd
minute.
	   Nathan Blake had the best scoring chance for the home team in
the 10th minute, but Italian keeper Angelo Peruzzi made a
sensational save on the powerful header by the Welsh forward from a
few meters.
	   Zoff praised the Italian defense ``which did not allow many
chances to Wales.''
	   ``It was a good debut, considering most Italian players are not
yet in peak condition,'' said Zoff, a former national team goalie
and world champion in 1982.
	   The victory on the road gave Italy three points and first place
in the standings of Group One, also including Switzerland, Denmark
and Belarus.
	   Italy plays Switzerland next, in Udine, on Oct. 10.
	   The lineups:
	   Wales - Paul Jones; John Rosinson, Darren Barnard, Kit Symons,
Adrian Williams, Chris Coleman, Andy Johnson, Gary Speed, Nathan
Blake (Dean Saunders, 65th), Mark Hughes (Robbie Savage, 80th),
Ryan Giggs.
	   Italy - Angelo Peruzzi; Christian Panucci, Gianlluca Pessotto,
Dino Baggio, Diego Cannavaro, Mark Iuliano, Diego Fuser, Demetrio
Albertini (Luigi Di Biagio, 66th), Chreisatian Vieri, Alessandro
Del Piero (Roberto Baggio, 75th), Eusebio Di Francesco (Michele
Serena, 85th).
	   Yellow cards: Speed and Blake.

<TEXT>
	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Heavy rains flooded an Alpine cavern
southwest of here Saturday, trapping 14 tourists, six of them
children, police said.
	   The Austria Press Agency said the tourists were visiting the
``Lamprechtsofenhohle,'' a sprawling network of subterranean
chambers and underground streams, which swelled because of
torrential rains.
	   The rising waters cut off the normal route to the surface,
police said.
	   Late Saturday, APA quoted police as saying a rescue team was
trying to enter the chamber where they believed the tourists had
taken refuge.
	   The Austrian Red Cross said there were eight adults and six
children.

Iceland holds France, Spain upset by Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later matches &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ World Cup holder France was held 1-1 by Iceland
and Spain was upset 3-2 by Spain Saturday as the first big round of
European Championship qualifying games threw up some surprises.
	   The French, famous 3-0 winners over Brazil in the World Cup
final two months ago, fell behind in Reykjavik after a blunder by
'keeper Fabien Barthez who chased out of his goal and was beaten by
a header by Rikhardur Dadason.
	   Although Christophe Dugarry leveled three minutes later, the
French failed to recapture anything like their World Cup form in
its first competitive game under new coach Roger Lemerre.
	   ``We came to attack but didn't play as well as we could. But at
least we have won a point away from home,'' Lemerre said.
	   After the humiliation of first round elimination from the World
Cup, Spain suffered more embarassment in the European Championship
when it lost 3-2 to modest Cyprus in qualfying Group 6.
	   Goals by Yiotis Engomitis, Sinica Gogic and Milenko Spoliaric
sent the Cypriot fans wild in Larnaca and heaped more agony on the
Spaniards, who were expected to be a force at the World Cup but
flopped.
	   By the time Raul Gonzalez replied for the Spaniards, the team
was already two goals down. Fernando Moriertes scored the other
Spanish goal five minutes from the end by which time the Cypriots
were already celebrating a famous victory.
	   Sweden shrugged off an early Alan Shearer strike to hit back and
beat England 2-1 in a Group 5 game.
	   The England captain fired his team ahead with a bending free
kick only two minutes into the game in Stockholm. But the Swedes,
who have not lost to England in Stockholm for 61 years, replied
with two goals in two minutes by Andreas Andersson (30th) and Johan
Mjallby (32nd).
	   ``It was a good start for us in the championship,'' said
Mjallby, after scoring his first goal in his seventh appearances
for Sweden. ``We had a nightmare start in the game.''
	   England also had Paul Ince sent off midway through the second
half for his second yellow card and Shearer had a penalty appeal
turned down in injury time.
	   Shearer couldn't believe that Italian referee Pierluigi Collina
didn't award a penalty when he went down near the end.
	   ``It was a penalty. I don't know why he didn't give it,'' the
Newcastle striker said. ``The player clipped my ankles. Maybe it
was the last minute and he was too frightened to do it.''
	   Ireland stunned World Cup semifinalist Croatia 2-0 in Group 8
with early goals by Dennis Irwin and his Manchester United
colleague Roy Keane.
	   The Croats had two players, Mario Stanic and Krunoslav Jurcic,
expelled in the space of 90 seconds late in the game.
	   Irwin stroked home a fourth minute penalty after he had been
brought down and Keane added the second in the 15th minute to give
Ireland, which failed to qualify for the World Cup, a
confidence-boosting start.
	   ``It might surprise you but I was more worried when Croatia went
down to nine men,'' said Ireland coach Mick McCarthy. ``They seemed
to create more chances then and we became a little bit slack.''
	   Powered by goals from Diego Fuser and Christian Vieri, Italy
cruised to a 2-0 Group 1 victory over Wales in its first
competitive game under new coach Dino Zoff.
	   Ukraine, fielding many of its Dynamo Kiev stars and roared on by
80,000 fans, scored a 3-2 victory over neighbor Russia in Kiev. The
Russians had goalkeeper Dmitri Kharin sent off 16 minutes from the
end for hauling down goalbound striker Serhiy Rebrov.
	   Scotland, coming off its latest World Cup failure having never
made the second round in eight attempts, had to thank veteran
goalkeeper Jim Leighton for a 0-0 Group 9 tie in Lithuania. The
40-year-old 'keeper brilliantly kept out a header from Edgarras
Jankauskas.
	   In Sunday's games, Greece hosts Slovenia and Latvia goes to
Norway in Group 2, Bulgaria and Poland meet in Group 5, Hungary
hosts Portugal in Group 7, Malta visits Macedonia in Group 8 and
the Faeroe Islands welcome the Czech Republic in Group 9.

Italy 2, Wales 0 in European qualifying game

 &UR; Eds: FIXES spelling of Robinson, Christian Vieri and Gianluca
Pessotto in the lineups &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ A shocking mishap by Wales defense
helped Italy's unimpressive 2-0 victory in a European Championship
qualifying game Saturday night.
	   Midfielder Diego Fuser kicked in the opening goal in the 19th
minute taking advantage from a ``pass'' by Welsh defender Chris
Coleman.
	   Coleman failed to clear a few meters from the Welsh net, lost
the ball to Fuser who kicked into the empty net from an angled
position.
	   World Cup striker Christian Vieri, fed by veteran star Roberto
Baggio, outdribbled two Welsh defenders and made it two with 13
minutes left.
	   Vieri, who transferred from Atletico Madrid to Lazio last week
on a record contract, put the ball into the Welsh net with a
precise and soft left-footed shot.
	   The success at the Anfield Road stadium marked the debut of Dino
Zoff on Italy's bench, two months after the elimination of the
``Azzurri'' by France in the World Cup quarterfinals which led to
the dismissal of coach Cesare Maldini.
	   The Italian team, unexpectedly starting Alessandro Del Piero and
fielding Baggio only in the last 15 minutes, showed a questionable
form prior to the start of the Serie A campaign and was often put
in trouble by Wales fast attacks.
	   Welsh star Ryan Giggs was a steady threat for the Italian
defense and hit the bar with a powerful free kick in the 42nd
minute.
	   Nathan Blake had the best scoring chance for the home team in
the 10th minute, but Italian keeper Angelo Peruzzi made a
sensational save on the powerful header by the Welsh forward from a
few meters.
	   Zoff praised the Italian defense ``which did not allow many
chances to Wales.''
	   ``It was a good debut, considering most Italian players are not
yet in peak condition,'' said Zoff, a former national team goalie

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Despite last-minute objections, Congolese
rebels sent a team to peace talks in Zimbabwe on Saturday in hopes
of negotiating a cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign troops.
	   Arthur Zahidi Ngoma, vice president of the rebel Congolese
Democratic Coalition, said the rebels decided to go despite
objections to receiving an invitation through their ally, Rwanda,
and not directly.
	   President Laurent Kabila has accused Rwanda and Uganda of
sponsoring the month-long rebellion against him, and demands their
withdrawal from Congolese soil. Uganda and Rwanda deny backing the
rebels.
	   The rebels also objected to Zimbabwe's mediation. Along with
Angola and Namibia, Zimbabwe has sent more than 2,800 troops to
support Kabila and defend the capital, Kinshasa, from rebel
advances.
	   The rebels insist that the revolt is a Congolese affair and must
be resolved within Congo.
	   Nevertheless, they agreed to attend talks because they see it as
an opportunity to state their case to the world.

Bosnia 1, Estonia 1 in Euro qualification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia and Estonia drew a
1-1 tie in a European soccer Championship qualifier Saturday to
leave both teams unbeaten after two Group 9 matches.
	   Estonia took the lead in the 29th minute. Bosnian 'keeper Mirsad
Dedic brilliantly saved a shot from Estonian forward Marko Kristal
but the ball rebounded off Bosnian defender Mirsad Hibic into the
net.
	   Bosnian forward Sergej Barbarez equalized in the 75th minute
from the penalty spot after Estonian defense brought down forward
Edin Mujcin.
	   The result means that both teams have four points from a win and
a tie each with Estonia top of the group on goal difference.
	   Although playing without injured captain and one of their best
players, forward Meho Kodro, the Bosnians dominated throughout the
match but was not able to find a solution for the tight Estonian
defense.
	   Although mainly concentrated on saving their own goal, Estonians
threatened the Bosnian 'keeper with several swift counter attacks.
	   More than 15,000 spectators left the Sarajevo's biggest Kosevo
stadium unsatisfied. The tie is likely to add fire to the Bosnian
media campaign requesting the Bosnian coach, Dzemaludin Musovic, to
resign.
	   Bosnia-Herzegovina and Estonia play in qualification Group 9,
together with Scotland, Faeroe Islands, Czech Republic and
Litvania.
	    &UR; Lineups:
	   Bosnia-Herzegovina: Mirsad Dedic, Sead Kapetanovic, Jasmin
Mujdza (Nermin Sabic, 65), Muhamed Konjic, Mirza Varesanovic,
Mirsad Hibic, Suvad Katana (Edin Mujcin, 54), Sejad Halilovic
(Elvir Bolic, 75), Sergej Barbarez, Hasan Salihamidzic, Elvir

Frenchman Bayle earns pole position
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IMOLA, Italy (AP) _ Jean Michel Bayle earned a rare pole
position in the 500-cc class as wet conditions prevented most
riders from improving their times in Saturday's final qualifying
session for the City of Imola Grand Prix.
	   As a result, riders such as Michael Doohan and Max Biaggi failed
to beat Bayle's fastest lap of 1:49.345 seconds set on a dry
circuit in Friday's opening qualifying.
	   The top 12 positions held from Friday's qualifying with
Brazilian Alex Barros second-fastest at 1:49.752 and Doohan in
third with 1:49.828.
	   Biaggi, the championship leader with 173 points, was fourth.
	   In the 250-cc class, Japan's Tetsuya Harada secured his
provisional pole on his Aprilia but was a questionable starter
Sunday due to a fractured left ankle suffered in a a spill in
Saturday's practice.
	   Harada, the championship leader, led France's Oliver Jacque and
Italian teammate Loris Capirossi before falling at a corner.
	   Italian organizers said Harada may start despite the injury.
	   Capirossi, who trails Harada 148 to 174 points in the
championship standings, said he hoped to duel with his Aprilia
teammate in Sunday's race.
	   ``I really hope he can start,'' Capirossi said.
	   Italy's rising star, teen-ager Marco Melandri, led the 125-cc
class qualifying, riding his Honda in 1:59.795.
	   Japan's Tomomo Manako, also on a Honda, was second fastest.

Italy stumbles past Wales 2-0 on Welsh mistake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Diego Fuser capitalized on a defensive
lapse to score in the 19th minute and Italy went on to an
unimpressive 2-0 European Championship qualifying victory over
Wales Saturday night.
	   Welsh defender Chris Coleman failed to clear the ball a few
meters from the Welsh net, lost it to Fuser, who kicked into an
empty net from an angled position.
	   World Cup striker Christian Vieri, fed by Roberto Baggio,
outdribbled two Welsh defenders and added the insurance goal with
13 minutes left.
	   Vieri, who transferred from Atletico Madrid to Lazio last week
in a record deal, put the ball into the Welsh net with a precise
and soft left-footed shot.
	   The success at Anfield Road marked the debut of Dino Zoff as
Italy's coach, two months after the Azzurri were beaten by France
in the World Cup quarterfinals which led to the dismissal of Cesare
Maldini.
	   The Italians, unexpectedly starting Alessandro Del Piero and
fielding Baggio for only the last 15 minutes, showed questionable
form and was often put in trouble by Wales fast attacks.
	   Welsh forward Ryan Giggs was a steady threat and hit the bar
with a powerful free kick in the 42nd minute.
	   Nathan Blake had the best scoring chance for the home team in
the 10th minute, but Italian keeper Angelo Peruzzi made a
sensational save on the powerful header by the Welsh forward from a
few meters.
	   Zoff praised the Italian defense ``which did not allow many
chances to Wales.''
	   ``It was a good debut, considering most Italian players are not
yet in peak condition,'' said Zoff, a former national team keeper
and world champion in 1982.
	   The victory on the road gave Italy three points and first place
in the standings of Group One, which also includes Switzerland,
Denmark and Belarus.
	   Italy plays Switzerland next, in Udine, on Oct. 10.

Church roof collapses, killing 30 people in Brazil

<TEXT>
	   OSASCO, Brazil (AP) _ A church roof collapsed during services in
a Brazilian town Saturday, killing 30 people and injuring 538 more,
firefighters said.
	   A congregation of 1,300 was in the church in Osasco, 9 miles (15
kms) southwest of Sao Paulo, when the roof came crashing down,
firefighter Fabio Leite said.
	   ``We were praying and had our eyes closed. When we opened them
the building was falling,'' worshipper Maria Aparecida Costa said
in a televised interview from a first-aid station. ``I fainted and
when I woke up I was buried.''
	   The roof had started to creak moments before it caved in,
eyewitnesses told Brazilian television.
	   Amateur video footage showed firefighters using chain saws to
break up the destroyed wooden roof and free the wounded. One young
woman pleaded with them to get her mother out.
	   A voluntary worker at a sister church in Sao Paulo told The
Associated Press by telephone that a new roof was only put on the
building two months ago.
	   ``There were a few little problems with the roof and it was
completely repaired,'' said Obreiea Luiza. ``There did not appear
to be anything wrong with the repairs.''
	   The roof's heavy wooden beams may have rotted, said Lourdes
Faccinalli, a spokeswoman for the town. It had been raining for
several hours before the accident.
	   ``We are not sure why the structure collapsed. We know the
building was over 40 years old and used to house a cinema,''
firefighter Leite said.
	   ``People had splinters and pieces of wood from the beams in
their bodies,'' Vitor Martins, director of a first-aid station,
said in a televised interview.
	   Twenty-one people were killed immediately and nine more died
later, Leite said. A further 538 people were being treated for
injuries, some serious, at seven hospitals.

Cross-border bridge named after George Mitchell

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A cross-border bridge between
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is being named in honor of
U.S. former Sen. George Mitchell who was instrumental in achieving
the April peace agreement.
	   Mitchell, who chaired the talks on the future of the province,
attended a ceremony Saturday in County Cavan in the republic for
the construction of the bridge, which will link the town of
Belturbet with the road to Enniskillen, in Northern Ireland.
	   Britain's Northern Ireland Office said the road, which has been
closed for years, was one of several being reopened because of
recent improvements in the security situation.
	   The bridge was named after Mitchell to mark his work for peace
in Ireland.
	   He described the building of the bridge as ``very constructive
at this stage.''

<TEXT>
	   REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) _ World champion France was unable to
turn possession into scoring chances Saturday and was held to a 1-1
draw by Iceland in its first European Championship qualifying
match.
	   France dominated its first competitive match since beating
Brazil 3-0 in the World Cup final, but was frustrated by a rugged
Icelandic team.
	   Against the run of play, the home team took a shock lead in the
33rd minute thanks to a schoolboy error by World Cup hero Fabien
Barthez.
	   From inside the Iceland half, Runar Kristinsson pumped a
harmless-looking free kick toward the edge of the France penalty
area, but Barthez sprinted to a ball that he never looked like
reaching and Rikhardur Dadason headed into an empty net.
	   The goal, Dadason's fourth in 18 matches for Iceland, sparked
frenzied celebrations amongst the home supporters, but also spurred
the French into action.
	   In the 36th minute, Zinedine Zidane left Kristinsson dazed with
a superb piece of ball control on the left edge of the penalty area
and crossed to Robert Pires.
	   Goalkeeper Birkir Kristinsson did well to push Pires' left foot
shot onto a post, but the French player's Marseille teammate
Christophe Dugarry easily smashed the ball into the net from three
yards to record his fourth goal for France.
	   Soon after, goalkeeper Kristinsson made a superb save from a
close range Pires shot to keep Iceland on level terms.
	   France rarely threatened again until the final minutes, when
Youri Djorkaeff wriggled free of the home defense but saw his
delicate lob come back off the crossbar.
	   In his first competitive match as coach, Roger Lemerre fielded
an offensive 4-3-3 formation.
	   Two attack-minded players_ Zidane, operating in a more withdrawn
role than normal and Djorkaeff _ lined up in midfield.
	   ``We came to attack but didn't play as well as we could. But at
least we have won a point away from home,'' Lemerre said.
	   Despite the lion's share of possession the world champions,
which had won six and drawn two of the previous eight meetings
between the two countries, struggled to make chances against
Iceland's five-man defense.

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Some sobbing and stumbling, others
shivering silently in a brisk breeze, relatives of Swissair Flight
111's victims sent wreaths out to sea Saturday and carried away
jars of water from the ocean where their loved ones died.
	   Offshore from the rocky ledge where the mourners stood, there
was a potential breakthrough in the search for the jet's missing
flight recorders, which could provide clues into the cause of the
crash late Wednesday that killed all 229 people aboard.
	   Search commanders said a Canadian submarine had detected signals
coming from one of the recorders. Divers working at depth of 190
feet (58 meters) ried to pinpoint the location, but were hindered
by limited visibility and planned to resume the hunt Sunday.
	   Crash investigators released excerpts of the final conversation
between the plane's pilots and air traffic controllers in Moncton,
New Brunswick.
	   The pilots reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the
crash, then spent 10 minutes getting directions for a rapid descent
from 33,000 feet (10,000 meters) and for dumping fuel into the
ocean before heading toward an emergency landing in Halifax.
	   The plane made two sharp turns, then communications ceased six
minutes before the plane hit the water. The crew's last words were:
``We are declaring an emergency ... we have to land immediately.''
	   ``All of the conversations were very professional,'' said Vic
Gerden, the chief crash investigator. But he said communications
became less clear in the last stages, suggesting the pilots may
have donned smoke masks that affected their speech.
	   In all, more than 300 family members have flown to Halifax from
New York, the plane's starting point, and Geneva, its intended
destination.
	   Most of them were driven in chartered buses Saturday to Peggy's
Cove, the tiny, picturesque fishing village near the ocean crash
site that has become the base for the search operation.
	   Police and soldiers kept a large media contingent well away from
the area cordoned off for the mourners, and only a few agreed to
speak with journalists.
	   One of them was Claire Mortimer, 45, of Berkeley, California,
whose father, John Mortimer, a former executive of The New York
Times, was among the victims.
	   ``My father would have wanted me to be here,'' she said. ``It's
ironic that he has died in the ocean that he loved. ... In an odd
way, it's very comforting to me to come here and see this beautiful
place.''
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police deployed boats to take wreaths
out to the crash site, a few miles (kilometers) from shore, and
bring back jars of sea water to be kept by relatives in
remembrance.
	   One distraught woman handed her baby to a companion and ran past
a barricade toward the sea, only to be stopped by grief counselors
who led her back to a tent.
	   In the afternoon, scores of the relatives gathered in a Halifax
convention center for a private memorial service.
	   The day began with an expanded effort to search the ocean floor
for the plane's fuselage and flight recorders. The HMCS Okanagan, a
Canadian submarine, was deployed for a second day to make a sonar
map of the seabed, and 75 police and military divers were in action
for the first time.
	   Lt. Commander Mike Considine, a navy spokesman, said searchers
still had found no piece of wreckage larger than a car roof. Divers
and unmanned submersibles would be checking areas where sonar
probes suggested the possible presence of larger pieces, he said.
	   Security forces have barred people, boats and planes not
involved in the search from the entire search area, including
several miles of coastline. About 250 soldiers were combing the
shoreline in search of debris and body parts.
	   The process of identifying the bodies was expected to take
weeks, because most of the human remains found so far have been
fragments.
	   Only on Saturday morning did officials announce the first
positive identification _ a French citizen whose name was not
released.
	   Swissair's chief executive officer, Jeff Katz, said Friday that
the three-engine MD-11 had been well maintained.
	   He said Swissair had complied with all directives from U.S.
aviation officials advising of wiring problems in MD-11 jets. Two
such advisories in 1996 and 1997 warned of potentially hazardous
wiring in the cockpit and in a rear console for flight attendants.
	   The pilot of Flight 111 reported smoke in the cockpit shortly
before the crash. The plane began heading toward Halifax to attempt
an emergency landing, made a couple of turns while descending and
dumping fuel, then disappeared from radar.
	   The tragedy had echoes Saturday far from Nova Scotia. The
brother of one of the victims died after becoming ill on a Swissair
flight from Chicago to Zurich, Swissair said. The 37-year-old man
was not identified.

Think tank recommends shakeup of British monarchy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A ``think tank'' has proposed a radical overhaul
of the monarchy, eliminating the sovereign's remaining political
and religious functions, Press Association reported Saturday.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said the report did not
reflect government views and that no one in the government was
involved in drawing it up.
	   The report by Demos, described by the British national news
agency as a left-wing think tank, does not call for abolition of
the monarchy. But it says a referendum should be held on the next
monarch and that if it were negative, it would open the way for
people to vote in favor of Britain becoming a republic.
	   ``Soundbites and spin doctors will not be enough for the
monarchy to thrive in the next century,'' co-author Mark Leonard is
quoted as saying. ``The monarchy must commit itself to real change
and put itself in touch with its people's priorities, hopes and
fears.''
	   The report suggests that the monarch's role should be that of
head of state, but that he or she should have ``minimal connection
with the executive, the legislature or the judiciary.''
	   That would mean the monarch would no longer appoint the prime
minister, dissolve Parliament, appoint judges, or give the final
assent allowing bills to become laws.
	   The 1559 law that makes the monarch the head of the Church of
England, should be repealed, suggests the report, to be published
formally on Monday.
	   The monarch's present role is largely symbolic and government
ministers must approve her official actions and statements.

	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Heavy rains flooded an Alpine cavern
southwest of here Saturday, trapping 16 tourists, six of them
children, for several hours, police said. All 16 were brought out
safely late Saturday, police added.
	   The Austria Press Agency said the group was touring the
``Lamprechtsofenhohle,'' a sprawling network of subterranean
chambers and underground streams about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of here.
	   Torrential rains swelled the streams, cutting off the normal
route to the surface, police said. Nationalities of the visitors
were unavailable.
	   The area is located a few kilometers (miles) south of the German
border and is popular with European tourists.

 &UR; Wales 0, Italy 2 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   At Liverpool, Wales played a part in Italy's first goal in the
19th minute with an ill-directed defensive pass from defender Chris
Coleman.
	   Coleman failed to clear near the Welsh goal and lost the ball to
Diego Fuser, who kicked into the empty net from an angled position.
	   Ryan Giggs created opportunities for Wales in the second half
but the emergence of Roberto Baggio from the Italian bench led to
the visitors scoring the clincher.
	   World Cup striker Christian Vieri, fed by Baggio, beat two Welsh
defenders to extend Italy's lead to two with 13 minutes to go.
 &UR; Belarus 0, Denmark 0 &QC; 
	   In Minsk, the highly fancied Danish team failed to score a goal
against Belarus in front of 30,000 spectators at Dinamo Stadium.
	   Danish striker Martin Jogensen had the best chance with a
one-on-one dual with goalkeeper Andrei Satsunkevich in the 53rd
minute.
	   But the 'keeper held his ground while defender Andrei Ostrovsky
rescued the home team by clearing the ball from goal line.
 &UR; Group 2 &QC; 
 &UR; Georgia 1, Albania 0 &QC; 
	   In Tbilist, Georgia, a win and Archil Arveladze's 65th minute
goal were the only hightlights for 35,000 fans at Dinamo stadium.
	   Georgia missed a goal in the first half when Zaza Dzanashia had
a one-on-one chance against Albanian goalkeeper Foto Strakosha but
hit the ball over the goal.
 &UR; Group 3 &QC; 
 &UR; Finland 3, Moldova 2 &QC; 
	   In Helsinki, Finland took an early lead through a Joonas Kolkka
goal in the in the 7th minute but Moldova hit back immediately with
two goals in 90 seconds by Igor Oprea, the first in the 10th
minute.
	   Jonatan Johansson levelled the match in the 44th minute after
receiving a pass from Mika-Matti Paatelainen. The pair combined
again in the 63rd minute for the winner, with Johansson lobbing in
a cross for Paatelainen who beat the 'keeper from a few meters.
	   Genadie Pusca of Moldova was ejected in the closing minutes for
a heavy clash on Litmanen.
 &UR; Turkey 3, Northern Ireland 0 &QC; 
	   In Istanbul, Oktay Derelioglu opened the scoring in the 18th
minute when he lobbed a clever chip over Northern Ireland
goalkeeper Alan Fettis, who was stranded outside his goal.
	   Tayfur Havutcu scored the second in the 4th minute of the second
half, converting a penalty awarded after Sergin Yalcin was downed
in the goal area.
	   Derelioglu got his double in the 58th minute when he outpaced
the defense as he charged into the penalty area and pushed the ball
past Fettis.
 &UR; Group 4 &QC; 
 &UR; Armenia 3, Andorra 1 &QC; 
	   At Yerevan, the home team took the lead in the 40th minute when
Garnik Avalian scored off a goalmouth scramble. Substitute Tigran
Yesaian replaced Avalian in the 65th minute and made it 2-0 six
minutes later before Andorra closed the gap on Julian Lucendo's
penalty goal in the 86th minute.
	   Yesaian put the issue beyong dount with the clincher in the last
minute of regular time.
 &UR; Iceland 1, France 1 &QC; 
	   At Reykjavik, France dominated the attack but failed to
capitalize.
	   An elementary mistake by 'keeper Fabien Barthez compounded
France's problems in the 33rd minute when Iceland took the lead
against the run of play.
	   Runar Kristinsson kicked a harmless-looking free kick from
inside his own half toward the edge of the France penalty area but
Barthez mis-timed is run out of the box leaving Rikhardur Dadason
to head into an empty net.
	   France equalized in the 36th minute when goalkeeper Birkir
Kristinsson deflected a Zinedine Zidane shot onto the post and
Christophe Dugarry swooped onto the rebound and finished off from
three yards out.
	   Kristinsson made two spectucular saves in the second half to
ensure an unlikely tie.
 &UR; Ukraine 3, Russia 2 &QC; 
	   At Respublikansky stadium, Kiev, in front of 80,000 supporters,
Ukraine held off a late charge by Russia to score a stunning
victory over its biggest soccer rival.
	   Serhiy Popov scored the opening goal in the 14th minute and the
home side increased its lead nine minutes later when Serhiy
Skachenko, who plays for Torpedo Moscow in Russia's domestic
league, beat Russian goalkeeper Dmitri Kharin in a one-on-one
encounter.
	   Yevgeni Varlamov's header in the 66th minute reduced the
Ukraine's lead but the two-goal buffer was reinstalled eight
minutes later, after Kharin was sent off for pulling down Ukraine
striker Serhiy Rebrov. Rebrov slotted the penalty shot past the
replacement goalkeeper.
	   Russia's Viktor Onopko scored in the 88th minute to close the
gap.
 &UR; Group 5 &QC; 
 &UR; Sweden 2, England 1 &QC; 
	   At the Rasunda stadium, Stockholm, an Alan Shearer goal after 76
seconds was the perfect start for England but Sweden retaliated
with two goals within three minutes midway through the first half
to clinch a 2-1 result.
	   Johan Mjallby's first international goal swung the game in
Sweden's favor in the 33rd minute just minutes after Andreas
Andersson, a team-mate of Shearer's at Newcastle, had levelled the
score.
	   England has not won an international against Sweden in Stockholm
in six matches at Rasunda Stadium since 1937.
 &UR; Group 6 &QC; 
 &UR; Austria 1, Israel 1 &QC; 
	   At Ernst Happel stadium in Vienna, Israel surprised Austria with
a 69th minute equalizer despite playing the bulk of the second half
with 10 men.
	   Pouring rain and a series of fouls prevented an open attacking
match and Austria missed several chances to score the winner after
taking an advantage in the 7th minute when Hannes Reinmayr guided a
cross from Ivica Vastic into the net.
	   Israel's David Ansamel was sent off in the 59th minute following
a scuffle in the Austrian penalty area.
	   Israel hit back when Avi Nimny converted a penalty after a foul
on Alon Mizrahi.

	   In Larnaca, Cyprus provided the shock of the round with a

	   The team of semi-pros scored in the last minute of the first
half with a long-range lob from Yiotis Engomitis and then again
early in the second half through Sinica Gogic.
	   Raul Gonzalez scored Spain's first goal in the 72nd minute when
he drove into an undefended goal.
	   Cyprus took a 3-1 lead five minutes later through Milenko
Spoliaric but Spain reduced the margin in the 85th minute when

	   In Kosice, Slovakia, the home team scored three goals in the

	   Martin Fabus scored the opening goal in the 17th minute, beating
the goalkeeper with a shot from close range.
	   The Azerbaijan 'keeper was punished for a foul on Jozef Majoros

by Krunoslav Jurcic and Robert Jarni and he scored from the penalty
spot. Roy Keane made it 2-0 in the 15th after the Croats failed to
clear a Damien Duff corner.
	   Jason McAteer took a shot from 20 yards, which deflected off a
defender and bounced up for Keane to head inside the far past.
	   Croatia had its best opportunity in the 66th minute when Stanic

Ireland goalkeeper.
 &UR; Group 9 &QC;

	   In Vilnius, Lithuania exerted all the pressure but failed to

	   Scotland's 40-year-old goalkeeper Jim Leighton rescued his team
with a reflex-action save in the 22nd minute as Edgarras Jankauskas
went close to finishing off a Lithuania free-kick on the edge of
the goal box.
	   Lithuania went close again before halftime when Darren Jackson
headed off the line after Leighton failed to deal with a corner
from Davidas Semberas.
	   Scotland captain Colin Hendry had a clear header during injury
time from a leftwing cross but it was too high.
 &UR; Bosnia 1, Estonia 1 &QC; 
	   At Kosevo Stadium in Sarajevo, a depleted Bosnian team had to
battle for a tie against Estonia.
	   Estonia opened the scoring in the 29th minute when Bosnia
conceded a home goal despite the best efforts of 'keeper Mirsad
Dedic.
	   Dedic made a difficult save to stop a shot from Marko Kristal
but his block rebounded off a Bosnian defender and into the net.
	   The home team equalized in the 75th minute when Sergej Barbarez
converted a penalty kick from the spot after Edin Mujcin was brough
down inthe pnealty area.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Police arrested 11 people, one of them
English, after fans vandalized Rasunda Stadium following Sweden's
2-1 European Championship victory over England on Saturday.
	   The mob kicked out human-sized panes of transparent plastic on
the top tier of the stadium and threw beer and debris.
	   Swedish news agency TT quoted police as saying 11 were arrested.
However, police told The Associated Press that details of the
arrests were not available.
	   Several fights broke out around Rasunda Stadium after the match
ended about 8 p.m., but there were no immediate reports of
injuries.
	   Dozens of police in riot gear and accompanied by German
shepherds surrounded the rioting fans and cleared the scene with
minimal force.
	   Downtown Stockholm's nightlife neighborhoods were loud and
lively after the game, but well-behaved.
	   Several hundred fans watching from the street in the residential
neighborhood about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from central Stockholm,
cheered when police dispersed the groups of young men, who shouted
and sang through the destroyed window frames, kicking and punching
out more in full view of police.
	   Several were led away in handcuffs. Two police helicopters with
searchlights circled overhead.

	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Heavy rains flooded an Alpine cavern
southwest of the Austrian city of Salzburg on Saturday, trapping 16
tourists, six of them children, for several hours, police said.
	   All 16 were brought out safely late Saturday, police added.
	   The Austria Press Agency said the group was touring the
``Lamprechtsofenhohle,'' a sprawling network of subterranean
chambers and underground streams about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Salzburg.
	   Torrential rains swelled the streams, cutting off the normal
route to the surface, police said. Nationalities of the visitors
were unavailable.

Woodhall holds onto WBC super-middleweight title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TELFORD, England (AP) _ Richie Woodhall took all the big punches
yet still held onto his WBC super-middleweight title Saturday by
gaining a decision over replacement opponent Glenn Catley.
	   While one of the judges scores the fight a draw, the other two
gave it to the champion who even admitted afterwards he thought
he'd lost his title in his first defense.
	   Catley hurt Woodhall in the seventh, got through with powerful
blows in the 10th and 11th rounds and was never put under any
pressure by the much taller champion.
	   ``I boxed awfully and I lost the fight,'' said Woodhall who was
due to fight Vincenzo Nardiello, a lefthander but wound up against
orthodox Catley when the Italian pulled out two weeks ago with a
calf muscle injury.
	   ``I had been training all the time to fight a southpaw.''
	   Catley said that Woodhall, who took the title from South
Africa's Thulane ``Sugar Boy'' Malinga in March, told him before
the judges decisions were announced that he'd lost the crown. ``He
came over to me and said `you've got the fight.'''
	   Woodhall, who still has to fight Nardiello, is aiming for a
big-money fight with another British fighter, WBO titlist Joe
Calzaghe.
	   ``I'm going to have to improve on this,'' he said.
	   Woodhall, who fights methodically behind his left jab, took a
long time to find his range despite outreaching Catley by several
inches.
	   The challenger, five inches (12.5 cms) shorter, was only able to
do any damage at close range in the early stages but began to hurt
Woodhall from the halfway point of the fight in the champion's home
town.
	   Catley got through with a big left hand at 1:32 in round seven
and stunned the champion. Woodhall took several seconds to respond
with any punches and was caught just before the bell with a right
hand following by a left.
	   The challenger landed a left and right early in the eighth but
this time Woodhall was able to come back with his trademark jabs
although most still seemed out of range.
	   Woodhall jabbed his way back into the fight in the 10th and also
powered through with a left hook but Catley landed a big right hand
just on the bell.
	   Catley took some more long range jabs in the 11th but still
landed the best punch of the round, a left uppercut 22 seconds from
the end.
	   Woodhall's only loss in 25 fights was a WBA challenge against
American fighter Keith Holmes two years ago. Catley, who moved up a
weight for the fight, remains the British middleweight champion.

<TEXT>
	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ For some relatives of the
victims, the sight of the ocean where Swissair Flight 111 crashed
was too much.
	   One woman handed her baby to a companion and ran past barricades
erected partly to keep the grief-stricken from running into the
frigid, cobalt blue waters off Peggy's Cove. She was chased by
grief counselors, who pulled her from the ocean's edge.
	   An elderly man collapsed and was carried off the sun-washed
granite bluffs on a stretcher, crying as he was lifted into an
ambulance. The whistle of the offshore wind breaking against the
rocks was broken only by the thump of coast guard helicopters
ferrying searchers out to sea.
	   The hundreds of police officers, firefighters and emergency
workers could do nothing for the 229 victims of the Canada's worst
maritime air disaster.
	   Saturday, they tried to do something for the families.
	   Firefighters helped them lower floral wreathes down the steep
embankments into the sea and stood by as they dipped small glass
bottles into the ocean to collect seawater.
	   The mourners had come by charter bus to this rocky promontory
overlooking the sea. Some of the bereaved were dressed in black
suits or dresses, others in blue jeans and T-shirts. Most carried
flowers _ snap dragons, lilies and roses.
	   In two army-issue, olive green tents perched on the rocks,
Canadian officials briefed them on the status of the salvage
effort. Then _ in pairs and alone _ some of the estimated 400
mourners stepped gingerly over the granite clefts to the
whitewashed lighthouse at the ocean's edge, where they stood gazing
out to sea.
	   Some wrapped themselves in red blankets to protect themselves
against the chill wind. A few adults hugged teddy bears. Others
sobbed.
	   A Red Cross worker held the hand of a young blonde-haired girl
from Newton, Massachusetts, who authorities said had lost her aunt.
	   A card left in a crevice between two boulders said, ``Words
cannot express what I feel for you right now. May God be with you,
my friends.''
	   Claire Mortimer, who lost her father and stepmother in the
crash, said relatives were leaving behind blood samples to help
authorities identify remains using DNA testing.
	   ``It think it's very difficult for a lot of people to grasp that
they're not going to be able to come here and in a very short
period of time have remains to take home,'' she said.
	   Tim Larson, of East Hartford, Connecticut, came with his family
to say good-bye to his wife's uncle, Victor Rizza, a 58-year-old
professor at the University of Catania in Sicily, and Rizza's
14-year-old son, Antonino.
	   Pausing to keep from crying, Larson did his best to say what he
could on behalf of the relatives. He thanked Canadian officials for
setting up the tents, providing food and trying to make everyone
feel as comfortable as they could. He paused again.
	   ``I think most people are resigned that their loved ones are
with their God and their maker.''

Ivanisevic gets two surprises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Goran Ivanisevic received two unusual items
Saturday: a pair of handcuffs and a victory over an old nemesis.
	   Ivanisevic, the Wimbledon runner-up and 14th seed at the U.S.
Open, reached the fourth round with a 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-4 victory
over Paul Haarhuis, who had beaten the Croatian left-hander five
straight times.
	   Earlier, the Croatian said he opened his mail to find something
even more bizarre _ handcuffs and a tube of what he assumed from an
accompanying note to be chocolate body paint.
	   ``I know (who the gift was from), but I can't tell you,''
Ivanisevic said with a smile.
	   Ivanisevic said handcuffs and body paint are available in
Croatia, ``But those things you hide. ... You don't go out and say,
`Oh, I bought the handcuffs for my wife. We're going to have a
great time tonight.' ''
	   Ivanisevic had a great time in the afternoon sun on the Open's
main court, serving 21 aces and converting all but one of five
break points.
	   ``I'm returning well, serving well,'' he said. Ivanisevic has
been to three Wimbledon finals but still has not won a Grand Slam
tournament.
	   ``Always the same question. Always the same stupid answer from
me. You know the answer. What can I tell you? I know that I'm maybe
the best player who never won a Grand Slam, but I'm trying.''
	   Up next is defending champion Patrick Rafter.
	   ``I am going to have to really concentrate on his serve,''
Ivanisevic said. ``Even if you hit a good return against Patrick,
he comes up with great volleys.''
	   But Ivanisevic said he has one less player to battle.
	   ``Lately I'm playing most of the time against the other guys,
not against myself,'' Ivanisevic said.
	   If all else fails, Ivanisevic knows another way _ banging his
head on the court when he gets frustrated.
	   ``Sometimes I am a little messed up there,'' Ivanisevic said.
``I have to bang, then everything comes together.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GOOD PRACTICE PARTNER: &LR;  Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash is
helping out at the U.S. Open as a practice partner for some of the
top players.
	   Cash retired last March after a career highlighted by his
straight-set victory over Ivan Lendl in the Wimbledon final in
1987. He also will be remembered for his climb up the wall to join
his family and friends to celebrate.
	   His trademark then remains his trademark now.
	   As he practiced on an outside curt, Cash wore the
black-and-white checked headband that honors Hawthorne, his
favorite Australian Rules Football team.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HOME RUN WATCH: &LR;  The crowd at the U.S. Open was watching
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario's match against Sarah Pitkowski but keeping
track of another sport _ baseball.
	   The public address announcements at the U.S. Major League
Baseball game between the New York Mets and the Atlanta Braves at
Shea Stadium a couple hundred meters away were easily heard. And
when the public address announcer told the baseball crowd that St.
Louis Cardinal slugger Mark McGwire had hit his 60th home run _ one
short of the U.S. single season record, the tennis fans cheered,
too, even though it was in the middle of a point.
	   ``I heard that,'' Sanchez Vicario said. ``I thought maybe
something big happened.''
	   Sanchez Vicario threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the
Mets' game Friday night but wondered what it would be like to pitch
against McGwire.
	   ``Let me try,'' she said. ``It would be very exciting.''

British boys' group rejects girl members
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Boys' Brigade, a British scouting
organization, on Saturday rejected girls as formal members.
	   Although girls are unofficial members in some Brigade companies,
leaders at the annual meeting voted 406 to 284 against accepting
them formally.
	   ``Girls are not always wanting to leap up mountains or onto
football pitches,'' said Brigade secretary and chief executive
Sydney Jones. ``Boys, especially in their teens, are much more into
group things like football teams.''
	   There were already organizations for young girls, he said, and
no need to swell the membership of the 115-year-old brigade, which
includes 100,000 boys aged 6 to 18.
	   Roy Herbert, 59, strongly disagreed.
	   ``This is disastrous,'' he said. ``A total disaster, and one
that we are going to live to regret. The argument is not going
away.''
	   Herbert who runs a 36-strong Boys Brigade company in southwest
London, said 12 girls were unofficial members of his company and
there were no problems integrating them into the group.
	   He said companies like his all over Britain were already
allowing girls to take part successfully.
	   But Jones, the chief executive, said, ``At this stage, it would
not help and might hinder if girls were allowed to come in.''
	   They would be members of the movement within 20 years, he
predicted, but he insisted the movement was not ready for girls and
would need to adapt before it could cater for their needs.
	   Richard Davies, London district secretary of the brigade, said
most of the proxy votes that defeated the motion had come from
remoter areas _ particularly Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Franchitti wins fourth pole of year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW with Saturday's qualifying. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Scotland's Dario Franchitti,
coming off his first Indy-car victory two weeks ago, claimed the
fifth pole of his career Saturday, winning the top spot for the
Vancouver Molson-Indy.
	   Franchitti won the fourth pole of the season with his best lap
of 1 minute, 4.130 seconds on the 2.899-kilometer (1.802-mile)
temporary street circuit.
	   Italian driver Alex Zanardi, closing in on his second
consecutive CART FedEx Series championship, started Saturday's
final round of qualifying on the provisional pole. He ended the day
a disappointing third behing Franchitti and American Bryan Herta.
	   ``Actually I'm very confident we made the car better in practice
this morning, and I could have gone much faster,'' Zanardi said,
noting that slower cars _ notably Englishman Mark Blundell _ held
him up through much of the 30-minute session.
	   ``I still believe the speed is in the car, and maybe it will
come out in the race.''
	   Franchitti is coming off his first victory at Elkhart Lake,
Wisconsin.
	   ``It's nice to be on the pole at a circuit where it looks pretty
hard to pass,''
	   Herta took the other spot on the front row for Sunday's race at
1:04.218, while Zanardi fell short despite upping his best lap to
1:04.420.
	   ``It's going to be a tough race at a place where it is so
difficult to pass,'' Zanardi said. ``I just hope I can survive and
bring home a good result.''
	   Although he has not won a pole this season _ after winning 10
his first two years in CART _ Zanardi has started among the top
three five times, winning three of those races and finishing second
in another.
	   In fact, Zanardi goes into Sunday's 90-lap, 260.948-kilometer
(162.18-mile) race leading Target-Chip Ganassi Racing teammate
Jimmy Vasser by 80 points. If Zanardi can add nine points to that
margin, he will clinch the dlrs 1 million PPG Cup championship with
four of the 19 races remaining.
	   ``We work very hard to make both the cars good on our team,''
Zanardi said. ``I don't hope for Jimmy to have a bad day. In fact,
I hope he can improve his car and have a great day. If you look at
my learning curve the last two years, it is because of a man called
Jimmy Vasser.''
	   Vasser, who has struggled since arriving here, qualified 15th in
the 28-car field.
	   ``Our times were better, but we're not where we want to be,''
Vasser said. ``I hope we can make it better before the race.''
	   Canadian Greg Moore, a local favorite, took the fourth spot at
1:04.620, followed by rookie Tony Kanaan at 1:04.624 and three-time
Vancouver winner Michael Andretti at 64.651.
	   In fact, with the new track getting more rubber down and the
drivers getting used to it, the top 18 were less than one second
apart in qualifying.
	   Most of the drivers agree that the new circuit is fast and
dangerous in several spots.
	   ``I think there's a lot of potential to get involved in somebody
else's mistake here,'' Herta said. ``Cool heads are going to have
to prevail. I think somebody who's fast and uses his head will win
it.''
	   Mauricio Gugelmin, who won last year's race, will start 13th,
while four-time Vancouver winner Al Unser Jr. will start 22nd.
	   Adrian Fernandez, who has won two races this season, crashed
hard during Saturday's morning practice, bouncing off both the
outside and inside walls on the temporary street circuit. He
qualified his backup car and will start 21st.
	   Gil de Ferran also crashed, ricocheting off two walls early in
qualifying. He too jumped in his backup and wound up 14th.

Cannabis experts discuss legalization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Experts from around the world met in London on
Saturday to discuss how legalization of cannabis might work in
practice.
	   The so-called First International Cannabis Congress ``marks an
historic turning point in the cannabis debate, with implications
for drug policies around the globe,'' said Mike Goodman, director
of Release, a British-based drug policy organization that was
co-host.
	   ``We expect the debate to shift away from `should it be
decriminalized' to how cannabis should be regulated responsibly,''
he said.
	   ``Opinion polls continue to show growing support for cannabis
reform around the world,'' said Ethan Nadelmann, director of the
Lindesmith Center, a New York-based research institute that also
was co-host of the one-day conference.
	   ``The public is demanding legal access to cannabis for
therapeutic and other responsible uses and we plan to advise them
on how the drug can best be regulated,'' he said.
	   Current international policy varies from hardline prohibition to
legalized sale of the drug. Some U.S. states are considering
allowing patients to use marijuana for medicinal purposes.

Sluman, Perry share Greater Milwaukee Open lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW with Saturday's round. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT IMRIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Jeff Sluman, seeking his first victory since
early last year, shot an 8-under-par 63 on Saturday for a share of
the third-round lead with Chris Perry in the Greater Milwaukee
Open.
	   Told it was his lowest score of the year, Sluman was surprised.
``I didn't know that,'' he said. ``Obviously, there are no
complaints.''
	   Sluman and Perry, winless on the U.S. PGA Tour, headed into
Sunday's final round at 16-under 197, leading a group of 14 players
within six strokes of the lead. Perry followed Friday's 62 with a
67.
	   ``Man, there was a lot of energy out there. It was like being at
Packers game,'' said Perry, referring to the famous gridiron
football team which plays in nearby Green Bay, Wisconsin.
	   Perry, 36, who has played on the tour since 1984, said a victory
would make him ``the happiest guy around. ... I am grinder. I play
hard.''
	   Sluman's last victory was the 1997 Tucson Chrysler Classic.
Prior to that, he won the 1988 U.S. PGA Championship.
	   Wisconsin favorite Steve Stricker, who became a father for the
first time this week, ended Saturday's round with four birdies,
climbing within one stroke of the leaders in a tournament he said
would be `more special'' than any for him to win.
	   After posting a career-best 63 on Friday, Stricker, of nearby
Madison, shot a 67 on Saturday, using a caddie who once worked for
Sluman.
	   ``I kept telling myself something good would happen,'' Stricker
said. ``The finish was just what I needed.''
	   His wife, Nicki, who had been his caddie until becoming
pregnant, gave birth to a daughter, Bobbie Jean, on Monday.
	   ``This would be the ultimate win. It would be unbelievable,''
Stricker said. ``I don't feel that much pressure. I felt pressure
on Monday when Nicki delivered the little girl.''
	   Perry birdied three of the first six holes, missing an eagle by
maybe an inch on the par-5 sixth hole.
	   Mark Calcavecchia and Nolan Henke, were two strokes behind the
leaders. Henke shot 67 and Calcavecchia, struggling with his
putter, had a 69.
	   First-round leader Loren Roberts faded from the leaderboard,
shooting a 72 that left him seven strokes behind Perry and Sluman.
	   U.S. PGA champion Vijay Singh, making his first appearance in
Milwaukee, was 5 under for the tournament after shooting a 71
Saturday.
	   ``I've played decent, but I haven't made any putts,'' he said.
``I don't know how these guys got that many under. I must be using
the wrong ball.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Defending U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter
needed just 66 minutes and lost only three games Saturday, breezing
into the round of 16 at the U.S. Open.
	   Andre Agassi advanced while losing just five games. Venus
Williams needed to play only half a match.
	   ``You never feel badly about winning. You want to get on and off
as quick as you possibly can,'' Rafter said after his 6-1, 6-1, 6-1
victory over David Nainkin. ``This is a Grand Slam. You want to
conserve your energy.''
	   Only two seeded women and three seeded men have been eliminated.
	   The third-seeded Rafter, who lost just six points on his first
serve and never faced a break point, will face No. 14 Goran
Ivanisevic in the fourth round.
	   Ivanisevic had 21 aces in a 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-4 win over Paul
Haarhuis, a player who had tormented him in the past. The
temperamental Ivanisevic said he has been playing better since
banging his head on the court during a second-round win over Todd
Martin earlier this week.
	   ``Sometimes I am a little bit messed up,'' he explained. ``I
have to bang, then everything comes together.''
	   Agassi won 6-2, 6-3, 6-0 in 96 minutes over Davide Sanguinetti,
who twisted his right ankle late in the first set and played the
rest of the match with the ankle heavily taped. Agassi's next
opponent will be No. 9 Karol Kucera.
	   Williams' match lasted just 13 minutes. She was leading 5-0 in
the first set when Larisa Neiland retired because of a painful
lower back injury that prevented her from sitting on the final
changeover.
	   Neiland was unable to move more than a few feet from the middle
of the court, watching helplessly when Williams hit shots into the
corners. Neiland's face was contorted with pain as she held onto
the umpire's chair for support after five games and told Williams
she could not continue.
	   ``I really would have enjoyed to have a match where she could
have played to her full ability,'' Williams said. ``I can get the
preparation on the practice court.''
	   Agassi, who played third on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court after
Rafter and Williams, was shocked to start playing so early in the
afternoon.
	   ``Both matches combined were like an hour and 15 minutes,
phenomenal,'' Agassi said. ``I felt rather rushed, I didn't enjoy
that at all.''
	   Other men advancing to the fourth round were No. 12 Jonas
Bjorkman and Marat Safin, the Russian teen-ager who became a crowd
favorite with his improbable run through this year's French Open.
	   Safin's next opponent probably will be four-time champion Pete
Sampras, who faced Mikael Tillstrom in a third-round match Saturday
night.
	   Women's winners included No. 2 Lindsay Davenport, No. 4 Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, No. 10 Nathalie Tauziat, No. 13 Amanda Coetzer and
No. 15 Anna Kournikova.
	   The only men's seeded player spending much time on court was No.
10 Carlos Moya, who needed 3 hours, 49 minutes to rally from a
two-set deficit for the first time in his career in a 3-6, 1-6, 7-6
(7-5), 6-4, 6-3 win over Michael Chang that began Friday night and
lasted until 1:33 a.m. Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Latin American leaders warned of a
world-wide recession and issued a plea for Russia, Asia and the
developed nations to take immediate measures to halt financial
market turmoil that has battered stocks and currencies in the
region.
	   Economic worries were the top priority at the annual one-day
gathering of the 14-member Rio Group of Latin American leaders,
after the region's largest market _ the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange _
suffered a 13.9 percent midday slide Friday and other Latin markets
reported declines.
	   ``We urge the countries which have generated the international
financial crisis to adopt the necessary measures to correct their
imbalances,'' the presidents and other leaders attending the summit
said in a joint declaration.
	   ``It is indispensable for the G-7 nations to immediately take
the necessary steps to restore stability in financial markets,''
continued the statement, referring to the G-7 group of the world's
most industrialized nations.
	   The document also called on international lending agencies to
play a greater role in stemming the turmoil, which has devalued
many of the region's currencies and forced other governments to
spend foreign reserves to defend their currencies.
	   ``We are concerned about the possibility that the international
financial crisis may worsen, to the point where a world-wide
recession could occur.''
	   President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico _ where the market also fell
Friday and the peso hit a new low _ spoke with summit host Ernesto
Perez Balladares of Panama and other leaders before the summit's
start to suggest they make the global financial crisis the main
focus.
	   ``They are worried because it's a crisis that greatly affects
... commerce, investment and public spending,'' Mexico's Foreign
Secretary, Rosario Green, said prior to the signing of the
declaration.
	   The 10 Latin American presidents attending the summit along with
four top officials from other countries gave a vote of confidence
to the free-market reforms that have swept the region in the last
decade.
	   ``We reaffirm our commitment to handle in a responsible way
those economic policy mechanisms that guarantee growth and
stability,'' the statement read.
	   And they said Latin American economies ``showed clear signs of
strength.''
	   Zedillo, Colombian President Andres Pastrana and Venezuelan
President Rafael Caldera met privately before the larger meeting,
agreeing that their region should be able to withstand the troubles
because their economic structures are distinct from those of Asia
and Russia.
	   In a separate declaration, the group also addressed regional
unity, development, the need to protect democracy and human rights,
poverty, drug trafficking and terrorism.
	   Those topics had been expected to be near the top of the summit
agenda, before the financial market turbulence hit.
	   The group criticized the U.S. Helms-Burton law, which punishes
businesses that trade with Cuba, as harmful to international
commerce and as an example of a nation wrongly attempting to impose
its laws outside of its territory.
	   Eight nations _ Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, Argentina,
Brazil, Peru and Uruguay _ founded the group in Rio de Janeiro in
1986. Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, and Paraguay joined later.
	   Two countries are the temporary representatives for their
regions: El Salvador for Central America and Guyana for the
Caribbean.

 &UR; SURINAME: More criminal suspects released due to judicial
stalemate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Five more criminal suspects have
been released because of a political standoff between the president
and the courts over the appointment of a new attorney general.
	   Heloise Rozenblad, named attorney general by President Jules
Wijdenbosch, set the five suspects free late Friday after a judge
ruled they could not legally be held any longer.
	   More suspects may be freed, including nine accused of murder, if
the situation is not resolved soon.
	   Judges are not proceeding with criminal cases because they
consider Rozenblad's appointment unconstitional. Wijdenbosch named
her before consulting with the South American nation's top court,
as required by the constitution.
	   Both associations of lawyers in the country agree that the
appointments of Rozenblad as attorney general and Alfred Veldema as
president of the high court are unconstitutional. But Wijdenbosch
has said he has done nothing wrong and refuses to resubmit the
nominations, as the lawyers organizations have suggested.
 &UR; VIRGIN ISLANDS: Territory senator calls for federal bailout
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ If the federal
government can help bail out Asian and Russian economies, it should
consider taking over the dlrs 1 billion debt of this U.S. Caribbean
territory, a local lawmaker said.
	   The Virgin Islands has been hit by three devastating hurricanes
in the last decade and deserves help as much as the countries being
assisted by the U.S.-supported International Monetary Fund, said
territory Sen. David Jones.
	   ``Charity begins at home,'' said Jones. ``The United States has
a moral obligation to help the territory.''
	   Jones said Friday he will introduce a resolution calling for a
federal bailout when the Senate convenes late this month.
 &UR; SURINAME: Guilder slides lower against the dollar
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ The guilder slid to 630 to the U.S.
dollar on the unofficial market Saturday, with some money changers
expecting it to drop to 650 within a week, far from the official
rate of 405 to the dollar.
	   Even the Central Bank is not selling dollars at the official
rate.
	   The government of former President Ronald Venetiaan had brought
the rate down to 450 after it had hit an all-time high of 700. But
current President Jules Wijdenbosch is blamed by opposition
politicians, including his own cousin, for overspending and causing
inflation.
	   Ruth Wijdenbosch said Saturday her cousin's government is
covering its spending by printing more money, thereby fueling
inflation and devaluing the currency.
 &UR; VIRGIN ISLANDS: Workers find centuries-old bones
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Part of the renovation
work at Government House on St. Croix was halted this week when
workers found pre-Columbian human bones at the site.
	   Workers digging a trench along the southeast corner of the
property found the skull and leg bones. Thomas R. Wheaton, an
archeologist for the Georgia-based New South Associates Inc., has
concluded that the bones date prior to 1492.
	   Territory officials are currently searching territorial statutes
to determine local guidelines regarding such finds.
	   Construction company officials said that the bones were found in
shallow ground with no other artifacts or additional human bones.
	   Workers are currently searching the site for more bones or other
burial sites before construction can resume on that area.
Meanwhile, work continues on the exterior and interior of the
building.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Some sobbing and stumbling, others
shivering silently in a brisk breeze, relatives of Swissair Flight
111's victims sent wreaths out to sea Saturday and carried away
jars of water from the ocean where their loved ones died. Offshore
from the rocky ledge where the mourners stood, there was a
potential breakthrough in the search for the jet's missing flight
recorders, which could provide clues into the cause of the crash
late Wednesday that killed all 229 people aboard. Search commanders
said a Canadian submarine had detected signals coming from one of
the recorders. Divers working at depth of 190 feet (58 meters) ried
to pinpoint the location, but were hindered by limited visibility
and planned to resume the hunt Sunday. (CANADA-SWISSAIR CRASH)
	   LIMERICK, Ireland (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton appealed to
the Irish people Saturday never to allow ``the enemies of peace to
break your will'' as Northern Ireland's Protestant leader announced
he would finally end his long war of nerves with Sinn Fein. As
Clinton concluded a fruitful three-day swing through both parts of
Ireland, he told more than 20,000 people crowding Limerick's
central crossroads that the Northern Ireland agreement should
provide inspiration to entrenched conflicts worldwide. ``You have
made it possible for me ... to tell every warring, feuding, hating
group of people, trapped in the prison of their past conflict, to
look at Ireland and know there can be a better day,'' Clinton
declared to cheers and applause. (CLINTON-IRELAND)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea's newly convened
parliament on Saturday reelected Kim Jong Il as head of its 1.1
million-strong military, the backbone of the reclusive Stalinist
regime, an official news report said. The move reconfirms Kim's
grip on power, said Seoul's Naewoe Press, which monitored the North
Korean state media that reported Kim's reelection as chairman of
the National Defense Commission, a post he has held since 1993. The
Supreme People's Assembly convened Saturday to elect key government
posts for the first time since Kim's father, longtime President Kim
Il Sung, died of heart failure in 1994. It has widely been expected
to consolidate the junior Kim's power by electing him as state
president. But a presidential election was not on the assembly's
agenda. (NKOREA- POLITICS)
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels attacked a prison in western
Rwanda and freed about 3,000 inmates suspected of involvement in
the 1994 genocide, authorities said Saturday. Details were sketchy,
but authorities in Kibuye, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of
capital Kigali, said a group of 2,000 rebels on Friday overpowered
the guards at Kivumu prison and set people free. Most of the
inmates who had escaped returned voluntarily to the prison by
Saturday, officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The
inmates were apparently afraid of army reprisals if associated with
the rebels. State-run Radio Rwanda said the rebels, attacking from
the nearby Mukura forest, had also attacked Nyange secondary
school, killing three teachers. (RWANDA-JAILBREAK)
	   OSASCO, Brazil (AP) _ A church roof collapsed during services in
a Brazilian town Saturday, killing 30 people and injuring 538 more,
firefighters said. congregation of 1,300 was in the church in
Osasco, 9 miles (15 kms) southwest of Sao Paulo, when the roof came
crashing down, firefighter Fabio Leite said. ``We were praying and
had our eyes closed. When we opened them the building was
falling,'' worshipper Maria Aparecida Costa said in a televised
interview from a first-aid station. ``I fainted and when I woke up
I was buried.'' The roof had started to creak moments before it
caved in, eyewitnesses told Brazilian television. Amateur video
footage showed firefighters using chain saws to break up the
destroyed wooden roof and free the wounded. One young woman pleaded
with them to get her mother out. (BRAZIL-CHURCH DISASTER)

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The wife of Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso was admitted to hospital here Saturday suffering
from heart problems, according to local news reports.
	   Dona Ruth Cardoso was taken to hospital after feeling sudden
pains while out walking, according to TV Globo. She was treated and
put under observation for several hours but was expected to be
released late Saturday.
	   Cardoso canceled a meeting with his economic team to be with his
wife, the television station reported.
	   Neither a spokesman for the President nor the hospital would
comment.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's Central Bank has moved to
restrict borrowing after Brazilians rushed to invest abroad,
newspapers reported Saturday.
	   The interest rate at which the Central Bank lends to commercial
banks will be set at 29.75 percent interest rate, up from 19
percent rate, when financial activity resumes Tuesday after a
public holiday.
	   ``Too much money was being borrowed at the 19 percent interest
rate and invested'' outside of Brazil, Central Bank spokesman
Silvia Faria said late Friday.
	   The action comes amid some uncertainty in Brazil's economy. At
one point Friday, stock prices plunged by 14 percent before
recovering down 6 percent.
	   Brazil's nervousness was attributed to declining U.S. stocks and
Moody's Investors Service lowering the financial strength ratings
of the country.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A salt plant on the Baja California peninsula
has agreed to cut brine dumping that was blamed for the deaths of
94 sea turtles in late 1997, in what environmental authorities
called a voluntary agreement Saturday.
	   The company, owned in part by the government, agreed to monitor
salt levels, conduct studies of the turtles and reduce emissions of
highly-concentrated brine that experts have said caused the largest
die-off in two years of sea turtles, a protected species in Mexico.
	   The announcement was made in a statement by the Environment
Secretariat.
	   The Exportadora de Sal company, in which the Mexican government
has a 51 percent stake while the rest is owned by Japan's
Mitsubishi company, produces salt on the Baja peninsula by
evaporating sea water in flat lagoon beds.
	   In July, the Environment Secretariat said one of the company's
plants, located in the Ojo de Liebre lagoon on the Baja Pacific
coast, was responsible for turtle deaths. The lagoon is located
about 325 miles (520 kilometers) south of Tijuana.
	   But the Saturday agreement called for another study of the
die-off. Should that study also implicate the salt plant, the
company would have to pay for remediation efforts in the lagoon and
possibly pay fines.

_ a high-tech future for Germany's most tradition-bound state.
	   The formula has helped transform Bavaria since World War II from
an agricultural backwater known mostly for its scenic beauty and
traditional lederhosen garb into one of Germany's wealthiest
regions _ and won absolute majorities in the statehouse for the
arch-conservative Christian Social Union since 1962.
	   But despite a strong economy and the lowest unemployment in
Germany, elections here Sept. 13 look like less of a romp for the
CSU, the Bavaria-only branch of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats.
	   Stoiber isn't the only one anxiously awaiting the outcome of the
vote: Kohl has been struggling in his bid for re-election in
nationwide polls Sept. 27, and a poor showing for the CSU _
anything less than 50 percent _ would be another psychological
blow.
	   Even a good CSU performance in the state election doesn't
necessarily mean Kohl is safe. Polls show the CSU's support is
stronger on state issues than the national ones that will be key in
the big vote.
	   Social Democratic chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder, who
leads Kohl in polls, has been criss-crossing the state trying to
chip away at the CSU base.
	   Kohl has been less visible. He wasn't even invited to the CSU's
party convention last weekend.
	   Apparently fearful of being dragged down by Kohl's sagging
popularity, Stoiber doesn't mention the chancellor at all in his
stump speeches. In fact, he sounds more like a chancellor candidate
himself.
	   Completely ignoring his local political opponents, Stoiber
lashes out time and again at Schroeder and the Social Democrats
national party chairman, Oskar Lafontaine.
	   ``Those are my challengers,'' he thundered at a campaign rally
Wednesday in Fuerth, a city about 125 miles north of Munich. Both
are governors like him, and Stoiber shows obvious delight in
reciting statistics to show how much better off his state is than
theirs.
	   Bavaria, home to global firms like BMW, Adidas and Siemens, has
a jobless rate of about 6 percent, little more than half the
national rate.
	   Threats from the left and some smaller parties have cut into
CSU's strength. Polls earlier this year showed the CSU below 50
percent for the first time in decades, although the party seems to
have recovered to about 51 percent in recent weeks.
	   Shoring up his right-wing credentials, Stoiber has stressed
law-and-order themes and demands the immediate deportation of
foreigners who commit crimes in Germany.
	   He has urged Kohl to be careful as Germany gives up the mark for
the untested euro next year, he rails against welfare cheats and he
wants crucifixes to remain in Bavarian classrooms.
	   Julchen Beer, a 28-year-old mother holding a mug of beer in one
hand and tending her 1-year-old son Frederick with the other, is
voting CSU, she says, because ``they're more family-oriented, they
hold to traditions.''
	   Others in the crowd of several hundred in Fuerth who turned out
in a light drizzle to hear Stoiber speak, were less committed.
	   Those planning to vote for Stoiber weren't sure they would
choose CSU again in the national vote. ``Then you're voting for
Kohl,'' said one young businessman.

After seven years of independence, Baltics are post-Soviet success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL TARM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ Seven years after the Kremlin turned
them loose, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are the success stories
of the former Soviet Union.
	   New buildings gleam in their once drab and shabby capitals, old
architectural gems are being spruced up, and fashionably dressed
young professionals hurry purposefully, their cellular phones
prominently displayed.
	   Although prosperity still eludes many of the Baltics' 8 million
people, the countries' economies are growing at among the fastest
rates in Europe.
	   ``The Baltics are the most successful reformers of all the
ex-Soviet republics,'' said Ardo Hansson, a senior World Bank
economist in Warsaw. ``There is no doubt about it.''
	   They were supposed to be too small, too vulnerable and too
damaged by Soviet rule to make it.
	   When the Kremlin recognized their independence on September 6,
1991, all three economies were in tatters. They got even worse in
the early months of independence. Gross domestic product plummeted,
and annual inflation in the countries topped 1,000 percent.
Shortages of almost everything, from butter to toilet paper, were
rampant.
	   But by 1995, when other post-Soviet economies were still in a
downward slide, the Baltics were recording economic growth. For
1998, all three are expected to post economic growth of 6 percent
or better.
	   David Katz, commercial attache at the U.S. Embassy in Tallinn,
said the Baltics have thrived because they have not tried to cling
to elements of Soviet economics.
	   ``They simply threw out the old and started with a clean
slate,'' he said.
	   Virtually all Soviet-style subsidies were slashed. Privatization
of all but a few big infrastructure companies was completed long
ago. New currencies were introduced and pegged strictly to stable
foreign currencies.
	   ``Radical free-market reforms may now be losing favor around the
world, but the Baltic states embraced them and made them work,''
Katz said.
	   But such reforms also have left out many, especially the elderly
and people living in the countryside. Scaled-down welfare systems
mean the poor and pensioners are often forced to subsist on less
than dlrs100 a month in countries where food prices are near
Western levels.
	   Sociologists say suicide rates, which went up sharply after
independence, are now among the highest in the world and are at
least partly a consequence of the economic hardships.
	   The Baltics' economies have been vulnerable to the financial
turmoil in Asia, and analysts are uneasily watching for effects
from Russia's crisis.
	   Although the Baltics have diligently turned much of their trade
west, Russia is still the largest trading partner for all three
countries.
	   Another concern is that the three Baltics have had trouble
setting up economic cooperation with each other.
	   ``Since we had such spiritual unity when we fought for our
independence from Moscow, there was a kind of illusion that things
would develop fast,'' said Latvian foreign ministry spokesman
Andrejs Pildegovics. ``But we have realized that setting up a joint
economic area is a tremendous task.''
	   Baltic leaders are pinning hopes for future growth and
prosperity on getting their countries into the European Union.
	   They are the only former Soviet republics whose candidacies for
membership are being taken seriously by the EU. Estonia last year
won a coveted invitation to start talks on membership, and Latvia
and Lithuania are seen as having good chances of landing
invitations this year.
	   The countries also are eager to join NATO, although none of them
are immediate candidates.
	   ``Russia is like a big vacuum cleaner, and we must always run
forward to be rooted in Western society,'' Latvian Foreign Minister
Valdis Birkavs said last year. ``If we stop running, we will be
sucked in.''

Ruling coalition to cut budget, talks of tax increases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs.
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's governing coalition has
decided on a package of budget cuts and tax increases to help the
country weather the effects of financial turmoil triggered by
economic crises in Russia and Asia.
	   In a rare Saturday session, the Cabinet agreed to seek
parliamentary approval for cuts in the budgets of five ministries _
health, education, defense, culture and research _ totaling 7.5
trillion le, or dlrs 843 million.
	   Government spokesmen said the Cabinet would probably announce
other measures soon, including tax increases on cars, real estate,
tobacco and alcohol.
	   The announcement followed a meeting late Friday between leaders
of the four coalition parties and President Emil Constantinescu,
who urged them to carry on market reforms and end the political
bickering which has stagnated the government for months.
	   Early Saturday, the parties issued a statement declaring that at
a time when ``several countries around Romania'' face ``economic,
financial and political crises,'' the government must ``assure the
country real political stability.''
	   The statement included each ministry's priorities for the next
six months in an effort to carry through privatization, market
reforms, social policies and fight corruption.
	   One of the four parties, the Hungarian Democratic Union, said it
would support the economic reform program. But the HDU, which
represents Romania's 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians, said it would
decide later whether to back other government programs.
	   On Thursday, HDU leader Bela Marko said the party, which
controls 36 of the 486 seats in the national assembly, was
``withdrawing support'' for the government to protest a decision by
a parliamentary committee to oppose a Hungarian language
university.
	   The announcement meant the Hungarian party no longer felt
obliged to vote with its coalition partners on every issue. The
other parties prefer a ``multicultural'' university open to all
ethnic minorities.
	   Following a meeting Saturday in Cluj, 325 kilometers (203 miles)
northwest of Bucharest, HDU leaders announced they would leave the
coalition altogether unless parliament agrees by Sept. 30 to open
the Hungarian university.
	   ``This is a chance offered by the HDU to the ruling coalition,''
HDU vice president Attila Verestoy said. ``This is our firm
decision.''
	   Marko, considered a moderate, is under pressure from nationalist
hardliners in the party to take a strong stand in defense of what
they consider Hungarian rights.

	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. hit his American League-leading
48th homer, a go-ahead, three-run shot in the eighth Saturday that
led the Seattle Mariners over the Baltimore Orioles 6-5.
	   With Seattle trailing 5-2, Alex Rodriguez hit an RBI single off
Armando Benitez (5-4) and Griffey followed with his first home run
since Aug. 30 at New York, sending the Orioles to their 13th loss
in 15 games.
	   Greg McCarthy (1-2) got three outs for the victory, and Mike
Timlin finished for his 13th save.
 &UR; Blue Jays 4, Red Sox 3
	   In Toronto, Roger Clemens (18-6) allowed three hits in eight
innings to remain unbeaten since May 29, and Toronto won its ninth
straight.
	   By winning the first three games of the four-game series, the
Blue Jays pulled within six games of the Red Sox, the AL wild-card
leader. Boston lost for the seventh time in 10 games.
	   Shawn Green, Carlos Delgado and Jose Canseco homered for the
Blue Jays.
	   Clemens (18-6), who lowered his league-leading ERA to 2.62,
struck out 11 and walked three. He has won 13 consecutive decisions
and is unbeaten in 18 starts.
	   Paul Quantrill got two outs for Bret Saberhagen (12-7) gave up
three runs and eight hits in six innings.

Cardinals beat Reds 7-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire moved within one of Roger Maris'
home-run record, hitting his 60th in the first inning Saturday as
the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Cincinnati Reds 7-0.
	   McGwire, who has five homers in his last four games and 13 in 18
days, has 21 games remaining to set the record. He joined Babe Ruth
and Maris as the only players to hit 60 homers in a single season.
Ruth hit 60 in 1927, a record that stood until Maris hit 61 in
1961.
	   Saturday's shot off Dennis Reyes (3-5) put St. Louis ahead 2-0.
Donovan Osborne (4-3) pitched a three-hitter and the Cardinals won
for the fifth time in six games, stopping a 10-game losing streak
to the Reds.
 &UR; Mets 5, Braves 4
	   In New York, Tony Phillips made up for a rough sixth inning with
a two-run homer in the eighth off Rudy Seanez (4-1) that overcame a
4-3 deficit.
	   In the top of the sixth, Phillips had failed to come up with
Greg Colbrunn's fly to left that turned into a two-run double as
the Braves took a 4-2 lead. In the bottom half, Phillips couldn't
deliver a base hit with the bases loaded, hitting an inning-ending
flyout.
	   Turk Wendell (5-1) struck out two in the eighth, and John Franco
finished for his 32nd save. Franco moved past Dennis Eckersley into
second place on the career list with his 391st save, 87 behind Lee
Smith.
 &UR; Padres 4, Rockies 2
	   In Denver, Kevin Brown (18-5) became the first San Diego pitcher
to win 18 games since 1985 and San Diego reduced its magic number
for clinching the NL West to six.
	   Brown gave up two runs and five hits in seven innings, striking
out five and walking four. He also broke a 2-all tie with a
sixth-inning double.
	   Steve Finley, went 3-for-4 including a two-run homer and Quilvio
Veras went 2-for-4 with a walk. Trevor Hoffman got three outs for
his 46th save.
	   Darryl Kile (10-16) allowed four runs _ just one earned _ and
eight hits in seven innings.
 &UR; Dodgers 6, Giants 3
	   In Los Angeles, Chan Ho Park (12-7) pitched a four-hitter to win
for the second time in seven starts, giving Los Angeles its first
four-game winning streak of the season.
	   Orel Hershiser (9-10), who pitched for the Dodgers from 1983-94,
gave up six runs and eight hits in two-plus innings.

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Searchers have detected signals
coming from one of Swissair Flight 111's missing recorders, but
preliminary dives failed to locate it under the sea, officials
said.
	   On Saturday, search commanders said a Canadian submarine had
detected signals coming from one of the recorders. The recorders
could provide clues into the cause of the crash late Wednesday that
killed all 229 people aboard.
	   Divers working at a depth of 190 feet (58 meters) tried to
pinpoint the location, but were hindered by limited visibility and
planned to resume the hunt Sunday.
	   The searchers also said sonar probes had detected a cylindrical
object, about 30 feet (9 meters) long, on the seabed. Whether it
was part of the fuselage or just a rock remained to be determined,
Navy Capt. Phil Webster said.
	   Onshore, relatives of the crash's victims sent wreaths out to
sea Saturday and carried away jars of water from the ocean where
their loved ones died.
	   Also Saturday, crash investigators released excerpts of the
final conversation between the plane's pilots and air traffic
controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick.
	   The pilots reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the
crash, then spent 10 minutes getting directions for a rapid descent
from 33,000 feet (10,000 meters) and for dumping fuel into the
ocean before heading toward an emergency landing in Halifax.
	   The plane made two sharp turns, then communications ceased six
minutes before the plane hit the water. The crew's last words were:
``We are declaring an emergency ... we have to land immediately.''
	   ``All of the conversations were very professional,'' said Vic
Gerden, the chief crash investigator. But he said communications
became less clear in the last stages, suggesting the pilots may
have donned oxygen masks that affected their speech.
	   Gerden said the aircraft was about 30 tons overweight for a safe
landing, and needed about 12 minutes of flying to rid itself of
excess fuel. Landing so heavily could have forced the aircraft off
the runway at a high rate of speed, he said.
	   In all, more than 300 family members have flown to Halifax from
New York, the plane's starting point, and Geneva, its intended
destination.
	   Most of them were driven in chartered buses Saturday to Peggy's
Cove, the tiny, picturesque fishing village near the ocean crash
site that has become the base for the search operation.
	   Police and soldiers kept a large media contingent well away from
the area cordoned off for the mourners, and only a few agreed to
speak with journalists.
	   One of them was Claire Mortimer, 45, of Berkeley, California,
whose father, John Mortimer, a former executive of The New York
Times, was among the victims.
	   ``My father would have wanted me to be here,'' she said. ``It's
ironic that he has died in the ocean that he loved. ... In an odd
way, it's very comforting to me to come here and see this beautiful
place.''
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police deployed boats to take wreaths
out to the crash site, a few miles (kilometers) from shore, and
bring back jars of sea water to be kept by relatives in
remembrance.
	   Security forces have barred people, boats and planes not
involved in the search from the entire search area, including
several miles of coastline. About 250 soldiers were combing the
shoreline in search of debris and body parts.
	   The process of identifying the bodies was expected to take
weeks, because most of the human remains found so far have been
fragments.
	   Only on Saturday morning did officials announce the first
positive identification _ a French woman whose name was not
released.
	   Dr. John Butt, Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, said
pathology teams were working around the clock on ``a daunting
task'' and described in a shaken tone how he had struggled to
inform relatives how badly damaged the bodies were.

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Brandishing the flag of African
nationalism, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Saturday blasted
American and U.N. sanctions against Libya, saying a defiant Africa
had triumphed over imperialism.
	   ``They stepped on the American sanctions ... with their dark
feet,'' said Gadhafi, pointing to the five African leaders who flew
to Tripoli in violation of a U.N. ban on air travel to and from
Libya.
	   Speaking before thousands in Tripoli's Martyr's Square, Gadhafi,
dressed in tan fatigues and seated behind a podium, commended the
bravery of Sudan's Omar el-Bashir, Chadian President Idriss Deby,
Niger's Ibrahim Bare Mainassara, Mali's Alpha Oumar Konare and the
Central African Republic's President Ange-Felix Patasse as ``a
gathering of hawks'' who had faced up to ``American imperialism''.
	   The five presidents were invited to attend a ceremony late
Saturday marking the 20th anniversary of the Libyan Armed Laborers
Day. The celebration also honored the 30th anniversary of the Sept.
1 bloodless coup that brought the Libyan leader to power.
	   The Security Council imposed the embargo in a bid to force Libya
to hand over for trial two suspects wanted for the 1988 bombing of
an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270
people.
	   Libya has refused to extradite the suspects on grounds that they
would not receive a fair trial in the United States or Britain.
	   Last month, Washington and London persuaded the Security Council
to allow the trial to be held in the Netherlands with Scottish
judges and under Scottish law.
	   Libya has accepted the deal, but Gadhafi wants further
negotiations to provide ``guarantees'' for the suspects' safe
custody and fair trial. Washington and London say the offer is
non-negotiable.
	   Thrusting his fist in the air, Gadhafi lashed out at the U.S.
and Britain for ``belittling human rights, international law ...
and the world court'' by proffering an agreement he says could
leave the two suspects vulnerable to extradition from the
Netherlands to Scotland.
	   Gadhafi said Libya would accept an agreement only if ``Holland
was the last stop (for the two men) ... whether they are found
guilty or innocent.''
	   ``We don't care about the sanctions,'' he said. ``We live with
integrity. We live to challenge.''
	   ``Challenge on, oh you lone hawk,'' was the reply from the
crowd.
	   For months, Gadhafi has been toting the African banner in what
has proven to be a largely successful bid to muster support against
the sanctions and America. The Organization of African Unity, in
its June summit, decided it would no longer respect the U.N.
embargo, which also bans arms sales.

	   In the spotlight: Harry Connick Jr., a soulful but happy guy
	    &UR; Personal stats: Born Sept. 11, 1967. Harry Connick's parents
were lawyers who co-owned a New Orleans record store and encouraged
their son's musical interests. He first touched a piano at age 3,
and by 6 was good enough to play at his father's swearing-in
ceremony as city district attorney.
	   Before age 10, Connick made his debut with a jazz band, and
while working clubs in the French Quarter, he studied piano with
Ellis Marsalis and James Booker. He moved to New York at age 18 to
study at Hunter College and later at the Manhattan School of Music.
	   Connick signed with Columbia Records and recorded his
self-titled debut album in one session at age 19. Critics praised
the idiosyncratic style of both the debut album and its follow-up.
	    &UR; Breakthrough: Director Rob Reiner asked Connick to work on the
score to his 1989 film, ``When Harry Met Sally,'' which included
several warm standards _ ``It Had to Be You,'' ``Let's Call the
Whole Thing Off'' and ``Don't Get Around Much Anymore.'' The film's
success led to Connick's first multi-platinum album.
	   His next two albums, ``Lofty's Roach Souffle'' and the
multi-platinum, Grammy-winning ``We Are in Love,'' released
simultaneously in July 1990, topped the jazz charts and scored high
on the pop charts as well. That same year, his gold-certified home
video, ``Singin' and Swingin','' was released and he made his
acting debut inthe film, ``Memphis Belle.''
	    &UR; Movie star, too: Connick appeared in Jodie Foster's 1991 film
``Little Man Tate,'' co-starred with Holly Hunter and Sigourney
Weaver in ``Copycat,'' and appeared in the 1996 box office champion
``Independence Day.'' He also co-starred with Alicia Silverstone in
``Excess Baggage,'' and won critical raves for this summer's ``Hope
Floats,'' opposite Sandra Bullock.
	   ``I'm not stretched thin. Not really,'' he says. ``The two
careers are pretty unrelated.''
	   In his music career, Connick has racked up one gold, four
platinum, and three multi-platinum albums, and won two Grammys. His
latest album, ``To See You,'' is his 12th.
	   ``The inspiration for this was a flight attendant, really,''
Connick says. ``She asked if I had any romantic records, and I
thought maybe it was time to do a romantic album.''
	   Connick and his wife, former model Jill Goodacre, have two
daughters.
	   ``Everybody makes me out to be some kind of old-fashioned
goody-goody. I don't see how my life is different,'' he says.
``People don't believe that a happy person can be soulful, or a
happy person can deal with pain.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Although Renee Fleming was a late bloomer in the
opera world, her career is in full blossom. She has just one thing
to say: ``Boy! We'll see if I'm still standing in December.''
	   She sings Blanche in the September premiere of ``A Streetcar
Named Desire'' by Andre Previn at the San Francisco Opera.
	   She sings in three of the Metropolitan Opera's new productions
this season _ the first such triple by a soprano at the Met since
Roberta Peters sang in ``The Tales of Hoffmann,'' ``Don Pasquale''
and ``The Magic Flute'' in 1955-56.
	   Manuela Hoelterhoff, in her new book about mezzo-soprano Cecilia
Bartoli, calls Fleming ``the most fully equipped lyric soprano of
her generation.'' Her voice is compared with Renata Tebaldi's.
	   ``From May until the end of the year is just unbelievably tense,
with four new roles,'' Fleming, 39, says on a stop here between
Houston, Texas, and Milan, Italy. ``I just finished `Arabella' in
Houston, my first. I have `Lucrezia Borgia' at La Scala, then
`Streetcar.' `Traviata' is new for me; I haven't sung it.''
	   ``La Traviata'' was added when Roberto Alagna and Angela
Gheorghiu, who were offered the tenor and soprano roles in the
Met's new production of ``Traviata'' in November, declined to sign
the contracts last spring. They were said to be wary of what
designer Franco Zeffirelli might design. Zeffirelli is known for
his ``cast-of-thousands'' approach to staging in which stars may
fade into the background.
	   ``I just couldn't resist that one,'' the American soprano says,
when the Met offered it to her.
	   ``They're all substantial and challenging in different ways,''
she says about her new roles. ```Arabella' is challenging vocally
because it's high. Anything at La Scala is frightening. To do bel
canto repertoire there for the first time, I would say is
borderline crazy.''
	   The first ``Lucrezia Borgia'' at La Scala July 6, broadcast
across Europe, had a claque in the audience booing from the moment
Fleming walked on stage and booing while she sang. At the end of
bows after the opera, those who wanted to boo and those who wanted
to cheer stayed and shouted at each other. One observer said it was
the worst behavior in the opera house in 30 years.
	   She sang ``Lucrezia Borgia'' three times and decided not to do
two more performances because of the stress.
	   But learning new roles, even in a new opera like ``Streetcar,''
isn't that stressful for Fleming.
	   ``I was brought up playing piano and violin,'' she says. ``For
me, learning new music is not difficult. `Streetcar' is not atonal
and complex for complexity's sake. It is very beautiful. For me, it
is an accessible piece. I don't know whether audiences will feel
that way. The music is lush, rich, very harmonically based and
texture based. It's gorgeous.''
	   Fleming was able to slot the Met's ``Traviata'' into her
schedule because she already was scheduled to be at the Met for its
new production of ``The Marriage of Figaro'' Oct. 29.
	   When ``Traviata'' became available _ she'll sing Violetta _
Fleming told the Met she'd be happy to give up ``Figaro'' to do it.
She was supposed to sing the Countess in ``Figaro'' 11 times. Met
management decided she'd sing in both new productions, each four
times.
	   The third new Met production for Fleming this season is Carlisle
Floyd's ``Susannah'' in March.
	   The Countess in ``Figaro'' is the role that gave Fleming her
first break. She sang it at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., the
Spoleto Festival in Italy and, 10 years ago, when she was 29, in
Houston.
	   ``I was frustrated not to get my career started right after I
left Juilliard,'' Fleming says. ``In retrospect, it was perfect. I
could never have handled the pressure in my early 20s. My voice
wasn't technically stable enough for the schedule I have this year.
You have to be emotionally very stable, very rooted, or you flow up
and down with every success and every failure.''
	   In 1989, Fleming married actor Rick Ross, whom she'd met when
both were studying at The Juilliard School. ``That has been
important, obviously,'' she says. ``The children (Amelia and Sage)
even more so. They ground me in a fantastic way.
	   ``I remember visiting Joan Sutherland at her house in
Switzerland. ... She told me, `One of the most important things is,
have your children. It doesn't matter what engagements you lose. My
grandchildren are the greatest joy of my life.'''
	   The beautiful blue-eyed soprano has been praised for her family
life and she has a reputation among colleagues for being easy to
get along with. She has wondered sometimes whether she shouldn't
call more attention to herself with diva fits. So far, she hasn't
done it.
	   Fleming sang jazz in college to combat shyness. She intends to
record songs by Duke Ellington. ``Most of his songs are good for
classical singers,'' she says.
	   On Oct. 9, Fleming will sing with the Berlin Philharmonic at
Carnegie Hall. She starts a recital tour Jan. 3, to 10 American
cities and Toronto Jan. 21, Milan Feb. 8, Paris Feb. 11 and Vienna
Feb. 14. On Feb. 17 and 18 she sings with the Danish Radio
Orchestra in Copenhagen.
	   She sings with the Orchestre de Paris in Paris April 28 and 29
and gives a recital in Barcelona May 16. Next summer, she'll sing
in a new production of Handel's ``Alcina'' at the Palais Garnier in
Paris nine times from June 7 through July 1. While there, on June
24, she sings in concert with the Paris Opera Orchestra.
	   ``Five years ago I would have been talking about working on
vocal technique. I tell young singers you can't escape that. You
have to work on technique or you can't be a real artist.''
	   Now, Fleming can look beyond that. ``The thing I focus on most
now is expression, communicating meaning and emotion of what I'm
singing to the audience and finding out how that is best done in
every piece.''
	   ``Singing is always about telling a story, finding tonal variety
and color.''

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennesee (AP) _ There's a big dilemma in doing a
tribute album to the late country legend Tammy Wynette.
	   Who among today's female singers should get the honor of taking
on Wynette's theme song, ``Stand by Your Man''? On the outstanding
``Tammy Wynette Remembered,'' to be released Tuesday (Sept. 8), the
question is sidestepped with style.
	   Pop star Elton John is the choice, singing over a slick
arrangement reminiscent of Elvis Presley's sound on hits like
``Suspicious Minds.''
	   ``Sometimes, it's hard to be a woman, givin' all your love to
just one man,'' John sings to open the album on the Asylum Records
label.
	   Columbia Records, Wynette's longtime label, has a multi-artist
collection dedicated to Wynette coming out Sept. 22. Called
``Tribute to Tradition,'' it contains remakes of two Wynette hits,
``Stand by Your Man'' by the Dixie Chicks and ```Til I Can Make It
on My Own'' by Martina McBride.
	   But it pales as a tribute to Wynette when compared with ``Tammy
Wynette Remembered.'' Most of ``Tribute to Tradition'' is country
classics not connected to Wynette, and sung by men.
	   The male singers included on ``Tammy Wynette Remembered'' _
John, George Jones and Brian Wilson _ are the exceptions. The main
event is hearing female singers pay a debt to Wynette by
reinvigorating 1960s and 1970s hits like ``I Don't Want To Play
House'' and ``Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad.''
	   Wynette had a huge influence on female country singers, and her
records also inspired future rock stars like John. She was 55 when
she died at home in Nashville on April 6 from a blood clot to the
lungs after years of health problems.
	   Though Wynette hadn't had a country hit since the 1980s, the
outpouring of grief from her fans and peers was immediate and huge.
Her star-studded memorial service was carried live on CNN and
tributes poured in from around the world.
	   ``I have been a fan, admirer _ tried to be a clone years ago _
in regards to Tammy,'' said Faith Hill, who sings Wynette's 1976
hit ```Til I Can Make It on My Own'' on ``Tammy Wynette
Remembered.''
	   ``Her music is timeless. It will speak to women and generations
years past and years to come,'' Hill said.
	   Wynette's background is the stuff of country music legend. She
picked cotton as a child in Alabama and worked as a barmaid,
waitress and hairdresser before her strong, emotional voice took
her to country music stardom. Her first record, released in 1966,
was ``Apartment No. 9.'' ``Stand by Your Man'' came in 1968.
	   ``Tammy taught me how to sing,'' said Melissa Etheridge, who
sings ``Apartment No. 9'' on ``Tammy Wynette Remembered.''
	   ``The voice you hear today on stage singing rock 'n' roll came
from Tammy Wynette _ `Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad' and
`D.I.V.O.R.C.E' _ it came from that ... .
	   ``After I heard her, I never sang softly ever again.''
	   Wynette helped glamorize country music's image in the 1970s when
she dated actor Burt Reynolds. She also made news campaigning for
Alabama Gov. George Wallace when he ran for president in 1972, and
20 years later when she told a magazine she had a circle of gay
friends.
	   Over the years, she recorded with Sting and Aaron Neville and
scored her last hit, ``Justified and Ancient,'' in 1992. It was a
dance record made with the English band KLF.
	   ``Tammy was really country, but she made country more
sophisticated,'' said Evelyn Shriver, Wynette's longtime friend and
publicist who now runs Asylum's Nashville office.
	   ``She wasn't the buffoon woman. She was the woman that movie
stars wanted to go out with. She just represented a very
classy-lady aspect of country music that up to then really hadn't
existed.''
	   Wynette's favorite song themes were dear to her audience: the
trials and tribulations of being a wife and mother. Thirty years
after feminists dismissed her, ``Tammy Wynette Remembered'' proves
her songs have stood the test of time.
	   Listen as a knowing Wynonna Judd offers advice to a rival on
``Woman to Woman,'' or Rosanne Cash spells out ``D.I.V.O.R.C.E.''
Also singing on ``Tammy Wynette Remembered'' are Trisha Yearwood,
K.T. Oslin, Lorrie Morgan, Sara Evans and Emmylou Harris.
	   Shriver and George Richey, Wynette's husband, compiled the
album. George Jones, who was married to Wynette from 1968-74 and
who was her frequent duet partner, transforms her ``Take Me to Your
World'' to ``Let Me Take You to My World.''
	   ``It was really important to me that Jones liked it, because I
knew if George liked it, Tammy would have liked it,'' Shriver said.
``He said, `I think you did a great job, but it's not Tammy
singing.'''
	   The final song on the album is Wynette singing a version of the
Beach Boys' hit ``In My Room'' with vocals and production by Brian
Wilson. It's the last song she recorded before her death.
	   Even though the song was not recorded in a good key for Wynette,
and despite her being ill at the time it was recorded in 1996, the
performance is chilling, especially when her voice breaks into a
slight yodel as she reaches for high notes at the end.
	   ``She said that she could relate to (Wilson's) pain and
isolation,'' Shriver said. ``In one sense, Tammy lived a very
isolated life, with her illnesses and everything. She was home and
she was in her room a lot.
	   ``Whenever I hear the lines, `And now I'm alone and it's so
dark' and all of that, I can barely deal with it.''

At one of world's great museums, a dynasty takes charge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY322-NY325 &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   St. PETERSBURG, Russia _ The Hermitage Museum certainly looks
like a place fit for a dynasty. Opulent beyond measure, it once
housed generations of Romanov czars and one of the world's largest
and finest art collections.
	   The art is still there _ and so is a dynasty.
	   No, not that dynasty. The Romanovs left under some duress in
1917. The new dynasty at the Hermitage is the Piotrovskys, father
and son, who have held the directorship of the museum for all but
two of the past 34 years and appear unlikely to yield it anytime
soon.
	   Between them, Boris and Mikhail Piotrovsky have shepherded one
of the world's great museums _ comparable to the Louvre in Paris or
the Metropolitan Museum in New York _ into the modern age.
Remarkably similar in some ways, each has faced drastically
different challenges. And each has proved to be a man of his time.
	   Boris Piotrovsky, a lanky, handsome archeologist, saw his heyday
during the Brezhnev era, when he walked a cautious line between
artistic freedom and the insistent demands of the Communist state.
He is said to have once asked his senior staff to stop talking so
much _ they were forcing the transcribers at the KGB listening post
to work too hard.
	   Today, Mikhail Piotrovsky, a more compact, cosmopolitan version
of his father, faces a much different balancing act, working
tirelessly to raise money for the museum while trying to maintain
its integrity. He also worries about how the museum can reach out
and grab the attention of young people more attuned to the
aesthetic of MTV than Matisse.
	   ``My slogan is, `The children must bring their parents into the
museum and make them spend money,''' he said with a laugh during a
recent interview in his office.
	   He conducted the interview in nearly flawless English _ one of
the 11 languages he knows. For, like his father, Piotrovsky is
first and foremost a scholar and intellectual, and was yanked from
the groves of academe to this austere post, far from the biblical
cities of the Middle East that are his academic specialty.
	   His father had reluctantly turned his back on a lifetime of
archeological fieldwork when he was tapped to lead the museum where
he had spent happy hours roaming as a boy, and which he had
defended from Nazi invaders in World War II.
	   Boris Piotrovsky headed the Hermitage from 1964 until his death
in 1990. His deputy succeeded him, and soon sought a deputy of his
own. He chose Mikhail Piotrovsky. In 1992, the younger Piotrovsky
became director.
	   It is easy to understand the lure that brought the Piotrovskys
to their jobs.
	   The Hermitage is a museum that invites a lifetime of
exploration. It has a collection of nearly 3 million items in the
Romanov's Winter Palace and surrounding Hermitage buildings that
date from the 18th and 19th centuries.
	   Within its vast maze of galleries hang perhaps the world's
finest collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist
paintings; more Rembrandts than any museum but the Rijksmuseum in
Amsterdam; outstanding collections of Greek, Egyptian, Dutch,
Italian and French art. It has breathtaking tapestries, priceless
furniture and a fleet of gilded carriages.
	   And remarkably, it is more than the sum of its parts, for the
very buildings are works of art _ and of history. Here, Catherine
the Great entertained the cream of European society in splendidly
ostentatious rooms. Here, the young Nicholas II married Princess
Alexandra, the granddaughter of Britain's Queen Victoria.
	   And here, on the evening of Nov. 7, 1917, Bolshevik
revolutionaries stormed the Winter Palace, looting many of its
treasures and establishing the world's first socialist government _
what would eventually become the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics.
	   Parts of the Hermitage had been opened as a museum under the
czars. The Bolsheviks might have been expected to raze the place _
and considered doing something even more banal.
	   In her new book ``The Hermitage: The Biography of a Great
Museum,'' the British writer Geraldine Norman recounts how, in
November 1918, the Communist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky organized a
conference to decide what to do with the palace complex.
	   His suggestion: Turn it into a macaroni factory. ``We do not
need a dead mausoleum of art where dead works are worshipped,'' he
said.
	   Miraculously, the Soviet Union not only failed to destroy the
Hermitage, it opened almost all of it to the public and built it
into the museum it is today. True, the Soviets sold off some of its
most valuable art at fire sale prices. But their overall record was
a remarkably good one.
	   That may help explain how both Piotrovskys maintained their
communist loyalties to the end. In fact, according to Norman,
Mikhail Piotrovsky still considers himself a socialist _ albeit one
who recognizes the realities of the modern market economy.
	   Under Piotrovsky, the Hermitage has struck sponsorship deals
with the likes of IBM and Coca-Cola; it has courted such Western
allies as the Dutch government and UNESCO; it has become a
hard-nosed bargainer with international museums that want to borrow
chunks of its collection.

	   ``My father had to fight to get his own decisions on many things
_ oh, not exactly fight, but to find ways. We have much more
freedom to make our own decisions,'' Piotrovsky said. But, he
added, ``The freedom ... is a kind of a problem _ we have to adjust
to this kind of responsibility, and we have to pay for the freedom.
One of the penalties is financial problems.''
	   Even now, the Hermitage depends on the government for two-thirds
of its funds. That poses its central problem, because the Russian
government is anything but dependable these days. Last year,
Piotrovsky said, the Hermitage received only 40 percent of its
federal funding.
	   Given that, the museum does a remarkable job of maintaining its
buildings and collection.
	   ``There are no major works of art in any danger,'' said
Catherine Phillips, a British art historian who has worked for the
Hermitage on a contract basis for the past eight years. And with
some notable exceptions, she said, the buildings ``are in excellent
condition.''
	   Now, Piotrovsky has his eye on an ambitious expansion plan.
Already, a controversial warehouse and display building is nearing
completion on the outskirts of St. Petersburg, and plans call for
the Hermitage to take over two more major buildings near the museum
itself.
	   That will allow the museum to put more of its collection on
display, and also give its staff a better environment for carrying
out research and restoration work.
	   It will, of course, require more money.
	   In his father's time, Piotrovsky said, ``the financial problems
were quite less, and it was quite clear that there was only one way
to get the money _ from the government. You had to push and press,
(but) in general there was always money for maintenance of the
museum. Nowadays, it's very difficult and complicated because of
the economic situation of the country.''
	   He remains confident nonetheless. ``We are working hard,'' he
said. Then he cut the interview short. A group of IBM executives
was waiting. Even dynasties have to find ways to make money in
Russia these days.

	   EAST HAMPTON, New York (AP) _ Standing three deep at the bar of
the hottest restaurant in town, patrons crowd around Steven Gaines,
who tries between handshakes and swats on the back to eat roast
chicken and garlic potatoes.
	   Nick and Toni's is the restaurant to the stars in Long Island's
East End, the place where Steven Spielberg and Robert De Niro eat
when they are in the Hamptons, a string of beach communities and
villages.
	   But tonight, the man of the hour is Gaines.
	   Who?
	   The man who wrote ``The Book,'' as it has come to be known.
	   The Book is ``Philistines at the Hedgerow: Passion and Property
in the Hamptons,'' a work that exposes the weird and the downright
strange who live and play here.
	   ``Have you read the book?'' people ask at parties, restaurants,
grocery stores or beaches. ``You HAVE to read it.''
	   Gaines' book is doing for the Hamptons what John Berendt's
hugely popular ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' did for
Savannah, Georgia. That book, about the murder trials of a gay
antiques dealer and the eccentricities of the genteel, put Savannah
on the map for average Joes wanting to know more about the rich and
infamous.
	   ``It's fun to talk about. Everybody wants to know those
things,'' says Rona Jaffe, best-selling author of ``Five Women''
and a Hamptons homeowner. ``If they say they don't, then they
aren't being truthful.''
	   Gaines, whose book is at No. 15 on The New York Times
best-seller list, reveals the Hamptons' hermetic society of old and
new money through real estate dealings _ who can and cannot afford
the millions for beach property.
	   The Hamptons, always chic, were once a summer playground for old
money _ the Fords, Bouviers, Vanderbilts and Hearsts. Now it's a
vacation hot spot for new millionaires created by corporate America
and the entertainment industry, and struggling wanna-bes who live
far beyond their means.
	   ``It's always been about my house is bigger than yours syndrome,
or my car is better that yours,'' Gaines says.
	   For locals, a mention in the book has become a status symbol of
sorts.
	   ``The first thing everybody does is look in the index to see if
they're in the book,'' says gallery owner Ruth Vered, who admits to
looking for her own name. She wasn't there.
	   ``A part of me was happy and the other part was upset. I'll
admit it. I wanted to be in the book,'' she says.
	   Gaines dedicates an entire chapter to advertising executive
Jerry Della Femina, detailing his many legal battles, including his
arrest for putting up a pumpkin display in front of his upscale
grocery store.
	   ``The pumpkin prosecution,'' as it came to be known, pitted
new-money outsiders like Della Femina against those who got there
earlier and wanted little to change. It was eventually settled out
of court.
	   Della Femina gave a recent book party at his oceanfront home in
honor of Gaines. Although many of the big names mentioned in the
book were invited, few showed.
	   That could be because Gaines publicly aired:
	   _The eccentricities of two reclusive sisters who lived with a
pride of indoor cats, but no litter boxes.
	   _How Spielberg bought up his estate bit by bit, trying to
protect his view from developers.
	   _All-out territorial wars, including how Martha Stewart
allegedly tried to run over her neighbor in a property-line
dispute.
	   At another recent Della Femina party, Gaines and the host stood
side by side greeting guests. It was a literacy fund-raiser, but it
was Gaines who got most of the attention. Even gossip columnist Liz
Smith got in on the action, shaking hands and trading barbs with
Gaines.
	   After minor success writing unauthorized biographies about rock
stars Alice Cooper and the Beach Boys, Gaines, 49, says he was
ready to quit after his controversial book on Calvin Klein (a
fellow Hamptonite) was pulled from publication.
	   ``It was almost like I was a pariah. I didn't go anywhere and I
didn't do much of anything,'' he says. Then his agent called,
pushing him to write about what he knew _ the Hamptons.
	   Inspired by Berendt's success, Gaines imitated much of
``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' _ even his book's cover
photo of statues resembles the cover of the Berendt book, which
showed a statue of a girl.
	   ``I thought, `If this doesn't work, I'm going to get out,'''
Gaines says.
	   But it did work. Now he's fielding movie and TV offers.
	   ``He has as much a right as anyone to enjoy his success,'' says
Dan Rattiner, editor of Dan's Papers, a weekly newspaper that
chronicles Hamptons happenings.
	   A few locals say Gaines just parroted rumors and lore. But he
shrugs it off. ``I'm always going to have critics,'' he says.
	   Driving around town in a gray 9-year-old Chrysler LeBaron
convertible, Gaines points out houses and landmarks. ``Not since
the days of the Pharaohs have people built such shrines to
themselves,'' he says.
	   On Main Street, droves of weekenders toting overnight bags lined
up to catch the jitney back to New York City.
	   ``It's like a cattle roundup,'' Gaines said. ``They all get on
the bus, go home and then do it all again next weekend.''

Protestant party agrees to meeting IRA ally, two police hurt by

bomb &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The main Protestant party has
agreed to a meeting between its leader and Gerry Adams, president
of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, paving the way for an encounter
of symbolic significance and a new stage in the peace process.
	   But underlining the fragility of this process were two incidents
of violence on Saturday.
	   In the first, pro-British loyalists threw explosives at police
and injured two officers during a night of violence between
pro-British loyalists and anti-British republicans in the
Protestant majority town of Portadown.
	   In the second incident, police were attacked with gasoline bombs
after separating opposing factions before a loyalist parade. At one
point some 700 people were involved. One Catholic-owned store was
burned down by arsonists and a second was damaged by arsonists.
	   As U.S. President Bill Clinton wound up a tour of both parts of
Ireland on Saturday, the 110-member executive committee of the
Ulster Unionist Party indicated its support for leader David
Trimble's meeting with Adams.
	   No vote was taken, but executive committee member Dermott
Nesbitt said the meeting was part of the ``natural progress'' in
the peace process. He said there were no dissenting voices in the
executive.
	   But hours later, five members of the party executive _ including
four of its 10 members of Parliament _ indicated no endorsement had
been sought or given for the meeting.
	   Trimble, who is First Minister in Northern Ireland's new
assembly, sat in the same room as Adams during negotiations which
led to the deal this year, but refused to speak to him.
	   Trimble has already invited Adams and all the other party
leaders in the assembly to a meeting on Monday. The face-to-face
meeting alone with Adams is expected later next week.
	   Earlier, the terrorist car bombing of Omagh, already the most
deadly atrocity in the 30-year history of Northern Ireland's
conflict, claimed a 29th life.
	   Sean McGrath, 61, retired owner of a bakery business, died in
Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital 21 days after IRA dissidents
detonated their bomb amid workers, shoppers and Spanish tourists in
the religiously mixed town of Omagh.
	   ``This just highlights the fact that the suffering in far from
over,'' said William Thompson, an Ulster Unionist lawmaker in
Omagh.
	   ``The visits of famous people have come and gone. The people
will now be trying to get back to normality and that will probably
be the most difficult time of all,'' added Thompson.
	   On Thursday, Clinton and his wife, Hillary, paid respects to the
dead and wounded in a visit to the bomb-shattered center of Omagh.

NEW YORK: Chaucer's world.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Chaucer may have shuffled among several versions of the Tales in
his final 15 years. In that way, he shared more with Homer and the
ancient oral tradition when stories were embellished as they were
repeated.
	   ``I am not satisfied that they have figured out all the
questions in the Canterbury Tales, or that it's even necessary,''
says Larry Scanlon of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New
Jersey, editor of the literary journal for the New Chaucer Society.
	   ``The textual variance makes it richer,'' he says. ``We can
appreciate the importance of Chaucer without trying to determine
exactly which manuscripts are closest to him. The author himself
may have been of two minds.''
	   Chaucer is regarded as the first master of English poetry and a
keen chronicler of medieval life.
	   ``The Canterbury Tales'' is a collection of stories as told by
29 pilgrims, ranging from a noble knight to a humble plowman, and
even Chaucer himself _ deliberately cast as a dolt.
	   Some of his ribald characters behave so amorally and foolishly
that today they could be guests on ``The Jerry Springer Show.''
	   Perhaps no one more than Alison, the Wife of Bath.
	   She brags of dominating husbands One through Four and inheriting
their wealth. She defers to hubby No. 5, though her motives are
murky.
	   But her tale changes noticeably, depending on the manuscript and
the sensibilities of each scribe. Some copies differ by as many as
26 lines. Others freely substitute words and spellings. In the
Ellesmere edition, now preserved at the Huntington Library in
suburban Los Angeles, the Wife of Bath is portrayed as a ``monster
of carnality.''
	   She challenges the church by declaring that sex can be pursued
for pleasure as well as procreation. To satisfy ``myn appetit,''
she proudly describes adulterous liaisons with men of all races,
statures and classes.
	   Yet in the Hengwrt manuscript archived in Wales, she confines
herself to a series of legal unions.
	   ``Depending on which manuscript you read, you may meet a very
different Wife of Bath,'' project director Robinson says.
``Hengwrt's Wife is still outrageous, but with hankerings of
respectability.''
	   So far, researchers have used the project's programs to analyze
the Wife of Bath's Prologue in 58 manuscripts, plus Chaucer's
draft.
	   Their study divides the manuscripts into six groups representing
branches of a modified ``family tree'' of the Canterbury Tales. The
sixth group of 14 manuscripts is labeled O. Scholars had previously
considered these editions to be mongrels because they could not be
traced by traditional methods to specific parent texts.
	   But the computer analyses reveal that some O manuscripts share
verse, spellings and other characteristics with manuscripts in
different groups. A verse in O linked to two manuscripts in two
other groups has more branches in the family tree, and may be twice
as authoritative as a verse in 20 manuscripts in a single group
that share a single ancestor text.
	   Biochemist Christopher J. Howe of Cambridge University says the
O manuscripts contain ``crucial evidence'' suggesting they descend
from Chaucer's original.
	   Differences among manuscripts also can be reduced to individual
words, or even letters or fragments of calligraphy. The word
``experience'' appears in at least 42 of the manuscripts, spelled
several ways. In at least 14, the word ``experiment'' appears in
place of experience _ with as many as nine spellings, including
``experyment'' and ``expiment.''
	   This isn't the first time that scholars have tackled this
jumble.
	   In the mid-19th century, German scholar Karl Lachman tried a
manual analysis of the Tales. But the ``Lachman method'' was
condemned for making sweeping generalizations based on few
comparisons.
	   Contemporary authors are candidates for high-tech analysis as
well.
	   In the 1980s, textual scholar Hans Gabler used a computer to
help assemble a ``corrected'' version of James Joyce's ``Ulysses''
on paper. Like Chaucer, Joyce constantly revised his difficult
prose, and publishers inadvertently peppered his manuscript with
mistakes.
	   Gabler was roundly criticized in years past for being too
aggressive in his corrections. But Robinson isn't worried. The
Tales project differs not only in number of manuscripts and
sophistication of computer programs, but also in purpose: It's not
trying to eliminate ``wrong'' editions.
	   And Robinson believes the computer can be just as important to
literary research as it is to laboratory research. So he is
consulting with Gabler to refine the electronic edition of
``Ulysses'' too.
	   The authors may have lived 600 years apart, Robinson explains,
but the projects share the same mission: Computers can help readers
tackle these multi-layered, disputed texts and trace how
manuscripts change over time.
	   ``The Tales is both finished and unfinished depending upon which
section you happen to be reading,'' he says. ``I think that we have
achieved already a much clearer sense of what Chaucer left behind
at his death.''

	   HAZLETON, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Few ever venture to fly into this
old coal town on the tip of Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. But
those who do have seen it _ those two gigantic, godlike hands
reaching toward them from the runway.
	   Ah, the Monstrous Hands of Hazleton.
	   With fingers the length of limousines and massive palms that
could cradle a football team, these 160-foot-long (48-meter) hands
could be the stuff of legend, like Mount Rushmore and the Eiffel
Tower _ except, as one very frustrated artist is discovering,
nobody seems to care.
	   Salvadore de Fazio created the Hands as the centerpiece of what
could be the world's largest painting. His massive ``A Celebration
of Life'' covers 2.5 acres (one acre) of scrub grass between the
two runways of Hazleton Municipal Airport. It depicts a kind of
``Age of Aquarius'' scene _ one giant hand lifting several human
figures toward the sun, while two dolphins and a whale leap at a
rainbow in the other.
	   ``It's a message against suicide,'' said de Fazio, owner of an
``all-natural health care'' business. ``This was a way I could
bring natural healing back into art. And it was a way to take art
out of the museums and give it back to the people.''
	   It was also, he hoped, a way to paint his way to fame, fortune
and an entry in the Guinness Book of Records. So in June, he
gathered about dlrs 5,000 worth of donated paint, generators and
surveying equipment, and got down to the messy business of painting
the lonesome field.
	   The not-so-starving, media-hungry artist spent more than 100
hours laying out his design and coloring it with biodegradable
latex paint. Once done, he recruited family and friends to
distribute press releases announcing his record-breaking feat. He
readied himself to field phone calls from media around the world.
	   But the phone has barely rung, and de Fazio is finding out how
tough it is to make a splash in the world from the hinterlands of
Pennsylvania _ even with 500 gallons (1,890 liters) of bright
rainbow-colored paint.
	   Today, the 48-year-old stands in the middle of the field,
scratching his graying hair, readjusting his glasses, and watching
the paint and his hopes of fame fade away as the world fails to
recognize his achievement. The Guinness people have yet to arrive,
despite his invitations. Tourists and art lovers have been few.
	   ``I thought this would have spun more interest being the world's
largest painting,'' he said. ``I feel like I failed.''
	   A representative of the Guinness Book of World Records said a
category for massive field paintings was recently created, but the
archivists of the world's achievements, who are based in Middlesex,
England, don't seem in any hurry to check out de Fazio's work.
	   ``We're still awaiting more documentation to consider de Fazio
as the initial record holder,'' Guinness spokeswoman Vanessa Law
said.
	   Until then, de Fazio is just another local eccentric.
	   With August's sizzling sun coming to an end and autumn's frost
just a few weeks away, dead and frostbitten grass will soon lose
all trace of his massive masterpiece.
	   ``The weeds are starting to grow in now,'' de Fazio said,
walking across a cracked, dry patch of dirt in the middle of his
masterpiece. He looked over at a two-engine plane buzzing by, then
back at his painting. ``And the paint is fading over here.''
	   Few people besides Hazleton's 23,000 residents know of his
sticky, sweaty days on the painting field. One is Ted Gans, a
66-year-old retired pilot who still flies over Hazleton.
	   ``I'd call myself a fan,'' Gans said. ``Everyone around here is
fascinated by his art. I wish more people could see it and
appreciate it. But unfortunately, it'll only be here another month
or so _ max.''
	   This is the fourth time since 1991 that de Fazio has tackled a
large-scale, outdoor painting. Each time, he has expanded his work
an additional 10,000 square feet (900 square meters) in a growing
effort to draw more attention.
	   That has prompted some to criticize him for being too
``gimmicky.'' But de Fazio brushes off the comments.
	   ``Everybody is an art critic these days,'' he said, before
continuing to talk about his future grass-painting plans. He still
has a tinge of hope. ``If something else comes up that warrants a
larger painting, I'll still do it.
	   ``Maybe,'' he adds thoughtfully, ``I'll do something for the
millennium'' _ where the grass could always be greener.

	   ``Tiny Town'' (Pioneer) _ Tiny Town
	   As a lead guitarist, Bernie Leadon provided the tasteful twang
on many of the Eagles' great early songs, including ``Peaceful Easy
Feeling,'' ``Tequila Sunrise'' and ``Lyin' Eyes.'' But Leadon also
was responsible for some of the band's lamest moments, especially
``Journey of the Sorcerer'' and the abysmal ``I Wish You Peace,''
which he supposedly co-wrote with Ronald Reagan's daughter, Patti
Davis.
	   When Leadon left the Eagles, they went on to even greater glory
while he vanished from the pop scene. Now Leadon resurfaces as the
co-producer of Tiny Town, a promising debut effort that is
unfortunately tarnished by, yes, too many lame moments.
	   Tiny Town includes two ex-members of the defunct New Orleans
group the subdudes, singer-guitarist Tommy Malone and bassist
Johnny Ray Allen. They're joined by New Orleans drummer Kenneth
Blevins and Nashville singer-guitarist Pat McLaughlin. All but
Blevins contribute to the songwriting, and the band attempts to
combine rootsy country rock, Sam and Dave-style vocals and Little
Feat funk.
	   Sometimes it works. The simple but beautiful ``New Day''
suggests the band has promise, as does ``Baby Ain't Got No Home,''
which swings thanks to a great guitar groove.
	   Too much else, however, simply sounds soulless. ``Pretty Pink
Flower'' is dumb; ``Little Child'' rhymes ``diapers'' with
``tricycle,'' and ``Follow You Home'' shows that Tiny Town is no
Little Feat.
	   In the plus column, there's not one songwriting credit for Patti
Davis.

	   ``Live at the Old Absinthe House Bar'' (Justin Time) _ Bryan Lee
	   This disc is as much about an irreplaceable club as it is about
an unsung performer recorded in his best live element. There are
better blues performances to be found, but no better finds for
sentimental collectors.
	   Bryan Lee and The Jumpstreet Five were an attraction for 14
years at the Old Absinthe, a must-stop on Bourbon Street where
Jimmy Page, Johnny Winter and Sting had stopped to catch the blind
guitar impresario and to mix with his band. Guests for this show
include the esteemed James Cotton and young guitar sensation Kenny
Wayne Shepherd.
	   The smoky, brick-wall club founded in 1800 has been remodeled as
a tropical tourist bar, an incomprehensible loss to Bourbon Street.
The poignancy of the event does not tighten the loose musical edges
or freshen up the band's lack of originality on this disc. But
Bryan Lee is all heart and does not hold back.

Screenwriting professor: The script's the thing

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It's the stuff dreams are made of: The average
original screenplay fetches upwards of dlrs 250,000 from major
studios.
	   And Richard Walter, a college professor for 21 years, considers
it his mission to help new writers develop that stuff and those
dreams. Part of the challenge is making them understand why Michael
Corleone is like Buzz Lightyear and what Luke Skywalker has in
common with Malcolm X.
	   ``Every movie is about the same thing,'' he declares.
``Identity.''
	   Considered one of the top screenwriting teachers in the country,
Walter has been steadily expanding his student base beyond the
University of California at Los Angeles through lecture tours and
books, including his latest, ``The Whole Picture: Strategies for
Screenwriting Success in the New Hollywood.''
	   Legs together, arms half upraised, the long-haired, bearded
Walter is like a modern Messiah giving the Sermon on the Movie as
he stands before about 40 people who have each paid dlrs 225 for
his two-day spring seminar at the New School in Manhattan.
	   He poses a question: ``If you have absolutely no standards and
all you care about is money, put a lot of sex and violence in
films. Right?''
	   The students sit rapt, but don't respond.
	   ``Wrong,'' Walter says, then rattles off a list of films that
croaked at the box office, including ``Jade'' and ``Showgirls.'' He
isn't shy about dismissing the critically acclaimed, either.
	   ``'L.A. Confidential' was about a bunch of growling white guys.
Talk, talk, talk. Shoot. Talk, talk, talk. Shoot,'' he sneers.
	   But the 53-year-old Queens, New York, native _ a graduate of
that egghead incubator known as Stuyvesant High School _ isn't
averse to sex and violence in films as long as they advance the
story. Many of his former students have liberally peppered their
dramas with those devices, and their success is what drives
Walter's marketing machine.
	   ``Men in Black,'' ``Face/Off,'' ``Speed 2: Cruise Control,''
``Con Air'' and ``Jurassic Park: The Lost World,'' among others,
were all written by screenwriters who had attended Walter's UCLA
class.
	   In an interview, Walter says his combined careers as academic,
script doctor, author and lecturer let him live comfortably with
his wife and two children in the Los Angeles area.
	   In the ``new'' Hollywood, he says, writers are no longer at the
bottom of the film industry's food chain _ precisely the reason he
tells them to embrace art as commerce.
	   ``Sophocles and Shakespeare were hacks,'' he declares. ``If they
were writing today they'd be writing for TV. Drama is pretty much
unchanged since the ancient Greeks. It's just the snobs who think
otherwise.''
	   For example, Walter describes ``The Godfather,'' a box-office
smash and one of the treasures of modern cinema, as a classic Greek
tragedy about the nature of families and how brothers get along.
	   ``The format of writing a screenplay can be learned by a
chimpanzee in three minutes,'' says Walter. ``But what about
stories? What about character?''
	   Walter thinks his ability to draw those elements out of writers
is his greatest strength, especially in a semester-length course.
But not all who take his course agree. One woman who attended the
two-day New School seminar and is familiar with Walter's work
praised his analytic skills but, speaking on condition of
anonymity, complained that his lectures tended to be more anecdotal
than instructive.
	   Mike Werb, a 1987 UCLA graduate who had Walter as a professor,
co-wrote the 1997 movie ``Face/Off'' and 1994's ``The Mask.'' He
praised Walter's teaching style.
	   ``Richard is good at cutting through the mustard,'' Werb says.
``He'll say, 'This is your story.' But he's also big on not letting
you write until you know the theme, or what you want to say through
the characters.''
	   Walter receives hundreds of unsolicited screenplays from writers
requesting critiques. He used to charge dlrs 5,000 per script.
	   ``Now I charge substantially more,'' he says coyly. ``I raised
my fees because I thought it would chase people away. But it
hasn't. I've actually gotten busier.''
	   Like any guru worth his gab, he knows how to make people feel
good. Variety once described him as ``the Jewish mother of
screenwriting,'' a moniker he wears with pride. (``Guilt is good.
Guilt is your friend,'' he tells writers who procrastinate.)
	   When Walter graduated in 1965 from the State University of New
York in Binghamton he was planning a law career. He went on to get
a masters from the Newhouse School of Public Communication.
	   But in 1966, during a visit to California, he enrolled in the
University of Southern California's film school. After three years,
he left without graduating. ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas,
with whom Walter worked on ``American Graffiti,'' was one of his
classmates.
	   By 1977, the year he began teaching at UCLA, Walter was already
a working writer and script doctor in Hollywood.
	   Asked why growing numbers of people are signing up for his
lectures around the country, Walter can't suppress his inner
``mother'' when he explains, ``I create a safe place in my class
where new film artists can feel comfortable. I don't think these
people are foolish to try to write screenplays. I admire their
creative courage.''

Tennis star takes the wheel to get to Open

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Looking for a shortcut from Midtown to the U.S.
Open? Ask Lindsay Davenport, the third-ranked player in the world,
who drives from her hotel to the tournament each day.
	   While most of the players, especially at the top of the fields,
are chauffeured to the National Tennis Center in Queens, Davenport
gets behind the wheel for the daily commute, dodging potholes,
taxis and other components of New York's highway mayhem.
	   In three years, Davenport said Saturday after reaching the
fourth round with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Virginia Ruano Pascual,
she's never even been stuck in a traffic jam.
	   ``You know, so far I've been pretty lucky,'' she said. ``But I
really like being able to drive yourself. You know, you feel like
you're in control and you can just talk amongst yourselves with
your family. Relaxes me, I think.''
	   Davenport comes from the land of freeways, Southern California,
and says New York traffic isn't much better than Interstate 405
back home.
	   ``Especially this weekend, it's great. It only takes 15 minutes
on Labor Day weekend, no traffic,'' she said.
	   And she seems to fit right in with the local driving style that
borders on permanent road rage.
	   ``My coach has a hard time when I drive, a little aggressive,''
she said.
	   For others looking to get here quick, Davenport suggests this
route:
	   ``Normally I take the Triboro Bridge,'' she said. ``But if I
hear there's traffic on the radio, which I listen to, I take the
Midtown Tunnel.''
	   Even this road warrior has her limits, though.
	   ``I'm not driving crosstown,'' Davenport said. ``I'm just
getting on the FDR (the highway that runs up Manhattan's East Side)
and I'm out.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Martinez, Pierce winning, Rusedski losing; will
be UPDATED after Sampras-Tillstrom match &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The world's top tennis players are doing little
work on this Labor Day weekend.
	   Defending U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter needed just 66
minutes and lost only three games in a third-round victory. Andre
Agassi advanced while losing just five games. Venus Williams needed
to play only half a match.
	   ``You never feel badly about winning. You want to get on and off
as quick as you possibly can,'' Rafter said after his 6-1, 6-1, 6-1
victory over David Nainkin. ``This is a Grand Slam. You want to
conserve your energy.''
	   Only two seeded women and four seeded men have been eliminated.
	   The third-seeded Rafter, who lost just six points on his first
serve and never faced a break point, will face No. 14 Goran
Ivanisevic in the fourth round.
	   Ivanisevic had 21 aces in a 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-4 win over Paul
Haarhuis, a player who had tormented him in the past. The
temperamental Ivanisevic said he has been playing better since
banging his head on the court during a second-round win over Todd
Martin earlier this week.
	   ``Sometimes I am a little bit messed up,'' he explained. ``I
have to bang, then everything comes together.''
	   Agassi won 6-2, 6-3, 6-0 in 96 minutes over Davide Sanguinetti,
who twisted his right ankle late in the first set and played the
rest of the match with the ankle heavily taped. Agassi's next
opponent will be No. 9 Karol Kucera.
	   Williams' match lasted just 13 minutes. She was leading 5-0 in
the first set when Larisa Neiland retired because of a painful
lower back injury that prevented her from sitting on the final
changeover.
	   Neiland was unable to move more than a few feet from the middle
of the court, watching helplessly when Williams hit shots into the
corners. Neiland's face was contorted with pain as she held onto
the umpire's chair for support after five games and told Williams
she could not continue.
	   ``I really would have enjoyed to have a match where she could
have played to her full ability,'' Williams said. ``I can get the
preparation on the practice court.''
	   Agassi, who played third on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court after
Rafter and Williams, was shocked to start playing so early in the
afternoon.
	   ``Both matches combined were like an hour and 15 minutes,
phenomenal,'' Agassi said. ``I felt rather rushed, I didn't enjoy
that at all.''
	   Other men advancing to the fourth round were No. 12 Jonas
Bjorkman and Marat Safin, the Russian teen-ager who became a crowd
favorite with his improbable run through this year's French Open.
	   Safin's next opponent probably will be four-time champion Pete
Sampras, who faced Mikael Tillstrom in a third-round match Saturday
night.
	   But No. 6 Greg Rusedski was upset 4-6, 6-4, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 by Jan
Siemerink in a match that lasted 3 hours, 22 minutes.
	   Women's winners included No. 2 Lindsay Davenport, No. 4 Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, No. 7 Conchita Martinez, No. 10 Nathalie Tauziat,
No. 12 Mary Pierce, No. 13 Amanda Coetzer and No. 15 Anna
Kournikova.
	   Fourteen of the 16 women's seeds reached the fourth round, the
first time that has happened since 1987. And the ease with which
favorites are advancing is in stark contrast to this year's French
Open and Wimbledon, in which there were many surprises.
	   ``It's been weird because the other Grand Slams, there's been a
lot of upsets, a lot of seeds that haven't made it,'' Davenport
said. ``I don't know what the reason is, but it just seems like the
players who are expected to win so far are winning.''
	   One of the few players spending much time on court was No. 10
Carlos Moya, who needed 3 hours, 49 minutes to rally from a two-set
deficit for the first time in his career in a 3-6, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5),
6-4, 6-3 win over Michael Chang that began Friday night and lasted
until 1:33 a.m. Saturday.

Blind pianist wins Taiwan's competition

 &UR; By LEE CHUAN-HSIEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan (AP) _ The winner of Taiwan's youth piano
competition thinks he understands Beethoven pretty well.
	   Hsieh Yun-lun was born blind.
	   He feels it gives him a clue to the turmoil Beethoven felt _ and
expressed in his music _ as the composer lost his hearing. In order
to win this year's national youth piano contest, however, Yun-lun
chose the more measured tones of Bach's Italian Concerto.
	   The choice was fitting for a calm and happy boy living with his
family in a cramped middle-class apartment in this southern
Taiwanese city. He said he thinks of himself as a normal
12-year-old _ whose sense of sound just happens to be sharp enough
to learn piano by listening to tapes, and to win the occasional
video game from his brother.
	   He wishes others would regard him as a normal kid, too.
	   Taiwan has found that a bit hard to do.
	   Business support for musicians _ even the best professionals _
is rare here, and the system of care for the handicapped lags
behind the island's economic development. But Yun-lun caused a
sensation when he won the annual piano competition for 8-12
year-olds.
	   Smiling, Yun-lun said he considers himself fortunate because he
didn't go through the trauma of losing his eyesight.
	   Surgery when he was 4 months old failed to cure a retina
problem. His parents still hope that medical advances may one day
give him his sight.
	   He's grateful to his parents, who started paying for piano
lessons when he was 5 years old because of the interest he showed
in his brother's lessons.
	   ``Beethoven lost his hearing after he was 30, and his music is
so fretful,'' Yun-lun said. ``I didn't go through the unhappy
moments of losing my eyesight. So far, I feel I'm no different than
others.''
	   Therefore, he said, he prefers Bach's music, which he said is
``not too tempestuous and not too romantic _ just about right.''
	   Twice a week, Yun-lun's parents take turns making the 15-minute
drive on a motorbike to his piano teacher's home, where the boy
tapes his lesson. During the week, he listens to it repeatedly and
memorizes it. He spends eight hours a day listening and playing the
piano. In between, Yun-lun is taking lessons in composition and
violin.
	   Juanelva Rose, an American piano professor who has given the boy
lessons, said Yun-lun hasn't reached the top level yet for his age.
However, there is room yet for improvement because he has a good
musical sense, she said.
	   Besides music, Yun-lun is learning to deal with daily life.
	   He does dishes and sweeps the floor in the flat, where the many
trophies he won from music contests are scattered over TV and CD
racks.
	   He learns the shapes of articles by touching them and recreating
them with clay. He likes math and science. Relying on his sharp
ears, he even plays basketball and video games with his brother.
	   Because his parents want him to grow up just like any other boy,
he will enter a regular junior high school this fall.
	   Yun-lun said he has been upset in the past by people picking on
him in parks or at school because of his handicap.
	   ``I tried to let them know I am no different from them, and
slowly they accepted me,'' he said.
	   His mother, Hsiao Fu-ying, an elementary school teacher, said
Yun-lun will be sent abroad to study music when he gets a little
older and can better take care of himself.
	   ``We won't expect him to become a top musician,'' she said. ``We
just want to guide him out of his small world with music.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As a kid, A.J. Croce learned Chuck Berry's
guitar licks on the piano. He considered it rock 'n' roll.
	   He'd tried playing guitar, trumpet and drums _ with fairly
unmusical results. Then he tried the piano. Now, when he tours,
it's with a 7-foot (2 meters) Steinway grand piano.
	   Croce, 26, is the son of the late Jim Croce, whose early 1970s
hits included ``You Don't Mess Around With Jim,'' ``Time in a
Bottle,'' ``Bad, Bad Leroy Brown,'' ``I Got a Name'' and ``I'll
Have to Say I Love You in a Song.''
	   Although Croce's full name is Adrian James Croce, he's been
called A.J. since he was in the first grade. He was 2 when his
father was killed in a plane crash in Louisiana in 1973.
	   He doesn't remember his father and he's never performed his
songs. Croce can only guess what impact his father's career has had
on him. ``I think maybe there's a naivete in thinking that anyone
can do it, if your parents do it. I think there's less fear
involved.''
	   When he was 12, Frank Sinatra invited him to a concert in Los
Angeles. Sinatra was performing ``Bad, Bad Leroy Brown.'' Says
Croce: ``I think that would have been a highlight of my father's
life. An Italian-American having Frank Sinatra record and sing one
of his songs is about as good as it gets.''
	   ``Fit to Serve'' (Ruf Records) is Croce's new bluesy CD. Stating
that blues is a basis for jazz and popular music, he says: ``I
suppose there's a lot of blues influence in the record. I don't
think there's any way not to include that, as a piano player. I
never thought of myself as a blues musician, though.''
	   When Croce started playing rock 'n' roll, he became interested
in its origins _ which started him on a study of piano styles back
to the turn of the century. ``The evolution of piano really stalled
out in the late 1950s when the guitar took over as the melodic
lead,'' he says. But that didn't put him off playing piano.
	   Croce is also a singer and composer.
	   ``I was making stuff up from the time I was a little kid. I
don't think I got any confidence until I was 17 or 18. I went to
Nashville for the first time then, looking for a record deal. I
hooked up with songwriters and started writing with them. I love
writing in different styles.
	   ``I've gone to Nashville at least once a year since then. I like
the fact when you go in to write with someone in Nashville, you're
going to get a song. That can't be guaranteed when I sit down at
home,'' Croce says.
	   He's played a couple of shows with Willie Nelson, and he's
written a song for him. ``I don't record country, but I love
country music and love writing it.'' He put ``Texas Ruby,'' a song
he co-wrote in Nashville, on his new album. ``It's a real story
song. It's fun to perform.''
	   Croce was hired for his first job in music when he was 12.
	   ``Some people paid me to come and sing at a bat mitzvah for the
sister of a girl I went to school with. I did a couple of my songs
and a Ray Charles song and a Little Richard song. It gave me the
confidence I needed to really practice and continue to do it.''
	   He played music five or six nights a week in high school until
he dropped out. He later took a test and entered the University of
California at San Diego. Then B.B. King heard him play in New York
and asked him to be his opening act. ``Three months later, I was
opening for him in Seattle and Vancouver,'' Croce says. ``It was
great. At that point I decided this is what I was going to do.''
	   Croce is married and the father of two young children. He lives
in San Diego. He enjoys performing but dislikes being away from his
family. He has taught seminars about the history of American music,
especially piano music. He'd like to write film scores.
	   Croce often composes on the guitar because he doesn't play it as
well as the piano. ``It forces me to simplify. It is rare that
complicated songs work.
	   ``But I like the idea of keeping at it until I write a 2 1-2 -
or 3-minute song. Mark Twain said he was writing a long letter to a
friend because he didn't have time to write a short one.''

Defending champion Aoki leads Emerald Coast Classic

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILTON, Florida, (AP) _ Defending champion Isao Aoki shot a
4-under-par 66 on Saturday to take a two-stroke lead over Leonard
Thompson after the second round of the Emerald Coast Classic.
	   The Japanese star was almost as hot as the 90-degree
(30-centigrade) weather, but not nearly as blazing as last year
when he shot a Senior PGA Tour record 10-under 60, also in the
second round at The Moors Golf Club.
	   ``Last year was last year; this year is this year,'' said Aoki,
who has found the smooth, fast greens ideal for his crisp putting
style.
	   He opened with 65 en route to a 9-under 131 total.
	   ``He's going deep,'' Hale Irwin said of Aoki's play this year
and last when he also set a record for the tournament at 14-under
196.
	   Aoki had five birdies Saturday and nearly made an eagle on the
par-4, 400-yard (365-meter) 14th. A bogey on the par-3, 196-yard
(179-meter) 16th allowed Thompson to close the gap to two strokes
with a 67.
	   Irwin, a six-time winner this year who tops the money list with
dlrs 2,251,750, shot his second straight 67 to match first-round
leader David Lundstrom at 134. Lundstrom followed his opening 63
with a 71.
	   Jim Colbert, Dana Quigley, Jim Dent and Ed Dougherty were four
back at 135, and Dan Wood, Jerry McGee, Mike McCullough, Walter
Hall, Dale Douglass and Bob Duval followed at 136.
	   Heat and humidity on the treeless course in the Florida
Panhandle took a toll on some of the seniors.
	   ``You kind of go in spurts,'' McGee said. ``You feel good for a
few holes, then you feel tired. Your legs feel tired. You get
blurry vision. That's the time to grab some more water, maybe ride
a hole.''
	   But it didn't seem to bother others.
	   ``To me its no factor. I could play another 18 without thinking
about it,'' Quigley said. ``I like it really, really bad because it
makes everyone else feel crummy about it. ... Let them all fall by
the wayside.''
	   Australia's David Graham, who withdrew on the fifth hole Friday
after experiencing chest pain, was released Saturday from Sacred
Heart Hospital in Pensacola after doctors determined he had not
suffered a heart attack.

New, clearer looks at Hollywood's unique movie math
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Some of Hollywood's greatest special effects
never make it to the screen. They can be found in studio accounting
books.
	   Using the razzle-dazzle of movie math, hits can turn into duds,
flops can be hidden behind blockbusters, contracts are as
convoluted as the plot of ``The X-Files'' and profits _ well, it
depends what you mean by profits.
	   For the uninitiated, unsuspecting or unsophisticated, this can
be more than just frustrating. It can be costly, as columnist Art
Buchwald found out in his very public dispute with Paramount
Pictures, or as investors in Cannon Films and Orion Pictures were
surprised to discover.
	   But there is some hope for the outsider, two opportunities to
peek behind the curtain and get a clearer look at movie accounting
wizardry, thanks to a set of proposed new accounting rules and a
new book about Hollywood math.
	   The two tackle different aspects of Hollywood bookkeeping, but
both speak to the industry's brand of number crunching. It's a
system created over time to deal with this highly speculative
business, full of unknowns and complexities that make accounting
tricky and create plenty of wiggle room for abuse.
	   So much room, in fact, that the panel that sets the rules for
bean counters will on Sept. 18 consider changes for studios that
are designed ``to make the balance sheet tighter, more
representationally faithful,'' said Frank Scheuerell, project
manager for the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
	   The new Hollywood restrictions, which could take effect by the
year 2000, are designed to make it harder to fudge corporate
earnings by giving a less-than-candid account of how a movie is
performing.
	   ``You'll actually know whether a film is a bust a lot faster,''
said Scheuerell. ``If it's a bust now, you can hide it a little
longer.''
	   The changes address the way studios account for the costs of
marketing and publicity, the financial pinch from an abandoned
project and the revenues from syndication rights. Another change
would require studios to disclose for the first time their
estimated costs for directors, actors and actresses _ information
usually only available in stories leaked to the trade papers.
	   How much the rules would affect the studios is debatable.
	   David J. Londoner, a member of the task force that drafted the
changes, estimated the major studios would take a onetime dlrs 1
billion, industry-wide hit to comply. Studios have either disputed
that figure or declined to comment, and other analysts say that
even if the write-offs are big, it won't scare Wall Street
investors.
	   ``Since everyone's going to deal with it at the same time,
across the entire sector, I wouldn't expect it to have much impact,
if there is an impact,'' said David Davis, vice president of
investment bankers Houlihan, Lokey, Howard and Zukin. ``Most of the
major studios are using very conservative methods and the change in
accounting ... won't impact these companies very much at all.''
	   If studios fail to follow the new rules they could face large
fines. Recently, Sony Corp. agreed to pay a dlrs 1 million fine to
settle a complaint by the SEC, which ruled the studio had failed to
warn investors about the mounting losses at Sony before suddenly
announcing a dlrs 2.7 billion write-off in 1994.
	   The Motion Picture Association of America says it has taken no
position on the rule changes.
	   The proposals follow high-profile allegations of accounting
abuses in the 1980s by such studios as Orion and Cannon. Analysts
say the studios took advantage of the current rules to post profits
even though their finances were going south.
	   In Buchwald's case, Paramount Pictures had claimed that ``Coming
to America'' wasn't likely to show a net profit, even though the
Eddie Murphy film had collected dlrs 145 million at the box office
at the time of the dispute.
	   A judge who found the movie was inspired by a 2 1-2 -page
treatment by Buchwald said the studio had used ``unconscionable''
accounting practices to deny the humorist his share of profits and
royalties. Paramount appealed, and both sides settled in 1995, with
Buchwald and his producing partner receiving less than dlrs 1
million.
	   The case was far from the only one. Other legal action has been
taken by the heirs of Jim Garrison, whose book was the basis for
the hit movie ``JFK,'' and director Ron Shelton was awarded dlrs
9.8 million in 1997 in a dispute over profits from the 1992 film
``White Men Can't Jump.''
	   But while Hollywood is often singled out for its unique
accounting, it's not unusual for rule makers to take a fresh look
at practices in particular industries, according to Jack Albert,
associate chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which investigates allegations of accounting abuses at
publicly traded companies.
	   Just because the board is re-examining an area of accounting
doesn't mean ``that there's something sinister or improper,'' he
said. ``It does suggest that there's room for improvement.''
	   No matter what shape the new rules take, it will be of little
use to actors, writers, directors and anybody else who feels ripped
off by the studios in profit-participation deals.
	   As the Buchwald case a decade ago showed, studio executives can
say with a straight face that a blockbuster like ``Coming to
America'' didn't show a net profit, and thus those who feel they
deserve a contractually guaranteed cut of the profits get zip.
	   What many people fail to understand, according to a new book, is
that in movie math, there are profits, and then there are profits,
and that financial terms as most people understand them can mean
something quite different in the confines of a Hollywood contract.

LOS ANGELES: Hollywood contract.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ``It's not accounting at all. It's legal,'' said
attorney/accountant Steven D. Sills, one of the authors of ``Movie
Money: Understanding Hollywood's (Creative) Accounting Practices.''
	   The book provides a sort of financial Gray Line tour through the
jungle of movie number crunching, covering everything from contract
language to negotiating tips. The fact that it takes the authors
almost 300 pages to sketch out the basics should tell you just how
dense that thicket is.
	   Intended for actors, directors and others who aspire to a
profit-participation deal, the book is actually helpful to anyone
who may someday have a story to sell to Hollywood, whether he or
she is the next kid to fall down a well or a particular White House
intern.
	   As the book makes clear, the issue isn't whether you're going to
get a sweet profit-participation deal; you're not, unless you're a
power player like Tom Cruise or Arnold Schwarzenegger. The issue is
whether you can negotiate from the strongest possible position for
the amount of clout you possess.
	   ``Hollywood has a culture and a mindset that is somewhat
independent _ and always has been,'' said co-author Bill Daniels,
an attorney and former reporter for Daily Variety. ``Hollywood has
set up this arcane way of doing business, and it trips some
people.''

Remember `The Apostle': Filmmakers hope for a break at Toronto

festival &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Toronto Film Festival opens Thursday and runs to Sept. 19 &QL; 
 &UR; By HILLEL ITALIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Words to live by for all the deal seekers at
this year's Toronto International Film Festival: Remember ``The
Apostle.''
	   Robert Duvall, the film's producer, director, writer and star,
arrived at the 1997 festival without a distributor for the United
States. He left holding a contract with October Films, went on to
receive critical acclaim and ended up with an Academy Award
nomination for best actor.
	   ``Duvall came here and made a big deal of the fact he had
invested dlrs 5 million of his own,'' said Festival Director Piers
Handling. ``He came to Toronto to sell it and he did. That
obviously makes people take notice.''
	   More than 300 films, from 53 countries, will be screened at the
10-day festival, which runs Sept. 10-19. And dozens don't have U.S.
distributors, including ``At Sachem Farm,'' starring Minnie Driver
and Nigel Hawthorne; ``Another Day in Paradise,'' the latest
feature by ``Kids'' director Larry Clark; and ``Judas Kiss,''
starring Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman.
	   ``It's a great forum because all the buyers are at the same
place at one time,'' said Dan Grodnik, co-founder of Itasca
Pictures, which produced ``At Sachem Farm.''
	   ``When you're a major studio picture, you have a marketing
machine behind you. But when you're an independent feature, film
festivals like Toronto are the best places to turn on the engine.
That's where you're going to get all the publicity.''
	   Started in 1976 with little attention from the media or the
industry, the Toronto festival is now one of the biggest in the
world. Tom Cruise, Meryl Streep, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman
and many other celebrities are expected to attend, and more than
100 films will have their world and/or North American premieres.
	   Because Toronto is a public festival, industry executives say it
gives them a chance to see how a film plays before a general
audience. Many movies that failed to attract interest from private
screenings have picked up distributors thanks to the response in
Toronto.
	   ``Most of the times we go to see films, we see them in the
context of other distributors,'' said Amir Malin, president of
Artisan Entertainment, which has three movies at Toronto this year.
	   ```Back in the '80s, (the Coen brothers') `Blood Simple' was
screened for all the American distributors several months before it
was screened in Toronto and everybody passed on it _ not once, but
several times. It was really when it was screened at Toronto, with
great acclaim, that it was picked up for distribution. The same
thing happened last year with (David Mamet's) `The Spanish
Prisoner.'''
	   Besides helping films find distributors, the festival has become
essential for promoting upcoming art-house releases. Among those at
Toronto this year are John Waters' ``Pecker,'' John Boorman's ``The
General'' and Roberto Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful.''
	   ``It's a great place for us to launch our fall films,'' said
Cynthia Swartz, senior vice president for special projects for
Miramax Films, which has ``Life Is Beautiful'' and seven other
films at this year's festival. ```The Crying Game' played great in
Toronto and some of the Woody Allen films have done really well up
there, like `Bullets Over Broadway'.''
	   Other art-house directors with films at Toronto include James
Ivory (``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries''), Ken Loach (``My Name
Is Joe''), Hal Hartley (``The Book of Life'') and Todd Solondz
(``Happiness''). Separate programs will be devoted to
documentaries, Japanese films, African films, midnight movies and
first-time directors.
	   As it has for years, the festival will open with a Canadian
production. ``The Red Violin'' stars Samuel L. Jackson and Greta
Scacchi and was directed by Canada's Francois Girard, who made the
acclaimed ``Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould.'' The closing
presentation will be the computer-animated feature ``Antz'' from
DreamWorks. It features the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone,
Hackman and Stallone.
	   ``The closing film is a chance to kick back, relax and have
fun,'' Handling said. ``And, you're hoping to attract as many stars
as you can.''

Iran's prized art collection coming out of cellar

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Like buried treasure, scores of original
works by Picasso, Gauguin, Renoir and other Western masters have
lain hidden in the vaults of a museum in Iran for nearly 20 years.
	   But for the first time since the 1979 Iranian revolution, the
rich collection that reads like a who's who of Western art is
expected to go on display early next year.
	   The paintings and sculptures were ordered collected for the
state by the Iranian monarch Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his
wife Farah Diba during the oil boom of the 1970s.
	   But when the shah was overthrown by the revolution, most pieces
at the purpose-built Museum of Contemporary Arts were locked away
by the new government, which thumbed its nose at all things
Western.
	   The collection has remained in the museum's vaults, while the
galleries above are filled with kitsch revolutionary art and
Islamic pieces.
	   Only works by Iranian masters and a half-dozen lithographs by
Picasso, Chagall and Miro are displayed from the old collection.
The exhibits draw few visitors, even on weekends.
	   But the May 1997 election of a new Iranian president has brought
sweeping political changes, affecting attitudes about nearly
everything _ including art.
	   A former minister of culture, President Mohammad Khatami has
rescued Iran's art scene from years of isolation, even encouraging
cultural exchanges with the United States, considered Iran's
arch-enemy by hard-line revolutionaries.
	   At the Museum of Contemporary Arts, a new curator is busy
readying galleries where works by the likes of Kandinsky, Monet,
Pissarro, Braque, Toulouse-Lautrec, Pollock and pop art icon Andy
Warhol will be shown.
	   ``New facilities currently being built to display our treasury
of Western art should be ready by the end of this year, and so by
early 1999 the galleries should be open to the public,'' said
Alireza Sami-Azar, the curator.
	   He said that some works are even being loaned abroad. A Gauguin
was recently sent for an exhibition in Switzerland of the French
master's works.
	   Despite new attitudes, however, some prized possessions will
remain locked up. Displaying nudes or semi-nudes would run into
laws requiring women to be draped from head to foot whenever they
venture outdoors.
	   Even a bronze statue of a woman watering crops at the museum's
main entrance has not escaped the Islamic rules. She now wears a
scarf, crudely added in bronze after the revolution.
	   Nearby, Swiss sculptor Max Bill's bronze of a dancing woman was
spared similar zeal, probably because the abstract figure-eight
magically transforms into a graceful dancer only when viewed from a
certain angle.
	   Since the revolution, that sculpture and a few others scattered
around the museum's manicured lawn are the only hint of what's
locked up inside. Few passersby recognize the sculptures as works
by Henry Moore, Alexander Calder and Alberto Giacometti.
	   In the revolution and its tumultuous aftermath, many rare
Iranian antiquities and art works were smuggled out of Iran and
sold to wealthy clients in Europe, the United States and Asia.
	   But the museum's collection remained largely intact, locked up
in a climate-controlled vault.
	   ``If you consider the turmoil of the revolution, and how pieces
in the collection could have been defaced, destroyed or stolen in
that chaos, then locking them up was the best thing that could have
happened,'' said Iranian art lover Shahriar Adl.
	   But Adl, who has made a hobby of recovering stolen Iranian art,
knows that not every item in the collection is still in Iran.
	   Four years ago Adl arranged the exchange of Willem de Kooning's
Woman III, the third canvas in a series of six, for an ancient
Persian manuscript.
	   The de Kooning, later bought by U.S. entertainment executive
David Geffen, was traded for the Shahnameh, or Book of Kings. In
exquisite detail, the work illustrates the accession to the throne
of Shah Tahmasp of Persia in 1524.
	   Iran got most of the manuscript _ acknowledged as one of the
world's great masterpieces _ but Adl said previous owners had
ripped out and sold some pages piecemeal.
	   The Shahnameh was acquired in a trade because no one in
revolutionary Iran could advocate buying a work of art, even a
piece of Iranian history. An arbitrary price of dlrs 20 million was
placed both on the de Kooning and the Shahnameh.
	   ``One reason we exchanged the de Kooning was because it was
badly done and was falling apart,'' said Adl. ``The other was that
the nude couldn't be shown in Iran anyway.''

Serb television airs clear message to Kosovo Albanians
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As pressure mounts over Kosovo
refugees, state television has shown hundreds heading home, aided
by government troops. The scene then switches: Albanian men sit on
the ground, their hands behind their heads.
	   The footage, aired Saturday night by Serbian state television,
sent a clear message to Kosovo's Albanian majority: cooperate with
the government in its fight against the Kosovo Liberation Army or
suffer the consequences.
	   Police said not all of the some 450 men, some of whom looked
barely out of their teens, would be prosecuted. Those who were
``forced'' by KLA ``terrorists'' to take up arms would be released.
	   It appeared part of a campaign by the government to isolate
hardliners within the KLA and encourage others to accept a
negotiated settlement over the province's future.
	   Moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova has agreed to a
U.S.-mediated framework under which he and Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic would negotiate self-rule for the province
within Serbia, the main part of Yugoslavia.
	   The agreement, which falls short of the Albanian demand for
independence, would end the fighting and be reviewed in three to
five years. The KLA's political representative, Adem Demaci, has
expressed doubt about the plan, saying Milosevic ``constantly
lying'' about his willingness to restore self-rule he canceled in
1989.
	   But U.S. and European diplomats hope enough KLA fighters will
ultimately accept the plan if the fighting can be brought to an
end. European Union foreign ministers, meeting in Salzburg,
Austria, are expected to discuss the Kosovo crisis on Sunday.
	   The fighting, which has raged for six months, has driven more
than 265,000 people from their homes. About 50,000 are believed to
be camped in the forests and hills of Kosovo, and concern is
mounting for their safety as winter approaches.
	   On Saturday, the State Department's top human rights official,
John Shattuck, said he was gathering evidence to turn over to the
U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   ``The horrendous killing and shelling of civilians must stop,''
said Shattuck, who is touring the region as part of the U.S.
diplomatic effort to end the violence. ``All ... violations of
international humanitarian law in Kosovo should be fully
investigated and prosecuted.''
	   Milosevic has said returning villagers have nothing to fear, so
long as they are not KLA members. The Serb Media Center reported
more than 5,000 Albanians returned Saturday to villages west of
Pristina.
	   The conflict has also resulted in scores of missing on both
sides. Former Sen. Bob Dole arrived Saturday as head of the
nongovernmental International Commission for Missing Persons to
investigate.
	   Dole told Rugova the American people ``are very supportive of
Kosovo and the efforts for autonomy.'' He also said it is essential
to help refugees return to their homes.
	   ``If they have homes to go back to,'' he said.

A.J. Croce: blues, country and rock 'n' roll
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL;

 &UR; By MARY CAMPBELL &QL; 
 &UR; AP Newsfeatures Writer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As a kid, A.J. Croce learned Chuck Berry's
guitar licks on the piano. He considered it rock 'n' roll.
	   He'd tried playing guitar, trumpet and drums _ with fairly
unmusical results. Then he tried the piano. Now, when he tours,
it's with a 7-foot (2 meters) Steinway grand piano.
	   Croce, 26, is the son of the late Jim Croce, whose early 1970s
hits included ``You Don't Mess Around With Jim,'' ``Time in a
Bottle,'' ``Bad, Bad Leroy Brown,'' ``I Got a Name'' and ``I'll
Have to Say I Love You in a Song.''
	   Although Croce's full name is Adrian James Croce, he's been
called A.J. since he was in the first grade. He was 2 when his
father was killed in a plane crash in Louisiana in 1973.
	   He doesn't remember his father and he's never performed his
songs. Croce can only guess what impact his father's career has had
on him. ``I think maybe there's a naivete in thinking that anyone
can do it, if your parents do it. I think there's less fear
involved.''
	   When he was 12, Frank Sinatra invited him to a concert in Los
Angeles. Sinatra was performing ``Bad, Bad Leroy Brown.'' Says
Croce: ``I think that would have been a highlight of my father's
life. An Italian-American having Frank Sinatra record and sing one
of his songs is about as good as it gets.''
	   ``Fit to Serve'' (Ruf Records) is Croce's new bluesy CD. Stating
that blues is a basis for jazz and popular music, he says: ``I
suppose there's a lot of blues influence in the record. I don't
think there's any way not to include that, as a piano player. I
never thought of myself as a blues musician, though.''
	   When Croce started playing rock 'n' roll, he became interested
in its origins _ which started him on a study of piano styles back
to the turn of the century. ``The evolution of piano really stalled
out in the late 1950s when the guitar took over as the melodic
lead,'' he says. But that didn't put him off playing piano.
	   Croce is also a singer and composer.
	   ``I was making stuff up from the time I was a little kid. I
don't think I got any confidence until I was 17 or 18. I went to
Nashville for the first time then, looking for a record deal. I
hooked up with songwriters and started writing with them. I love
writing in different styles.
	   ``I've gone to Nashville at least once a year since then. I like
the fact when you go in to write with someone in Nashville, you're
going to get a song. That can't be guaranteed when I sit down at
home,'' Croce says.
	   He's played a couple of shows with Willie Nelson, and he's
written a song for him. ``I don't record country, but I love
country music and love writing it.'' He put ``Texas Ruby,'' a song
he co-wrote in Nashville, on his new album. ``It's a real story
song. It's fun to perform.''
	   Croce was hired for his first job in music when he was 12.
	   ``Some people paid me to come and sing at a bat mitzvah for the
sister of a girl I went to school with. I did a couple of my songs
and a Ray Charles song and a Little Richard song. It gave me the
confidence I needed to really practice and continue to do it.''
	   He played music five or six nights a week in high school until
he dropped out. He later took a test and entered the University of
California at San Diego. Then B.B. King heard him play in New York
and asked him to be his opening act. ``Three months later, I was
opening for him in Seattle and Vancouver,'' Croce says. ``It was
great. At that point I decided this is what I was going to do.''
	   Croce is married and the father of two young children. He lives
in San Diego. He enjoys performing but dislikes being away from his
family. He has taught seminars about the history of American music,
especially piano music. He'd like to write film scores.
	   Croce often composes on the guitar because he doesn't play it as
well as the piano. ``It forces me to simplify. It is rare that
complicated songs work.
	   ``But I like the idea of keeping at it until I write a 2 1-2 -
or 3-minute song. Mark Twain said he was writing a long letter to a
friend because he didn't have time to write a short one.''

Japanese and snafus dominate Sydney marathon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Japanese runners completed a clean
sweep of the men's placings and added the women's title in Sunday's
Sydney marathon, but there was major embarrassment for the host
city of the 2000 Olympics.
	   Kenichi Takahashi won the men's title in two hours, 15 minutes
and 51 seconds, followed by compatriots Kutsuhiko Hanada and Honda
Takehura. Yukari Komatsu, 24, was the first woman across the finish
in 2:29:09.
	   The race started an hour late because the Sydney Roads and
Traffic Authority had failed to close two essential roads to
traffic.
	   While the event was not run by the Sydney Olympic organizers
(SOCOG), a leading athletics official said the problems could only
reflect poorly on Sydney's Olympic buildup.
	   The 900 entrants were warmed up and ready for the 0700 start at
North Sydney when police informed organizers of the inadequate road
closures. The race started at 0803 local time.
	   Athletics New South Wales president Ralph Doubell described it
as a major international embarrassment for Sydney.
	   ``Especially when you have about 400 overseas runners, including
the Japanese Olympic Games squad competing,'' said Doubell, who won
the 1968 Olympic 800-meter gold medal.
	   ``When they return home they will be reporting that the marathon
started one hour late. ``The Roads and Traffic Authority charged us
Aust dlrs 50,000 (U.S. dlrs 29,000) to construct road barriers, and
they didn't. I think there will now be negotiation on the price.''
	   Organizers encountered another problem 24 hours earlier when
they had to arrange the provision of about 10,000 bottles of water
because Sydney's tap water was found to contain dangerous bacteria.

Ammaccapane on record pace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) _ Danielle Ammaccapane shot a 5-under-par
67 on Saturday to take a three-stroke lead in the Safeway LPGA Golf
Championship with a tournament-record 12-under 132 total.
	   Ammaccapane broke the 36-hole mark of 135 set by Kris Monaghan
in 1987 and matched by Tina Barrett in 1992. Dottie Pepper set the
tournament record of 14-under 202 in 1996.
	   Emilee Klein, looking for her first LPGA Tour victory since
winning twice in 1996, matched Ammaccapane's 67 for a 135 total.
Barrett, Charlotta Sorenstam, Juli Inkster and Erika Wicoff were
six back at 138.
	   Ammaccapane, who won the Mercury Titleholders in May 3 for her
seventh career title, had five birdies in her second straight
bogey-free round on the Columbia-Edgewater Country Club course.
	   Ammaccapane, coming off a fourth-place tie last week in the
State Farm Rail Classic, birdied four of the first nine holes,
including a 25-foot (7 1/2 meters) putt on the 409-yard (374
meters) ninth hole.
	   Inkster was 1 under after 27 holes before closing with birdies
on five of her last nine holes for a 68. Sorenstam, the younger
sister of Swedish star Annika Sorenstam, birdied No. 13 to reach 8
under, but bogeyed Nos. 14 and 18 for her second straight 69.
	   Wicoff shot a 68, and Barrett had a 69.
	   Donna Andrews (67), Sherri Turner (69) and Maria Hjorth (69)
were seven back at 139.
	   South Korea's Se Ri Pak, a four-time winner this year, followed
her opening 72 with a 69 for a 141 total. Dina Ammaccapane,
Danielle's younger sister, also was at 141 after a 70.
	   Defending champion Chris Johnson was 14 back after a 74.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pete Sampras and the rest of the world's top
tennis players are doing little work on this Labor Day weekend.
	   The top-seeded Sampras needed just 78 minutes to defeat Mikael
Tillstrom 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 Saturday night to advance to the fourth
round of the U.S. Open, and several of his peers spent even less
time on court.
	   Defending champion Patrick Rafter won in 66 minutes, dropping
only three games in a third-round victory. Andre Agassi advanced
while losing just five games. Venus Williams needed to play only
half a match.
	   ``You never feel badly about winning. You want to get on and off
as quick as you possibly can,'' Rafter said after his 6-1, 6-1, 6-1
victory over David Nainkin. ``This is a Grand Slam. You want to
conserve your energy.''
	   Only two seeded women and four seeded men have been eliminated.
	   Sampras, serving 14 aces at up to 125 mph (200 kph), was
expressionless for most of the match as he pounded winners past the
Swede. But the four-time U.S. Open champion raised his arms to the
crowd to solicit applause on one point after slamming a forehand
down the line.
	   Sampras' next opponent will be unseeded Marat Safin, the Russian
teen-ager who became a crowd favorite in Paris with his improbable
run through this year's French Open. He defeated Thomas Muster in
the third round.
	   The third-seeded Rafter, who lost just six points on his first
serve and never faced a break point, will face No. 14 Goran
Ivanisevic in the fourth round.
	   Ivanisevic had 21 aces in a 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-4 win over Paul
Haarhuis, a player who had tormented him in the past. The
temperamental Ivanisevic said he has been playing better since
banging his head on the court during a second-round win over Todd
Martin earlier this week.
	   ``Sometimes I am a little bit messed up,'' he explained. ``I
have to bang, then everything comes together.''
	   Agassi won 6-2, 6-3, 6-0 in 96 minutes over Davide Sanguinetti,
who twisted his right ankle late in the first set and played the
rest of the match with the ankle heavily taped. Agassi's next
opponent will be No. 9 Karol Kucera.
	   The only men's seed to lose Saturday was No. 6 Greg Rusedski,
who was upset 4-6, 6-4, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 by Jan Siemerink in a match
that lasted 3 hours, 22 minutes. Rusedski was a U.S. Open finalist
last year.
	   Williams' match lasted just 13 minutes. She was leading 5-0 in
the first set when Larisa Neiland retired because of a painful
lower back injury that prevented her from sitting on the final
changeover.
	   Neiland was unable to move more than a few feet from the middle
of the court, watching helplessly when Williams hit shots into the
corners. Neiland's face was contorted with pain as she held onto
the umpire's chair for support after five games and told Williams
she could not continue.
	   ``I really would have enjoyed to have a match where she could
have played to her full ability,'' Williams said. ``I can get the
preparation on the practice court.''
	   Agassi, who played third on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court after
Rafter and Williams, was shocked to start playing so early in the
afternoon.
	   ``Both matches combined were like an hour and 15 minutes,
phenomenal,'' Agassi said. ``I felt rather rushed, I didn't enjoy
that at all.''
	   Women's winners included No. 2 Lindsay Davenport, No. 4 Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, No. 7 Conchita Martinez, No. 10 Nathalie Tauziat,
No. 12 Mary Pierce, No. 13 Amanda Coetzer and No. 15 Anna
Kournikova.
	   Fourteen of the 16 women's seeds reached the fourth round, the
first time that has happened since 1987. And the ease with which
favorites are advancing is in stark contrast to this year's French
Open and Wimbledon, in which there were many surprises.
	   ``It's been weird because the other Grand Slams, there's been a
lot of upsets, a lot of seeds that haven't made it,'' Davenport
said. ``I don't know what the reason is, but it just seems like the
players who are expected to win so far are winning.''

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Chartered planes, chauffeured
minivans, police protection and cash payments.
	   Swissair has lavished the grieving families of those killed on
Flight 111 with services and money since Wednesday's crash. Like
protective parents, airline officials have fiercely guarded the
privacy of the families while trying to provide for their every
need.
	   The airline's actions stand in stark contrast to TWA's treatment
of the families of those killed aboard Flight 800 two years ago. In
that tragedy, TWA officials said their first priority was to
investigate the possibility that a terrorist attack downed the
plane.
	   Swissair officials have said repeatedly that their first concern
is caring for the relatives of the 229 people killed when the plane
plunged into the ocean off Nova Scotia's coast.
	   ``I think it's a little bit our tradition to provide them with
the best we can,'' said Hans Klaus, a Swissair spokesman.
	   Arthur Wolk, a Philadelphia aviation attorney who has been
involved in lawsuits over many major airline crashes in the United
States, said Swissair is doing the right thing.
	   ``From a publicity standpoint, they don't look like they're hard
and evil. They look like they're sorry and compassionate,'' he
said.
	   TWA, he said, treated the families of victims ``like dirt.''
	   ``TWA didn't come up with a passenger list for days,'' he said.
``There was no offer of expense money so people could gather their
families, and there was no concerted effort...to bring them to the
site.''
	   A lawsuit seeking millions was brought by some of the families
of the 230 killed July 17, 1996, when the TWA plane exploded
shortly after it left Kennedy International Airport in New York
City. The civil trial was not expected to start before next summer.
	   The cause of the explosion has not been clearly defined by the
government despite an unprecedented civil and criminal
investigation.
	   Wolk predicted that Swissair's efforts would not prevent
survivors from filing a lawsuit. No airline crash has gone
unlitigated.
	   But the thoughtful treatment might make families more willing to
negotiate a settlement, he said.
	   Immediately after the Swissair crash Wednesday, airline
officials went to work notifying the families of the 229 people
aboard. Within a day, they had notified virtually everyone and
arranged for their travel to Canada.
	   The airline also offered each family dlrs 20,000 to pay for
their immediate needs.
	   On Friday, Swissair representatives greeted relatives as they
arrived in Nova Scotia on chartered flights from New York and
Geneva. Officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police made sure
they were left alone.
	   The passengers were quickly taken through customs in a private
room at Halifax Airport, then buses and taxi cabs took them to
their hotels.
	   Reporters and photographers were kept at least 100 yards (90
meters) away. But because the media were eager for access to the
families, the authorities made a deal: reporters could seek
interviews from relatives willing to talk, but there would be
further restrictions if the families were bothered.
	   Russell MacLellan, the premier of Nova Scotia, said it was the
regional government's duty to make sure the mourners were treated
well. His government helped set aside hundreds of hotel rooms.
	   Swissair, in coordination with Canadian authorities, arranged a
group meeting at the Lord Nelson Hotel late Friday to tell more
than 300 family members where the investigation stood and what
services would be available to them. German and French translators
also were hired to help.
	   At least 100 ``care team'' members, including priests, rabbis,
psychiatrists and social workers, wore badges on their lapels
identifying themselves by name and profession. Most said they were
simply making themselves available to the families.
	   ``There's no textbook on this,'' said Anglican pastor Richard
Walsh. ``You listen to what they say, and what they don't say.
You're basically there to be a sounding board.''
	   Saturday morning, many mourners traveled to the rocky shoreline
in Peggy's Cove, where Canadian soldiers had cordoned off an area
and set up tents for families to grieve away from the media.
	   Red Cross and Salvation Army officials escorted some to the
rocky ledge near the red and white lighthouse, the point closest to
the crash site. Firefighters lined the shoreline and police boats
patrolled the waters to be sure no news cameras intruded.
	   Swissair's Klaus said he had no idea how much the effort would
cost. The airline was not even thinking about that at this point,
he said.
	   Jeffrey Katz, Swissair's CEO, said after meeting with families
that he thought his company was doing a good job.
	   ``The group is, I believe, being well tended,'' he said.

Report: Japan corporate profits drop sharply amid Asia crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Profits for Japan's manufacturers will fall by
nearly a third in the first half of the fiscal year amid recession
at home and economic crisis in Asia, a leading Japanese business
daily reported Sunday.
	   Manufacturers have been hurt by weakening demand in Japan for
everything from pulp to chemicals and electronic equipment, the
Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. Price cutting by competitors
elsewhere in Asia has forced manufacturers in Japan to lower prices
also, sharply reducing profits in the half year ending in
September, the paper said.
	   Profits before taxes for the Japan's 1,747 publicly traded
companies will fall an aggregate 27.6 percent compared to the first
half of last year to 3.97 trillion yen (dlrs 29.3 billion), the
paper said citing its own compilation of company forecasts.
	   Profits for the 1,095 listed manufacturing companies will
decline 31.6 percent, the paper said.
