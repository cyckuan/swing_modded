Report: Japan to lend dlrs 3 billion to South Korean companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese government bank will extend dlrs 3
billion in loans to small companies in South Korea to help them
pull through their country's economic crisis, Japanese national
television said Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will officially unveil the loans by
the Export-Import Bank of Japan when South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung visits Japan starting Oct. 7, NHK reported.
	   A spokesman for the Export-Import Bank, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said nothing has been decided yet regarding loans to
South Korea.
	   In May, the bank lent dlrs 1 billion to South Korean companies
to pay for imports from Japan.
	   South Korea is currently struggling to restructure its economy
under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International Monetary
Fund.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Supporters of voluntary euthanasia
are encouraging voters to kick out federal members of Parliament
who overturned the Northern Territory's right-to-die laws.
	   They have placed advertisements in a national newspaper listing
the names of members of Parliament who supported overturning the
territorial law early last year, the first law in the world to
legalize assisted suicide for the terminally ill.
	   Martin Williams, husband of Esther Wild who was denied access to
the Northern Territory law and died a few weeks after the federal
bill overturning it was passed, has launched an Internet site
showing images of the politicians who supported the bill.
	   Voluntary euthanasia advocate Dr. Philip Nitschke, who used the
Northern Territory law to help four patients end their lives, has
taken the campaign a step further -- he's running for election on
Oct. 3 against Kevin Andrews, the conservative member of Parliament
who sponsored the federal law that overturned the territory's
right-to-die bill.
	   Nitschke said he did not expect to unseat Andrews, who holds the
safe ultra-conservative seat of Menzies.
	   ``It's very much symbolic. It's a very, very safe seat,''
Nitschke said.
	   ``We wanted to make sure that people out here had a chance to
make a protest vote,'' he said Wednesday.
	   Federal Parliament in March last year passed Andrews' bill to
overturn the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act,
which had been in force since July 1996.

 &UR; Hurricane victims storm relief trucks in Dominican Republic &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ At a relief center in a
capital slum for victims of Hurricane Georges, throngs of the
hungry swarmed a convoy of dump trucks bearing donated water, food,
cooking oil, pillows and second-hand clothes.
	   Police and relief workers swatted them back with sticks.
	   In the end, the aid went to those who could jump the highest,
shoulder the heaviest burdens and bear the most punishment.
	   It was survival of the fittest.
	   The ugly scene underscored the mounting desperation throughout
the hurricane-ravaged Dominican Republic as tens of thousands of
residents enter their second straight week deprived of life's most
basic essentials.
	   ``This makes me ashamed,'' said neighborhood organizer Rosa
Cabrera, who had hoped to collect provisions for nearby refugee
shelters. ``There are people (here) who aren't even refugees.
They're just the most able ones, and now they're going to eat all
the food.''
	   Donated by thousands of Dominican immigrants living in New York
City and New Jersey, the provisions were being delivered to one of
the capital city's most impoverished and hard-hit areas.
	   Flood waters swallowed up hundreds, perhaps thousands of flimsy
homes along a river bank in the Sabana Perdida shantytown after
Hurricane Georges crashed into the island nation on September 22.
	   The storm, which killed at least 200 in the Dominican Republic
and over 300 in the whole Carribean, drove 7,000 neighborhood
residents into a half dozen squalid shelters in Santo Domingo.
	   Dominican-born businessman Fernando Mateo, a self-made
millionaire who grew up in New York and organized the relief
shipments, said his idea was to take the aid straight to the
people.
	   In the past, he said, disaster relief and government assistance
to the poor had been stolen by corrupt officials or manipulated for
political gain.
	   ``This is not a time for politics,'' he said. ``This is a time
to get the food to the people who need it.''
	   In Sabana Perdida on Tuesday, what began as a well-intentioned
and orderly relief effort descended into chaos.
	   Hundreds of residents streamed past a chain-link fence at a
refugee compound where the aid trucks were parked.
	   A call to form single-file lines outside the 10-foot (3-meter)
barrier was ignored, as hungry people squeezed through narrow
cracks or scrambled over the fence top, indifferent to the barbed
wire digging into their bare or sandaled feet.
	   Unable to restore order, volunteers manning the trucks began to
hurl boxes, bottles and bags down at those able to stand tallest in
all the pushing and shoving.
	   Lydia Manzego's family came away with two bags of clothes and
two boxes of food _ including rice, orange juice, spaghetti, and
cans of tomato sauce and evaporated milk. Her teenage daughther
Yahai, one of six children, leaped the fence.
	   Many others, like 34-year old Felix Jimenez, came away
emptyhanded.
	   ``I threw myself in there, but I couldn't get my hands on
anything,'' said the sullen looking Jimenez, a father whose home
was carried off by the raging river.
	   ``We have nothing to eat,'' he said.
	   Barrio residents said the government has done little to help,
and the shipment from the Dominicans in the United States was the
first they'd received in the week since Hurricane Georges hit the
island.
	   City official Alejandro Obrero said the mad scramble for aid
shows how precariously people were living even before the latest
disaster.
	   ``There's an immense poverty in the Dominican Republic, '' he
said. ``The hurrican didn't create that, it just brought it
bubbling to the surface.''

Protest over helmet law blocks traffic on Thai resort island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 500 motorcyclists paralyzed
traffic for four hours on the resort island of Phuket during a
protest over enforcement of a crash helmet law, local papers
reported Wednesday.
	   The bikers who staged Tuesday's protest were mostly motorcycle
taxi drivers. The law, which came into effect on Sept. 15, requires
not only the drivers but their passengers to wear helmets, the
Bangkok Post reported.
	   Phuket, 690 kilometers (430 miles) southwest of Bangkok, is one
of Thailand's most popular beach resorts. It has almost no public
transport, and motorcycle taxis, where the passengers share the
bike's seat with the driver, are a common means of getting around.
	   The taxi drivers complained that the law would hurt their
business and that the fines of 200-500 baht (dlrs 5-12.5) were too
steep, the Post said.
	   They paraded on their motorcycles through several areas of
Phuket town, stalling traffic for most of the afternoon.

Japanese capital may experience financial crisis, governor warns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The governor of Tokyo warned Wednesday the city
faces a ``financial crisis'' because of declining tax revenues, the
latest local government to fall victim to Japan's stubborn economic
slowdown.
	   Gov. Yukio Aoshima said a decline in money from corporate income
taxes may force the capital this year to post its first budget
deficit since 1980.
	   ``It's become clear that tax revenues will contract
significantly,'' Aoshima said in a speech to city employees.
	   According to a text of the speech released to the press, Aoshima
blamed rising corporate bankruptcies and declining profits.
	   ``A financial crisis is foreseeable,'' he said.
	   Tokyo becomes the third prefectural-level government _ Japan's
equivalent of a state _ to slip into the red this year.
	   Last month, suburban Kanagawa prefecture followed the city of
Osaka when it declared a ``financial state of emergency'' because
of a similar drop in tax revenues.
	   The spreading malaise among local governments could throw a
wrench into the central government's plans to stimulate the economy
out of its longest recession since records were first kept in 1955.
	   Although must of the 17 trillion yen (dlrs 126 billion) that
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi wants to spend on public works to kick
start growth will come from federal coffers, some would also come
from local governments, who might be reluctant to comply, warn
analysts.
	   Aoshima said he is considering several unspecified reforms to
balance the budget of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, which also
has jurisdiction over several rural towns and a string of islands
near the capital.
	   Aoshima refused to say how big a shortfall the city foresees
from its original projection of 4.6 trillion yen (dlrs 34 billion)
in tax revenues for this year. But the Nihon Keizai newspaper
estimated the gap may be as large as 400 billion yen (dlrs 3
billion).
	   That could force the city to cut jobs and scale back public
projects to get its books back in balance, the paper said.
	   Aoshima is also considering cutting salaries and benefits of
higher ranking city officials, said the paper, Japan's top business
daily.

Industry shutdowns spread as Australian gas shortage worsens

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Stores in the state of Victoria
began rationing bread, while factories in other states closed down
Wednesday as the effects of a major natural gas system shutdown
spread.
	   ``I think it's worse than the state of Victoria,'' state Premier
Jeff Kennett said. ``It is going to cost Australia ... in the order
of hundreds of millions of dollars a day.''
	   The crisis began with a huge fire at Esso's Longford gas plant
in Victoria state on Friday that killed two men and injured eight.
	   The plant supplied more than 80 percent of the natural gas for
Australia's second-most populous state, and some 1.4 million
households and 100,000 businesses may be without natural gas for at
least two weeks.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook
their food.
	   Some industry sectors have speculated the aftermath of the fires
could last up to six months, even if gas is restored within a
couple of weeks.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions, which took two days to extinguish.
	   At least 100,000 workers in Victoria have been laid off as the
Ford and Toyota auto factories, glass and brick-making plants,
bakeries, dairies and many other industries shut down.
	   The Franklins supermarket chain, with 48 stores in Victoria,
alerted store managers that in the event of serious shortages they
might ration food, especially bread and milk.
	   Rationing has not been seen in Victoria since World War II.
	   Safeways, the state's biggest supermarket chain with 138 stores,
is limiting bread purchases by its customers.
	   ``We are attempting to restrict them to two or three loaves per
person so that those stores have sufficient bread supplies for
people coming in later in the day,'' Safeways state finance manager
Tony Parle said.
	   The industrial crisis spread interstate, with other factories
that rely on business with Victoria having to lay off workers.
	   In South Australia, two of Australia's largest automotive
companies, Holden and Mitsubishi, announced they were preparing for
several days of lost production because of a lack of parts from
Victoria.
	   Holden is to shut down Wednesday night, sending home its 4,500
workers until at least Tuesday.
	   Mitsubishi expected to remain open until Thursday, but the
operation of the plant for next week was in doubt.
	   Victoria state's auto industry is losing 10 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.9 million) a day in exports. In New South
Wales, 600 workers at BTR Automotives have been laid off as parts
from Victoria ran out.
	   Lawyers and unions clamored to launch legal action against Esso
and gas distributor VENCorp for damages to business and consumers
while economists warned the disaster's effect on Australia's growth
rate depended on its duration.
	   ``With speculation that it might be up to six months, if it's
that sort of period then it's going to have a big impact in terms
of industrial output and people being stood down,'' said Matthew
Drennan, senior economist at Morgan Grenfell.
	   The Australian Industry Group estimates the crisis could cost
100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) each day it
goes on.
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Canadian officials to allow the Makah
to hunt wounded whales that swim into Canadian waters.

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) _ Canada won't honor a U.S.
treaty that allows the Makah Indians to conduct their whale hunt in
Canadian waters, fishery officials say.
	   However, they will allow the Makah to pursue a wounded whale
that later swims into Canadian waters.
	   Beginning Thursday, the Makah are allowed by U.S. treaty rights
and by the International Whaling Commission to kill up to five gray
whales annually for subsistence and cultural reasons.
	   Over the five-year term of the agreement, they can strike 33
whales in their bid to kill a total of 20 through 2002.
	   Canadian officials have been wrestling with the issues
surrounding the new hunt.
	   ``The department is prepared to issue a license to the Makah to
harvest an injured gray whale,'' fisheries officer Larry Paike said
Tuesday. ``We will not allow the pursuit of an uninjured whale into
Canadian waters and we will take enforcement action to prevent
that.''
	   The chances of Makah hunters entering Canadian waters are low
now because the gray whale will be migrating south. But the Makah
will hunt again in April, when the whales head north.
	   Paike and Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers went to Port
Angeles, Washington, on Tuesday to discuss the final details of the
hunt with other U.S. and Canadian agencies.

	   The state on Wednesday raised the fine for turning on gas
without authorization from 500 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 290)

alerted store managers that in the event of serious shortages they
might ration food, especially bread and milk.
	   Rationing has not been seen in Victoria since World War II.
	   Safeway, the state's biggest supermarket chain with 138 stores,
is limiting bread purchases by its customers.
	   ``We are attempting to restrict them to two or three loaves per
person so that those stores have sufficient bread supplies for
people coming in later in the day,'' Safeway state finance manager
Tony Parle said.
	   The industrial crisis spread interstate, with other factories
that rely on business with Victoria having to lay off workers.
	   In South Australia, two of Australia's largest automotive
companies, Holden and Mitsubishi, announced they were preparing for
several days of lost production because of a lack of parts from
Victoria.
	   Holden is to shut down Wednesday night, sending home its 4,500
workers until at least Tuesday.
	   Mitsubishi expected to remain open until Thursday, but the
operation of the plant for next week was in doubt.
	   Victoria state's auto industry is losing 10 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.9 million) a day in exports. In New South
Wales, 600 workers at BTR Automotives have been laid off as parts
from Victoria ran out.
	   Lawyers and unions clamored to launch legal action against Esso
and gas distributor VENCorp for damages to business and consumers
while economists warned the disaster's effect on Australia's growth
rate depended on its duration.
	   ``With speculation that it might be up to six months, if it's
that sort of period then it's going to have a big impact in terms
of industrial output and people being stood down,'' said Matthew
Drennan, senior economist at Morgan Grenfell.
	   The Australian Industry Group estimates the crisis could cost
100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) each day it
goes on.
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

Amnesty International, U.S. slam Malaysia over police brutality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Anwar pleading innocent to new charge
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Amnesty International has called
for a probe into allegations of police brutality against detained
opposition activists, including ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim. The U.S. State Department also slammed Malaysia for
mistreating political prisoners.
	   ``Anwar's treatment at the hands of the police shows the
government's blatant disregard for basic human rights,'' said a
statement from the London-based human rights group, issued late
Tuesday.
	   Making his first appearance in court Tuesday, Anwar said that
after his arrest on Sept. 20 he was led handcuffed and blindfolded
to a police lockup where he was greeted with a punch that knocked
him unconscious.
	   Anwar also said his left eye was so swollen that he could not
use it for two days after the beating. The eye was still bruised
when he appeared in court.
	   ``We are deeply concerned as well by reports of police brutality
during the incarceration of Anwar,'' said a statement, also late
Tuesday, by deputy State Department spokesman James Foley.
	   Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth called in Malaysia's
acting ambassador to Washington to convey U.S. concerns, Foley
said.
	   Malaysian police said they would investigate.
	   On Wednesday, Anwar pleaded innocent to a 10th charge _ of
committing an illegal sexual act _ in a suburban Kuala Lumpur
courthouse.
	   Several hundred riot police surrounded the courthouse to keep
out crowds who had gathered to get a glimpse of Anwar after reading
newspaper accounts of his injuries.
	   But few got to see the 51-year-old politician, who was driven to
the courthouse in a vehicle with tinted windows and hustled into
the courtroom through a back entrance.
	   On Tuesday, he was charged formally on five counts of corruption
during his tenure as deputy prime minister and finance minister and
on four counts of illegal sex. Homosexual acts are illegal in
Islamic Malaysia.
	   Anwar pleaded innocent to all nine charges on Tuesday. A trial
is likely to commence soon in the High Court.
	   Since he was fired on Sept. 2, Mahathir has cracked down on
political critics. Apart from Anwar, 17 others have been arrested
under the harsh Internal Security Act which allows for indefinite
imprisonment without trial.
	   Anwar was arrested after he led a huge rally that demanded
Mahathir's resignation. Kuala Lumpur has been convulsed with
regular pro-Anwar protests since his arrest.
	   To block a potential protest near the courthouse, police also
stationed a water cannon and prevented people from gathering in
groups.
	   While the government has tried to keep public attention focused
on the allegations of homosexuality against Anwar, escalating
political protests and Tuesday's exposure of police brutality have
taken centerstage.
	   ``I was hit very hard on the left part of my neck and slapped
left and right until blood flowed down my nose,'' Anwar told the
court.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, followed her husband back to the
federal police headquarters, where an eye doctor determined that
his retina wasn't permanently damaged.
	   ``When I first saw him, I was shocked and stunned,'' said
Azizah, an eye specialist herself who gave up her practice years
ago to take care of their six children. ``After all he's been
through, his spirit is very strong and I'm proud of that.''

Italy asks Australia for extradition of wanted man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Italian authorities on Wednesday
requested the extradition of a man on kidnapping charges who was
arrested at Sydney airport last month.
	   Giovanni Farina, 48, is wanted by Italian police for the
kidnapping of an Italian businessman in June last year, Sydney
Central Local Court was told Wednesday.
	   Already in custody over passport, currency and assault charges,
Farina was arrested Wednesday morning on a provisional extradition
warrant.
	   A statement given to the court said Farina faced up to 30 years
in prison if found guilty of the kidnapping and five billion lira
(U.S. dlrs 3 million) ransom demand.
	   Magistrate Derek Price remanded Farina in custody until Nov. 11.
	   Farina made no application for bail and entered no plea.
	   The man identified as Farina maintains he is 39-year-old
businessman Luigi Valiante.
	   He was arrested Aug. 15 after customs officials discovered a
large amount of undeclared cash in his bags. Under Australian law,
it is illegal to import a large amount of currency without
declaring it.
	   Farina is accused of masterminding the kidnappings of wealthy
business people whose ears were chopped off when ransom money was
not paid in time.
	   In one attack, Giuseppe Soffiantini's ears were cut off and sent
to a television station before his family paid the ransom.

Asia's top three markets slide, following Wall Street's example
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ With the long-awaited U.S. interest rate cut
smaller than expected, Asia's top three stock markets fell victim
to profit-taking Wednesday that chopped away at earlier gains.
	   Tokyo stock prices opened higher, but soon gave up the gains as
investors began to refocus on local banking problems. In Hong Kong
and Singapore, investors sold shares that had risen in value in
anticipation of the Fed move.
	   Wall Street, disappointed by the conservative reduction, lost
28.32 points, or 0.35 percent, to close at 8,080.52 Tuesday.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve cut the federal-funds rate a quarter
percentage point to 5.25 percent Tuesday, the first change in
interest rates in a year and a half. It was largely expected to
strengthen the yen and boost market sentiment across Asia.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei average of 225 selected issues soared to
13,966.77, or up 1.04 percent, then slid fast as investors began to
refocus on problems in Japan. By midday Wednesday, the Nikkei stood
at 13,827.45, up only 6.02 points or 0.04 percent.
	   ``People are worried about problems at subsidiaries of Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan,'' said Jon Yang of Jardine Fleming Securities
in Tokyo, referring to the Japanese government efforts to bail out
the ailing bank.
	   In mid-morning trading, the dollar bought 135.03 yen, down from
135.26 yen earlier, but above 134.55 yen in New York late Tuesday.
The dollar was quoted at 135.20 yen in Tokyo late Tuesday.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index opened lower at
7,811.25, down 26.36 points, as the U.S. interest rate reduction
came as no surprise after days of anticipation.
	   ``Buy on rumor, sell on news,'' said Michael Ng of Sassoon
Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. ``Wall Street fell, so Hong Kong
followed. Investors don't think Hong Kong will match the cut.''
	   The Hang Seng Index had risen by 11 percent last week.
	   In Singapore, investors had expected a more significant interest
rate reduction. So by midday Wednesday the benchmark Straits Times
Index was down 2.90 points, or 0.3 percent at 935.61 from Tuesday's
close. Earlier in the day, it had earlier slid as much as 1 percent
to a midmorning low of 928.54.
	   Dealers noted profit-taking activity on blue chips and banks,
which had enjoyed a good run-up in the last few weeks in
anticipation of the rate cut.

Moody's downgrades debt rating of Nomura Securities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday downgraded
the debt rating of brokerage giant Nomura Securities Co., pointing
to losses in its international operations and troubles in its
domestic business.
	   The move is the latest in a series of downgrades of top Japanese
companies by the New York-based credit agency. In most of the
decisions, Moody's cited a stubborn downturn by Japan's domestic
economy as a key concern.
	   The decision dropped the senior long-term debt rating from A1 to
A3, possibly raising the borrowing costs of Nomura, Japan's top
securities firm and one of the largest in the world. Moody's said
the A3 debt rating remains on review for possible further
downgrade.
	   Moody's also cut Nomura's short-term debt rating to Prime-2 from
Prime-1, and lowered the Bank Financial Strength Rating of Nomura
Bank International Plc to D from D-plus.
	   The rating actions were prompted by substantial losses and asset
quality problems in Nomura's international operations, as well as
troubles in its domestic operations, Moody's said.
	   ``Although Nomura is still the predominant securities firm in
Japan, its earnings are under severe pressure because of the
prevailing recession in the domestic economy,'' Moody's said in a
statement.
	   Intensifying competition by new domestic financial conglomerates
and by foreign competitors also contributed to the rating actions,
according to the credit agency.
	   The losses reported in its U.S. real estate business and
proprietary trading activities show that Nomura is vulnerable to
adverse market conditions, Moody's said.
	   A credit rating reflects the agency's assessment of the
company's ability to repay its debts. A lower rating usually means
higher borrowing costs as the company is seen as a greater risk.

Thai monkey may lose hand caught inside coconut

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A passion for coconuts may cost a
monkey in Thailand its right hand, veterinarians in Bangkok said
Wednesday.
	   The wild macaque, who lives in a forest in a suburb of Bangkok,
caught his hand inside a coconut about three weeks ago after
slipping it through a narrow crack in the shell to dig out some
meat, according to residents of the area.
	   They alerted veterinarians at Bangkok's Dusit Zoo, who succeeded
in capturing the monkey on Tuesday.
	   But after removing the coconut with a hacksaw, they found that
80 percent of the flesh on the monkey's palm was already dead.
	   The hand will have to be amputated if it does not begin healing
in two days, said Somchai Chotapisithikul, a veterinarian at Dusit
Zoo.
	   He said, however, that the animal's plight may not have been the
result of bad luck.
	   About 100-150 macaques live in Bang Khunthien, the last bit of
forest in the metropolitan area. Construction workers in the
vicinity sometimes try and catch the monkeys either to sell or kill
for food.
	   One method they use is to dig a small hole in a coconut so a
monkey will trap his hand, making him easier to catch, Somchai
said.
	   The monkeys' natural habitat is rapidly disappearing because of
forest encroachment, shrimp farming and road construction in Bang
Khunthien, and so they frequently wander into more populated areas
searching for food.
	   Residents have complained to district officials about monkeys
pilfering their food.
	   To help the monkeys survive, the district has provided a budget
to buy them food, said Manit Kuldilokamphon, a district official.

A Labor victory would calm Asian fears, Beazley says

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Labor opposition leader Kim Beazley
declared Wednesday that a change of government in the Oct. 3
election would end Asian fears of resurgent racism in Australia.
	   Beazley said the recent success of Pauline Hanson's anti-Asian
One Nation party damaged Australia's reputation in Asian countries
that only recently had begun to forget the White Australia
migration policy that was rescinded in the 1960s.
	   However, he predicted that Australia's reputation will be
restored quickly if Labor regains power in Saturday's elections,
ousting Prime Minister John Howard and his conservatives.
	   ``I would see the advent of a Labor government ending that
concern in the region,'' he said.
	   He also said a Labor government would push for a big

a new Marshall plan.
	   Beazley told reporters, after his last major speech of the
election campaign, that he wants to have his proposals for this
initiative ready for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
leaders' meeting in Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur in November.
	   Howard has been widely criticized for being slow to condemn
Hanson after her first speech to Parliament in 1996, in which she
warned that Australia is in danger of being ``swamped by Asians''
and called for an end to Asian immigration.
	   Indeed he initially appeared to welcome some aspects of Hanson's
speech, saying shortly afterwards that the election of his
government in March 1996 had left Australians feeling freer to
express their views.
	   ``One of the great changes that have come over Australia in the
last six months is that people do feel able to speak more freely
about what they feel,'' Howard said at that time.
	   That led to widespread condemnation of Howard, in newspapers
throughout the region, even though months later he led Parliament
in a blunt condemnation of racism in all its forms.

Will Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party be a one-year wonder?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Pauline Hanson, the outspoken opponent
of Asian immigration and Aboriginal land rights whose right-wing
One Nation party just months ago seemed to have a real chance to
hold sway over the next government, now looks like a spent force
after a bizarre campaign for the Oct. 3 election.
	   Opinion polls, which at One Nation's peak showed it was likely
to hold the balance of power in the upper house of Parliament _
giving it a virtual veto over government bills _ now show voter
support has halved, and Hanson herself is facing an uphill battle
to win a seat.
	   Hanson, 44, who once owned a fish and chips shop, was elected to
federal Parliament in 1996 despite having her candidacy disendorsed
by Prime Minister John Howard's Liberal Party, for allegedly racist
comments.
	   With an often faltering voice, homespun philosophies but obvious
determination, Hanson rode a wave of public resentment toward
professional politicians and ``political correctness,'' launching
One Nation in April 1997.
	   Fourteen months later, One Nation won almost 23 percent of the
vote in a Queensland state election, giving it a minority 11 of 89
seats and ending the conservative government's hopes of
re-election.
	   The Queensland result sent shockwaves through Australian
politics and panicked the conservative ruling coalition,
particularly the rural-based National Party.
	   In Australia's Outback, where issues such as globalization and
Aboriginal land rights are blamed for everything from failing crops
to youth suicide, National members called on the government to
adopt Hanson-like policies.
	   But Hanson's popularity has not held, major polls show. During
the campaign, One Nation support has been hovering at between 6 and
8 percent.
	   Hanson's campaign has been a disorganized whirlwind of
appearances, policies released on the run and chaotic news
conferences. She has been dogged by protesters and Pauline
Pantsdown, a man in heavy makeup and colorful skirts who parodies
Hanson.
	   Relations with reporters have been strained. Itineraries have
been kept secret or not followed.
	   By the last week of the campaign, chief strategist David
Oldfield encouraged Hanson supporters to yell abuse at reporters
asking questions and accused the media of stirring division.
	   A nadir was reached Tuesday, when Oldfield called the police to
arrest reporters who refused to leave a policy launch without
promised documents outlining costings. Police declined to make the
arrests and the reporters left quietly.
	   After a poor reception to her plan for a flat 2 percent tax on
all transactions in the economy, Hanson's campaign struggled to
find form.
	   It was most notable for her qualified support for a One Nation
candidate who said Aborigines were happier when they worked as
slave labor, for allegations she was trying to appeal to men by
wearing a miniskirt and a claim that the Australian people are all
her children.
	   Hanson's immigration policy reflects her claim Australia's in
danger of being ``swamped by Asians'' and calls for a zero net
intake.
	   The major parties have tried to ignore her, apparently following
the strategy of Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, who refused to
debate her, saying: ``I'm not going to provide her with oxygen.''

Military captures town of Mankulam after one-year siege
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan government troops captured
the key northern town of Mankulam Wednesday after a bloody one-year
siege, military officials said.
	   Tamil Tiger guerrillas withdrew from the battered town 245
kilometers (150 miles) north of Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, as
government troops encircled it, said military officials who asked
not to be named. Civilians fled the town more than a year ago.
	   Mankulam's defenders, dug in behind bunkers and barbed wire, had
frustrated the military's 16-month attempt to capture the main
highway in the north.
	   Meanwhile fighting continued to rage around the town of
Kilinochchi at the northern end of the highway, which the rebels
stormed on Sunday. Kilinochchi is 35 kilometers (21 miles) to the
north of Mankulam.
	   The rebels claim they captured Kilinochchi and the town of
Paranthan further north. Paranthan lies on the northernmost stretch
of a 70-kilometer (45 mile) highway. The government says it still
controls parts of the towns.
	   The military said it killed 477 rebels and lost more than 262
soldiers in highway battles _ the heaviest fighting this year. This
includes more than 100 rebels and 62 soldiers killed in fresh
fighting near Mankulam on Tuesday, the military said in the
statement. Another 300 soldiers were wounded.
	   The military first reached the outskirts of Mankulam from the
south last October. Since then, government troops trying to
surround the town have had to fight step by step through a rain of
mortar and artillery fire from guerrillas in the thick jungles.
	   On Monday, as the main body of guerrillas attacked Kilinochchi,
the military began a fresh advance and gained ground to the east
and west of Mankulam.
	   The clandestine Voice of Tigers radio, monitored by civilians in
the northern government-held town of Vavuniya, admitted losing 240
fighters in the fighting near Kilinochchi and Paranthan.
	   There was no independent confirmation since the government has
barred journalists from visiting the battle zone. The government
imposed censorship in June on war reporting by foreign and local
reporters after fighting escalated in the north.
	   The clandestine radio said rebels were prepared to hand over the
bodies of soldiers to the International Committee of Red Cross.
	   Since May last year, government forces have wrested control of
two-thirds of the highway, parts of which are controlled by the
guerrillas. Complete military control would open a land route to
the Jaffna peninsula, a former rebel stronghold in the north that
the army captured two years ago.
	   The government is relying on expensive air and sea deliveries of
food and other commodities to Jaffna's half-million residents in
the absence of a road link.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that they are
widely discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control
the government and the military.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed in the fighting since
1983.

 &UR; Mahathir hints that Anwar's injury self-inflicted

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Opposition parties condemned the
government Wednesday over allegations by ousted deputy premier
Anwar Ibrahim of police brutality, while Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad hinted Anwar's wounds might be self-inflicted.
	   Anwar may have intentionally hurt himself to derive public
sympathy, the national news agency, Bernama, quoted Mahathir as
saying.
	   ``It's not impossible because he will get plenty of mileage if
he showed he was abused by police,'' Mahathir told reporters.
	   Anwar told a court Tuesday that he was punched and slapped until
he fell unconscious on the first night in captivity on Sept. 20
when he was arrested under a harsh security provision.
	   When he appeared at another court on Wednesday, he repeatedly
took off his glasses to dab the area around his left eye that is
still black with blood clots.
	   Amnesty International and the U.S. State Department have
expressed concern over Anwar's safety in police custody.
	   ``All Malaysians are asking how they could be safe when former
deputy prime minister could be brutally assaulted while in police
custody,'' said Lim Kit Siang, the leader of the opposition
Democratic Action Party.
	   The Malaysian People's Party, another opposition group, called
on Mahathir to guarantee that physical and psychological force
would not be used against Anwar.
	   Anwar was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2. He then launched a
movement for political reform which has slowly grown into a
campaign for Mahathir's ouster.
	   Anwar will be tried on 10 counts of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. He faces a maximum of 14 years in jail if
corruption is established and 20 years if the charges of sodomy are
proven.

India shrugs off cancellation of Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ With their nuclear dispute still
unresolved, Indians had stopped expecting a visit from Bill Clinton
that would have been the first by a U.S. president in 20 years,
analysts said Wednesday.
	   The Clinton administration on Tuesday came close to calling off
the trip, which had been tentatively scheduled for November. A
formal cancellation was expected this week.
	   The Indian foreign office said it would have no reaction until
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee returned Thursday from
France, where he is on a state visit.
	   In Washington, White House press secretary Mike McCurry,
speaking to reporters about reports that Clinton would drop India
and Pakistan from his itinerary, said: ``I don't have any reason to
dispute that.''
	   McCurry said Clinton would go ahead with his original plan to
attend an Asia Pacific Economic Conference meeting in Malaysia in
mid-November.
	   In New Delhi, former Foreign Secretary S.K. Singh said Clinton
could not have hoped to achieve much in India before the end of
talks on nuclear policy between Vajpayee's envoy Jaswant Singh and
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
	   ``We've known for months now that the negotiations between
Jaswant and Talbott will not be over soon and Clinton might not
wish to come before that,'' Singh said in an interview.
	   The United States wants India and Pakistan to sign an
international nuclear test ban treaty and end 50 years of rivalry.
Nuclear weapons tests by both countries in May raised fears of a
nuclear war in South Asia.
	   The Clinton visit was put on hold after the tests, and the
United States led several countries who slapped economic sanctions
on India and Pakistan. Indian officials have said in the past that
it would have been awkward for Clinton to visit while sanctions
were in place.
	   ``Had the events of May on both sides not occurred and the visit
(to New Delhi) had taken place, I think there would have been
major, major gains for India,'' said Surjit Mansingh, an
international relations expert at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru
University.
	   ``But the whole process got pushed back years, and until we
reach the same point again where there is a broad band of
agreement, what's the point?'' she said.
	   Jimmy Carter was the last American president to visit India in
1978. A planned trip by President George Bush was canceled because
of the Gulf War. U.S.-Indian relations have been strained chiefly
by nuclear differences, but American business has been pushing for
closer ties.
	   On Tuesday, U.S. lawmakers agreed to give Clinton power to lift
some sanctions against India and Pakistan, flexibility he had said
he needed in order to negotiate with the two countries about their
nuclear policy. But the provision is tacked onto an agriculture
bill whose passage into law is uncertain.
	   In an address to the opening session of the U.N. General
Assembly last week, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said his
country was ready to adhere to the test ban treaty if India did. In
his own speech to the General Assembly, Vajpayee indicated New
Delhi's willingness to sign the treaty by next year.

A Labor victory would calm Asian fears, Beazley says

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Labor opposition leader Kim Beazley
declared Wednesday that a change of government in the Oct. 3
election would end Asian fears of resurgent racism in Australia.
	   Beazley said the recent success of Pauline Hanson's anti-Asian
One Nation party damaged Australia's reputation in Asian countries
that only recently had begun to forget the White Australia
migration policy that was rescinded in the 1960s.
	   However, he predicted that Australia's reputation will be
restored quickly if Labor regains power in Saturday's elections,
ousting Prime Minister John Howard and his conservatives.
	   ``I would see the advent of a Labor government ending that
concern in the region,'' he said.
	   He also said a Labor government would push for a big
international rescue plan for Indonesia, a proposal he described as
a new Marshall plan.
	   Beazley told reporters, after his last major speech of the
election campaign, that he wants to have his proposals for this
initiative ready for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
leaders' meeting in Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur in November.

two men convicted of allowing Anwar to sodomize them appealed their
guilty pleas.
	   Munawar Anees, Anwar's former speechwriter, and Sukma Dermawan,
Anwar's adopted brother, filed their appeals against their
convictions at the High Court on Tuesday through their lawyers.
	   Both men, aged 51 and 37 respectively, pleaded guilty earlier
this month to allowing Anwar to sodomize them. They were sentenced
to six months in jail.

Voluntary euthanasia campaigner runs against man who overturned law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election-Hanson

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian supporters of voluntary
euthanasia are encouraging voters to kick out federal members of
Parliament who overturned the Northern Territory's right-to-die
laws.
	   They have placed advertisements in a national newspaper listing
the names of members of Parliament who supported overturning the
territorial law early last year, the first law in the world to
legalize assisted suicide for the terminally ill.
	   Martin Williams, husband of Esther Wild who was denied access to
the Northern Territory law and died a few weeks after the federal
bill overturning it was passed, has launched an Internet site
showing images of the politicians who supported the bill.
	   Voluntary euthanasia advocate Dr. Philip Nitschke, who used the
Northern Territory law to help four patients end their lives, has
taken the campaign a step further _ he's running for election on
Oct. 3 against Kevin Andrews, the conservative member of Parliament
who sponsored the federal law that overturned the territory's
right-to-die bill.
	   Nitschke said he did not expect to unseat Andrews, who holds the
safe ultra-conservative seat of Menzies.
	   ``It's very much symbolic. It's a very, very safe seat,''
Nitschke said.
	   ``We wanted to make sure that people out here had a chance to
make a protest vote,'' he said Wednesday.
	   Federal Parliament in March last year passed Andrews' bill to
overturn the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act,
which had been in force since July 1996.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bomb blast ripped through the offices of a fish
cannery on eastern island of Sakhalin on Wednesday, but no one was
hurt, officials said.
	   The radio-controlled bomb went off shortly after a company
executive arrived at the offices of the Tunaicha cannery in the
city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The bomb, placed under a stairway, shattered windows in the
building and damaged a car parked nearby.
	   The cannery exports red caviar and salmon to Japan, Britain and
the Netherlands.

Tokyo stocks nosedive after Nomura debt rating downgrade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stocks afternoon close, latest bond, dollar-yen
rate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks plummeted 3 percent to their lowest
level in 12 years Wednesday after Moody's credit-rating agency
downgraded the nation's biggest securities firm.
	   The U.S. dollar gained against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 415.04
points, or 3 percent, to 13,406.39 points by the close of afternoon
trading, the lowest finish since Feb. 21, 1986, when it closed at
13,394.31 points.
	   On Tuesday, the Nikkei index closed down 87.94 points, or 0.63
percent.
	   After gaining slightly in the morning session, prices _
especially securities company stocks _ went south in the final hour
of trading after Moody's Investors Service cut the debt rating of
Nomura Securities Co.
	   The move was the latest in a series of rating downgrades for
Japanese companies. Moody's cut Nomura's long-term and short-term
debt ratings and its Bank Financial Strength Rating.
	   The rating agency cited losses in Nomura's international
operations and its domestic troubles in the midst of Japan's worst
recession since the end of World War II.
	   The announcement immediately took its toll on Nomura stocks, as
well as those of other Japanese brokerages, such as Daiwa and
Nikko. Nomura is Japan's top brokerage and one of the world's
largest.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was also down 19.33 points, or 1.82 percent, to
1,043.57. The TOPIX closed down 0.62 points, or 0.06 percent, the
day before.
	   The rating news quickly eclipsed any buoying effect from a U.S.
interest rate cut on Tuesday, which had been expected to boost
markets by cushioning the U.S. economy from global economic turmoil
and revive other slumping economies.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the benchmark federal funds
rate to 5.25 percent from 5.50 percent on Tuesday _ a move widely
expected after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted at it recently.
	   But the Fed action was seen as largely insufficient, eventually
sending U.S. stocks _ and then the dollar _ lower. Lower interest
rates tend to make a nation's currency less attractive to
investors.
	   The dollar recovered in Tokyo trading on Wednesday, however,
hitting 135.54 yen at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT), up 1.12 yen from its Tokyo
close on Tuesday and also above its late New York rate of 134.45
yen overnight.
	   Still, traders said the dollar faced downward pressure against
the yen.
	   ``People are focused on the dollar's problems rather than the
yen's,'' said Yuji Matsuura, chief dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
	   On Wall Street on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average,
which was up 15 points as Fed officials concluded their meeting,
dropped 28.32 points _ or 0.3 percent _ to close at 8,080.52.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell Wednesday to 0.765 percent from Tuesday's finish of 0.805
percent, driving its price up to 109.35 yen from 108.96 yen.
	   The government changed the benchmark bond from No. 182 because
of the increased trading volume of No. 203.

Mrs. Clinton tours Hurricane Georges damage in Puerto Rico
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Speeches begin at 1230 GMT; timing of Mrs. Clinton's talk not
certain &QL; 
 &UR; By CAROLYN SKORNECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ It was hot and steamy, but Hillary Rodham
Clinton dutifully gazed out the window of the military helicopter,
nodding as Puerto Rico's governor pointed out damage wrought by
Hurricane Georges.
	   The four-hour stop en route to Chile for the annual meeting of
the hemisphere's first ladies gave Mrs. Clinton a chance to meet
some of the victims and announce new disaster aid for the Caribbean
island.
	   The detour to Puerto Rico meant she missed the private dinner of
the first ladies Tuesday night. But she was to address their
meeting Wednesday on boosting women's political and leadership
roles.
	   Her whirlwind tour of a sultry Puerto Rico on a Marine
helicopter swooped her through ravines and over fields and towns
for a birds eye view of the damage. Efforts to avoid a huge storm
cloud a week after Georges cleared out of Puerto Rico doubled the
length of one chopper ride.
	   ``I have visited many natural disasters with my husband and on
my own and I know how devastating they can be for families,'' she
told a rapt and often cheering crowd of some 200 people living
temporarily at a school turned into a shelter in the town of
Luquillo.
	   Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rosello heaped praise on President Bill
Clinton's quick response to his request for aid over a week ago
when the storm hit, saying, ``We have not had from any president
more help than from President Clinton.''
	   Georges killed four people in Puerto Rico and caused dlrs 2
billion in damage. Water and power were cut off for days for most
of the 3.8 million residents. More than 17,000 people left homeless
by the storm were being housed in 232 shelters.
	   Mrs. Clinton said that after surveying the damage, ``I can tell
my husband how much more needs to be done.''
	   There was no hint of Clinton's troubles regarding his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
	   Mrs. Clinton also met with hurricane victims in two towns.
	   In Guayama, chicken farmer Carlos Lopez, 58, told her that 80
percent of his flock had been killed by the hurricane that also
destroyed much of Puerto Rico's coffee and plantain crops. He was
now in the process of burying the birds, he told a sympathetic
first lady.
	   And at the school-shelter in Luquillo, 50-year-old Ismael Rivera
Rios, temporary tenant of a classroom furnished with 10 cots
sporting mismatched linens, grinned widely after talking to Mrs.
Clinton even though he got to meet her only because his home was
destroyed.
	   But at least one woman was in tears when television cameras and
reporters entered the room, angered at what she considered an
invasion of her privacy. ``I live here,'' cried Luz Soto Figuera in
Spanish before she stormed out of the room prior to Mrs. Clinton's
arrival.
	   The new aid announced by Mrs. Clinton includes:
	   _up to dlrs 30 million from the Labor Department to hire
displaced workers to assist in hurricane cleanup and restoration.
	   _a federal commitment to pay 75 percent of the cost of
rebuilding the infrastructure, such as bridges, municipal buildings
and water purification plants.
	   _a housing and urban development department offer to provide 100
percent financing with no down payment for people to buy a new home
if their old was damaged beyond repair. HUD previously announced
dlrs 39 million to help repair damaged public housing units.
	   Mrs. Clinton's next stop on a busy four-day trip is Montevideo,
Uruguay, for a conference bringing together hundreds of women from
across Latin America.

Singapore Airlines reverses increase in fares to Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Airlines says it is restoring
discounts on a popular route to the Philippines, a week after it
touched off a public outcry by scrapping them.
	   The airline effectively doubled all its fares to Manila a week
ago after Philippines Airlines ceased operations, handing Singapore
Airlines a monopoly on direct flights on the busy route.
	   In a statement late Tuesday, it said it has decided ``to
reinstate the discounted market fares that applied before Sept.
23'' on flights to the Philippine capital.
	   Local newspapers had published letters from the public
complaining about the scrapping of the discounts, which also
affected the many Filipino maids and their employers in Singapore.
	   The Consumer Association of Singapore also criticized the move.
	   ``You don't just double fares overnight if it's a pure business
decision,'' association director Edmund Baker told The New Paper
last week. ``This is making use of a monopoly to profiteer.''
	   The airline's Tuesday statement made no reference to the general
criticism, stating simply that it decided to reinstate the previous
discounted fares after it had ``reviewed the overall market
conditions, and in view of an anticipated increase in seat
capacity.''
	   Without the discount, one-way economy tickets to Manila rose to
810 Singapore dollars (dlrs 480) from about 400 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 237), while round-trip airfare shot up to 1,206 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 714) from a previous level of about 650 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 385).
	   The discounted fares for Filipino maids were reinstated last
week only a day after they were scrapped.
	   Singapore Airlines applied to Philippine civil aviation
authorities last week for increased capacity on the Manila route _
either more flights or use of larger aircraft.
	   ``If approval is granted, the additional capacity will be
available by the end of October,'' the Tuesday statement added.

	   The toll is in addition to the 262 soldiers whose bodies the
military said it recovered itself in battles for a strategic
highway that began Sunday. The military said it killed 477 rebels
in the fighting.
	   The military has waged a bitter and costly yearlong battle for
the highway linking Colombo the government-held northern town of
Jaffna.
	   Since May last year, government forces have wrested control of
two-thirds of the highway from the guerrillas. Complete control
would open a land route to the Jaffna peninsula, a former rebel
stronghold in the north that the army captured two years ago.
	   The government is relying on expensive air and sea deliveries of
food and other commodities to Jaffna's half-million residents in
the absence of a road link.
	   Military officials said Wednesday that their troops captured the
Mankulam, a town on the highway 245 kilometers (150 miles) north of
Colombo. But at the northern end of the highway at Kilinochchi 35
kilometers (21 miles) north of Mankulam, fighting continued.
	   The rebels stormed Kilinochchi on Sunday and on Tuesday claimed
to have captured it and the town of Paranthan further north. The
government says it still controls parts of the towns.

Schroeder: 'No problem' with Greens leader as foreign minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder said in
an interview published Wednesday that he sees ``no problem'' in
appointing Greens leader Joschka Fisher as foreign minister,
despite his radical past.
	   Schroeder told Die Woche newspaper that Fischer, once a
self-described ``professional revolutionary'' as part of the
leftist student movement in the 1960s and '70s, has since developed
into ``an unusually rational political man.
	   ``And in the face of the fact that this development process went
amazingly fast, I see no problem'' with him as foreign minister,
Schroeder said.
	   The Social Democratic chancellor-to-be was less clear about
another controversial figure that he has invited to join his
Cabinet.
	   The non-partisan computer entrepreneur Jost Stollmann served
during the campaign as shadow economic minister, often angering
traditional Social Democrats with his calls for cuts in the social
welfare state.
	   Schroeder said Stollmann would certainly be part of his
government, ``but its structure will be determined after we clear
up the questions of content in the coalition talks.''
	   The Social Democrats, the strongest party after Sunday's
election, open coalition talks with the ecology-minded Greens on
Friday.
	   Schroeder was visiting Paris on Wednesday _ a trip meant to
stress that German foreign policy will remain stable when he
officially takes over from Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   The new government's defense policies could first be tested on
the issue of German involvement in possible NATO strikes in the
Serb-ruled Yugoslav republic of Kosovo.
	   The outgoing Cabinet was to meet Wednesday to confirm Germany's
offer to offer 14 fighter planes to participate in possible NATO
air strikes. The offer requires no parliamentary action but German
participation in NATO strikes would require lawmakers' approval.
	   That would fall to the outgoing parliament if the decision came
before the new legislature is confirmed.

Amnesty International, U.S. slam Malaysia over police brutality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS three grafs after the 12th to UPDATE with key players in
Anwar case appealing their conviction. ADDS Mahathir's comment &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Amnesty International has called
for an investigation into allegations of police brutality against
detained opposition activists, including ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim. The U.S. State Department also expressed
displeasure.
	   ``Anwar's treatment at the hands of the police shows the
government's blatant disregard for basic human rights,'' said a
statement from the London-based rights group, issued late Tuesday.
	   Making his first appearance in court Tuesday, Anwar said that
after his arrest on Sept. 20, he was led handcuffed and blindfolded
to a police lockup where he was greeted with a punch that knocked
him unconscious.
	   Anwar also said his left eye was so swollen that he could not
use it for two days after the beating. The eye was still bruised
when he appeared in court.
	   ``We are deeply concerned as well by reports of police brutality
during the incarceration of Anwar,'' said a statement, also late
Tuesday, by deputy State Department spokesman James Foley.
	   Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth called in Malaysia's
acting ambassador to Washington to convey U.S. concerns, Foley
said.
	   Malaysian police said they would investigate. Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Anwar may have inflicted the injury himself
to gain public sympathy.
	   On Wednesday, Anwar pleaded innocent to a 10th charge _ of
committing an illegal sexual act _ in a suburban Kuala Lumpur
courthouse.
	   Several hundred riot police surrounded the courthouse to keep
out crowds who had gathered to get a glimpse of Anwar after reading
newspaper accounts of his injuries.
	   But few got to see the 51-year-old politician, who was driven to
the courthouse in a vehicle with tinted windows and hustled into
the courtroom through a back entrance.
	   On Tuesday, Anwar was charged formally on five counts of
corruption during his tenure as deputy prime minister and finance
minister and on four counts of illegal sex. Homosexual acts are
illegal in Islamic Malaysia.
	   Anwar pleaded innocent to all nine charges on Tuesday. A trial
is likely to begin soon in the High Court.
	   The case against Anwar received a setback when two men convicted
of allowing him to sodomize them appealed their convictions to the
High Court.
	   The charges against Anwar hinge largely on the confessions the
two purportedly gave about the alleged sex acts with him.
	   Munawar Anees, 51, Anwar's former speechwriter, and Sukma
Dermawan, 37, Anwar's adopted brother, filed their appeals Tuesday.
Both are serving six-month sentences.
	   Since firing Anwar on Sept. 2, Mahathir has cracked down on
political critics. Apart from Anwar, 17 others have been arrested
under the harsh Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite
imprisonment without trial.
	   Anwar was arrested after he led a huge rally that demanded
Mahathir's resignation. Kuala Lumpur has been convulsed with
regular pro-Anwar protests since his arrest.
	   To block a potential protest near the courthouse, police also
stationed a water cannon and prevented people from gathering in
groups.
	   While the government has tried to keep public attention focused
on the allegations of homosexuality against Anwar, escalating
political protests and Tuesday's complaints of police brutality
have taken center stage.
	   ``I was hit very hard on the left part of my neck and slapped
left and right until blood flowed down my nose,'' Anwar told the
court.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, followed her husband back to the
federal police headquarters, where an eye doctor determined that
his retina wasn't permanently damaged.
	   ``When I first saw him, I was shocked and stunned,'' said
Azizah, an eye specialist herself who gave up her practice years
ago to take care of their six children. ``After all he's been
through, his spirit is very strong and I'm proud of that.''

Red Cross collects bodies of 600 soldiers from Sri Lankan rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Red Cross collected the bodies of
600 soldiers from rebels Wednesday after the heaviest fighting this
year in Sri Lanka's intractable ethnic war. Those dead bring the
military's toll to 862, the worst it has suffered in two years.
	   Red Cross spokesman Harsha Gunawardene said the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam handed over the bodies at Mallavi, 40
kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Kilinochchi, a key town where
fighting reportedly continued. Gunawardene spoke by telephone from
the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo to The Associated Press in New
Delhi, capital of neighboring India.
	   The toll is in addition to the 262 soldiers whose bodies the
military said it recovered itself in battles for a strategic
highway that began Sunday. The military said it killed 477 rebels
in the fighting.
	   The military has not seen such casualties since 1996, when 1,240
soldiers were killed when rebels overran a garrison at Mullaittivu,
about 280 kilometers (175 miles) north of Colombo.
	   The military has waged a bitter and costly yearlong battle for
the highway linking Colombo to the government-held northern town of
Jaffna.
	   Since May last year, government forces have wrested control of
two-thirds of the highway from the guerrillas. Complete control
would open a land route to the Jaffna peninsula, a former rebel
stronghold in the north that the army captured two years ago.
	   The government is relying on expensive air and sea deliveries of
food and other commodities to Jaffna's half-million residents in
the absence of a road link.
	   Military officials said Wednesday that their troops captured
Mankulam, a town on the highway 245 kilometers (150 miles) north of
Colombo. But at the northern end of the highway at Kilinochchi, 35
kilometers (21 miles) north of Mankulam, fighting continued.
	   The rebels stormed Kilinochchi Sunday and on Tuesday claimed to
have captured it and the town of Paranthan further north. The
government says it still controls parts of the towns.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that they are
widely discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control
the government and the military.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed since the fighting
began in 1983.

Russian official kidnapped in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A member of the Russian government mission in
Chechnya has been kidnapped in the breakaway southern territory,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Akmal Saidov, a bureaucrat at the mission, was kidnapped after
attending a public rally Tuesday in the Chechen capital Grozny, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The head of Russian mission, Georgy Kurin, said the kidnapping
had apparently been motivated by ransom. Kurin said he had informed
the Chechen authorities about the kidnapping, the report said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov,
was kidnapped five months ago and remains missing.
	   Earlier this month, two British charity workers were released
following 14 months of captivity. British officials said they had
paid no ransom.
	   Hundreds of Russian and foreign citizens have been abducted by
gangs seeking ransom since the 1994-1996 independence war with
Russia, and dozens remain held.
	   Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov's government has been
unable to stem kidnappings that have become a steady business for
some criminal gangs.
	   Earlier this week, Maskhadov pledged to stop abductions by
carrying out public executions of kidnappers.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian troops left two years ago. Moscow says
that Chechnya remains part of Russia but has no control over its
affairs.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's prime-minister designate,
taking over after his predecessor resigned following weeks of
protests, now faces the difficult task of building a coalition
government.
	   The ruling Socialist Party nominated its 30-year-old general
secretary, Pandeli Majko, to replace Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
Late Tuesday, President Rexhep Mejdani asked Majko to try and form
a new government. Majko was expected to start negotiations with
other parties Wednesday on forming a coalition.
	   Nano submitted his resignation as prime minister on Monday, and
his bitter rival, ex-President Sali Berisha on Tuesday demanded new
elections. At the same time Berisha urged supporters to cooperate
with a new government in his most moderate comments in weeks.
	   Under Albanian law, Nano remains caretaker prime minister until
Parliament approves his successor and his Cabinet. The Socialists
hold 108 of the 155 seats.

Kia Motors announces schedule for third auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two U.S. and three South Korean auto
companies have been invited to enter a new round of bidding for
bankrupt Kia Motors Corp., Kia officials said Wednesday.
	   The successful bidder, to be announced Oct. 19, will be chosen
among Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. of the United States
and Hyundai Motor Co., Samsung Motors Corp. and Daewoo Motor Co. of
South Korea, they said.
	   Following two failed auctions, Kia's creditor banks have said
they plan to sweeten the terms of the third, presumably by
swallowing more of its debt.
	   Kia's creditor banks will provide the five companies with new
auction terms by Friday, the officials said. Potential buyers must
submit their bids by Oct. 12.
	   General Motors was invited but did not take part in two previous
auctions. Ford participated in the first auction but withdrew from
the second, saying that Kia's debts were too much for it to handle.
	   While terms of the next auction have not been made public,
President Kim Dae-jung, commenting on the issue at a news
conference Monday, said he understood measures were being taken to
make the third auction successful.
	   The state-controlled Korea Development Bank is Kia's largest
creditor. Various news media said creditor banks have agreed to
write off up to dlrs 3.2 billion of Kia's dlrs 8.4 billion debt.
	   The banks had earlier agreed to write off dlrs 2.1 billion, but
that didn't satisfy potential buyers who wanted further debt
reductions.
	   The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure its battered economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout
from the International Monetary Fund. Kia's collapse last year
helped erode investor confidence in South Korea's industries,
leading to a flight of capital.

Nothing found of Sri Lankan plane missing with 55 people

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Military planes and naval gunboats
searched Wednesday for a passenger plane which is believed to have
crashed into the Indian Ocean off war-torn northern Sri Lanka with
55 people on board, officials said.
	   The Lionair Antonov-24 disappeared minutes after taking off from
Palali airport in Jaffna, on the northern tip of this Indian Ocean
island, Tuesday afternoon. The plane had fuel for two hours; the
flight to the capital takes less than an hour.
	   Lionair and the other commercial airline serving Jaffna, Monara
Air, suspended their four daily flights from Colombo after the
Lionair plane disappeared.
	   There was no distress signal from the seven-member crew,
officials said. Four of the crew were Russian, they said,
correcting earlier reports only two were Russian. All others aboard
were Sri Lankan.
	   ``We have little hope,'' said Selvarani Ponnathurai, whose
cousin Ravi Ragunathan, a government health inspector, was on the
plane, returning from a visit to his parents in Jaffna.
	   The search is being conducted between Jaffna and Mannar island
80 kilometers (50 miles) to the south. The government has no radar
coverage of the area, which is mostly controlled by ethnic Tamil
secessionists. The planes' normal flight path is over the sea just
along the coast, past areas held by rebels.
	   Officials didn't immediately know whether the plane had crashed
or was downed by rebels who have been fighting since 1983. The
guerrillas, who have used shoulder-fired missiles to bring down
military aircraft, have not targeted civilian airliners since
blowing up an Air Lanka plane on the ground at Colombo airport in
1983.
	   Two weeks ago, both Lionair and Monara Air received unsigned
letters saying their planes would be attacked if service did not
cease. Monara stopped flights for two days, but then decided to
resume.
	   Though the letters were anonymous, suspicion fell on the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam separatists, who have tried to
sabotage attempts to restore normalcy on Jaffna.
	   Earlier this month, the rebels were blamed for a bombing that
killed the new mayor of Jaffna city, the main city on the
peninsula, along with its military and police commanders.
	   Just a few months before the bombing, the previous Jaffna mayor
was shot and killed while she met with residents. That attack also
was blamed on the Tigers.
	   The Tigers seized Jaffna in 1990 and proclaimed a government for
the more than 1 million people who live in northern Sri Lanka,
where Tamils predominate. Sri Lanka's army retook the city in 1995
after a bitter 50-day offensive.
	   Jaffna is linked to the rest of Sri Lanka only by air and sea
because of fighting between the army and secessionist ethnic Tamils
along the land route.

FDA approves implanted heart pumps to help patients await
</HEADLINE>
transplants &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ People who desperately need a heart transplant
won new help: The government approved a pair of battery-powered
heart pumps that can help them survive the wait for a transplant at
home instead of in a hospital bed.
	   Until now, patients with advanced heart failure were tethered to
machines inside a hospital that mechanically pump the heart until
doctors find an appropriate donor heart _ or until the machines
fail.
	   The new implantable pumps, made by Baxter Inc. and Thermo
CardioSystems Inc., let the patients do their waiting at home. They
worked so well that some patients who had been within days of death
recovered enough to return to work or other normal activities.
	   Among them is Jeff Abner of Beaver Dam, Kentucky, who was dying
of a combination of congestive heart failure and irregular
heartbeat. ``I was flat-lined,'' Abner recalled of the day doctors
implanted Baxter's Novacor heart pump in a last-ditch attempt to
revive his heart.
	   Three weeks later, the pump was working well enough that Abner
left the hospital. That was two years ago, and today Abner
regularly goes hunting and fishing while awaiting the donor heart
he still needs but that so far hasn't been found.
	   ``I would have died and instead I'm out running around having a
good time,'' Abner said in a telephone interview, his heart pump
rhythmically clicking in the background. ``It's life to me and I'm
just tickled to death to have it.''
	   Implanting the pump helps patients ``live better,'' said Dr.
Eric Rose of New York Presbyterian Hospital, who tested TCI's
HeartMate pump. One of his patients went snowboarding with the pump
before having a successful transplant.
	   The temporary pumps, known as ``ventricular assist devices,''
will give hundreds awaiting a transplant a better quality life, and
save money because these patients won't need to be hospitalized,
Kormos said. Also, doctors now are studying if the pumps might
eventually offer a long-term alternative to transplants.
	   The implanted pumps temporarily do the diseased heart's work,
doubling the chances that a patient lives long enough to receive a
donor heart, said Dr. Susan Alpert, the Food and Drug
Administration's device evaluation chief, on Tuesday.
	   But the pumps are only for patients at risk of imminent death,
because they also can cause serious side effects, she warned. They
require major surgery and can cause blood infections, blood clots,
even strokes.
	   The small devices are implanted into the abdomen and connected
up to the heart's left ventricle, its main pumping chamber. The
artificial pump moves blood through the body, powered by a battery
pack worn at the patient's waist or shoulder.
	   Baxter implanted its Novacor pump into 104 patients.
Seventy-eight percent survived long enough to get a transplant, and
after the transplant 67 percent were alive a month later. Among 35
equally sick patients who didn't get an implanted pump, just 37
percent survived to transplant and 34 percent were alive a month
after the surgery.
	   TCI compared its implanted HeartMate to the in-hospital pump now
used and concluded that both in-hospital and at-home versions
worked equally well, Alpert said.
	   The two pumps are very similar, but have not been directly
compared. So Alpert stressed that there's no way to say which pump
is better for each patient, although significantly more Novacor
patients did suffer a blood clot.
	   TCI said its HeartMate implant will cost dlrs 60,000; Baxter
hasn't determined a U.S. price, but sells the machine in Europe for
about dlrs 75,000.

Philippine Airlines workers postpone vote on recovery plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines workers postponed
voting Wednesday on a management-proposed plan aimed at putting the
closed national flag-carrier back in business, the workers' union
said.
	   The debt-laden airline, Asia's oldest, closed on Sept. 23 after
failing to persuade its ground crew union to accept the rescue
plan. Its closure left much of the Philippines without air service.
	   Leaders of PAL's largest union approved the plan Monday after
accepting a 10-year suspension of the union's collective bargaining
agreement in exchange for 20 percent of the company's stock and
other benefits.
	   The agreement must still be formally approved by workers,
regulators and PAL's creditors.
	   Avelino Capili, a board member of the PAL Employees Association,
said they would put the rescue plan to a vote among its nearly
7,000 members by secret ballot Thursday or Friday. Union leaders
initially planned a signature campaign to ratify the plan.
	   Capili said the union needed to print ballots and confer with
government labor officials, whom they want to oversee the voting.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with many militant
members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreement would
violate workers' rights and expose them to management abuses.
	   Hundreds of workers opposed to the plan protested Tuesday,
urging President Joseph Estrada to allow a government takeover of
PAL.
	   Estrada says the government cannot do that because there is no
money in public coffers to underwrite daily losses of up to 45
million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.
	   Under the recovery plan, PAL has guaranteed continued
recognition of the union, said union president Alex Barrientos.
	   Estrada urged the workers to ratify the agreement, saying their
share holdings could earn profit when the airline's financial
condition improves.
	   PAL has been ravaged by strikes and Asia's currency crisis. It
says creditors have insisted on the bargaining agreement suspension
before they will accept a restructuring of the company's finances.
	   Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4
billion modernization program, greatly inflating the amount of
money it must repay to overseas creditors. The airline is saddled
with an estimated dlrs 2.1 billion debt.
	   Two foreign carriers, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Dragon
Airlines, have been enlisted by the government to fly certain
domestic routes to help fill the vacuum left by PAL's closure.

Cambodian `prisoner of conscience' receives royal pardon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos PHN101-102 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A Cambodian opposition figure
convicted of murdering co-Prime Minister Hun Sen's brother-in-law
was released from prison Wednesday after receiving a pardon from
King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   Srun Vong Vannak, security chief for opposition party leader Sam
Rainsy, proclaimed his innocence outside the prison and thanked
Sihanouk for issuing the royal pardon.
	   ``I am very happy as the king has a very kind heart for his
subjects,'' said Vannak, who served about a year in prison.
	   ``I have done nothing wrong to my nation,'' he said.
	   Surrounded by family members and opposition party activists,
Vannak added that he would continue his political activities with
the Sam Rainsy Party, the smaller of two opposition parties in
parliament.
	   Sihanouk pardoned Vannak last week for his conviction in the
1996 killing of Kov Samuth, a national police official and Hun
Sen's brother-in-law.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International has called Vannak a
prisoner of conscience, charging he was detained ``solely for his
peaceful political affiliation and wrongly convicted on politically
motivated criminal charges.''
	   The king granted the pardon after receiving Hun Sen's approval
last week during a meeting of rival party leaders. In the past,
Sihanouk has granted politically sensitive pardons only with the
express agreement of the country's political leadership.
	   Vannak was arrested without a warrant in February 1997 and held
incommunicado for more than two weeks, during which police
extracted a murder confession. He disavowed it in court.
	   Two other men charged and convicted in the case, whose testimony
was instrumental to Vannak's conviction, recanted shortly after the
trial. They told human rights groups in letters from prison that
their confessions had been made under duress.
	   Those two were not covered by the pardon.
	   Vannak's release comes amid continuing negotiations between Hun
Sen's ruling party and the opposition to form a new government
following July 26 parliamentary elections.
	   The two sides expressed optimism Tuesday that negotiations would
continue to proceed smoothly.

Ukraine to buy more gas from Russia this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine plans to buy an additional 5
billion cubic meters (175 billion cubic feet) of gas from Russia
this year to meet its needs, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Ukraine's government plans to pay for half of the gas in cash,
while the form of payment for the other half is under
consideration, said Ihor Bakai, head of Ukraine's oil and gas
monopoly, Naftogaz Ukrainy, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Bakai said the Russian firm Gazprom has already agreed to sell
the gas to Ukraine, which is priced at dlrs 80 per 1,000 cubic
meters (35,000 cubic feet).
	   Ukraine needs the gas by the end of the year or else it would
have to suspend supplies to enterprises throughout the country,
Bakai said.
	   Ukraine, the world's sixth largest country in terms of gas
consumption, imports about 70 percent of its supply from Russia.
	   Ukraine's mounting gas debt to Russia has prompted tension
between the two countries. Ukrainian officials have put the current
debt to Gazprom at dlrs 640 million. The government owes about dlrs
500 million and private traders owe the rest.

Albright not planning to change job, newspaper says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel got
an answer Wednesday to his unusual suggestion that Madeleine
Albright succeed him when his term is over: No, thank you, she
replied.
	   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted Lee McClenny, a State
Department spokesman, as saying Albright prefers to keep her job as
U.S. secretary of state.
	   ``Madeleine Albright said it clear,'' McClenny said. ``She was
very pleased by the offer, but she already has a job she likes very
much and she's not looking for another job.''
	   Last week, Havel mentioned the Czech-born Albright among those
who could succeed him someday as Czech president.
	   He said, however, he hasn't had a chance to discuss his proposal
with Albright as the idea occurred to him on a plane on his way
back from an official visit to the United States.
	   ``I think that Madeleine Albright is an excellent state
secretary, but I'm not sure she would be equally excellent as the
president of the Czech Republic,'' Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted
McClenny as saying.

Tokyo stocks nosedive when government skips market boost
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with quotes; UPDATES with latest bond, dollar-yen
rate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index plummeted 3
percent to its lowest level in 12 years Wednesday when an expected
injection of public funds to shore up the market failed to
materialize.
	   The U.S. dollar gained against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 415.04
points, closing at 13,406.39, the lowest finish since 13,394.31 on
Feb. 21, 1986.
	   On Tuesday, the Nikkei index had slipped 87.94 points, or 0.63
percent.
	   The market opened higher on hopes that the government, via
public fund buying, would push share prices higher to help the
balance sheets of companies as they close their books for the
fiscal half on Wednesday.
	   But when the public fund buying didn't materialize, prices
dropped sharply in the last 30 minutes of trading.
	   ``Players had been expecting that public fund buying would
support the market, but when that didn't happen they had to cut
their losses,'' said Hideyuki Okoshi, a manager at Chuo Securities.
	   ``Everybody panicked,'' said Louis Tseng, head of derivatives at
Jardine Fleming Securities. He said the market remained vulnerable
to a further drop.
	   Since the close of the latest fiscal year on March 31, the
benchmark average has fallen 19 percent. The market gauge finished
last fiscal year at 16,527.17 and ended the 1997 trading year at
15,258.22.
	   Also weighing on the market was the announcement that Moody's
Investors Service had cut the debt rating of Nomura Securities Co.,
Japan's top brokerage and one of the world's largest.
	   The move was the latest in a series of rating downgrades for
Japanese companies. Moody's cut Nomura's long- and short-term debt
ratings and its Bank Financial Strength Rating.
	   The rating agency cited losses in Nomura's international
operations and its domestic troubles in the midst of Japan's worst
recession since the end of World War II.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was also down 19.33 points, or 1.82 percent, to
1,043.57. It had fallen 0.62 points, or 0.06 percent, the previous
day.
	   The drop in stock prices quickly eclipsed any buoying effect
from a U.S. interest rate cut Tuesday, which had been expected to
boost markets by cushioning the U.S. economy from global economic
turmoil and revive other slumping economies.
	   On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the benchmark
federal funds rate to 5.25 percent from 5.50 percent _ a move
widely expected after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted at it
recently.
	   But the Fed action was seen as largely insufficient, eventually
sending U.S. stocks _ and then the dollar _ lower. Lower interest
rates tend to make a nation's currency less attractive to
investors.
	   The dollar recovered in Tokyo trading Wednesday, however,
hitting 135.72 yen at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT), up 1.30 yen from late
Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of 134.45
yen overnight.
	   On Wall Street Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average, which
was up 15 points as Fed officials concluded their meeting, dropped
28.32 points _ or 0.3 percent _ closing at 8,080.52.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell Wednesday to 0.765 percent from Tuesday's finish of 0.805
percent, driving its price up to 109.35 yen from 108.96 yen.
	   The government changed the benchmark bond from No. 182 because
of the increased trading volume of No. 203.

Old German Cabinet meets on offer for NATO air strikes in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with Cabinet in session. Trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's outgoing Cabinet met Wednesday to
confirm an offer for 14 fighter planes to participate in possible
NATO air strikes in Kosovo.
	   It was expected to be the last major decision by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's government, which was voted out of office after 16
years in Sunday's election.
	   NATO officials asked all member states for such a commitment to
raise the pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to seek
a settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
	   But even if NATO members commit to air strikes, a NATO
ratification of the plan is needed first.
	   That means approval of the actual deployment could fall to the
new government being formed by Social Democratic chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder.
	   The Social Democrats and their likely coalition partner, the
Greens, have said they want a U.N. mandate for NATO strikes before
allowing the Tornado fighters to take off.
	   However, the parties have left unclear how explicit the U.N.
mandate must be.
	   NATO has formally queried member states about whether and how
they would support possible air strikes against Serb positions in
Kosovo.
	   Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are ethnic
Albanians, who seek independence from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and about 275,000 have fled
their homes since Milosevic's forces began cracking down on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo in February.
	   Whether the old Cabinet and old parliament decide on Germany's
participation depends on how quickly NATO acts. At the earliest,
the new parliament may be constituted by Oct. 20. If NATO decides
before then, the old parliament could call a special session to
vote on participation.
	   However, Social Democratic foreign policy expert Guenter
Verheugen said he didn't expect any quick decisions on NATO air
strikes in the next few weeks, because the political, legal and
military situation wasn't right for it.
	   Even within the old Cabinet, there were differences on whether a
U.N. mandate would be needed for NATO air strikes. While outgoing
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel insisted it was, Defense Minister
Volker Ruehe has said he could foresee a NATO decision sufficing in
a humanitarian emergency.

Indonesian military, New Guinea rebels agree on cease-fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The military and a small separatist
group fighting Indonesian rule in western New Guinea have agreed on
a cease-fire in the former Dutch colony, the official Antara news
agency reported Wednesday.
	   The truce, thought to be the first in the long-running conflict,
started Tuesday and is based on a proposal from Mathias Wenda,
commander of the rebel Free Papua Movement, or OPM, Antara said.
	   Both sides have agreed to stop fighting so that negotiations for
possible peace talks can be launched.
	   Antara quoted regional military chief Maj. Gen. Amir Sembiring
as saying the military would allow OPM fighters to move around the
province freely as long as they wear civilian clothes and do not
carry weapons.
	   Indonesia took over the former Dutch colony of western New
Guinea in 1963 and renamed it the province of Irian Jaya.
	   Indonesian sovereignty was formalized in 1969 after a
U.N.-supervised ballot there favored incorporation with the rest of
Indonesia, itself a former Dutch colony.
	   Despite this, small bands of guerrillas have fought a low-key
war against Indonesian troops over the decades.
	   Calls for independence have grown in recent weeks following the
resignation in May of autocratic ex-President Suharto.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has relaxed controls
against protests as part of a wide-ranging reform agenda.

Aide to Russian lawmaker dies in apparent contract killing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian businessman, who also worked as a
legislative aide, has been killed in his apartment in St.
Petersburg, officials said Wednesday.
	   Viktor Smirnov, 49, died Tuesday from a rifle shot to the head,
in what appeared to be a contract murder, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported, quoting the local police.
	   Smirnov also worked as an aide to Mikhail Monastyrsky, a member
of the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party faction in the
parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   The party, led by flamboyant Vladimir Zhirinovsky, has provided
such credentials to scores of businessmen, who covet them because
they believe it will help in their business activities.
	   The aides are unpaid, and do little work for the party, but the
credentials give them easy access to all government offices
throughout the country.
	   However, of number of the aides have been killed in contract
killings that appear linked to their business dealings, rather than
their political work.
	   In St. Petersburg, two aides to members of Zhirinovsky's faction
have been killed this year. Several were killed in Moscow last
year.
	   The Russian media has claimed that Zhirinovsky's faction sells
the credentials to businessmen as a source of income.

Leakey to resign parliamentary seat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Anthropologist Richard Leakey must resign
from Parliament because he was appointed to his second stint as
director of the troubled Kenya Wildlife Service, his party said
Wednesday.
	   President Daniel arap Moi last week chose Leakey to lead the
service, which is responsible for Kenya's wildlife, the mainstay of
the country's tourism industry, which is its third-largest earner
of foreign currency.
	   Leakey was named to Parliament for Safina after December's
elections. Safina Secretary-General Mwandawiro Mghanga said the
constitution does not allow the head of a public institution to
also serve as a member of Parliament.
	   The opposition party, which Leakey helped to found, will name
Leakey's replacement later this week, Mghanga said.
	   Leakey, who last week said the wildlife service was ``completely
broke'' and could not do its work, pledged to reduce the service's
deficit, which he estimated at dlrs 8 million for last year.
	   During his previous stint as director, Leakey was known as a
skilled international fund-raiser. The United States on Wednesday
provided dlrs 2 million in funding for the service.
	   Leakey replaces David Western, who was dismissed last week after
a four-year term.
	   Leakey was forced to quit the same job in 1994 after attacks by
politicians close to Moi. The president has described Leakey as
``arrogant and racist'' and not a Kenyan.
	   Leakey is a third-generation Kenyan of British origin whose
grandfather came to Kenya as a missionary in 1902. His parents,
Louis B. and Mary Leakey, did pioneering research that located the
origins of humanity in East Africa.

Hundreds protest in East Timor for release of political prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of East Timorese protested
Wednesday, demanding that the Indonesian government release all
political prisoners from the former Portuguese colony including
separatist guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao.
	   The demonstrators protested in front of a prison in Baucau, 100
kilometers (60 miles) east of the territorial capital, Dili.
	   Police said the protest broke up peacefully after an hour.
	   Gusmao was arrested in 1992 and is serving a 20-year term in
Jakarta's Cipinang penitentiary.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has released dozens of East
Timorese prisoners since he replaced authoritarian former leader
Suharto in May.
	   However, at least 89 political prisoners are still behind bars
in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony invaded by Indonesia in
1975.
	   Other East Timorese prisoners have been jailed in other parts of
Indonesia.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976.
	   While the United Nations does not recognize Jakarta's claim of
sovereignty, it is brokering talks between Indonesia and Portugal
over the future of the half-island territory.
	   Habibie has offered to grant a measure of autonomy to East Timor
and to release Gusmao along with other political prisoners in
return for international recognition that East Timor is part of
Indonesia.
	   Two weeks ago, prisoners in Dili's prison staged a hunger strike
and demanded that they be released.

Brewery director killed in eastern Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The director of a large brewery in eastern
Ukraine was shot dead at the door of his apartment, news reports
said Wednesday.
	   Three unknown assailants attacked Yuriy Pavlenko, 37, when he
was about to open the door of his apartment in the city of Donetsk,
the daily Fakty said. He was beaten and then shot four times when
he tried to escape, the report said.
	   Pavlenko's wife, who ran out of the apartment to help her
husband, was knocked unconscious, but survived, the newspaper
added.
	   Police declined to comment on the case, but the Ukrainian media
speculated that the killing might have been related to business
disputes at the brewery.

Japan's oldest lesser panda dies at age 16
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Pang Pang, the oldest lesser panda in Japan, has
died of old age, a zoo official said Wednesday.
	   The 16-year-old female, who gave birth to three cubs during her
lifetime, died Monday evening, said Miyako Nakata of the Nishiyama
Zoo in Sabae, a town 324 kilometers (200 miles) west of Tokyo.
	   Pang Pang was old by lesser panda standards. The average life
expectancy for her species is 12 years, Nakata said.
	   Reddish brown with white spots on the cheeks and nose, and with
a long tail, the lesser panda is far less striking in appearance
than its larger relative, the black-and-white giant panda.
	   Lesser pandas weigh about 6 kilograms (13 pounds), one-tenth the
size of the better known giant pandas.
	   Both species of panda are found in the wild in China and the
Himalayan mountains.
	   Nakata said the exact cause of Pang Pang's death will be
determined later by autopsy.
	   Pang Pang was presented to Japan by the Beijing zoo in 1982, and
has been kept at the Nishiyama zoo since its opening in 1985.
	   Nakata said Pang Pang first showed signs of losing her appetite
in early August. She was unable to stand up Monday afternoon
without losing her breath, he added.
	   About half the lesser pandas in captivity are in Japanese zoos,
Nakata said, adding that many of those came from vigorous breeding
programs at Japanese zoos over the last 10 years.
	   There now are about 220 lesser pandas at 46 zoos in Japan,
Nakata said.

 &UR; Japan to propose dlrs 30 billion aid package for Asia

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
Wednesday he will propose a plan for Japan to spend about dlrs 30
billion to aid Southeast Asian countries at the Group of Seven
meeting this weekend.
	   His plan envisages the Export-Import Bank of Japan guaranteeing
debts to and buying government bonds of the Asian countries,
Miyazawa said at a regular news conference.
	   The meeting of finance ministers from the G-7 nations _ the
United States, Japan, Germany, Italy, England, Canada and France _
is to begin Saturday in Washington.
	   Countries throughout Asia have been hit hard by a financial
crisis that has deeply eroded the values of many regional
currencies. Japan, though itself in recession, has been called on
to do more to lead the region to recovery.

Cambodian government says no plans to question opposition leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ In an apparent move to ease
political tensions, the government said Wednesday there were no
plans to summon junior opposition party leader Sam Rainsy for
questioning about recent turmoil.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen has publicly threatened Sam Rainsy with
arrest at least twice for his role in anti-government
demonstrations that followed Hun Sen's narrow victory in July 26
parliamentary elections. He also accused the outspoken politician
of being behind a mysterious grenade attack on his home, which hurt
no one and caused little damage.
	   Fearing arrest or assassination, Sam Rainsy took refuge in a
United Nations office in Phnom Penh for slightly more than a week
in early September. He emerged to take part in a meeting of
government and opposition leaders, and to be sworn in with other
members of parliament last Thursday.
	   Sam Rainsy and senior opposition party leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh have claimed that the ruling party used fraud and
intimidation to win the elections.
	   Responding to what it called rumors intended to ``pollute the
political climate,'' the Information Ministry said Wednesday that
``at the present time ... the court has no plans to summon His
Excellency Sam Rainsy to appear before it.''
	   The government statement came after Cambodia's three main
political parties expressed optimism Tuesday at a negotiating
session aimed at forming a new government.
	   Hun Sen's party captured 64 of 122 seats in parliament in the
election, but not the two-thirds needed to form a government on its
own.
	   The government used two alleged attempts on Hun's Sen's life _
the grenade incident and an equally mysterious rocket attack on his
convoy last Thursday _ as an excuse to put pressure the opposition,
which had once threatened to boycott parliament.
	   It imposed a ban on foreign travel for elected opposition
lawmakers and also pointedly noted that if opposition members did
not attend the convening of parliament, they would lose their
parliamentary immunity from arrest.
	   The foreign travel ban was lifted after the opposition attended
the ceremonial opening of parliament last week.
	   Both Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy tested their freedom of movement
after parliament convened with a trip to Bangkok. Neither has
returned amid fears that arrests were still planned against
opposition leaders if negotiations did not proceed smoothly.
	   Hun Sen has claimed several plots on his life in recent years,
and usually cracked down on his opponents in their aftermath.

Two mid-size Japanese brokerages announce merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two medium-size Japanese brokerages said Wednesday
they had agreed to merge, forming the latest corporate alliance
aimed at surviving changes sweeping Japan's finance industry.
	   National Securities Co. and Meiko Securities Co. decided to
combine operations by next April 1, company officials said at a
news conference.
	   Under the agreement, shareholders will receive two shares of
National for every one of Meiko they now hold.
	   The merger comes as Tokyo embarks on an ambitious program to
revive its moribund financial markets by liberalizing stock trading
commissions and allowing new competition.
	   Many of Japan's largest finance companies, including industry
leader Nomura Securities Co. and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.,
the world's largest bank, have announced tie-ups with other
companies.
	   National, which has its headquarters in Tokyo, posted its
seventh straight loss last year, a pretax shortfall of 1.3 billion
yen (dlrs 9.6 million) on sales of 11.6 billion yen (dlrs 86
million).
	   Meiko, a member of the venerable Sumitomo industrial group, has
also failed to report a profit since 1991, the year after Tokyo
stock prices went into a long slide.
	   The Osaka-based brokerage reported a 465 million yen (dlrs 3.4
million) pretax loss in the year ended March 1998 on revenues of
10.3 billion yen (dlrs 76 million).
	   The new brokerage will have 39 branches, making it one of the
larger of Japan's mid-size securities houses, the newspaper Yomiuri
said.
	   Trade in shares of both companies was suspended before the
merger was announced. Meiko last traded unchanged at 127 yen, and
National rose 3 yen, or 3.9 percent, to 80 yen.

Police minister promises to track down attackers of Christians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's police minister has promised to
track down and punish those responsible for a growing number of
attacks on Christians under the country's new Hindu-nationalist-led
government, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Lal Krishna Advani, considered a hardliner in the
Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party that leads the governing
coalition, ordered officials to ensure the guilty were punished
immediately, The Economic Times reported him as saying.
	   He acted after meeting Tuesday with a delegation of Christians
led by Alan de Lastic, the Catholic archbishop of New Delhi and
president of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India.
	   The Hindustan Times reported that Advani called the attacks on
Christians ``outrageous.''
	   On Sept. 23, about 20 armed men broke into a convent in a remote
village in central India, dragged four nuns to farm fields nearby
and raped them. Three days later, armed men attacked a convent a
few kilometers (miles) outside the Indian capital and beat up a
group of nuns.
	   The BJP's sister organization, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad _ World
Hindu Council _ has issued strongly worded statements accusing
Christians of attacking Hinduism by trying to convert Indians. The
New Delhi chapter of the VHP reportedly described the recent
attacks on nuns as an understandable reaction by angry Hindu youth,
though the national VHP distanced itself from that statement and
condemned the rapes, The Economic Times said.
	   Both the BJP and the VHP are satellites of the Rashtriya
Swayamsevak Sangh, which says it is devoted to protecting India's
Hindu heritage. The BJP took over the government in March, ruling
with partners that include secular socialists.
	   John Dayal, spokesman for the All-India Catholic Union, a lay
group that has tracked attacks on Christians, says the atmosphere
has become increasingly intolerant under the BJP-led federal
government. He added local governments controlled by the BJP have
been slow to investigate attacks on Christians.
	   ``At a political level, the leadership of the BJP, the RSS and
the VHP must share blame'' for the attacks, Dayal told The
Associated Press. ``I indict them as a group.''
	   Most of India's 21 million Christians are Catholic. More than 80
percent of the country's nearly 1 billion people are Hindu.

Russia, Vietnam to sign oil refinery deal by Oct. 15
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian and Vietnamese firms will sign a contract
by Oct. 15 to build the first oil refinery in Vietnam, the Interfax
news agency reported Wednesday.
	   During talks in Hanoi last week, Russia's Zarubezhneft and
Vietnam's Petrovietnam agreed Russian companies will be used as
contractors to build part of the refinery, the report said.
	   The initial plan is for dlrs 65 million to be invested in 1998
as charter capital for the joint venture that will build and
operate the refinery. Overall capital investments in the project
are estimated at dlrs 1.3 billion.

Muslims stage anti-communist rally on Indonesian coup anniversary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo JAK101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Warning that communist-like forces
could be behind a rash of riots and protests, thousands of Muslims
staged a rally Wednesday on the 33rd anniversary of what the
government says was an abortive leftist coup.
	   Troops and police were deployed across the capital amid rumors
that anti-government protesters might take to the streets as the
country grapples with the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   However, the city of 11 million was quiet as red and white
Indonesian flags were flown at half-staff.
	   ``We want to show the public that we have to be careful about
the latent danger of communism. Today's situation is similar to the
situation in the 1960s,'' a rally organizer, Abdul Kadir, said
outside the Istiqlal Mosque, the biggest in Indonesia.
	   Sept. 30, 1965, was a bloody turning point in the history of the
sprawling Southeast Asian nation, which then too was in economic
turmoil.
	   Six army generals were executed and their bodies tossed down a
well on the outskirts of Jakarta. The military at the time blamed
communists for the murders and swiftly crushed what it said was a
coup attempt.
	   The operation was led by Suharto, a major general, who later
replaced Indonesia's founding President Sukarno as head of state.
	   Tens of thousands are said to have been slaughtered in a
backlash against leftists during the following months.
	   The burgeoning Indonesian Communist Party was decimated and
remains banned to this day.
	   Suharto led Indonesia for 32 authoritarian years, but was forced
to quit in May after about 1,200 people were killed in a wave of
riots and protests against him.
	   On Thursday, Suharto's successor President B.J. Habibie is to
lead an annual commemoration of the end of the coup attempt.
	   Since taking office, Habibie has been targeted by student
protesters who have demanded that he step down over his failure to
control soaring prices, growing unemployment and rising poverty.
	   There have also been outbreaks of looting and rioting in some
areas hit badly by the crisis.
	   Abdul Kadir said it was possible that some student protesters
had been manipulated by activists with communist leanings. Students
have rejected this.

Turkish court upholds prison sentence for second Islamic mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In another blow for Turkey's Islamic
movement, an appeals court on Wednesday upheld the sentence of a
second pro-Islamic mayor in two weeks.
	   Bekir Yildiz, mayor of Sincan, which is near Ankara, was
sentenced to four years and seven months in prison for inciting
religious hatred. The conviction stemmed from a Jan. 31, 1997 rally
in Sincan at which calls for Islamic rule were made.
	   Days after the rally, the military sent tanks rumbling through
the town's streets in a show of force reminding the country that it
remains the guarantor of Turkey's secular regime.
	   In upholding Yildiz' conviction, appeals court judge Demirel
Tavil ruled that the mayor and five codefendants belonged to an
illegal Islamic movement, Hezbollah, the Anatolia news agency said.
Hezbollah supports creating an Islamic regime in Turkey.
	   Yildiz has been in prison since his arrest in February 1997.
	   His is the second conviction of a mayor upheld for inciting
religious hatred through anti-secular activity. The convictions
mean neither man can run again for political office.
	   Another appeals court last week upheld a 10-month prison
sentence for Istanbul Mayor Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was seen as
the future leader of the pro-Islamic Virtue Party.
	   Virtue replaced the pro-Islamic Welfare Party, which the
Constitutional Court closed down in February for violating the
constitution's secular principle. Both mayors were elected on
Welfare's ticket.
	   The appeals court on Wednesday also upheld the convictions of
five of codefendants, who got sentences ranging from three to more
than 17 years in prison.. It overturned the convictions of another
five.

India shrugs off cancellation of Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new graf 3 with U.S. ambassador in Bangladesh
saying trip is off. &QL; 
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ With their nuclear dispute still
unresolved, Indians had stopped expecting a visit from Bill Clinton
that would have been the first by a U.S. president in 20 years,
analysts said Wednesday.
	   The Clinton administration on Tuesday came close to calling off
the trip, which had been tentatively scheduled for November. A
formal cancellation was expected this week.
	   In neighboring Bangladesh Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador John
Holzman told reporters Clinton had written Bangladeshi Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina to say he would be unable to visit in
November. Clinton was to have visited Bangladesh along with India
and Pakistan; Holzman said the entire South Asian tour would be put
off until next year.
	   The Indian foreign office said it would have no reaction until
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee returned Thursday from
France, where he is on a state visit.
	   In Washington, White House press secretary Mike McCurry,
speaking to reporters about reports that Clinton would drop India
and Pakistan from his itinerary, said: ``I don't have any reason to
dispute that.''
	   McCurry said Clinton would go ahead with his original plan to
attend an Asia Pacific Economic Conference meeting in Malaysia in
mid-November.
	   In New Delhi, former Foreign Secretary S.K. Singh said Clinton
could not have hoped to achieve much in India before the end of
talks on nuclear policy between Vajpayee's envoy Jaswant Singh and
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
	   ``We've known for months now that the negotiations between
Jaswant and Talbott will not be over soon and Clinton might not
wish to come before that,'' Singh said in an interview.
	   The United States wants India and Pakistan to sign an
international nuclear test ban treaty and end 50 years of rivalry.
Nuclear weapons tests by both countries in May raised fears of a
nuclear war in South Asia.
	   The Clinton visit was put on hold after the tests, and the
United States led several countries who slapped economic sanctions
on India and Pakistan. Indian officials have said in the past that
it would have been awkward for Clinton to visit while sanctions
were in place.
	   ``Had the events of May on both sides not occurred and the visit
(to New Delhi) had taken place, I think there would have been
major, major gains for India,'' said Surjit Mansingh, an
international relations expert at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru
University.
	   ``But the whole process got pushed back years, and until we
reach the same point again where there is a broad band of
agreement, what's the point?'' she said.
	   Jimmy Carter was the last American president to visit India in
1978. A planned trip by President George Bush was canceled because
of the Gulf War. U.S.-Indian relations have been strained chiefly
by nuclear differences, but American business has been pushing for
closer ties.
	   On Tuesday, U.S. lawmakers agreed to give Clinton power to lift
some sanctions against India and Pakistan, flexibility he had said
he needed in order to negotiate with the two countries about their
nuclear policy. But the provision is tacked onto an agriculture
bill whose passage into law is uncertain.
	   In an address to the opening session of the U.N. General
Assembly last week, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said his
country was ready to adhere to the test ban treaty if India did. In
his own speech to the General Assembly, Vajpayee indicated New
Delhi's willingness to sign the treaty by next year.

Ousted Central Bank chairman was drawing large salary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While Russia's economy crumbled, the head of the
Central Bank was receiving a salary worth dlrs 240,000 a year, far
larger than other government officials, including President Boris
Yeltsin, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Sergei Dubinin, who headed the Central Bank until he was ousted
last month, received a salary of 1.2 billion rubles (dlrs 240,000)
last year, the Moscow Times newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   By comparison, President Boris Yeltsin made dlrs 117,000 last
year, and most of that was from a book deal with Western
publishers. Yeltsin's official salary in 1996 was the equivalent of
dlrs 480 a month.
	   The report did not say why Dubinin's salary was so much larger
than those of other government officials. An average worker in
Russia makes around dlrs 300 a month.
	   Dubinin's salary ``is equivalent to the budget for two
departments of the State Tax Service, five prominent Moscow high
schools _ or 12 villages,'' the Novaya Gazeta newspaper said.
	   Dubinin was widely criticized for his handling of the Central
Bank. He was dismissed after Russia's economic crisis hit with full
force in mid-August.

Hong Kong share prices end moderately higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices closed moderately higher
Wednesday, but trading slowed to its lowest level in almost three
years as investors held back ahead of the long holiday weekend,
traders said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index gained 45.85 points, or 0.6
percent, closing at 7,883.46. The index had fallen 1.4 percent on
profit-taking Tuesday.
	   Trading volume dropped to 2.42 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 310 million), the lowest full-day volume since mid-December
1995. The previous low for this year was 2.62 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 335.9 million) on May 25.
	   Volume totaled 4.42 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 566
million) on Tuesday.
	   The key index slipped at the opening Wednesday as investors
shrugged off a much-expected interest rate cut in the United States
and continued taking profits after a 9.3 percent rise in the index
over six sessions before Tuesday.
	   On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the benchmark
federal funds rate to 5.25 percent from 5.50 percent _ a move
widely expected after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted at it
recently.
	   ``The interest rate reduction (in the U.S.) has been largely
discounted,'' said Sean Li, a trader at Amsteel Securities (Hong
Kong) Ltd. ``The long weekend is coming, and there's not much
activity in the market.''
	   Hong Kong financial markets will be closed Thursday and Friday
and again next Tuesday for public holidays.
	   The Hang Seng rebounded in the afternoon session, lifted by
gains in property shares as expectations grew that Hong Kong's
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa will announce new measures to
stabilize the local property market in his major policy speech next
Wednesday, said Winnie Chiu, a property analyst at DBS Securities
(HK) Ltd.
	   Property giant Cheung Kong Holdings gained 1.10 Hong Kong
dollars to 35.90, its rival Henderson Land gained 20 cents to
26.50, and Sun Hung Kai Properties gained 45 cents to 27.45.
	   Property values have halved since a year ago, and major
developers' profits have dwindled. The government already has
frozen land sales and increased funding for loans for homeowners to
kick start the market.
	   Among other gainers, market heavyweight HSBC Holdings gained 50
cents to 142.00, and conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa gained 1.10 to
40.80.
	   Hong Kong Telecom bucked the market trend, losing 35 cents to
15.25, and CLP Holdings shed 20 cents to 37.80.

Japan to propose dlrs 30 billion aid package for Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of plan in graf 4, comments from
Miyazawa, timing of proposal in graf 6; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Wednesday he
will propose a plan for Japan to spend about dlrs 30 billion to aid
Southeast Asian countries at the Group of Seven meeting this
weekend.
	   His plan envisages the Export-Import Bank of Japan guaranteeing
debts of its Asian neighbors and buying government bonds from the
countries, Miyazawa said at a regular news conference.
	   Countries throughout Asia have been hit hard by a financial
crisis that has deeply eroded the values of their currencies.
Japan, though itself in recession, has been called on to do more to
lead the region to recovery.
	   Miyazawa said the aid would be used to restructure Southeast
Asian corporations, establish social safety nets, and alleviate the
credit crunch in those countries.
	   ``Japan will take the initiative,'' Miyazawa said. ``Although
the situation is severe domestically, we have enough funds to help
Southeast Asia. We feel that that is our responsibility
internationally.''
	   Miyazawa will propose the plan to finance ministers and central
bankers of Southeast Asian countries before formally presenting it
during the G-7 talks.
	   The meeting of finance ministers from the G-7 nations _ the
United States, Japan, Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada and France _
is to begin Saturday in Washington.
	   One of the countries that would likely benefit from the aid was
South Korea, whose president, Kim Dae-jung, is scheduled to visit
Japan next Wednesday. Japan was expected to offer a large aid
package to South Korea during the visit.
	   Japan has also been a big contributor to a series of
international aid packages sponsored by the International Monetary
Fund for troubled Asian economies, including Thailand, Indonesia
and South Korea.

Kohl's campaign chief resigns after election defeat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A top party aide of Helmut Kohl announced
Wednesday he would step down, a further victim of the stinging
election defeat for the four-term chancellor and his Christian
Democrats.
	   Peter Hintze, who managed Kohl's campaign as general secretary
of the Christian Democratic Union, reversed statements earlier this
week that he intended to serve out his term until 2000.
	   Kohl, 68, announced Sunday night he would not seek re-election
as party chairman after leading the party to its worst showing in a
national election in nearly 50 years. Social Democrat Gerhard
Schroeder won the chancellor's race on a platform of change.
	   A Nov. 7 party convention will elect a successor to Kohl, who
has led the CDU for 25 years, including the last 16 years as
chancellor.
	   Hintze, a pastor from the Rhineland area near the French border,
said he also would not be seeking another term. He has held his
post since 1992.
	   Hintze helped engineer Kohl's narrow re-election in 1994 with a
campaign that painted the Social Democrats and the former East
German communists as potential allies.
	   But he was harshly criticized inside the party this year for
running a lackluster effort oriented toward Kohl's past
achievements such as German unification in 1990. His perpetual grin
and boyish appearance earned him the ridicule of the media and
Kohl's foes.
	   Kohl's fall has also claimed other political casualties.
	   His finance minister, Theo Waigel, is stepping down as chairman
of the CDU-allied Christian Social Union, which rules Bavaria. The
CDU spokesman, Rolf Kiefer, is also looking for a new job.
	   The two Christian Democratic parties plummeted to 35.1 percent
of the vote in Sunday's election, from 41.5 percent in 1994.
	   With Kohl dethroned, his successors felt free to blast his long
spell of iron-fisted leadership.
	   Outgoing defense minister Volker Ruehe criticized Kohl's
announcement last year that he wanted his protege Wolfgang
Schaeuble to succeed him.
	   Ruehe, who is believed to covet the party leader's job himself,
said on ARD television that the new leadership must ``not be
imposed, certainly not by those who have been in charge until
now.''
	   He added, though, that he believed Schaeuble was capable of
doing the job while also staying CDU faction leader in parliament.

Human Rights Watch says 18 ethnic Albanians slaughtered

	   OBRIJA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Valmir's tiny right hand was raised,
stiffened, as if he was cringing. His pacifier still dangled from
the dried blood on his chin.
	   The 18-month-old boy was found sprawled on the floor of a pine
forest beside his 38-year old mother, two of the 15 men, women and
children whose bodies were seen by a reporter Tuesday. Ethnic
Albanians say were slaughtered Sunday after a Serb attack.
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch, whose staffers were in the
area, said a total of 18 ethnic Albanians had been killed in the
forest near this village in the Drenica region northwest of
Pristina.
	   ``The massacre was clearly an attack on defenseless civilians
who were hiding in the woods,'' said Holly Cartner, executive
director of Human Rights Watch's European division. ``The Yugoslav
army and Serbian police are fighting a war against civilians, and
this is another sad example of the unspeakable atrocities being
committed against them.''
	   Most were killed in a makeshift camp in the woods where they had
been hiding after Serb troops overran their towns and villages.
	   ``Serb police executed everybody,'' said one trembling elderly
man, who identified himself only as Fazli.
	   Journalists saw the bodies Tuesday, a day after they were seen
by diplomats from the United States and other countries who make up
a permanent international observer mission to Kosovo.
	   Serbs began cracking down on Albanian separatists in the
southern province in February. Since then, hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 275,000 have been driven from their
homes.
	   Sunday's massacre came as the Yugoslav army _ facing threats
from NATO _began pulling out equipment from a recent conflict area.
The move came after a government pledge to end the offensive
against ethnic Albanian militants.
	   But the Albanians say the fighting is continuing and that the
government is actually putting more weapons and men into the fray
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   About 150 military vehicles were seen Tuesday passing through
Caglavica, just south of the provincial capital of Pristina. Tanks
made up at least one-third of the convoy.
	   Still _ despite the convoy seen at Caglavica _ it was unclear
whether a large-scale pullback had begun, or if new offensives were
in progress, as claimed by the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center.
	   NATO had stepped up plans for airstrikes after repeated warnings
to Yugoslavia to stop its onslaught against ethnic Albanians, who
form the majority of the population in Kosovo.
	   Serbia, under world pressure, has agreed in principle to restore
some of the autonomy it stripped from Kosovo in 1989 _ but rules
out demands for independence.
	   Each side has accused the other of killing civilians since
President Slobodan Milosevic launched the crackdown. Serbs say at
least 39 Serbs were tortured, mutilated and killed near Glodjane
earlier this month after they were kidnapped by ``terrorists.''
	   In Sunday's attack, friends and relatives of the victims said
masked Serbs in green and blue uniforms descended last weekend on
this town, which the Serbs call Obrinje.
	   They captured a man in his 60s, and wielding a knife from his
kitchen, forced him to take them to where refugees were hiding. The
man's body was found at the edge of the camp. The back of his head
was blown off, his throat was slit and the butcher knife was
carefully placed on his chest.
	   In the camp, the attackers shot a man and a woman, both 65,
while they lay in a makeshift tent that had sheltered them since
they fled their home days earlier.
	   Their bodies were spread on the blankets, surrounded by their
blood-spattered clothing, pots and pans. The woman's right foot was
partially cut off and her mouth was gaping open.
	   Villagers said six women tried to escape with four children. But
the attackers caught up with them in a shallow ditch.
	   They were found there.

U.S. to provide temporary consular services from former residence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The United States will provide temporary
consular services from a refurbished residence in a Nairobi suburb
after a powerful bomb destroyed the consular section of the U.S.
Embassy, killing several officials, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
	   Temporary consular duty officer Melissa Arkley said visa
applicants would be served on an appointment-only basis, unlike the
previous practice when the embassy was located at a busy
intersection in downtown Nairobi, and applicants had to wait in
long lines outside the building.
	   The Aug. 7 embassy blast killed 248 people, among them 12
Americans, included Consul General Julian Bartley and his son, Jay.
Several Kenyan consular employees also died.
	   Since then, no visa services have been provided from the
diplomatic mission that serves Kenya and eight other eastern
African nations.
	   The bombed U.S. Embassy building in Nairobi did not meet the
latest State Department security standards.
	   Arkley said the temporary consular section would meet _ and
sometimes surpass _ standards.
	   Those standards require that all windows and glass partitions in
U.S. diplomatic missions be covered with a 4-millimeter coating of
shatterproof mylar. She said windows in the temporary consular
section will have an 8-millimeter coating.
	   Arkley said it was hoped consular services would resume by the
end of October, but this depended on how quickly telephone lines
and additional eletric power were provided to what was formerly an
embassy staff residence in the suburb of Spring Valley.
	   Since the bombing, emergency services for U.S. citizens have
been provided from temporary embassy facilities in the offices of
the U.S. Agency for International Development.
	   Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said plans were underway to move
all the embassy operations to a temporary building outside downtown
Nairobi sometime next year. Consular services would then be moved
to that building, he said.
	   Congress is expected to appropriate funds to construct a new
Nairobi embassy outside the central business district, he said.
	   The bombed-out embassy building, located on land leased to the
United States for 99 years, will be pulled down, he said.

Philippine stocks rise on heavy PLDT trading; peso falls on weaker
</HEADLINE>
yen &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rallied Wednesday
as shares of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. again dominated
the day's trading.
	   The peso, meanwhile, closed lower against the U.S. dollar,
pressured mainly by a sharp fall in the Japanese yen.
	   Window-dressing by some traders closing their books for
September also contributed to the stock market's rise, dealers
said.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision Tuesday to cut its target
Fed funds interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 5.25 percent,
but leaving its discount rate unchanged at 5.00 percent, had
minimal effect on Manila shares since the news had been expected,
traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 21.47 points,
or 1.7 percent, to 1,259.64, following a 7.67-point gain Tuesday.
	   Persistent takeover rumors continued to encourage local
investors to position behind PLDT shares, which accounted for an
estimated 67 percent of total trades Wednesday. PLDT closed
unchanged at 920 pesos (dlrs 20.90).
	   Traders said the market may now succumb to profit-taking
following Wednesday's gain. Since regional economic fundamentals
are still weak, investors remain reluctant to hold on to local
stocks for the long term, dealers said.
	   Gainers trounced decliners 50 to 30, while 39 issues were
unchanged.
	   In currency trading, dealers said the cut in U.S. interest rates
also had little impact on the peso market, which had long expected
a reduction.
	   The dollar averaged 44.027 pesos for the day, up from 43.809
pesos on Tuesday. It reached a day-high of 44.160 pesos and closed
at 43.920 pesos.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said the market has now largely
digested the impact of the central bank's decision earlier this
week to raise the reserve requirement of commercial banks to
stabilize the peso. The move was aimed at siphoning off excess
liquidity to reduce the level of funds that could be used for
currency speculation.
	   The U.S. interest rate cut was welcomed by the central bank,
which said it should make higher-yielding peso-denominated
instruments more attractive to foreign investors.
	   However, one trader predicted inflows of foreign currency will
not be substantial given the uncertain regional investment climate.
	   The central bank's overnight borrowing and lending rates were 16
percent and 18 percent respectively, but will fall by two
percentage points each on Friday.

Tropical storm Yanni floods South Korea's south coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Tropical storm Yanni dumped heavy rain
along South Korea's southern coastal regions Wednesday, causing
casualties and flooding vast residential and crop lands.
	   Officials reported four people were killed or missing as the
storm dumped up to 19 inches (48 centimeters) of rain on the
nation's southern tip.
	   Weathermen predicted the storm would drop 4 more inches (10
centimeters) of rain before moving out over the Sea of Japan early
Thursday.
	   At Ulsan, a southeastern industrial city, a Korean Air passenger
plane carrying 148 people skidded off the rain-slick runway during
landing. Three people were hospitalized with minor injuries, police
said.
	   On the southernmost island of Cheju, one man was killed and two
others were missing after they fell into rough seas. In Changhung
in the southwest, a man was reported missing in a rain-swollen
river.
	   Television footage showed trees in Mokpo and several other
cities uprooted and embankments collapsed. A flood warning was
issued in some areas.
	   MBC-TV reported that many sections of road were washed away and
62,000 hectares (153,000 acres) of rice paddies flooded along the
Yongsan River in the southwest. About 1,500 people along the river
were evacuated, it said.
	   Most air flights to and from the southern areas were canceled.

Old German Cabinet meets on offer for NATO air strikes in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with commitment approved, tightens &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's outgoing Cabinet confirmed
Wednesday an offer for 14 fighter planes to participate in possible
NATO air strikes in Kosovo. But a decision on actual deployment
could fall to the new government being formed by chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder.
	   Outgoing Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said the action by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government sends ``a clear signal'' to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that Germany remains focused
even during the transition phase.
	   NATO officials had asked all member states for such a commitment
to raise the pressure on Milosevic to resolve the Kosovo crisis
peacefully. But even if they all come through, NATO ratification of
the plan is needed before air strikes could be carried out.
	   That means approval of the actual deployment could fall to the
Social Democrats, who defeated Kohl in Sunday's election.
	   The Social Democrats and their likely coalition partner, the
Greens, have said they want a U.N. mandate for NATO strikes before
allowing the Tornado fighters to take off.
	   However, the parties have left unclear how explicit the U.N.
mandate must be.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and about 275,000 have fled
their homes since Milosevic's forces began cracking down on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo in February.
	   Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are ethnic
Albanians, who seek independence from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
	   Whether the old Cabinet and old parliament decide on Germany's
participation depends on how quickly NATO acts. At the earliest,
the new parliament may be constituted by Oct. 20. If NATO decides
before then, the old parliament could call a special session to
vote on participation.
	   However, Social Democratic foreign policy expert Guenter
Verheugen said he didn't expect any quick decisions on NATO air
strikes because the political, legal and military situation wasn't
right.
	   Even within the old Cabinet, there were differences on whether a
U.N. mandate would be needed for NATO air strikes. While outgoing
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel insisted it was, Defense Minister
Volker Ruehe has said he could foresee a NATO decision sufficing in
a humanitarian emergency.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two medium-size Japanese brokerages said Wednesday
they had agreed to merge, forming the latest corporate alliance
aimed at surviving changes sweeping Japan's finance industry.
	   National Securities Co. and Meiko Securities Co. decided to
combine operations by next April 1, company officials said at a
news conference.
	   Under the agreement, shareholders will receive two shares of
National for every one of Meiko they now hold.
	   The merger comes as Tokyo embarks on an ambitious program to
revive its moribund financial markets by liberalizing stock trading
commissions and allowing new competition.
	   National, which has its headquarters in Tokyo, posted its
seventh straight loss last year, a pretax shortfall of 1.3 billion
yen (dlrs 9.6 million) on sales of 11.6 billion yen (dlrs 86
million).
	   Meiko, a member of the venerable Sumitomo industrial group, has
also failed to report a profit since 1991, the year after Tokyo
stock prices went into a long slide.
	   The Osaka-based brokerage reported a 465 million yen (dlrs 3.4
million) pretax loss in the year ended March 1998 on revenues of
10.3 billion yen (dlrs 76 million).
	   The new brokerage will have 39 branches, making it one of the
larger of Japan's mid-size securities houses, the newspaper Yomiuri
said.
	   Trade in shares of both companies was suspended before the
merger was announced. Meiko last traded unchanged at 127 yen, and
National rose 3 yen, or 3.9 percent, to 80 yen.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines workers postponed
voting Wednesday on a management-proposed plan aimed at putting the
closed national flag-carrier back in business, the workers' union
said.
	   The debt-laden airline, Asia's oldest, closed on Sept. 23 after
failing to persuade its ground crew union to accept the rescue
plan. Its closure left much of the Philippines without air service.
	   Leaders of PAL's largest union approved the plan Monday after
accepting a 10-year suspension of the union's collective bargaining
agreement in exchange for 20 percent of the company's stock and
other benefits.
	   The agreement must still be formally approved by workers,
regulators and PAL's creditors.
	   Avelino Capili, a board member of the PAL Employees Association,
said they would put the rescue plan to a vote among its nearly
7,000 members by secret ballot Thursday or Friday. Union leaders
initially planned a signature campaign to ratify the plan.
	   Capili said the union needed to print ballots and confer with
government labor officials, whom they want to oversee the voting.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with many militant
members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreement would
violate workers' rights and expose them to management abuses.
	   Hundreds of workers opposed to the plan protested Tuesday,
urging President Joseph Estrada to allow a government takeover of
PAL.
	   Estrada says the government cannot do that because there is no
money in public coffers to underwrite daily losses of up to 45
million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two U.S. and three South Korean auto
companies have been invited to enter a new round of bidding for
bankrupt Kia Motors Corp., Kia officials said Wednesday.
	   The successful bidder, to be announced Oct. 19, will be chosen
among Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. of the United States
and Hyundai Motor Co., Samsung Motors Corp. and Daewoo Motor Co. of
South Korea, they said.
	   Following two failed auctions, Kia's creditor banks have said
they plan to sweeten the terms of the third, presumably by
swallowing more of its debt.
	   Kia's creditor banks will provide the five companies with new
auction terms by Friday, the officials said. Potential buyers must
submit their bids by Oct. 12.
	   General Motors was invited but did not take part in two previous
auctions. Ford participated in the first auction but withdrew from
the second, saying that Kia's debts were too much for it to handle.
	   While terms of the next auction have not been made public,
President Kim Dae-jung, commenting on the issue at a news
conference Monday, said he understood measures were being taken to
make the third auction successful.
	   The state-controlled Korea Development Bank is Kia's largest

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Airlines says it is restoring
discounts on a popular route to the Philippines, a week after it
touched off a public outcry by scrapping them.
	   The airline effectively doubled all its fares to Manila a week
ago after Philippines Airlines ceased operations, handing Singapore
Airlines a monopoly on direct flights on the busy route.
	   In a statement late Tuesday, it said it has decided ``to
reinstate the discounted market fares that applied before Sept.
23'' on flights to the Philippine capital.
	   Local newspapers had published letters from the public
complaining about the scrapping of the discounts, which also
affected the many Filipino maids and their employers in Singapore.
	   The Consumer Association of Singapore also criticized the move.
	   ``You don't just double fares overnight if it's a pure business
decision,'' association director Edmund Baker told The New Paper
last week. ``This is making use of a monopoly to profiteer.''
	   The airline's Tuesday statement made no reference to the general
criticism, stating simply that it decided to reinstate the previous
discounted fares after it had ``reviewed the overall market
conditions, and in view of an anticipated increase in seat
capacity.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Production at recession-plagued Japanese factories
and mines slipped 0.6 percent in August from July, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said Wednesday.
	   The decline was smaller than forecast by economists surveyed by
Dow Jones Newswires, who projected on average that industrial
production would shrink by 0.8 percent. The figures were adjusted
for seasonal factors.
	   It was the second straight month of decline following July's 0.8
percent fall. In June, output rose 1.7 percent, which had been the
first gain in four months.
	   Industrial shipments were also down, slipping 0.9 in August,
while inventories dropped 0.5 percent, MITI said.
	   The ministry forecast output would rise 3.0 percent in September
from August, although it said production would fall 1.0 percent in
October.
	   Japan is suffering its worst recession in decades amid a
stubborn slump in consumer demand and growing worries about the
health of the country's debt-ridden banks.
	   In a sign of continued weak consumer sentiment, MITI also
announced that sales at Japan's major department stores and
supermarkets fell 5.1 percent in August from the same month a year
ago to 1.768 trillion yen (dlrs 13.2 billion).
	   The figure, adjusted for changes in the number of stores, marked
the fourth consecutive month of year-on-year falls.

Korean War POW escapes North Korea after 45 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean prisoner of war
returned home Wednesday after escaping 45 years of captivity in
communist North Korea, government officials said.
	   Staff Sgt. Chang Moo-hwan, 72, toiled at a North Korean coal
mine before he managed to escape to China in August and find South
Korean officials there, Defense Ministry officials said.
	   Chang arrived by ship in Inchon, a port city west of Seoul. He
was not allowed to talk to journalists pending a government
debriefing.
	   Chang, captured by North Korean troops toward the end of the
1950-53 Korean War, had been listed as killed in action, and a
headstone bearing his name rests in the Seoul National Cemetery.
	   Seoul says more than 40,000 South Korean prisoners were not
returned at the end of the Korean conflict, but the North says all
POWs went home in 1953.
	   Only three POWs have successfully escaped the North since.
	   Former POW Yang Soon-yong, who escaped to the South in December,
has said at least 59 ailing South Korean prisoners of war were
still alive in a North Korean concentration camp.
	   Without a peace treaty, the two Koreas are still technically at
war.

Mubarak: Sudan factory may have been used for chemical weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt says a
Sudanese pharmaceutical factory bombed by the United States last
month could have been used to make chemical weapons agents.
	   Mubarak's comments published Wednesday in the government-run
Al-Ahram newspaper are the first by an Arab leader endorsing the
Clinton administration's claim that Sudan was using the plant for
military purposes.
	   ``We know that this plant was for medicine but it is possible
that it produced agents that are used in manufacturing chemical
weapons,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying in an interview.
	   He said Sudan also has another ``chemical plant'' close to the
al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, which was destroyed in the Aug. 20
bombing.
	   The remarks contradict Egypt's endorsement earlier this month of
an Arab League resolution supporting Sudan's claim that the plant
was producing only medicines.
	   Sudan has called for a United Nations investigation to prove its
claim. The United States rejects such a probe, saying American
intelligence has supplied enough evidence to back its stand.
	   Relations between Egypt and Sudan have remained cold since
Mubarak survived an assassination attempt in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
in 1995. Egypt said Sudan was behind the attempt and that it is
harboring the attackers.
	   In the interview, Mubarak accused Sudan's Islamic government of
terrorism and repeated claims that it harbors Egyptian and other
Muslim militants who are trying to topple their governments.
	   Mubarak did not elaborate or cite any evidence to support his
statements.
	   His comments came even as Sudanese President Oman el-Bashir, in
a separate interview published Wednesday, hailed Egypt for
supporting Sudan in the Arab League resolution over the
pharmaceutical plant.
	   Relations between the two countries are improving, especially
after Egypt ``stood with Sudan against the American aggression,''
el-Bashir was quoted as saying by the London-based Arabic weekly,
Al-Wasat.
	   On the assassination attempt on Mubarak, el-Bashir said it is
impossible for his government to ``find the accused and hand them
over to concerned countries for their trial.''

Myanmar military government stages mass rally of supporters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government has
marshaled 28,000 supporters at a rally to denounce the democratic
opposition and foreign interference in the country's affairs,
state-run media reported Wednesday.
	   The rally Tuesday in the northwestern city of Monywa followed
similar gatherings in the capital, Yangon, and the central city of
Mandalay over the past several days.
	   The rallies are regular features of government propaganda drives
that accompany crackdowns on the country's beleaguered but
tenacious democracy activists, led by 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner
Aung San Suu Kyi and her political party, the National League for
Democracy.
	   The military, which has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma,
since 1962, has arrested 961 NLD members, including 202 members of
parliament, since May, the party said Tuesday.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a 1990
election the military refused to honor. The current sweep of
arrests, the largest since the early 1990s, was to prevent the
party from convening the assembly against the wishes of the
military.
	   People attending mass rallies are usually members of the Union
Solidarity and Development Association, a military-sponsored
civilian organization.
	   At similar rallies in Yangon in the past, some participants told
reporters from Bangkok that if they didn't attend, they would be
fined by the government.
	   Analysts have said the USDA will be used as a political machine
delivering blocks of votes for military candidates in any future
elections.
	   Its members have also been used as storm troopers, according to
the opposition, participating in violent attacks on government
opponents, including an assault on Suu Kyi in November 1996.
	   A government press release said those attending the rally at a
sports stadium in Monywa were members of the Publishers
Association, Brick Factory Entrepreneurs Association, Vessel Owners
Association, Bankers Association, Video and Recording Association,
Rice Dealers Association, Weaving Entrepreneurs Association, Red
Cross Society, Industrialists Association, Theatrical Association
and the Auxiliary Fire Brigade.
	   They listened to speeches demanding that the government deport
Suu Kyi and outlaw her party.
	   ``The voice at the rallies is that of the entire people,'' said
an editorial in Wednesday's state-run New Light of Myanmar
newspaper.
	   ``What the rallies are saying, most vocally and justifiably, is
that it is high time the government took concrete action. The kind
of drastic move that will bring a halt to the NLD's wily and wicked
ways,'' the editorial said.

More than 1,300 killed in battle for key road in Sri Lanka

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ More than 1,300 soldiers and Tamil
rebels have been killed in the worst explosion of fighting in a
year along a Sri Lankan highway that the military has been trying
to recapture for months, according to military and Red Cross
figures available Wednesday.
	   International Committee of the Red Cross spokesman Harsha
Gunawardene said the bodies of 600 soldiers were collected from
rebels Wednesday. Though Gunawardene could not confirm exactly
where and when the 600 died, he said they appeared to be casualties
in the highway fighting that began Sunday.
	   Gunawardene said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam handed
over the bodies at Mallavi, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Kilinochchi, a key town where fighting reportedly continued to rage
Wednesday. Gunawardene spoke by telephone from the Sri Lankan
capital of Colombo to The Associated Press in New Delhi, capital of
neighboring India.
	   The Red Cross toll is in addition to the 262 soldiers whose
bodies the military said it recovered itself in battles for the
same highway. The military said it killed 477 rebels in the
fighting.
	   In Colombo, hospital officials speaking on condition of
anonymity said another 53 soldiers have died in hospitals.
Colombo's 1,400-bed state-owned National Hospital, the largest in
the country, was one of several that were sending home most
patients to make room for wounded soldiers.
	   Some of the wounded were being treated on stretchers in hospital
corridors.
	   There was little public reaction to the scale of the carnage
because censorship has kept news of the fighting out of local
newspapers.
	   The military has not seen such casualties since 1996, when 1,240
soldiers were killed when rebels overran a garrison at Mullaittivu,
about 280 kilometers (175 miles) north of Colombo.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that they are
widely discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control
the government and the military.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed since the fighting
began in 1983.
	   The military has waged a bitter and costly battle for the
highway linking Colombo to the government-held northern town of
Jaffna.
	   Since May last year, government forces have wrested control of
two-thirds of the highway from the guerrillas. Complete control
would open a land route to the Jaffna peninsula, a former rebel
stronghold in the north that the army captured two years ago.
	   The government is relying on expensive air and sea deliveries of
food and other commodities to Jaffna's half-million residents in
the absence of a road link.
	   Military officials said Wednesday that their troops captured
Mankulam, a town on the highway 245 kilometers (150 miles) north of
Colombo. At the northern end of the highway at Kilinochchi, 35
kilometers (21 miles) north of Mankulam, fighting continued.
	   The rebels stormed Kilinochchi Sunday and on Tuesday claimed to
have captured it and the town of Paranthan further north. The
government says it still controls parts of the towns.
	   The Sri Lankan government under President Chandrika Kumaratunga
has vowed to crush the Tigers on the battlefield. But though the
rebel fighting force estimated at 5,000 is much smaller than the
100,000-strong Sri Lankan army, it has managed spectacular strikes
from its rebel hide-outs.
	   Tigers are believed behind the Sept. 11 city hall bombing in
government-held Jaffna, the main city on the Jaffna peninsula, that
killed the city's mayor, police chief, and military commander. Just
months before the bombing, the mayor's predecessor was shot and
killed in Jaffna, also reportedly by the rebels.
	   In August, Kumaratunga extended a state of emergency from the
northern and eastern areas directly affected by the fighting to the
remaining parts of the island.

Sale set for real estate assets of defunct Thai finance companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A government agency said Wednesday it
will auction nearly 3 billion baht (dlrs 76.9 million) of real
estate belonging to 56 defunct finance companies on Nov. 8.
	   The agency, the Financial Sector Restructuring Authority, was
set up to oversee the liquidation of assets after the 56 companies
were shut down last December. An economic slowdown triggered a
collapse of Thailand's finance sector last year, when both finance
companies and banks found themselves stuck with a huge amount of
non-performing loans.
	   Previous sales by the authority disposed of such items as motor
vehicles and art works.
	   The authority said in a statement that the assets up for sale in
November include plots of land, residential houses, shop units,
office space, a hotel, a factory and golf courses.
	   Amaret Sila-On, the authority's chairman, said November's
auction will give a boost to Thailand's real estate market, ailing
since the domestic economy entered a deep recession.
	   ``This will lead to activities in the market and gradually lead
the sector back to normal conditions,'' Amaret said.
	   Earlier this month, the authority reported to the government
that it will be able to auction almost all of some 780 billion baht
(dlrs 20 billion) in assets by the end of the year.
	   It added, however, that it would probably not be able to sell
around 200 billion baht (dlrs 5.1 billion) worth of assets by the
year-end deadline included in the terms of a dlrs 17.2 billion
International Monetary Fund rescue package.
	   Under Thailand's agreement with the IMF, the authority has to
complete auctions of all assets of the 56 insolvent companies by
December.
	   On Dec. 2, the government plans to hold an auction of 460
billion baht (dlrs 11.8 billion) of business loans held by the
insolvent finance companies.
	   Amaret said last month that the auction would be ``the world's
single biggest auction deal.''
	   Since local investors don't have much buying capacity and the
assets are likely to be sold at attractively big discounts, some
analysts expect the auction to bring substantial foreign funds
flowing into the liquidity-starved Thai economy.

Greek defense minister pledges support for Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greece and Cyprus will continue to
strengthen their joint defense capability against Turkey, the
visiting Greek defense minister said Wednesday.
	   ``Turkish expansionism and threats will be faced resolutely,''
Akis Tzochatzopoulos told reporters at the airport.
	   He arrived on a Greek air force C-130 transport plane to join
the island's independence day celebrations and hold talks on the
joint defense agreement with Cyprus.
	   The northern one-third of the Mediterranean island nation has
been occupied by Turkey since 1974 when it invaded Cyprus. The
southern portion of the island is controlled by Greek Cypriots.
	   ``The strengthening of the defense capability of Cyprus will
continue without interruption,'' Tzochatzopoulos said.
	   The comments are seen an indirect response to Turkey's warning
that it will prevent the planned deployment later this year of
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles Cyprus has bought from Russia.
	   The United States and other Western governments are pressing
Cyprus to cancel the missile deployment and have also criticized
Turkey for its threats.
	   Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides says he will cancel the
missile deployment if Turkey accepts his demilitarization proposal
or if there is progress in the U.N.-sponsored talks for the
reunification of the island.
	   The northern breakaway Turkish Cypriot state is only recognized
by Turkey which maintains 35,000 troops there.

Mubarak: Sudan factory may have been used for chemical weapons

Bosnian Serb claims he is too sick to plead to war crimes charges
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect
snatched by NATO forces at the weekend Wednesday claimed he was too
sick to enter a plea at his arraignment because masked men clubbed
him with a baseball bat during his arrest.
	   Stevan Todorovic also told judges at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal that he was illegally ``kidnapped'' from the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. Judges made no comment on the claim.
	   NATO, whose troops arrested Todorovic, claims he was taken into
custody without incident in northern Bosnia.
	   Todorovic faces 15 charges relating to allegations that he
murdered, tortured and raped Muslims and Croats in the northern
Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac in 1992 where he was police chief.
	   If convicted he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
	   Asking for an adjournment, Todorovic, 40, told judges he was
suffering headaches, dizziness and nausea since his arrest in the
early hours of Sunday.
	   ``During the kidnap I was transported from Serbia by boat and I
received a heavy blow from a baseball bat over my head,'' Todorovic
claimed.
	   His face and head showed no visible signs of bruising, but he
told judges he had a laceration on the back of his head. He
requested an MRI scan to check for bruising.
	   Presiding Judge Claude Jorda of France agreed to adjourn the
arraignment, but added that a neurologist who examined Todorovic
after his arrest had said a scan was not necessary.
	   The U.N. court is sensitive to claims of ill health by suspects
since the death in custody of two Bosnian Serbs in recent months.
One committed suicide and the second died of a ruptured blood
vessel.
	   The three-judge panel entered provisional not guilty pleas for
Todorovic.
	   Prosecutors allege that Todorovic oversaw a ruthless campaign of
terror and discrimination by Serb forces that drove all but a
handful of non-Serbs from Bosanski Samac in 1992 and 1993.
	   Todorovic, the ninth suspect arrested by NATO forces in Bosnia,
is charged with five war crimes, five grave breaches of the Geneva
Conventions and five crimes against humanity. Each charge carries a
maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
	   He allegedly beat and kicked one Muslim to death, beat or
tortured six others, including a Catholic priest, and forced two
unidentified prisoners to perform sexual acts on each other while
other prisoners and Serb guards watched _ an allegation that
warrants a rape charge under the tribunal's rules.
	   Set up in 1993 to bring to justice those responsible for
atrocities during conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, the tribunal
has indicted 58 suspects and has 26 in custody.

Prosecutor who led 'Clean Hands' corruption probe leaves post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The prosecutor who headed Italy's ``Clean Hands''
corruption probe, which swept away an entire political class, has
asked for a new post. ``I am not abandoning ship,'' Francesco
Saverio Borrelli was quoted as saying Wednesday. ``But no one is
indispensable.''
	   Borrelli had twice before said he wanted to leave his post in
Milan, but colleagues pressured him to stay on. This time around,
he said he was determined to leave, despite the ``cries of
protest.''
	   But Italian newspapers said Wednesday that Borrelli assured his
colleagues that ``Clean Hands'' would continue.
	   The prosecutor on Tuesday applied for a higher-ranking job, also
in Milan, handling prosecutions in appeals cases, including those
of many of the politicians and businessmen convicted in ``Clean
Hands.''
	   Borrelli launched ``Clean Hands'' in 1992 and it shook the
foundations of Italy's political and business establishment.
	   Convictions ranging from bribery to corruption to extortion have
been meted out to top figures, among them are two former premiers,
Socialist Bettino Craxi and conservative media magnate Silvio
Berlusconi.
	   The sweeping investigations were shaken in 1994 by the
resignation of the most popular prosecutor, Antonio Di Pietro, who
became a national hero for the vigor with which he pursued
corruption. Di Pietro is now a senator.

Human Rights Watch says 18 ethnic Albanians slaughtered

	   OBRIJA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Valmir's tiny right hand was raised,
stiffened, as if he was cringing. His pacifier dangled from the
dried blood on his chin.
	   The 18-month-old boy was found sprawled on the floor of a pine
forest beside his 38-year old mother, two of the 15 men, women and
children whose bodies were seen by a reporter Tuesday. Ethnic
Albanians say were slaughtered Sunday after a Serb attack.
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch, whose staffers were in the
area, said 18 ethnic Albanians had been killed in the forest near
this village in the Drenica region northwest of Pristina.
	   ``The massacre was clearly an attack on defenseless civilians
who were hiding in the woods,'' said Holly Cartner, executive
director of Human Rights Watch's European division. ``The Yugoslav
army and Serbian police are fighting a war against civilians, and
this is another sad example of the unspeakable atrocities being
committed against them.''
	   Most were killed in a makeshift camp in the woods where they had
been hiding after Serb troops overran their towns and villages.
	   ``Serb police executed everybody,'' said one trembling elderly
man, who identified himself only as Fazli.
	   Journalists saw the bodies Tuesday, a day after they were seen
by diplomats from the United States and other countries who make up
a permanent international observer mission to Kosovo.
	   Serbs began cracking down on Albanian separatists in the
southern province in February. Since then, hundreds of people have
been killed and about 275,000 driven from their homes.
	   Sunday's massacre came as the Yugoslav army _ facing threats
from NATO _began pulling out equipment from a recent conflict area.
The move came after a government pledge to end the offensive
against ethnic Albanian militants.
	   But the Albanians say fighting continues and that the government
is actually putting more weapons and men into the fray in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   About 150 military vehicles were seen Tuesday passing through
Caglavica, just south of the provincial capital of Pristina. Tanks
made up at least one-third of the convoy, which was moving from one
part of Kosovo to barracks in another part of the city.
	   The Serbs have not promised to remove troops from Kosovo, merely
to return them to barracks and it was unclear whether a large-scale
pullback had begun.
	   The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center has said new
offensives are in progress.
	   NATO had stepped up plans for airstrikes after repeated warnings
to Yugoslavia to stop its onslaught against ethnic Albanians, who
form the majority of the population in Kosovo.
	   Serbia, under world pressure, has agreed in principle to restore
some of the autonomy it stripped from Kosovo in 1989 _ but rules
out demands for independence.
	   Each side has accused the other of killing civilians since
President Slobodan Milosevic launched the crackdown. Serbs say at
least 39 Serbs were tortured, mutilated and killed near Glodjane
earlier this month after they were kidnapped by ``terrorists.''
	   In Sunday's attack, friends and relatives of the victims said
masked Serbs in green and blue uniforms descended last weekend on
this town, which the Serbs call Obrinje.
	   They captured a man in his 60s, and wielding a knife from his
kitchen, forced him to take them to where refugees were hiding. The
man's body was found at the edge of the camp. The back of his head
was blown off, his throat was slit and the knife was carefully
placed on his chest.
	   In the camp, the attackers shot a man and a woman, both 65,
while they lay in a makeshift tent that had sheltered them since
they fled their home days earlier.
	   Their bodies were spread on the blankets, surrounded by their
blood-spattered clothing, pots and pans. The woman's right foot was
partially cut off and her mouth was gaping open.
	   Villagers said six women tried to escape with four children. But
the attackers caught up with them in a shallow ditch.
	   Their bodies were found there.

Prince Andrew undergoes drug tests; results negative
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Even Prince Andrew couldn't escape a random drug
test at the Ministry of Defense, as part of the British navy's
crackdown on drug use, Buckingham Palace confirmed Wednesday.
	   The son of Queen Elizabeth II, a naval lieutenant commander who
works at the site, was ordered to provide a urine sample by a team
of navy investigators conducting on-the-spot tests. The prince's
results were negative.
	   Andrew ``was absolutely happy to take part and accepts that it
is part of the nature of the job,'' said a Buckingham Palace
spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   The navy said the tests are carried out entirely at random,
without regard to rank or status. Anyone who refuses could face
discipline or dismissal. More than 80,000 service people were
tested last year.
	   The samples, which were taken Sept. 15, were sent to government
laboratories, where they were tested for traces of cannabis,
cocaine, heroin, Ecstasy and amphetamines.

Expos owners to make new bid for stadium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ The owners of the Montreal Expos plan to
re-launch their quest for a downtown stadium by injecting more
private money into the project, club chairman Jacques Menard said
Tuesday.
	   An Oct. 7 deadline to decide the future of the National League
team will be pushed back to allow the owners to come up with a new
stadium proposal that would be more acceptable to federal,
provincial and local government.
	   ``We're not giving up,'' said Menard, adding the owners still
plan to meet on Oct. 7, but there was no new deadline.
	   Menard said the owners would dilute their shares in the team by
bringing new investors into the group. The extra money would be put
toward construction costs and be used to cover losses incurred over
the next two or three years while the stadium is built.
	   The owners have been criticized for not putting their own money
into the stadium.
	   ``Hopefully, the Expos can write a check,'' Menard said, ``and
not only pass on the capital from seat licenses but also from the
Expos proper.
	   ``Will that add up to enough capital that we can go back to the
government with a solution to finance the stadium? I don't know,
but I happen to believe so.''
	   The original stadium plan called for dlrs100 million to be
raised through the sale of corporate boxes and seat licenses, with
the remaining dlrs150 million to come from governments.
	   Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard turned down any notion of
contributing public money to the project and the federal government
has been cool to any contribution other than selling the Expos the
building site for one dollar.
	   Bouchard made it known this week he is now willing to listen to
new proposals for financing the stadium, Menard said.
	   Bouchard said Tuesday that he would meet baseball commissioner
Bud Selig and Expos representatives in the first week of October to
discuss ways to save the team and keep it in Montreal.
	   Menard said 49 of 60 corporate boxes and about 5,000 of 18,000
seat licenses had been sold. The team is also selling personalized
bricks for the stadium at dlrs 299 each.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian authorities on Wednesday
released five allies of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim
who had been detained under a dreaded security law, a news report
said.
	   Among those freed was Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, head of the youth wing
of the ruling United Malays National Organization, the national
news agency Bernama said.
	   Four leaders from the popular Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia,
which Anwar once led in his student days, were also released.
	   Police gave no reason for the releases.
	   All five men were hauled in Sept. 21 under the Internal Security
Act, just a day after Anwar was arrested under the same law, which
allows police to jail detainees without trial.
	   The law originally was enacted in 1960 to counter militant
communists. Critics say it has been used in recent weeks to crack
down on 17 of Anwar's associates in a bid to hobble a groundswell
of support for the ousted leader.
	   Since Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sacked his deputy last
month, tens of thousands of supporters have demonstrated at rallies
throughout the country.
	   Many of those supporters come from the conservative Islamic
party he founded as a student reformer battling rural poverty.
Nearly 300 people were detained in the series of protests but many
of them have since been released.

Tanzania supports sale of ivory stockpiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Tanzania supports the sale of stockpiled
ivory, but the money should be used for the protection of
elephants, a government minister said Wednesday.
	   Zakia Meghji, natural resources and tourism minister, said at
the third African Range States meeting that Tanzania supports the
decision last year to permit three African countries to sell
stockpiles of ivory.
	   The three countries are Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana.
	   The experimental sale of 59.1 tons of ivory is expected to begin
next year and is restricted to Japan.
	   Meghji's statement indicated Tanzania will seek a similar
exemption at a later date.
	   Under a convention signed by 138 members of the U.N. Convention
on Trade in Endangered Species the sale of ivory is banned to deny
poachers a market.
	   Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe argued they had more elephants
than their land could sustain and that the proceeds would go toward
conservation and development programs in rural areas.
	   Meghji said Tanzania has one of the continent's largest elephant
herds, with 87,015 animals, and also one of the largest stockpiles
of ivory, 76,648 kilograms (76.6 metric tons).
	   The stockpiled ivory is obtained from elephants which die
naturally, or is seized from poachers.

Newspaper reports Glenn Hoffman won't be back as Dodgers manager
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The Los Angeles Dodgers had two managers
between 1954 and 1996 _ both Hall of Famers. They had two this year
alone, and it appears they will have another to start the 1999
season.
	   Glenn Hoffman won't return as the Los Angeles manager, and his
coaching staff will also be replaced, the Orange County Register
reported in today's editions.
	   The newspaper said the Dodgers planned to announce today that
Hoffman and the coaches will be offered other jobs within the
organization.
	   Hoffman, 40, guided the Dodgers to a 47-41 record after
replacing Bill Russell, who was fired along with general manager
Fred Claire on June 21.
	   Russell succeeded Tom Lasorda on July 29, 1996 _ after Lasorda
had a mild heart attack and was made a vice president of the team.
	   Lasorda, now the club's senior vice president, held the
managerial job for nearly 20 years starting in 1977. Before that,
Walter Alston managed the team in Brooklyn and Los Angeles from
1954-76.
	   Dodgers spokesman Derrick Hall confirmed late Tuesday that
general manager Kevin Malone met with Hoffman to discuss the 1999
season.
	   ``But no official decision has been announced, and until the
Dodgers make that announcement, we cannot comment on his status,''
Hall said.
	   Hoffman didn't answer his home phone, and didn't immediately
return a message.
	   Lasorda, who turned 71 last week, was named to replace Claire as
interim general manager last June, and was succeeded by Malone on
Sept. 11.
	   Hoffman was manager of the Dodgers' Albuquerque farm club of the
Pacific Coast League when Russell was fired.
	   A few days after Hoffman took over, Charlie Hough, Mickey
Hatcher joined the coaching staff, replacing Glenn Gregson, Reggie
Smith and Mark Cresse. Others on the coaching staff are Joe
Amalfitano, Mike Scioscia and Manny Mota.
	   Montreal Expos manager Felipe Alou is believed to be the leading
candidate for the managerial job.
	   Malone was general manager of the Expos during the 1994 and 1995
seasons. More recently, he was assistant general manager for the
Baltimore Orioles.
	   Believed to be other possibilities to succeed Hoffman are former
Boston Red Sox manager Kevin Kennedy and former Baltimore Orioles
manager Davey Johnson. Neither worked for a baseball organization
this year.
	   Alou, 63, has one year remaining on his contract with the Expos,
but it's believed the team won't stop him from leaving to manage
the Dodgers.
	   According to the Register, Malone said Tuesday he had not yet
contacted the Expos about speaking to Alou.
	   The Dodgers never contended in 1998, starting with four straight
losses and finishing with an 83-79 record.
	   The Fox Group finalized its purchase of the team in March, and
changes were made continuously throughout the season, starting in
mid-May when the Dodgers, struggling with a losing record, traded
slugger Mike Piazza to the Florida Marlins in a blockbuster
seven-player deal.
	   The Dodgers and Piazza were unable to agree on a contract
extension, prompting the trade. Piazza, dealt to the New York Mets
a week after being sent to the Marlins, is unsigned for next year.
	   The Dodgers made the playoffs in 1995 and 1996, and were
eliminated from contention on the final weekend last year. They
have not won a postseason game since 1988, when they won the World
Series.

Bosnian Serb claims he is too sick to plead to war crimes charges
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect
snatched by NATO forces at the weekend Wednesday claimed he was too
sick to enter a plea at his arraignment because masked men clubbed
him with a baseball bat during his arrest.
	   Stevan Todorovic also told judges at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal that he was illegally ``kidnapped'' from the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. Judges made no comment on the claim.
	   NATO, whose troops arrested Todorovic, claims he was taken into
custody without incident in northern Bosnia.
	   Todorovic faces 15 charges relating to allegations that he
murdered, tortured and raped Muslims and Croats in the northern
Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac in 1992 where he was police chief.
	   If convicted he could be sentenced to life in jail.
	   Asking for an adjournment, Todorovic, 40, told judges he was
suffering headaches, dizziness and nausea since his arrest in the
early hours of Sunday.
	   ``During the kidnap I was transported from Serbia by boat and I
received a heavy blow from a baseball bat over my head,'' Todorovic
claimed.
	   His face and head showed no visible signs of bruising, but he
told judges he had a laceration on the back of his head. He
requested an MRI scan to check for bruising.
	   Presiding Judge Claude Jorda of France agreed to adjourn the
arraignment, but added that a neurologist who examined Todorovic
after his arrest had said a scan, which can detect internal
injuries, was not necessary.
	   The U.N. court is sensitive to claims of ill health by suspects
since the death in custody of two Bosnian Serbs in recent months.
One committed suicide and the second died of a ruptured blood
vessel.
	   The three-judge panel entered provisional not guilty pleas for
Todorovic.
	   Prosecutors allege that Todorovic oversaw a ruthless campaign of
terror and discrimination by Serb forces that drove all but a
handful of non-Serbs from Bosanski Samac in 1992 and 1993.
	   Todorovic, the ninth suspect arrested by NATO forces in Bosnia,
is charged with five war crimes, five grave breaches of the Geneva
Conventions and five crimes against humanity. Each charge carries a
maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
	   He allegedly beat and kicked one Muslim to death, beat or
tortured six others, including a Catholic priest, and forced two
unidentified prisoners to perform sexual acts on each other while
other prisoners and Serb guards watched _ an allegation that
warrants a rape charge under the tribunal's rules.
	   Set up in 1993 to bring to justice those responsible for
atrocities during conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, the tribunal
has indicted 58 suspects and has 26 in custody.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mel Stottlemyre couldn't have scripted the New
York Yankees' playoff opener any better.
	   His son, Todd, had the best postseason outing of his career, and
Mel's pitcher, David Wells, threw eight strong innings in New
York's 2-0 win against Texas on Tuesday night.
	   ``Tonight's game probably ended the best way,'' said
Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach. ``My son pitched well and
we won.''
	   The game may have turned out the way Mel wanted, but watching
his own son pitch against his team wasn't easy.
	   ``This time was much more difficult because of the importance of
the game,'' Mel said, referring to Todd's start in New York in
August. ``The type of game it was, there wasn't much room for
error.''
	   Stottlemyre made very few mistakes, allowing two runs and six
hits, striking out eight in going the distance in the playoffs for
the first time in his career.
	   Stottlemyre, who walked four, settled down after allowing two
runs in the second inning. He gave up just three hits in his final
five innings.
	   ``I was a little anxious in the beginning, but that's natural,''
he said. ``If you're not nervous before a game like this, you have
a problem. You have to have nerves to have the edge.''
	   The loss was Todd's first in his last six starts at Yankee
Stadium, where he used to play tape ball in the clubhouse while Mel
pitched for the Yankees.
	   But this time his father, a Yankees ace in the 1960s, wasn't on
the mound. He was sitting next to New York manager Joe Torre in the
Yankees' dugout.
	   His mother, Jean, and his wife, Shari, were sitting in the
Yankees' family section. They sat with the Rangers' wives when Todd
pitched in New York in August.
	   ``I just wanted to sit in this section this time,'' said Jean,
who was openly cheering for her son and the Rangers, clapping when
Chuck Knoblauch was thrown out at home in the first inning.
	   Mel was neither surprised nor bothered by his wife's rooting in
the second game between father and son.
	   ``I sort of thought she would,'' said Mel, who had been in the
opposite league as his son until Todd was traded from St. Louis to
Texas at the July 31 deadline. ``We haven't talked about it, but it
is what I expected.''
	   Todd and Mel kept their distance after going out for dinner
together Monday night. When game time approached Tuesday, the
Stottlemyre men, the winningest father-son duo in major league
history, avoided each other.
	   They would not even share a glance as they walked out for
pregame warmups, and Mel stood out of his son's view as Todd
loosened his arm in left field.
	   ``I've got my whole life to look at my dad,'' Todd said. ``I
didn't need to do it tonight.''
	   Todd, who has 123 of the Stottlemyre's 287 career wins, is now
6-3 with a 4.26 ERA in the Bronx. In Todd's first start against his
father's team, he got the win despite allowing six hits and five
runs in six innings.
	   Torre appreciated Mel's predicament, but he wasn't going to let
him out of giving a scouting report on his son. He also saw a
difference in Mel's approach to watching the game.
	   ``He paid a little more attention to our hitters than usual,''
Torre said. ``Mel was probably under more pressure than any one of
us tonight.''

Central Banker says Russia has little choice but to boost money

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top Central Bank official said Wednesday that
Russia's new government had little choice but to boost the money
supply _ and thereby fuel inflation _ even though she expressed
reservations about the policy.
	   Tatiana Paramonova, who previously headed the Central Bank in
1995, won parliamentary approval Wednesday to the bank's board. She
pursued tight money policies when she was in charge of the Central
Bank, and that helped Russia bring down inflation until the latest
economic crisis hit in August.
	   The new government has already begun to expand the country's
money supply as a way to help troubled banks and get the country's
financial system moving again.
	   She indicated she had concerns about the policy, but said there
appeared to be no other choice.
	   ``It will be very difficult to limit the negative impact of
money supply growth, but it has to be a basis of our monetary
policy,'' said Paramonova.
	   Inflation has gone up 67 percent since August, and could reach
several hundred percent by the end of the year, according to
Central Bank predictions.
	   Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin filled several more vacant
Cabinet posts Wednesday. The new Cabinet has been almost three
weeks in the making, and the president has filled about 25 spots,
and about five more remain vacant.
	   Yeltsin named Sergei Kalashnikov, a member of Vladimir
Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist party, as minister of labor, Russian
news agencies reported. Kalashnikov has served as chairman of the
parliament's social affairs committee.
	   Yeltsin also selected ministers of culture, education and
health, news reports said.
	   The new government has yet to provide a blueprint for dealing
with the country's worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet
collapse. But it has said that its top priority is to pay off a
huge backlog of wage and pension arrears to millions of state
workers.
	   ``There is no political crisis, but there is certain
socio-economic tension,'' Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said of
Russia during a visit to Belarus on Wednesday. Russia is pursuing
``reforms that should serve people.''
	   Primakov has said the government already paid off part of its
debt, including military wages, and promised to pay current wages
on time starting in October. He hasn't said, however, where the
government would get funds.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An earthquake measuring 5.7 on the
Richter Scale shook Belgrade and other parts of the Balkans early
Wednesday, shutting off electricity temporarily, rattling buildings
and sending frightened residents into the streets.
	   There were no reports of significant damage during the quake,
which struck about 12:15 a.m. (2215 Tuesday GMT).
	   But the independent B-92 Radio said one man died of a heart
attack during the quake near the town of Valjevo. At least 17
people were injured, many of them tumbling down darkened staircases
as they fled into the streets.
	   Officials said the quake was centered near Cacak about 85
kilometers (55 miles) south of Belgrade.
	   In central Serbia, authorities warned people to avoid drinking
tap water because the sewerage system may have been damaged.
Schools were closed in the area Wednesday.
	   Callers to Belgrade radio stations asked whether NATO had
attacked. The Alliance has threatened possible military action
unless the government halts its crackdown of ethnic Albanian
separatists in the southern province of Kosovo.
	   In neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, people fled into the streets
of the capital Sarajevo, despite a heavy downpour. The quake was
also felt in parts of Croatia.

Schroeder: 'No problem' with Greens leader as foreign minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with vote on Kosovo, Kohl party aide steps down, ADDS
background on Greens seeking foreign policy post; CORRECTS typo in
'Fischer' in 1st graf &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder said in
an interview published Wednesday that he sees ``no problem'' in
appointing Greens leader Joschka Fischer as foreign minister,
despite his radical past.
	   Schroeder told Die Woche newspaper that Fischer, once a
self-described ``professional revolutionary'' as part of the
leftist student movement in the 1960s and '70s, has since developed
into ``an unusually rational political man.
	   ``And in the face of the fact that this development process went
amazingly fast, I see no problem'' with him as foreign minister,
Schroeder said.
	   Greens leaders meeting Tuesday said that securing the foreign
ministry post for Fischer would be one of their main demands in
coalition negotiations with Schroeder that start Friday.
	   In the newspaper interview, Schroeder, a Social Democrat, was
less clear about another controversial figure that he has invited
to join his Cabinet.
	   The non-partisan computer entrepreneur Jost Stollmann served
during the campaign as shadow economics minister, often angering
the Social Democrats' traditional-left wing and labor unions with
his calls for cuts in the social welfare state.
	   Schroeder said Stollmann would certainly be part of his
government, ``but its structure will be determined after we clear
up the questions of content in the coalition talks.''
	   Schroeder was visiting Paris on Wednesday _ a trip meant to
stress that German foreign policy will remain stable when he
officially takes over from Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   The new government's defense policies could first be tested on
the issue of German involvement in possible NATO strikes in the
Serb-ruled Yugoslav republic of Kosovo.
	   The outgoing Cabinet confirmed Germany's offer of 14 fighter
planes to participate in possible NATO air strikes. But a decision
on actual deployment will probably fall to the new government.
	   The Social Democrats and the Greens have said they want a U.N.
mandate for NATO strikes before allowing the Tornado fighters to
take off. However, the parties have left unclear how explicit the
U.N. mandate must be.
	   Sunday's stinging election defeat for Kohl and his Christian
Democrats claimed another victim Wednesday: Peter Hintze, who
managed Kohl's campaign as the party's general secretary, said he
would resign.

NATO's partners provide new view of security in Europe

	   KRIVOLAK, Macedonia (AP) - Moldovan soldiers splash across a
muddy Macedonian river. American infantrymen walk in tight patrol
formation. A Hungarian squad watches a demonstration of mine
detection.
	   This is European security today, NATO and non-NATO forces
learning and working together.
	   It's called Partnership for Peace, an American idea promulgated
at a 1994 summit in Brussels. The purpose: bring European security
firmly into the post-Cold War era to face the realities of the 21st
century.
	   ``The world has changed,'' said NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana. ``You have to be prepared to look at the challenges of the
present and the future, not the challenges of the past.''
	   At this sun-baked military base in central Macedonia, 13 NATO
countries and 13 PfP members practiced peacekeeping skills this
month in a week-long exercise. It's exactly the kind of skills
being used today in Bosnia, where 30 NATO and partner nations are
keeping the peace.
	   ``It's fun helping those guys,'' said 1st Lt. Wheeler Pulliam,
25, of Brookhaven, Mississippi, who had just conducted a
demonstration in medical evacuation procedures before a group of
former Warsaw Pact troops. ``It's better to train them than to
fight them.''
	   It still shocks in many ways, helping former enemies get better
at what they do, or working together with forces that have always
remained neutral.
	   In Bosnia, where NATO warplanes put an end to the fighting three
years ago, NATO soldiers are working closely with old friends and
former foes. The Russian brigade makes up part of the American
sector in northeast Bosnia. The Nordic-Polish brigade brings
together Poland, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark - an old
enemy, two old neutrals and two members of NATO.
	   This new cooperation became possible with the unraveling of the
Soviet Union and the diminishing Russian threat.
	   The NATO task was once relatively simple _ defend against a
Warsaw Pact onslaught across the plains of Central Europe. Today,
the threat is from regional conflicts like Bosnia or Kosovo,
international terrorism, ethnic violence, the spread of weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Dealing with these new threats requires new t program is trying to forge real partnerships with the
27 countries, including Russia, that have sought membership based
on the belief that practical and military cooperation will lead to
stability.
	   PfP members are Albania, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Hungary,
Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malta,
Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden,
Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.
	   Each of the 27 members has a bilateral relationship with NATO
and each develops its own cooperation program, setting out what it
wants out of its membership and what it has to give.
	   In exchange for a commitment to democracy, PfP members can get
nearly everything NATO has to offer except automatic defense
against outside attack. Many countries see PfP as a steppingstone
to NATO membership. Others want a more limited form of cooperation.
	   Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are scheduled to join
NATO in April when the alliance marks its 50th anniversary with a
summit in Washington.
	   Russia, which has developed a separate relationship under the
NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council, has yet to work out an
individual partnership program with the alliance.
	   NATO has conducted dozens of PfP exercises in the last four
years, including three in this Cooperative Best Effort series.
	   In these exercises, non-NATO countries like Bulgaria, Macedonia,
Estonia, Poland and Romania demonstrated their techniques for such
procedures as searching a building and operating checkpoints.
	   1st Lt. Zoltan Szekeres, a member of Hungary's Rapid Reaction
Force, said his unit is often called on to do this sort of thing
because it is, he said, the best brigade in Hungary. ``It is a
privilege to be part of a peacekeeping exercise like this,'' he
said, adding its most useful aspect is ``creating mutual
understanding.''
	   Macedonia in particular knows the value. A U.N. force patrols
Macedonia's borders with Albania and Kosovo, preventing a spillover
of violence from those two unstable areas. The Skopje government
jumped at the chance to sponsor a PfP exercise in this nation of a
mere 2 million people.
	   ``Today it is inconceivable to have the security of one European
country in the hands of that country alone,'' said Prime Minister
Branko Crvenkovski. ``For that we need PfP, and a further opening
of the alliance.''

After years of loneliness, life becoming rosy for 90-year-old
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ He was lonely. His children lived far away;
his wife had left him and it didn't help that he was getting old.
	   But life could be looking up for the 90-year-old Tehran resident
who has obtained a court approval to take a second wife, the Iran
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   All that remains now is to convince his lady love, said the
newspaper, which did not identify the man.
	   It said the man told the court that his wife of 60 years walked
out on him 14 years ago to live with their two sons and two
daughters in Sweden.
	   ``At first I thought I could live alone and manage, but later on
I realized it is very difficult,'' said the man.
	   He went to Sweden twice but couldn't convince his wife to
return. Their fifth child, a daughter who lives in the northeastern
Iranian city of Mashhad, visits him only once or twice a year.
	   ``Now I want a second wife,'' Iran quoting the man as telling
the 1706th branch of the Tehran Public Court court. The judge
agreed.
	   Islamic laws allow men to take up to four wives, but Iran
requires its citizens to get court approval for subsequent
marriages.
	   When the judge, identified only as Jamshidi, asked if he had
anyone special in mind, the 90-year-old replied: ``There is one
lady but first I must talk her into it.''
	   ``To be honest with you she is the reason for me being in the
court.''
	   The newspaper did not say when the hearing took place.

Ogata urges Serbs to halt excessive use of violence

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako
Ogata, on Wednesday urged Serb authorities to halt ``excessive use
of force'' against civilians in Kosovo province.
	   On Sunday, the human rights group Human Rights Watch reported 18
ethnic Albanians were slaughtered in the forest near the village of
Obrija in the Drenica region northwest of Pristina.
	   Most were killed in a makeshift camp in the woods where they had
been hiding after Serb troops overran their towns and villages.
	   Ogata, who has just returned from a five-day tour of the region,
said UNHCR believed excessive use of force directed against
civilians by Serb police, such as shelling, looting and burning of
homes, was designed to force people to move out of villages.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is also guilty of using excessive
force, Ogata told a news conference in Geneva. But the largest
offensive so far had been carried out by the Serbs and she had
protested this to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. ``These
are real, genuine causes of fear,'' said Ogata. ``These are daily
widespread terroristic offenses that are taking place.''
	   Ogata called for a cessation of hostilities followed by a just
political settlement and a long period of confidence rebuilding.
	   Ogata said UNHCR was very concerned about reports of mass graves
near villages that she visited during her trip.
	   She said UNHCR knew there had been ``serious violations of human
rights'' committed by both Serb and KLA forces, but said the agency
was still awaiting further information.
	   Ogata said that compiling figures on the numbers of refugees
displaced from their homes had been made difficult by the
``fluidity'' of movements. UNHCR had estimated there had been
50,000 people living in the open in August and September, but said
the figure was probably lower than that now.
	   Serbs began cracking down on Albanian separatists in the
southern province in February. Since then, hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 275,000 have been driven from their
homes.

Junta orders members to reveal personal assets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAG0S, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military junta ordered all
senior government administrators and ministers to disclose their
personal assets in order to crack down on corruption, a government
statement said Wednesday.
	   The decision follows a meeting of the ruling military council
and includes federal and state officials.
	   The move, initiated by head of state Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar,
is seen as part of his efforts to clean up Nigeria's troubled
governmental system, which has long been rife with corruption.
	   In addition to widespread human rights abuses, Abubakar's
predecessor Gen. Sani Abacha and many of his supporters, were
notorious for amassing personal fortunes from public funds.
	   ``The military administration is very much interested in the
issue of accountability,'' Lt. Col. Anthony Obi said of Abubakar's
new initiative to redress Abacha's alleged endemic corruption.
	   Abubakar has declared his own personal assets to officials, but
the figures have not been made public.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect
snatched by NATO forces at the weekend Wednesday claimed he was too
sick to enter a plea at his arraignment because masked men clubbed
him with a baseball bat during his arrest.
	   Stevan Todorovic also told judges at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal that he was illegally ``kidnapped'' from the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. Judges made no comment on the claim.
	   NATO, whose troops arrested Todorovic, claims he was taken into
custody without incident in northern Bosnia.
	   Todorovic faces 15 charges relating to allegations that he
murdered, tortured and raped Muslims and Croats in the northern
Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac in 1992 where he was police chief.
	   If convicted he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
	   Asking for an adjournment, Todorovic, 40, told judges he was
suffering headaches, dizziness and nausea since his arrest in the
early hours of Sunday.
	   ``During the kidnap I was transported from Serbia by boat and I
received a heavy blow from a baseball bat over my head,'' Todorovic
claimed.
	   His face and head showed no visible signs of bruising, but he
told judges he had a laceration on the back of his head. He
requested an MRI scan to check for bruising.
	   Todorovic's lawyer, Goran Neskovic, said after the hearing that
his client was kidnapped by men who told him they were thieves
working for somebody else, but did not say who.
	   Todorovic claims he was knocked unconscious with a baseball bat,
smuggled across a river into Bosnia, dumped in a hedge and then
taken to Tuzla.
	   In Tuzla, an officer Todorovic claimed was NATO's commander in
Bosnia, Gen. Eric Shinseki told him: ``You should have turned
yourself in. ... As you can see, we have ways of getting you.''
	   Todorovic's claims could not be immediately verified.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's prime-minister designate,
taking over after his predecessor resigned following weeks of
protests, now faces the difficult task of building a coalition
government.
	   The ruling Socialist Party nominated its 30-year-old general
secretary, Pandeli Majko, to replace Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
Late Tuesday, President Rexhep Mejdani asked Majko to try and form
a new government. Majko was expected to start negotiations with
other parties Wednesday on forming a coalition.
	   Nano submitted his resignation as prime minister on Monday, and
his bitter rival, ex-President Sali Berisha on Tuesday demanded new
elections. At the same time Berisha urged supporters to cooperate
with a new government in his most moderate comments in weeks.
	   Under Albanian law, Nano remains caretaker prime minister until
Parliament approves his successor and his Cabinet. The Socialists
hold 108 of the 155 seats.

Overcoming match-fixing distraction, Australia set for first test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Focusing hard on the spinners' pitch
rather than the match-fixing trial, Australia were set for four
grueling weeks of cricket with Pakistan on the eve of the first
Test match, the Australian captain said Wednesday.
	   ``It's been a little distracting for Mark (Waugh), but the rest
of the boys are keyed up for tomorrow's game,'' skipper Mark Taylor
told The Associated Press ahead of the first day of their first
test.
	   ``They have a very good side and I think it will be an
interesting four weeks ahead,'' Pakistan skipper Aamir Sohail said.
	   The Australian Cricket Board decided Tuesday their cricketers
would just concentrate on the three-Test series against Pakistan
and will not testify in the match-fixing inquiry against Pakistani
trio Salim Malik, Ijaz Ahmed and Wasim Akram. The Lahore High Court
is hearing the case.
	   Australia's Mark Waugh, Shane Warne and Tim May had alleged in
1994 that Malik had offered them bribes to throw the Karachi Test
that year. Of the three, Waugh is the only player in the present
team.
	   The registrar of the Lahore court claimed Tuesday an official
request had been made to the Australian team for recording their
statements in the court next week. But Australian team officials
denied they had received such a request.
	   Taylor, who made his captaincy debut in 1994, said his aim was
to concentrate on playing positive and enterprising cricket.
Australia have not won a series on Pakistan soil for 39 years since
Richie Benaud led them to 2-0 victory over Fazal Mehmood's team in
1959-60 series.
	   The pitch is likely to help spinners rather than pace bowlers
and will thrill spinners on the last three days, said Mohammad
Bashir, chief curator of the Pakistan Cricket Board.
	   ``There is not enough grass on the track and I think it will
help the slow bowlers,'' Taylor said.
	   Australia have included rookie leg-spinner Stuart MacGill to
fill the gap of Warne. MacGill took nine wickets in the four-day
tour opener at Karachi and Taylor said he hoped the 27-year-old
spinner would enjoy bowling at Rawalpindi.
	   The series could also bring a personal accomplishment for
Australia's 34-year-old wicketkeeper Ian Healy. Veteran of 103 Test
matches, Healy needs three more dismissals to surpass his
predecessor Rodney Marsh's record of 355. Healy has taken 328
catches and made 25 stumpings since making his debut against
Pakistan in 1988-89 series at Karachi.
	   Pakistan has named a 15-member squad strengthened with the
return of their star all-rounder Wasim Akram. Akram, who led
Lancashire in the English County Championship to runners-up
position this year, is expected to spearhead the pace attack.
	   Off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq, who was with his ailing father in
England, joined the team on Tuesday night and is expected to launch
the spin attack with leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed.
	   Teams Australia (from) : Mark Taylor (captain), Michael Slater,
Justin Langer, Ricky Ponting, Steve Waugh, Mark Waugh, Darren
Lehmann, Ian Healy, Stuart MacGill, Gavin Robertson, Michael
Kasprowicz, Glenn McGrath, Damien Fleming, Colin Miller.

Impressionist paintings recovered, curator central suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Police have recovered two valuable
Impressionist paintings stolen 10 days ago in what appears to have
been a staged heist and arrested the museum curator for alleged
armed robbery, police sources said Wednesday.
	   Two other people, described as small-time thugs, also were
arrested in connection with the Sept. 21 theft of a Monet and a
Sisley at the Fine Arts Museum of Nice, according to the sources in
the judicial police. They spoke on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The art works, Claude Monet's 1897 painting ``The Cliffs of
Dieppe'' and Alfred Sisley's 1890 work ``The Alley of the
Poplars,'' were found on a sail boat anchored in the small Riviera
port of Saint Laurent du Var, police said.
	   The police sources said that curator Jean Forneris is suspected
of having ordered the theft.
	   The paintings were stolen by two masked men who took Forneris
from his home, drove him to the museum, then bound and gagged him,
the caretaker and another employee and shut them in the museum
library.
	   The museum alarm had been turned off, allegedly because the
caretaker was on duty. The two men sped off in the curator's car
with the paintings.
	   Forneris later expressed his ``shock'' at the thefts.

Police officer confesses to raping asylum seeker from Ecuador
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A military police officer has
admitted raping a female asylum seeker from Ecuador at the Dutch
capital's airport, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The incident occurred two weeks ago when the 32-year-old woman
arrived at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport and was taken into custody
because she lacked the minimum amount of money to enter the
country, said Schiphol military police spokesman Rob Stenacker.
	   While awaiting deportation, she was taken to a restroom and
raped by the 23-year-old sergeant from the airport's military
police.
	   After she reported the incident, authorities launched an
investigation and the officer was arrested on Monday, added
Stenacker.
	   He added it was not immediately clear whether the officer will
be dismissed. The identities of the victim and the officer were not
released.
	   The public prosecutors' office said there were no indications
that similar incidents had occurred in the past.
	   Following the rape, military police officials announced that
asylum seekers and foreigners under interrogation at the airport
will be accompanied by two police officers from now on.
	   Reports of the Dutch incident came the week after the death of a
Nigerian asylum seeker in neighboring Belgium sparked public outcry
over that country's asylum policy.
	   Belgium's Interior Minister Louis Tobback resigned last week
over the death of Semira Adamu who died after police tried to
subdue her during her deportation.

Government stock holdings to be disclosed in late October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government will disclose in late October
the massive stock and futures holdings it accumulated in an
unprecedented buying spree aimed at driving out market speculators,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Its holdings will be disclosed by an independent company
established by the government to manage securities it bought in
late August, Acting Financial Secretary Rafael Hui told a news
conference.
	   Exchange Fund Investment Ltd. will manage the estimated U.S.
dlrs 15 billion of stocks and futures the government bought in its
market foray, aimed at driving up share prices to levels at which
speculators, who bet the market would fall, were stuck with huge
losses.
	   The government claimed victory and later introduced a series of
regulations to restrict speculative activity and stabilize the
markets.
	   Officials have not yet disclosed its holdings because existing
regulations on disclosure do not apply to the government. They said
any premature disclosure could wreak further havoc in the markets
and that they would disclose the details only after speculators
have left the Hong Kong markets.
	   Most analysts believe the government has spent at least 15
percent of its U.S. dlrs 96 billion in reserves. Reserves fell 4.6
percent to dlrs 92.1 billion at the end of August, but the drop may
not reflect transactions made but not settled by that time.
	   Hui said the new company will be subject to all the regulations
of private companies, but gave little further detail about the
company's board members or finances.
	   He added the company will not be engaged in active stock
trading, ``to avoid giving the wrong impression that the government
continues to operate in the stock market indirectly through the new
company.''
	   Hui also reiterated that the government intends to hold the
shares as a long-term investment, but said the company will enter
the market when it sees ``value-added opportunities for the
eventual disposal of shares.''
	   After the government intervened in the markets, economists,
analysts and politicians sharply criticized the move, saying it
damaged Hong Kong's reputation as a free market and wasted
taxpayers' money.
	   Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the de
facto central bank, said the government had not bought any shares
in September.

Human Rights Watch says 18 ethnic Albanians slaughtered
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with UNHCR comment &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OBRIJA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Valmir's tiny right hand was raised,
stiffened, as if he was cringing. His pacifier still dangled from
the dried blood on his chin.
	   The 18-month-old boy was found sprawled on the floor of a pine
forest beside his 38-year old mother, two of the 15 men, women and
children whose bodies were seen by a reporter Tuesday. Ethnic
Albanians say were slaughtered Sunday after a Serb attack.
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch, whose staffers were in the
area, said a total of 18 ethnic Albanians had been killed in the
forest near this village in the Drenica region northwest of
Pristina.
	   ``The massacre was clearly an attack on defenseless civilians
who were hiding in the woods,'' said Holly Cartner, executive
director of Human Rights Watch's European division. ``The Yugoslav
army and Serbian police are fighting a war against civilians, and
this is another sad example of the unspeakable atrocities being
committed against them.''
	   Most were killed in a makeshift camp in the woods where they had
been hiding after Serb troops overran their towns and villages.
	   ``Serb police executed everybody,'' said one trembling elderly
man, who identified himself only as Fazli.
	   Journalists saw the bodies Tuesday, a day after they were seen
by diplomats from the United States and other countries who make up
a permanent international observer mission to Kosovo.
	   Serbs began cracking down on Albanian separatists in the
southern province in February. Since then, hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 275,000 have been driven from their
homes.
	   Sunday's massacre came as the Yugoslav army _ facing threats
from NATO _began pulling out equipment from a recent conflict area.
The move came after a government pledge to end the offensive
against ethnic Albanian militants.
	   But the Albanians say the fighting is continuing and that the
government is actually putting more weapons and men into the fray
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the United Nations' chief refugee
office, Sadako Ogata, called Wednesday on Serb forces to halt the
``excessive use of force'' against Kosovo civilians. She told
reporters ethnic Albanian rebels were also guilty of brutality but
put most of the blame on government troops.
	   ``There are real, genuine causes of fear,'' she said. ``These
are daily, widespread terroristic offenses that are taking place.''
	   About 150 military vehicles were seen Tuesday passing through
Caglavica, just south of the provincial capital of Pristina. Tanks
made up at least one-third of the convoy.
	   Still _ despite the convoy seen at Caglavica _ it was unclear
whether a large-scale pullback had begun, or if new offensives were
in progress, as claimed by the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center.
	   NATO had stepped up plans for airstrikes after repeated warnings
to Yugoslavia to stop its onslaught against ethnic Albanians, who
form the majority of the population in Kosovo.
	   Serbia, under world pressure, has agreed in principle to restore
some of the autonomy it stripped from Kosovo in 1989 _ but rules
out demands for independence.
	   Each side has accused the other of killing civilians since
President Slobodan Milosevic launched the crackdown. Serbs say at
least 39 Serbs were tortured, mutilated and killed near Glodjane
earlier this month after they were kidnapped by ``terrorists.''
	   In Sunday's attack, friends and relatives of the victims said
masked Serbs in green and blue uniforms descended last weekend on
this town, which the Serbs call Obrinje.
	   They captured a man in his 60s, and wielding a knife from his
kitchen, forced him to take them to where refugees were hiding. The
man's body was found at the edge of the camp. The back of his head
was blown off, his throat was slit and the butcher knife was
carefully placed on his chest.
	   In the camp, the attackers shot a man and a woman, both 65,
while they lay in a makeshift tent that had sheltered them since
they fled their home days earlier.
	   Their bodies were spread on the blankets, surrounded by their
blood-spattered clothing, pots and pans. The woman's right foot was
partially cut off and her mouth was gaping open.
	   Villagers said six women tried to escape with four children. But
the attackers caught up with them in a shallow ditch.
	   They were found there.

Schroeder visits Paris amid French fears of losing out to British

<TEXT>
	   PARIS _ Germany's chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder was making
his first foreign trip to France on Wednesday, seeking to dispel
worries that his desire for closer relations with Britain doesn't
means neglecting Paris as a key force behind European unification.
	   The Franco-German axis was critical to building a stronger
European Union, including the euro single currency that takes
effect in January, and the two countries are each other's largest
trading partners.
	   But Schroeder, whose weekend election victory spelled the end to
16 years of rule by conservative Chancellor Helmut Kohl, has caused
jitters in Paris because of his interest in better ties with
London.
	   In contrast with Kohl, who lived through World War II, the new
54-year-old leader is part of a new generation of German leaders
some French officials feel will be less burdened by the past.
	   The Social Democrat, who speaks English but not French, was
expected to reaffirm his commitment to strong relations with France
during lunch with conservative President Jacques Chirac and a
meeting with Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   Schroeder scheduled a news conference at the end of his visit.
	   Meanwhile, the conservative daily Le Figaro said France and
Germany have gotten over various minor disputes. ``What is the real
problem? Great Britain, certainly,'' it said in a front-page
commentary Wednesday.
	   ``French officials think Schroeder wants to rebuild a magic
triangle: London, Berlin, Paris,'' it said, adding Schroeder feels
himself closer politically to Britain's New Left Prime Minister
Tony Blair than to Jospin.
	   With the trip Wednesday, the new German leader ``is making
obvious efforts to calm French jealousy,'' the leftist daily
Liberation said. It noted Schroeder picked as a foreign policy
adviser Brigitte Sauzay, a former interpreter for the late French
President Francois Mitterrand.
	   French and German interests have diverged in the past, and
Chirac's relations with Kohl had strained in recent months.
	   Chirac caused trouble with a series of nuclear weapons test
blasts under French South Pacific atolls in 1995 and 1996 and by
arguing over who should head euro's European Central Bank based in
Frankfurt.
	   Bonn had sought a more rapid expansion of the 15-nation European
Union to incorporate East European countries Germany wants to boost
trade with, while Paris has preferred a slower pace and expansion
of EU ties with Mediterranean trade partners.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Tuesday that while
Schroeder seeks closer ties with Britain, it ``doesn't replace''
relations with France. ``You have to take that very calmly. It's
not competition. It's not an alternative.''

German Cabinet meets on offer for NATO air strikes in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's outgoing Cabinet on Wednesday
offered 14 fighter planes for possible NATO airstrikes in Kosovo _
though a decision on whether they actually leave the ground will
probably fall to the newly elected government.
	   The action by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government sends ``a
clear signal'' to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that
Germany remains focused even as chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder
forms his government, outgoing Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said.
	   Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany, Zoran Jeremic, criticized
the Cabinet decision, saying it was ``completely wrong and rash''
and played into the hands of ``Albanian terrorists and
separatists.''
	   NATO officials had asked all member states for commitments of
military equipment to raise the pressure on Milosevic to resolve
the Kosovo crisis peacefully. But even if they all come through,
NATO ratification of the plan is needed before airstrikes could be
carried out.
	   That means approval of the actual deployment will probably fall
to the Social Democrats, who defeated Kohl in Sunday's election.
The new parliament is expected to convene Oct. 20 or 21.
	   The Social Democrats and their likely coalition partner, the
Greens, have said they want a U.N. mandate for NATO strikes before
allowing the German Tornado fighters to take off.
	   But Guenter Verheugen, the Social Democratic foreign policy
coordinator, backed away from that stance Wednesday.
	   ``One can imagine a situation in which the extent of violence in
Kosovo reaches such a level that any decent-thinking person would
say, `Something must be done ... that the humanitarian duty to stop
a murder is more important than the formal observance of
international law,''' he told WDR radio.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and about 275,000 have fled
their homes since Milosevic's forces began cracking down on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo in February.
	   Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are ethnic
Albanians, who seek independence from Serbia, the dominant republic
of Yugoslavia.

After years of loneliness, life becoming rosy for 90-year-old
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ He was lonely. His children lived far away;
his wife had left him and it didn't help that he was getting old.
	   But life could be looking up for the 90-year-old Tehran resident
who has obtained a court approval to take a second wife, the Iran
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   All that remains now is to convince his lady love, said the
newspaper, which did not identify the man.
	   It said the man told the court that his wife of 60 years walked
out on him 14 years ago to live with their two sons and two
daughters in Sweden.
	   ``At first I thought I could live alone and manage, but later on
I realized it is very difficult,'' said the man.
	   He went to Sweden twice but couldn't convince his wife to
return. Their fifth child, a daughter who lives in the northeastern
Iranian city of Mashhad, visits him only once or twice a year.
	   ``Now I want a second wife,'' Iran quoting the man as telling
the 1706th branch of the Tehran Public Court. The judge agreed.
	   Islamic laws allow men to take up to four wives, but Iran
requires its citizens to get court approval for subsequent
marriages.
	   When the judge, identified only as Jamshidi, asked if he had
anyone special in mind, the 90-year-old replied: ``There is one
lady but first I must talk her into it.''
	   ``To be honest with you she is the reason for me being in the
court.''
	   The newspaper did not say when the hearing took place.

Leading trainer Gordon Richards dies at age 68
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARLISLE, England (AP) _ English trainer Gordon Richards, who
trained two Grand National winners and the popular grey One Man,
has died at the age of 68.
	   Richards died Tuesday night at the Cumberland Infirmary in
Carlisle. The cause of death was not disclosed.
	   ``Father put up a brave fight and he was still doing the entries
until he was taken into hospital at the weekend,'' said Richards'
son, Nicky.
	   Richards' son and daughter, Joey, said they would take over, for
now, the running of his stables at Greystoke in Cumbria.
	   Richards, born in Bath and the son a timber merchant, trained
more than 2,000 winners, including Grand National winners Lucius in
1978 and Hallo Dandy in 1984.
	   He was best known in recent years for his handling of One Man,
which twice won the King George VI Chase and captured the Queen
Mother Champion Chase at Cheltenham in March. One Man was destroyed
after a fall at this year's Grand National at Aintree.
	   Newcastle race course was holding a minute of silence before
racing Wednesday as a mark of respect.

Ogata urges Serbs to halt excessive use of violence

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako
Ogata, on Wednesday urged Serb authorities to halt ``excessive use
of force'' against civilians in Kosovo province.
	   On Sunday, the human rights group Human Rights Watch reported 18
ethnic Albanians were slaughtered in the forest near the village of
Obrija in the Drenica region northwest of Pristina.
	   Most were killed in a makeshift camp in the woods where they had
been hiding after Serb troops overran their towns and villages.
	   Ogata, who has just returned from a five-day tour of the region,
said UNHCR believed excessive use of force directed against
civilians by Serb police, such as shelling, looting and burning of
homes, was designed to force people to move out of villages.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is also guilty of using excessive
force, Ogata told a news conference in Geneva. But the largest
offensive so far had been carried out by the Serbs and she had
protested this to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. ``These
are real, genuine causes of fear,'' said Ogata. ``These are daily
widespread terroristic offenses that are taking place.''
	   Ogata called for a cessation of hostilities followed by a just
political settlement and a long period of confidence rebuilding.
	   Ogata said UNHCR was very concerned about reports of mass graves
near villages from which people she met during her trip had fled.
	   She said UNHCR knew there had been ``serious violations of human
rights'' committed by both Serb and KLA forces, but said the agency
was still awaiting further information.
	   Jose Diaz, Geneva-based spokesman for U.N. human rights
commissioner Mary Robinson, said her office was still trying to
confirm the reports of the massacre in Drenica and mass graves.
	   The U.N. human rights office has three mobile staff operating in
Kosovo, but still hasn't received the go-ahead from the Yugoslav
authorities to set up a permanent office.
	   ``This (the reported massacres) just highlights the need for an
independent investigation,'' Diaz said.
	   Ogata said that compiling figures on the numbers of refugees
displaced from their homes had been made difficult by the
``fluidity'' of movements. UNHCR had estimated there had been
50,000 people living in the open in August and September, but said
the figure was probably lower than that now.
	   Serbs began cracking down on Albanian separatists in the
southern province in February. Since then, hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 275,000 have been driven from their
homes.

Taiwan commander warns of China missile threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Chinese submarines and ballistic missiles
pose the biggest military threat to Taiwan, the island's top
general said Wednesday in a landmark report to the legislature that
points to the military's growing openness.
	   Taiwan needs to upgrade its anti-submarine warfare systems to
foil China's likely strategy of using subs to sever the island's
sea routes during a war, Commander in Chief Tang Fei told a packed
meeting of the legislature's defense committee.
	   Meanwhile, China's military has advanced to the forefront of
missile technology, particularly in short- to medium-range
ballistic missiles like the M-9, of which it test fired 10 into
waters near the island in 1995-96, Tang said.
	   ``This is one area of our defense capability where we
desperately need to improve our response,'' Tang said.
	   Tang's report, prompted by a court decision, was the first to
the legislature by the armed forces' top uniformed officer.
Lawmakers usually receive their reports on the military from the
defense minister, who by law must be a civilian.
	   The change should yield better cooperation between the
legislature and the armed forces, said lawmakers, more than 50 of
whom signed up to question the general.
	   Legislative support is needed to pass the Defense Ministry's
budget, which accounts for more than 22 percent of government
spending, a far smaller proportion than in the past.
	   Most military spending goes into defending against the threat
from China. Since the Nationalist government was driven from the
mainland to Taiwan in 1949, China has claimed the island as a
breakaway province and threatens to attack it if it declares
independence.
	   The 1995-96 missile tests, accompanied by war games along the
China coast opposite Taiwan, were aimed at frightening the island's
leaders into reversing a perceived drift toward independence.
	   Those tests highlighted Taiwan's vulnerability to missile
attack, and Tang's report indicated China's ability to take out
civilian and military installations still must be factored into any
defense strategy.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Amnesty International has called
for an investigation into allegations of police brutality against
detained opposition activists, including ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim. The U.S. State Department also expressed
displeasure. ``Anwar's treatment at the hands of the police shows
the government's blatant disregard for basic human rights,'' said a
statement from the London-based rights group, issued late Tuesday.
Making his first appearance in court Tuesday, Anwar said that after
his arrest on Sept. 20, he was led handcuffed and blindfolded to a
police lockup where he was greeted with a punch that knocked him
unconscious. Anwar also said his left eye was so swollen that he
could not use it for two days after the beating. The eye was still
bruised when he appeared in court. (MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Stores in the state of Victoria
began rationing bread, while factories in other states closed down
Wednesday as the effects of a major natural gas system shutdown
spread. ``I think it's worse than the state of Victoria,'' state
Premier Jeff Kennett said. ``It is going to cost Australia ... in
the order of hundreds of millions of dollars a day.'' The crisis
began with a huge fire at Esso's Longford gas plant in Victoria
state on Friday that killed two men and injured eight. The plant
supplied more than 80 percent of the natural gas for Australia's
second-most populous state, and some 1.4 million households and
100,000 businesses may be without natural gas for at least two
weeks. (AUSTRALIA-GAS SHORTAGE)
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's prime-minister designate,
taking over after his predecessor resigned following weeks of
protests, now faces the difficult task of building a coalition
government. The ruling Socialist Party nominated its 30-year-old
general secretary, Pandeli Majko, to replace Prime Minister Fatos
Nano. Late Tuesday, President Rexhep Mejdani asked Majko to try and
form a new government. Majko was expected to start negotiations
with other parties Wednesday on forming a coalition. Nano submitted
his resignation as prime minister on Monday, and his bitter rival,
ex-President Sali Berisha on Tuesday demanded new elections. At the
same time Berisha urged supporters to cooperate with a new
government in his most moderate comments in weeks. (ALBANIA)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO preparing possible
airstrikes to end Kosovo's violence, the Yugoslav army is pulling
out hardware from a recent conflict area _ a move meant to
underline a government pledge to end the offensive against ethnic
Albanian militants. But the Albanians say the fighting is
continuing and that the Serb-Yugoslav alliance fighting the Kosovo
Liberation Army is actually putting more weapons and men into the
fray in Kosovo, an ethnic Albanian majority province of Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic. About 150 military vehicles were seen
Tuesday passing through Caglavica, just south of the provincial
capital, Pristina. Tanks made up at least one-third of the convoy.
Serbian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported three
army units were pulled back into Pristina, and similar withdrawals
from recent battlegrounds south of the capital. They did not say
how many troops were withdrawn. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ More than 1,300 soldiers and Tamil
rebels have been killed in the worst explosion of fighting in a
year along a Sri Lankan highway that the military has been trying
to recapture for months, according to military and Red Cross
figures available Wednesday. International Committee of the Red
Cross spokesman Harsha Gunawardene said the bodies of 600 soldiers
were collected from rebels Wednesday. Though Gunawardene could not
confirm exactly where and when the 600 died, he said they appeared
to be casualties in the highway fighting that began Sunday.
Gunawardene said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam handed over
the bodies at Mallavi, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Kilinochchi, a key town where fighting reportedly continued to rage
Wednesday. Gunawardene spoke by telephone from the Sri Lankan
capital of Colombo to The Associated Press in New Delhi, capital of
neighboring India. (SRI LANKA-FIGHTING)

Austrian official meets Iraqis seeking business contracts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Austrian trade delegation held talks
with Iraqi officials Wednesday on resuming business links between
the two countries, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   The 15-member delegation, which arrived Tuesday for the two-day
visit, is headed by Joseph Myre, the undersecretary of the foreign
trade relations. The group includes businessmen representing food,
pharmaceutical, power, water and sewage industries.
	   INA quoted Myre as saying that the visit is aimed at ``resuming
trade and economic ties ... in order to bring them back to their
previous level.''

Montgomerie heading for sixth straight Euro money title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie's victory
Sunday in German Masters has pushed him into first place on the PGA
European Tour money list as he bids for his sixth consecutive
title.
	   Montgomerie, by winning 166,660 pounds (dlrs 283,322) in Germany
on Sunday now has season earnings of 760,077 pounds (dlrs
1,292,131), well clear of England's Lee Westwood with 648,152
pounds (dlrs 1,101,858). Third place is held by Darren Clarke of
Northern Ireland with 616,867 (dlrs 1,048,674).
	   Only two events remain that count toward season winnings in
Europe _ this week's Belgacom Open in Belgium and the season-ending
Volvo Masters in Jerez, Spain, Oct. 29-Nov. 1.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official kidnapped after leaving a rally attended
by Chechen president, minor editing. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A member of the Russian government mission in
Chechnya was kidnapped in the breakaway southern territory after
attending a public rally featuring security officers, officials
said Wednesday.
	   Akmal Saidov, a bureaucrat at the mission, was kidnapped
following the gathering of Chechnya's security forces in the
capital Grozny, where President Aslan Maskhadov made a speech,
Russian news agencies reported.
	   The head of Russian mission, Georgy Kurin, said the kidnapping
had apparently been motivated by ransom. Kurin said he had informed
the Chechen authorities.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov,
was kidnapped five months ago and remains missing.
	   Earlier this month, two British charity workers were released
following 14 months of captivity. British officials said they had
paid no ransom.
	   Hundreds of Russian and foreign citizens have been abducted by
gangs seeking ransom since the 1994-1996 independence war with
Russia, and dozens remain held.
	   Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov's government has been
unable to stem kidnappings that have become a steady business for
some criminal gangs.
	   Earlier this week, Maskhadov pledged to stop abductions by
carrying out public executions of kidnappers.

Central Bank official says Russia should boost money supply
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 7-9 with newspaper publishing preview of
government's economic program, some ministers re-appointed in new
graf 12. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top Central Bank official said Wednesday that
Russia's new government had little choice but to boost the money
supply _ and thereby fuel inflation _ even though she expressed
reservations about the policy.
	   Tatiana Paramonova, who previously headed the Central Bank in
1995, won parliamentary approval Wednesday to the bank's board. She
pursued tight money policies when she was in charge of the Central
Bank, and that helped Russia bring down inflation until the latest
economic crisis hit in August.
	   The new government has already begun to expand the country's
money supply as a way to help troubled banks and get the country's
financial system moving again.
	   She indicated she had concerns about the policy, but said there
appeared to be no other choice.
	   ``It will be very difficult to limit the negative impact of
money supply growth, but it has to be a basis of our monetary
policy,'' said Paramonova.
	   Inflation has gone up 67 percent since August, and could reach
several hundred percent by the end of the year, according to
Central Bank predictions.
	   Meanwhile, the business daily Kommersant published what it said
was a preview of the new government's economic plan, which is not
expected to be unveiled until next week.
	   According to the newspaper, the plan calls for the government to
take over some ailing banks and use their assets to help troubled
industries. The government plans to increase the money supply by
about 60 percent and exercise control over the ruble rate,
Kommersant reported.
	   The plan, to be discussed by the government on Thursday, has
been prepared by a team of economic officials, including Yuri
Maslyukov, a Communist who is deputy prime minister in charge of
the economy. He served as the last chairman of the Soviet central
planning agency.
	   Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin filled several more vacant
Cabinet posts Wednesday. The new Cabinet has been almost three
weeks in the making, and the president has filled about 25 spots,
and several more remain vacant.
	   Yeltsin named Sergei Kalashnikov, 47, a member of Vladimir
Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist party, as minister of labor, Russian
news agencies reported. Kalashnikov has served as chairman of the
parliament's social affairs committee.
	   Yeltsin also selected ministers of culture, education and
health, and re-appointed the ministers of nuclear power and
agriculture, news reports said.
	   The new government has yet to provide a blueprint for dealing
with the country's worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet
collapse. But it has said that its top priority is to pay off a
huge backlog of wage and pension arrears to millions of state
workers.
	   ``There is no political crisis, but there is certain
socio-economic tension,'' Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said of
Russia during a visit to Belarus on Wednesday. Russia is pursuing
``reforms that should serve people.''
	   Primakov has said the government already paid off part of its
debt, including military wages, and promised to pay current wages
on time starting in October. He hasn't said, however, where the
government would get funds.

Communist Party fall meeting to discuss agricultural reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Slightly lifting the secrecy that normally
surrounds its workings, China's ruling Communist Party publicly
announced Wednesday the date of its fall policy meeting.
	   In a statement carried by the tightly controlled Xinhua News
Agency, the party said its influential Central Committee will
gather in Beijing Oct. 12-14.
	   Committee members will discuss progress in agriculture and
carrying out market reforms of state industries outlined by a
crucial party congress a year ago, the brief announcement said.
	   China's most powerful communists, from top leaders to provincial
power-brokers, sit on the Central Committee, which now has 344
members.
	   The group has usually met in secret once or twice a year to
endorse national policies. Its meetings are rarely announced
beforehand and its deliberations are normally not publicized until
after the meeting's end, if then.
	   Chinese leaders have slowly tried to move away from the opaque
political system of communist tradition and create a clearer
division of responsibilities among the party, the party-run
government and the party-dominated legislature.
	   The Xinhua report announcing the Central Committee conclave said
the dates were set by the powerful party Politburo on Monday.
Apparently the 22-member Politburo and its 7-member Standing
Committee, the apex of power in China, still meet in secret.

Moscow mayor says he may run for Russian presidency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said Wednesday that he
might run for the Russian presidency in two years if he feels no
other candidate can solve his country's problems.
	   Luzhkov, whose name is often mentioned as a candidate, said he
had not made up his mind.
	   ``But if I see that the contenders running for the presidency do
not have appropriate state positions and views that will bring
stability and prosperity, then I may thrown my hat into the ring,''
he said.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin has not categorically ruled out
running for re-election, but his standing was shaken badly this
summer when his government allowed the ruble to fall against
Western currencies and declared a moratorium on payments of loans.
	   Luzhkov, visiting Britain at the invitation of Prime Minister
Tony Blair, with whom he met Tuesday, called for a restructuring of
Russia's debt to the West to give the country ``a breathing
space.''
	   Luzhkov criticized Western lending practices to Russia, saying
that the International Monetary Fund and other institutions had
``made mistakes on a grand scale.''
	   Billions of Western dollars, he said, were spent on consumer
goods rather than industrial projects, ``which means the money was
thrown into the flames.''

Japan to propose dlrs 30 billion aid package for Asia

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Miyazawa about capital controls in
final grafs, EDITS to trim &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will present plans to spend about dlrs 30
billion to support Southeast Asian countries when finance officials
from the world's leading industrial nations meet this weekend,
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Wednesday.
	   Japan will offer aid including loan guarantees, interest-rate
subsidies and purchases of government bonds from Asian countries,
Miyazawa said.
	   Asia has been hit hard by a financial crisis that has plunged
many of the region's countries into recession, put millions out of
work, and fueled riots and political unrest.
	   Japan, though itself in recession, has been called on to lead
the region to recovery. With its strong trade links throughout the
area and a number of its manufacturers operating there, Japan's
fortunes are closely tied to those of the rest of Asia.
	   ``Japan will take the initiative,'' Miyazawa said. ``Although
the situation is severe domestically, we have enough funds to help
Southeast Asia. We feel that that is our responsibility
internationally.''
	   Miyazawa said the aid would be used to restructure Asian
businesses, establish social safety nets, and alleviate the credit
crunch that has resulted as deeply troubled banks have stopped
making new loans.
	   Miyazawa will propose the plan to finance ministers and central
bankers of Southeast Asian countries before formally presenting it
during the G-7 talks.
	   The meeting of finance ministers from the G-7 nations _ the
United States, Japan, Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada and France _
is to begin Saturday in Washington.
	   One of the countries that would likely benefit from the aid was
South Korea, whose president, Kim Dae-jung, is scheduled to visit
Japan next Wednesday. Japan was expected to offer a large aid
package to South Korea during the visit.
	   The money comes on top of tens of billions Japan has already
pledged to the region in aid packages sponsored by the
International Monetary Fund, for countries such as Thailand,
Indonesia and South Korea.
	   Miyazawa also suggested he would raise the issue of controls on
short-term international capital flows at the G-7 meeting, though
he quickly added that he would not propose imposing any formal
restrictions on international money flows.
	   ``After the emergence of financial turmoil in Asia, Russia and
emerging market countries since last year, we have realized the
adverse effects of short-term capital flows on the financial
markets,'' Miyazawa said.
	   Malaysia has implemented controversial controls on capital flows
that strictly regulate foreign investment in the country. While the
measures are expected to provide some short-term relief for the
country's currency, many analysts say the steps will impose larger
economic costs over time.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A gas explosion destroyed an apartment building in
central Kazakstan, and up to 15 people were feared dead, a news
report said Wednesday.
	   A five-story building in the town of Saran was ``split in two''
as the explosion collapsed the apartments in the middle of the
building, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Rescuers put out a fire and began sifting through the rubble for
survivors, the report added. The rescuers found the bodies of two

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - A five-hour taxi strike by the capital's
16,000 cabs Wednesday caused massive traffic jams around the city.
	   Athens taxis are among the cheapest in Europe and supplement the
city's buses, trolley and subways. The strike forced many suburban
residents to use their cars to get around the capital.
	   The taxi owners association is protesting a traffic regulation

Bulgaria faces possible FIFA suspension over federation ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Bulgaria could face suspension by
FIFA over a government decision to ban the national federation from
running soccer affairs, a spokesman for the game's world governing
body said Wednesday.
	   FIFA contacted the Bulgarian association at the beginning of
this week over the affair, but has set no deadline for authorities
to act, spokesman Keith Cooper said.
	   ``It's not a dramatic situation at the moment,'' Cooper added.
But ``it is within our power to suspend the federation from
international activity.''
	   In mid-September, the government Committee of Youth, Physical
Training and Sports banned the Bulgarian Soccer Union from running
soccer affairs, accusing it of failing to react to a positive
doping test of a local player.
	   The committee, which is empowered to license sports
organizations and teams, said it was revoking the license of the
Soccer Union and gave it to the Professional Soccer League, a part
of the Union including only professional teams.
	   That move is ``not acceptable to us,'' FIFA spokesman Cooper
said. But there is no reason to suppose England's European
Championship qualifying match against Bulgaria on Oct. 10 is in
danger, he said.
	   The government committee said the Union broke international and
Bulgarian regulations by allowing player Ilya Gruev to be included
in the national team although he had tested positive for
performance-enhancing drugs in April. Gruev plays for Neftochimik
in the Black Sea city of Burgas.
	   The Union is headed by Ivan Slavkov, son-in-law of late
communist ruler Todor Zhivkov. Slavkov has been criticized because
of Bulgaria's poor World Cup performance. The team was eliminated
in the first round of this summer's finals.
	   In August, Poland narrowly escaped suspension by FIFA with a
last-minute move by the country's sport minister to comply with a
deadline for the reinstatement of suspended administrators.
	   FIFA and UEFA, the European governing body, had threatened to
suspend Poland indefinitely if the administrators, suspended in
May, were not reinstated.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing figures &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mostly lower
Wednesday, with investors discouraged by a smaller-than-expected
U.S. interest rate cut and negative local news.
	   Japan's key stock index plunged 3 percent to its lowest level in
more than 12 years after a widely expected injection of public
funds to shore up the market on the last day of the fiscal half
failed to materialize.
	   Hong Kong stocks ended moderately higher, but trading volume
fell to its lowest level in almost three years as investors held
back ahead of a long holiday weekend.
	   Market participants generally were disappointed by the
conservative U.S. interest rate cut, saying it was too small to
spur the region's economies.
	   ``There's no real impact,'' said Shamus Mok, economist for the
Bank of East Asia Ltd.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve cut the federal-funds rate a quarter
percentage point to 5.25 percent Tuesday, the first change in
interest rates in a year and a half.
	   In disappointment over the mild reduction, Wall Street's
best-known index fell 0.35 percent to 8,080.52 points Tuesday.
	   However, domestic issues rather than U.S. market news caused
Japan's share prices to fall.
	   The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues tumbled 415.04 points
to 13,406.39, its lowest closing level since February 1986. On
Tuesday, the average had slid 87.94 points.
	   Investors panicked when the government didn't inject public
funds to buy stocks as expected, traders said.
	   ``Players had been expecting that public fund buying would
support the market, but when that didn't happen they had to cut
their losses,'' said Hideyuki Okoshi, a manager at Chuo Securities.

Orthodox leaders try to end conflict in Bulgarian church
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos SOF101-102
 &UR; By VESELIN TOSHKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Heads of Orthodox Churches gathered
Wednesday to discuss a schism which has plagued the Bulgarian
Orthodox Church for seven years.
	   The Pan-Orthodox convention of clergy is chaired by Ecumenical
Patriarch Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of nearly 300
millions of Orthodox Christians.
	   ``We shall try to help the Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox church
overcome the trial it is experiencing now,'' Patriarch Bartholomew
said ahead of the forum, which is held behind closed doors in
Sofia's main cathedral, Alexander Nevski.
	   Bulgarians regained religious freedom in 1989 after almost five
decades of officially sponsored atheism under the communist regime.
	   But since 1991, the country's main church has been split between
supporters of Patriarch Maxim, who served as church leader under
communist rule, and Pymen, whose followers seceded in 1991 and
proclaimed him patriarch in 1996. Maxim promptly declared him
expelled from the church.
	   Pymen's supporters accuse Maxim of serving the secret police
before communist rule collapsed in 1989. Maxim dismisses the
charge.
	   The conflict has led to some violent clashes between the two
factions. Government efforts to mediate have so far been fruitless.
	   President Petar Stoyanov has repeatedly urged Patriarch Maxim
and his rival Pymen to quit in order to end the split their
antagonist factions have caused in the country's main church.
	   Angered by the prelates' refusal to back down, Stoyanov has
refused to invite any church officials to serve traditional masses
at official holidays since the start of this year.
	   ``Overcoming the rift is an important task and since it is
dangerous for the church, it should be curbed,'' Russian Patriarch
Alexy II said.
	   ``Unfortunately a rift exists not only in Bulgaria, but in
Ukraine too, there also are symptoms of rift beginning in Serbia
and the United States. The rift violates the church cannons,'' the
Patriarch added.
	   As in most European countries where Orthodoxy prevails, the
Bulgarian Orthodox church has claimed the role of preserving the
nation's culture as well as saving souls.
	   The vast majority of ethnic Bulgarians, who make up about 7.7
million of the country's 8.5 million citizens, are of Orthodox
heritage. There are also smaller Muslim, Jewish, Catholic, Armenian
Apostolic and Protestant communities.
	   But the legacy of communism has polarized this poor Balkan land,
including the Orthodox church and its priests.
	   The power struggle has seriously damaged the image of the
Orthodox church and prevented it from being a moral compass for the
post-Communist age.
	   A number of small, non-traditional denominations such as the
Jehovah's Witnesses and followers of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
Unification Church have sprung up to fill the vacuum. Orthodox
prelates and many parents dismiss the denominations as sects and
fear their growing influence over young people.
	   Many Orthodox churches, particularly in Russia and Eastern
Europe, perceive Protestant missionary work as a threat to their
flocks, whose connection with the Orthodox church was eroded during
decades of Communist rule.
	   Conservative opponents of Bartholomew have expressed also fears
that he is too quickly pushing a dialogue to reunite the Orthodox
and Roman Catholic faiths.
	   The two churches, one based in Rome and the other in Istanbul,
Turkey, split in the year 1054 in what became known as the Great
Schism.

Hungarian minority may leave government over university rift
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Angered over a broken promise, the
party that represents 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians looks set to
withdraw from the Romanian government Wednesday, marking another
rift in the governing coalition.
	   The Union of Democratic Hungarians in Romania wants a state
university in its own language, but its political partners now
think a multi-lingual university would be a better solution.
	   Earlier this month, the party issued an ultimatum which expires
later Wednesday, saying it would withdraw its two ministers from
Cabinet if parliament did not pass a law allowing for the
university.
	   ``The board of the party will meet later to see how we will
leave the ruling coalition... first the two ministers will
resign,'' said Bela Marko, leader of the Hungarian party, quoted by
daily Evenimentul Zilei. The Hungarians have the health and
minority relations ministries.
	   Since reformers came to power in Nov. 1996, the four-party
coalition has been hampered by bickering, which has slowed down
vital economic and democratic reforms.
	   The other three coalition parties, the Peasant Party, the
Liberal Party and the Democratic Party, say they do not want the
Hungarians to leave but could govern without them.
	   In 1996, the coalition agreed to set up a Hungarian-language
university, but parliament's upper house refused to approve the
necessary modification to the existing education law.
	   Lawmakers refer to bitter historical disputes and say that
European norms do not require the Hungarians to have their own
state university. Transylvania, where most Hungarians live, has
changed hands over the centuries.
	   Education Minister Andrei Marga came forward with the idea of a
``Romanian-German-Hungarian multicultural university,'' but the
Hungarians disagreed.
	   The lower chamber of parliament could override the upper house
but has refused to do so.

Israeli-Palestinian deal brings both cautious welcome and
</HEADLINE>
opposition &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordanian commentators reacted cautiously
on Wednesday to the White House-brokered deal on a further Israeli
troop pullback from the West Bank, calling for action as well as
words from Israel.
	   But hard-liners in Iraq and Syria accused Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat of making too many concessions.
	   ``The Israeli measures to swallow the Palestinians' land is
being done with American support and encouragement,'' said Iraq's
Al-Thawra daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party.
	   The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, an
opposition faction based in the Syrian capital Damascus, accused
Arafat of ``new concessions'' and called for ``an immediate stop to
negotiations.''
	   In Jordan, even moderate newspapers raised questions about
Arafat's acceptance Tuesday of an an Israeli offer to withdraw from
over 13 percent of the West Bank's land, 3 percent of which will be
a ``nature reserve.''
	   Many newspapers in the Arab world did not carry editorial's on
Arafat's move because their deadlines had passed when the
announcement was made. On Wednesday, Arab countries made no
official statements about the decision.
	   The proposed pullback would be a second stage of Israel's
withdrawal from West Bank land. Israel earlier gave the
Palestinians full control of about 3 percent of West Bank land and
agreed to share control over 24 percent.
	   In Washington on Tuesday, Arafat said he agreed to the Israeli
offer ``to facilitate the negotiations'' for an overall West Bank
settlement. He spoke to reporters at the White House after meeting
with U.S. President Clinton.
	   It remained unclear how the ``nature reserve'' would be
governed.
	   The Palestinian envoy to Washington, Hassan Abdel-Rahman, told
Egypt's Sawt al-Arab radio that agreeing to the reserve was not a
concession ``because this area will still be under the complete
administrative and civil control of the Palestinian Authority,
while the security control will be under joint Israeli-Palestinian
control.''
	   In Jordan, the mass circulation Al-Ra'i carried a front-page
editorial saying the Israeli offer was worthwhile but was not
enough to achieve peace.
	   ``This step gives new hopes for breaking the deadlock which has
for long griped the peace process,'' the Arabic-language Al-Ra'i
said. ``But there must be other steps, otherwise, this will be just
a publicity stunt.''
	   The Jordan Times, a liberal English-language daily, was more
skeptical.
	   ``So what happens after the next redeployment?'' it asked. ``Can
Netanyahu and Israel at large lay aside the rhetoric and make an
effort for peace?''
	   The Times said a Palestinian state was inevitable.
	   ``The options are clear: a unilateral declaration of an
independent Palestine or multilateral recognition of an independent
Palestine,'' the paper said. ``Either way, there will be a state.''
	   In Kuwait, Al-Watan daily carried a cartoon that shows Arafat
appearing to make progress in a row boat. But the boat's bottom is
torn out, and Arafat is actually stumbling along the rock-strewn
floor of the sea.

Another relief agency withdraws from North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo HK101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An international relief agency announced
Wednesday that it is withdrawing from North Korea because the
government has ordered it to stop treating starving and sick people
and to supply the local pharmaceutical industry instead.
	   ``We are being forced to pull out, and we don't understand
why,'' said Dr. Dominique Lafontaine of Doctors Without Borders, a
European charity. ``They do not acknowledge the fact that there is
huge humanitarian need'' because of famine.
	   The agency recently withdrew 11 of its 13 professionals,
including nine doctors, when talks with the communist government
broke down. It said the last two were leaving Wednesday.
	   Doctors Without Borders is one of about half a dozen relief
agencies that have set up operations within North Korea to help the
secretive country cope with its 3-year-old famine.
	   In early August, the Paris-based Doctors of the World left North
Korea when the government denied it access to a large population of
malnourished and sick children.
	   U.S. officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of
North Korea this summer said 2 million North Koreans _ nearly 10
percent of the population _ may have died in the famine.
	   It was caused by two years of flooding and a drought that
devastated the country's inefficient state-run farming system.
	   Food shortages and widespread public health problems appear to
have left every sector of the nation's economy in ruins, except the
gigantic military that North Korea maintains.
	   That has left the country's 23 million people largely dependent
on foreign aid. But the government often frustrates relief agencies
by setting restrictions on how they can operate, where they can go
and which sectors of the public they can treat.
	   The government also has prevented many foreign journalists from
entering the country, which sometimes reduces the amount of money
that relief agencies can raise from the rest of the world.
	   Dr. Eric Goemaere, director-general of Doctors Without Borders,
said that it was ``forced to pull out'' its last two remaining
doctors when North Korean officials told the organization to stop
distributing medical aid.
	   The agency was forced to shut down its 1,400 health centers in
four provinces north of Pyongyang, where it was providing the
nation with basic medical equipment and medicines that it lacks,
and helping to train local doctors and health workers.
	   Doctors Without Borders also helped more than 15,000 children at
64 feeding centers in the provinces. But Goemaere and Lafontaine
said that restrictions on whom the relief agency could feed often
left them frustrated.
	   ``Without any antiseptics or antibiotics, the people will be
forced to go back to'' ineffective herbal medicines, said Goemaere.
	   Despite the prospects of a grim winter, North Korean officials
had asked the agency to focus on supplying raw materials and
chemicals for the production of basic antibiotics at the country's
own dysfunctional plants.
	   For instance, Goemaere said, such plants need large supplies of
acid derivatives and raw penicillin to produce something as simple
as basic aspirin and antibiotics.
	   The country's hospitals are so ill-equipped that Lafontaine said
that abortions and appendectomies are being performed without
antiseptics, anesthesia, or even gloves. Incisions are being made
using ordinary scissors, and intravenous infusions are being
applied with homemade tubes and bottle drips.
	   Video footage brought back by the health workers showed local
doctors manually grinding roots and tree bark using rusty
equipment. Half-empty bottles were lined up on hospital shelves,
and powdered herbs were being laid out to dry on linoleum floors.
	   Lafontaine said many hospitals and clinics outside Pyongyang
suffer severe power outages and lack of clean water, forcing many
to drink from polluted rivers and streams. Many people are
suffering from typhoid and intestinal infections, he said.
	   ``We know some hospitals are refusing to take patients because
the problem is too great,'' said Lafontaine.
	   He said thousands of children _ ridden with scabs and
frost-bitten toes, _ were roaming the streets and being denied
medical aid because the government had decided they were ``not a
priority.''
	   Earlier reports from North Korea have accused the government of
using donations to feed the military and government loyalists,
leaving other people without any aid at all.
	   Goemaere urged other relief agencies to remain in North Korea,
but to fight the restrictions they face by demanding concessions
before more aid is sent in.

Reports: Positive drug test on soccer player covered up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ In another blow to Italy's scandal-shaken soccer
world, newspapers reported Wednesday that a positive drug test on a
first-division player was covered up.
	   Corriere della Sera, Italy's most important paper, said
Wednesday that random tests were done on four players after the
Jan. 4 Roma-Udinese game. One Udiense player tested positive, the
newspaper said, but the lab altered the test results.
	   The report comes just two days after the head of the Italian
Olympic Committee, Mario Pescante, resigned amid growing criticism
that drug tests were not conducted properly.
	   Corriere said that the chemist who handled the Roma-Udinese
tests has talked to the prosecutor looking into alleged drug use by
soccer players, Raffaele Guariniello. The chemist said his superior
ordered him to alter the test results.
	   The Udinese players that underwent the post-game tests were
Francesco Statuto and Alessandro Calori. Udinese won the game 2-1.
	   Udinese official Sergio Vignoni said the team was not aware of
the alleged test falsification. ``We are amazed,'' he said.
	   The urine tests were performed at lab designated by the Italian
Olympic Committee, which oversees Italy's antidoping program. It is
on the outskirts of Rome.
	   There have been a series of doping investigations this year into
Italian athletes. One investigation, done for the Olympic
Committee's doping commission, ended in August without finding
evidence of illegal drug use, but did find that the use of legal
muscle-builders is widespread.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordanian commentators reacted cautiously
on Wednesday to the White House-brokered deal on a further Israeli
troop pullback from the West Bank, calling for action as well as
words from Israel.
	   But hard-liners in Iraq and Syria accused Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat of making too many concessions.
	   ``The Israeli measures to swallow the Palestinians' land is
being done with American support and encouragement,'' said Iraq's
Al-Thawra daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party.
	   The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, an
opposition faction based in the Syrian capital Damascus, accused
Arafat of ``new concessions'' and called for ``an immediate stop to
negotiations.''
	   In Jordan, even moderate newspapers raised questions about
Arafat's acceptance Tuesday of an Israeli offer to withdraw from
over 13 percent of the West Bank's land, 3 percent of which will be
a ``nature reserve.''
	   Many newspapers in the Arab world did not carry editorial's on
Arafat's move because their deadlines had passed when the
announcement was made. On Wednesday, Arab countries made no
official statements about the decision.
	   The proposed pullback would be a second stage of Israel's
withdrawal from West Bank land. Israel earlier gave the
Palestinians full control of about 3 percent of West Bank land and
agreed to share control over 24 percent.
	   In Washington on Tuesday, Arafat said he agreed to the Israeli
offer ``to facilitate the negotiations'' for an overall West Bank
settlement. He spoke to reporters at the White House after meeting
with U.S. President Clinton.
	   It remained unclear how the ``nature reserve'' would be
governed.
	   The Palestinian envoy to Washington, Hassan Abdel-Rahman, told
Egypt's Sawt al-Arab radio that agreeing to the reserve was not a
concession ``because this area will still be under the complete
administrative and civil control of the Palestinian Authority,
while the security control will be under joint Israeli-Palestinian
control.''
	   In Jordan, the mass circulation Al-Ra'i carried a front-page
editorial saying the Israeli offer was worthwhile but was not
enough to achieve peace.
	   ``This step gives new hopes for breaking the deadlock which has
long gripped the peace process,'' the Arabic-language Al-Ra'i said.
``But there must be other steps, otherwise, this will be just a
publicity stunt.''
	   The Jordan Times, a liberal English-language daily, was more
skeptical.
	   ``So what happens after the next redeployment?'' it asked. ``Can
Netanyahu and Israel at large lay aside the rhetoric and make an
effort for peace?''
	   The Times said a Palestinian state was inevitable.
	   ``The options are clear: a unilateral declaration of an
independent Palestine or multilateral recognition of an independent
Palestine,'' the paper said. ``Either way, there will be a state.''

Clashes following funeral of Hamas activist killed in explosion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BIDDOU, West Bank (AP) _ Hundreds of Palestinians clashed
Wednesday with Israeli troops after the funeral of a Hamas activist
who was killed when a car rigged with powerful explosives blew up.
	   Two Hamas activists who survived Tuesday's blast denied that the
blast went off while they were rigging the car for a bombing attack
in Israel, Palestinian police officials said.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
over renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to carry
out suicide bombings in the Jewish state. Hamas wants to avenge the
recent killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   On Tuesday, shortly after the car explosion in an industrial
zone of Beitunia, a West Bank village near Ramallah, Israel sealed
its borders with the Palestinian areas for Yom Kippur, the holiest
day in the Jewish calendar. The closure was to be lifted gradually
after 1 a.m. Thursday (2300 gmt Wednesday).
	   Israel shuts down during Yom Kippur and there was no official
comment on the Beitunia explosion.
	   The man killed in the blast, Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, was buried
Wednesday in his home village of Biddou, near Ramallah. Hundreds of
villager walked in the funeral procession led by one marcher with a
Hamas flag.
	   After the funeral, about 400 teen-agers and young men rushed
toward a nearby Jewish settlement, Har Adar, and began throwing
stones at Israeli soldiers posted at the gates.
	   Troops fired rubber bullets and gear gas and six protesters were
injured.
	   Zahran and his two friends, Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid, also
from Biddou, had been arrested twice by Israel and twice by the
Palestinian Authority for being involved in Hamas activities.
	   The Abu Eid brothers told Palestinian investigators, however,
that they were not rigging the car for a bombing in Israel when the
blast went off Tuesday.
	   They said that just before the explosion, they met an Israeli
Arab man in the car parked in the Beitunia industrial zone,
expecting him to deliver three guns and pistols for dlrs 1,000.
	   The brothers said they sat in the front and Zahran sat in the
back with the Israeli Arab whose name is not being released by
Palestinian police. The Abu Eids said they wanted to conclude the
transaction quickly and therefore did not look in the bag the
Israeli Arab handed them before getting out of the car. They said
the bag exploded shortly after they started the car.
	   The Abu Eid brothers were taken to nearby Ramallah Hospital
where they remained in stable condition Wednesday, under police
guard.
	   Palestinian police said a middleman who set up the meeting
between the three Hamas activists and the Israeli Arab has been
arrested.

Cambodian government says no plans to question opposition leader

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ In an apparent move to ease
political tensions, the government said Wednesday there were no
plans to summon junior opposition party leader Sam Rainsy for
questioning about recent turmoil.
	   It was the second time in two days that the ruling Cambodian
People's Party had responded positively to opposition concerns.
	   On Tuesday, it was announced that both the government and
opposition parties would send letters to the National Election
Committee requesting a reconciliation of used and unused ballots
from July's election.
	   The action was one of two moves requested by the opposition in
its protests over the polls, which it claims Co-Premier Hun Sen's
party won through fraud and intimidation. Agreement on the letters
came in the first round of working group negotiations to clear away
post-election problems and form a new government.
	   Hun Sen has publicly threatened Sam Rainsy with arrest at least
twice for his role in anti-government demonstrations that followed
Hun Sen's election victory. He also accused the outspoken
politician of being behind a mysterious grenade attack on his home,
which hurt no one and caused little damage.
	   Fearing arrest or assassination, Sam Rainsy took refuge in a
United Nations office in Phnom Penh for slightly more than a week
in early September. He emerged to take part in a meeting of
government and opposition leaders, and to be sworn in with other
members of parliament last Thursday.
	   Responding to what it called rumors intended to ``pollute the
political climate,'' the Information Ministry said Wednesday that
``at the present time ... the court has no plans to summon His
Excellency Sam Rainsy to appear before it.''
	   Hun Sen's party captured 64 of 122 seats in parliament in the
election, but not the two-thirds needed to form a government on its
own.
	   The government used two alleged attempts on Hun's Sen's life _
the grenade incident and an equally mysterious rocket attack on his
convoy last Thursday _ as an excuse to put pressure the opposition.
The FUNCINPEC party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh and the Sam Rainsy
Party had been threatening to boycott parliament.
	   Hun Sen has claimed several plots on his life in recent years,
and usually cracked down on his opponents in their aftermath.
	   Hun Sen's government imposed a ban on foreign travel for elected
opposition lawmakers and also pointedly noted that if opposition
members did not attend the convening of parliament, they would lose
their parliamentary immunity from arrest.
	   The foreign travel ban was lifted after the opposition attended
the ceremonial opening of parliament last week.
	   Both Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy flew to Bangkok, Thailand. Neither
has returned amid fears that their arrests were still planned if
negotiations did not proceed smoothly.
	   Meanwhile, sources at the Royal Palace said Wednesday that King
Norodom Sihanouk plans to leave Cambodia next week for medical
treatment in Beijing.
	   Sihanouk's mediating efforts helped end violent police
confrontations with anti-government demonstrators in Phnom Penh in
September.
	   The 75-year-old monarch suffers from a variety of illnesses and
periodically visits doctors in China for treatment. He was
diagnosed with colon cancer in 1993, but it has since gone into
remission.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Four members of an international aid
agency were injured when their vehicle hit a landmine in Kosovo,
officials said Wednesday.
	   The incident occurred early Wednesday, on the Donje
Obriga-Likovac road, 30 kilometers (17 miles) west of Pristina.
Three ethnic Albanians and a foreigner working for the
International Committee of the Red Cross were injured, two of them
seriously, said Col. Bozidar Filic, spokesman for Serbian police in
Kosovo.
	   Roland Sidler, spokesman for the Red Cross in Geneva, confirmed
the report. Sidler said the injured were being treated at the
hospital in Pristina.
	   Some 250,000 people have been displaced in the southern Serb
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence. Hundreds of aid workers have been struggling to
provide the displaced with food and shelter, before winter sets in.

European Council visitors denied visas for media conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian authorities have refused to
issue visas to several European Council officials scheduled to
attend a conference on media freedom, and the meeting will likely
be canceled as a result, conference organizers said Wednesday.
	   ``The act signaled a new government clampdown on free speech and
a continuation of this regime's persistent stifling of fledgling
independent media,'' said Veran Matic, manager of the Association
of Independent Electronic Media.
	   The international conference, entitled ``Broadcasting for a
Democratic Europe,'' sponsored by the European Council, was due to
begin this Friday.
	   It was to be first of its kind in Serbian capital Belgrade.
	   Visas were withheld for as many as eighteen European Council
visitors and eight of these had their visa applications refused
outright, Matic said. Most were British or Dutch citizens.
	   Matic added that the entire conference now comes into question
and would likely be postponed.
	   The association addressed a complaint to the ministry of
interior but was referred to the ministry of information were they
were unable to obtain any explanations.
	   ``It goes to show the full hypocrisy of the regime _ while
proclaiming to want membership to the European Council, it harasses
independent media and stifles the very principles the Council
stands for,'' Matic said
	   Foreign reporters and employees of humanitarian agencies have
also reported long and unexplained delays in trying to get visas.

fighting is Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte, retired

	   PARIS (AP) _ Germany's chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, on
his first foreign trip, arrived in France Wednesday seeking to
dispel worries that his desire for closer ties with Britain could
whittle down Paris' role in Europe.
	   Schroeder warmly clasped hands with conservative President
Jacques Chirac in their first-ever meeting. The two exchanged a few
words in English and then a joke. The French leader laughed
heartily.
	   Schroeder arrived in a chauffeur-driven French limousine,
sitting next to foreign policy adviser Brigitte Sauzay, a former
interpreter for the late French President Francois Mitterrand.
	   Schroeder scheduled a news conference at the end of his visit.
	   The French-German axis was critical to building a stronger
European Union, including the euro single currency that takes
effect in January. The two countries are each other's largest
trading partners.
	   But Schroeder, whose weekend election victory spelled the end to
16 years of rule by conservative Chancellor Helmut Kohl, has caused
jitters in Paris because of his interest in better ties with
London.
	   In contrast with Kohl, who lived through World War II,
Schroeder, 54, represents a new generation of Germans that some
French officials feel will be less burdened by the past.
	   The Social Democrat, who speaks English but not French, was
expected to reaffirm his commitment to strong relations with France
during lunch with conservative Chirac and a meeting with Socialist
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.

German Social Democrats irked by toothpaste ad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Social Democrats weren't smiling about a
toothpaste ad appearing in newspapers Wednesday that takes
unauthorized advantage of chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's
winning smile.
	   The full-page ad for Perlweiss toothpaste includes a headshot of
Schroeder flashing his broad, toothy grin over the slogan ``He
showed them all.''
	   The Social Democrats general manager Franz Muentefering said the
party would send a complaint to the British firm that makes the
toothpaste, Carter-Woolis, and the German Advertising Council.
	   German law allows the unauthorized use of photos of public
figures for journalistic or satirical purposes, but not for
advertising, he said.
	   Muentefering said the party would not take legal action against
the firm unless it keeps running the ad.

Five Poles detained in illegal arms sales
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prosecutors in the Baltic port city of
Gdansk questioned five men Wednesday on suspicion of illegal
weapons sales to Croatia, Yemen and Somalia.
	   The men were detained Tuesday by Poland's secret service,
according to Magdalena Kluczynska, spokeswoman for the State
Protection Office.
	   None of the five were identified, but a prosecutor who spoke on
condition of anonymity said they included executives of two private
arms exporting companies in Warsaw.
	   Prosecutors said they expected to file charges and issue arrest
warrants as soon as Wednesday afternoon. If convicted of illegal
arms sales, the suspects could face up to 12 years in prison.
	   Kluczynska said investigators found customs and financial
documents proving that Kalashnikov assault rifles, pistols, grenade
launchers and ammunition were exported from Poland to Croatia,
Yemen and Somalia from 1992 to 1996, when all those territories
were under a United Nations arms embargo.
	   The weapons, worth about dlrs 6 million, first went to Latvia
and Estonia before reaching the destinations, which all were war
zones at the time, Kluczynska said. Some weapons made their way
into smuggling rings that sold them to organized crime gangs in
Poland and other countries, she said.
	   Gdansk prosecutors opened the investigation this month after
Polish, Latvian and Estonian security officers provided information
about the illegal sales.
	   One of the investigators, Gdansk prosecutor Jacek Spyt, said one
company exported 1,000 Polish-made Kalashnikovs, 14,000 pistols and
160 howitzers from 1992 to 1994 to Estonia and Latvia, with most of
the weapons eventually going to Croatia and Somalia. He said the
rest of the arms were sold to an Estonian company that had no
license to deal in weapons.
	   Poland, once a leading weapons manufacturer and exporter, has
seen sales dwindle since the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989. Most
weapons trade now gets handled by private companies, often run by
retired military or secret service officers, instead of state
weapons makers that flourished under Communist rule.

Blair seeks at Labor conference to break impasse of IRA arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Blair-Adams meeting, other details; trims pvs to
tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied
Sinn Fein party, said Wednesday that demands for the Irish
Republican Army to start surrending weapons should not hold up the
formation of Northern Ireland's new administration.
	   ``The time frame should not be allowed to slip,'' Adams told
reporters after a 40-minute meeting with Prime Minister Tony Blair
during the governing Labor Party's annual conference. ``People
should not be allowed to hardball each other or go down to the wire
on this.''
	   Blair also was meeting members of Northern Ireland's main
Protestant and Catholic parties Wednesday in a new bid to break the
impasse over IRA weapons.
	   Adams wants two posts for Sinn Fein in a new multi-party
administration, which will be drawn from the 108-member
power-sharing Assembly set up as part of Northern Ireland's
historic peace agreement.
	   April's agreement specifies that the administration must hold a
summit meeting with the Irish government by Oct. 31.
	   But David Trimble, head of the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party
and leader of the administration, is insisting the IRA start
decomissioning to show the sincerity of its 14-month-old truce
before Sinn Fein could assume any such posts.
	   Trimble says he and his Catholic deputy could meet with the
Irish government; Adams is insisting the entire administration must
be appointed in time to participate in the meeting.
	   The peace accord calls for the IRA and the province's outlawed
pro-British paramilitary groups to disarm under international
supervision by mid-2000, but set no deadline for the process to
start.
	   Underlining the huge change since the Belfast peace agreement,
Adams passed through the security cordons that surround the annual
gathering of Britain's governing party _ once used primarily to
guard against an IRA assassination attempt on Cabinet ministers.
	   He addressed meetings in hotels, calling for a united Ireland
and denouncing what he sees as Protestant intransigence, and
listened to Blair's keynote address Tuesday in the conference
chamber.
	   Trimble and Seamus Mallon, his moderate Catholic deputy in the
new Northern Ireland assembly, were both to address the conference
Wednesday.
	   Mallon, of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, criticized
both Trimble and Adams.
	   In a radio interview Wednesday, he said Trimble should not make
disarmament a condition for forming the administration and that
Adams should recognize the importance of disarmament to sustaining
Protestant faith in the peace process.
	   ```Trust is a two-way street,'' Mallon said.

U.S. medical team seeks to help victims of embassy bombings

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher on
Wednesday led a team of medical specialists to Africa to help
victims of terrorist attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
	   ``We want to build on the long-term partnership that has existed
between our countries to help innocent Kenyans who suffered in the
bombing,'' Satcher said at a news conference.
	   ``At the same time, we want to help Kenya prepare to meet future
medical disasters, regardless of their cause.''
	   The bombings on Aug. 7 killed 259 people, including 12
Americans, and injured more than 5,500.
	   The U.S. team includes plastic surgeons with experience in
physical reconstruction, and a psychiatrist who worked in Oklahoma
City, where 168 people were killed in a bombing in 1995.
	   The team planned to leave Nairobi on Thursday for Dar es Salaam.
	   Besides meeting the immediate physical and emotional needs of
bombing victims, the United States will consider helping set up a
disaster response center in Kenya, Satcher said.
	   In addition to providing assistance using resources of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Satcher said he will
report to Congress on additional needs.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has requested dlrs 50 million in
emergency assistance funding from Congress for Tanzania and Kenya.
	   The U.S. government already has contributed dlrs 3.2 million in
assistance to the two countries.
	   On Friday, the Kenyan government planned to pay the first 32
death claims of 100,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 1,667) each.

Clashes follow funeral of Hamas activist killed in explosion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BIDDOU, West Bank (AP) _ Hundreds of Palestinians clashed
Wednesday with Israeli troops after the funeral of a Hamas activist
killed when a car rigged with powerful explosives blew up.
	   Two Hamas activists who survived Tuesday's blast denied they
were rigging the car for a bombing attack in Israel, Palestinian
police officials said.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
over renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to carry
out suicide bombings in the Jewish state. Hamas wants to avenge the
recent killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   On Tuesday, shortly after the car exploded in an industrial zone
of Beitunia, a West Bank village near Ramallah, Israel sealed its
borders with the Palestinian areas for Yom Kippur, the holiest day
in the Jewish calendar. The closure was to be lifted gradually
after 1 a.m. Thursday (2300 gmt Wednesday).
	   Israel shuts down during Yom Kippur and there was no official
comment on the Beitunia explosion.
	   The man killed in the blast, Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, was buried
Wednesday in his home village of Biddou, near Ramallah. Hundreds of
villagers walked in the funeral procession led by one marcher with
a Hamas flag.
	   After the funeral, about 400 teen-agers and young men rushed
toward a nearby Jewish settlement, Har Adar, and began throwing
stones at Israeli soldiers posted at the gates.
	   Troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas. Six protesters were
injured.
	   Zahran and his two friends, Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid, also
from Biddou, had been arrested twice by Israel and twice by the
Palestinian Authority for being involved in Hamas activities.
	   The Abu Eid brothers told Palestinian investigators, however,
that they were not rigging the car for a bombing in Israel when the
blast went off Tuesday.
	   They said that just before the explosion, they met an Israeli
Arab man in the car parked in the Beitunia industrial zone,
expecting him to deliver three guns for dlrs 1,000.
	   The brothers said they sat in the front and Zahran sat in the
back with the Israeli Arab whose name is not being released by
Palestinian police. The Abu Eids said they wanted to conclude the
transaction quickly and therefore did not look in the bag the
Israeli Arab handed them before getting out of the car. They said
the bag exploded shortly after they started the car.
	   The Abu Eid brothers were taken to nearby Ramallah Hospital
where they remained in stable condition Wednesday, under police
guard.
	   Palestinian police said a middleman who set up the meeting
between the three Hamas activists and the Israeli Arab has been
arrested.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An ethnic Albanian working for an
international aid agency in Kosovo died and three other people were
injured Wednesday, when their vehicle hit a landmine, officials
said.
	   The incident occurred early Wednesday, when a vehicle for the
International Committee of the Red Cross ran over a landmine on the
Donje Obriga-Likovac road, 30 kilometers (17 miles) west of
Pristina, said Col. Bozidar Filic, spokesman for Serbian police in
Kosovo.
	   Roland Sidler, spokesman for the Red Cross in Geneva, confirmed
the report. Sidler said the injured were being treated at the
hospital in Pristina.
	   Shpetim Rrobaj, a doctor working for the Red Cross died of his
injures late Wednesday. A foreigner and two other Albanians were
also injured, one of them seriously.
	   Some 250,000 people have been displaced in the southern Serb
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence. Hundreds of aid workers have been struggling to
provide the displaced with food and shelter, before winter sets in.

EU Commission says enlargement talks make `good progress.'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Wednesday
talks to admit five eastern neighbors and Cyprus into the European
Union are going well. Significantly, it gave no inkling that 2 or
2003 entry date _ a target set by the candidates _ was unrealistic.
	   The Commission issued a generally upbeat report on preliminary
negotiations, that began March 31, to bring Hungary, Poland, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus into the European
Union.
	   The report, to be discussed next Monday by the EU foreign
ministers, says all six are determined to be ready for membership
by 2002 or 2003.
	   Though it said it was still early days, the report did not
dispute the target entry dates. It urged the 15 EU governments to
``take the negotiating process a step further'' by launching formal
talks Nov. 10 and move away from initial ``screening''
negotiations.
	   Thus, the EU ``would maintain the dynamism (and) the historical
importance'' of its most ambitious enlargement ever, added the
report.
	   It is expected to find a cool welcome in some quarters. Spain,
Greece, Portugal and Ireland fear widening the club may cost them
economic and other benefits.
	   Their fears _ and the feeling in Germany, the Netherlands,
Sweden and Austria _ that it's high time to make membership fees
more equitable _ are holding up talks to revamp the EU budget ahead
of enlargement.
	   To become an EU member, candidates must adopt the entire
spectrum of EU rules, regulations and laws.
	   These cover 31 chapters _ from agriculture, energy, foreign
affairs and monetary union to corporate and banking laws, consumer
health protection and telecommunications standards and practices.
	   Estonia has told the EU by 2002 or 2003 it will be EU-compatible
in 12 chapters, Hungary in 11. Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia
and Cyprus say they will comply with seven chapters by then.
	   The Commission report called that ``good progress (though) it is
too early to draw conclusions at this stage''' about when the first
newcomers can join.
	   It urged the member states to agree to open formal negotiations
Nov. 10 to ``allow the European Union to give a positive signal to
the applicant countries by moving the negotiations forward towards
a concrete stage.''
	   EU officials said much work remains to be done. One source, who
asked not to be named, said even though the six candidates work
hard to comply with EU laws already on the books, they must also
take on board all EU legislation that will be passed between now
and their entry date.
	   ``On top of that, we have to make sure that they will be able to
enforce EU laws,'' said the official.
	   In addition to six countries negotiating with the EU, five
others _ Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria _ are
also in line to join albeit much later, plus Malta which reapplied
Sept. 11 after its previous government put EU membership on ice.

Jim Carrey wins minor battle in defamation case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Hollywood star Jim Carrey had a
minor victory
	   Wednesday in a court case in which he is suing an Australian
magazine which described him as a groper.
	   A Supreme Court judge ruled out a submission by lawyers
representing Woman's Day magazine in the defamation case that an
article headlined ``Hollywood Stars Ban Groper Jim'' meant that
Carrey was ``psychologically unstable,''
	   Justice John Hedigan noted that the headline had described the
plaintiff as ``Groper Jim,'' not ``Crazy Jim.''
	   Hedigan said the phrase, ``psychologically unstable is so wide
as to be virtually meaningless.''
	   The judge said that aspect of the defense would be disallowed.
	   The defamation action is continuing and is expected to go before
a jury on a date yet to be set.
	   Carrey, star of successful movies including ``The Mask,''
``Liar, Liar'' and ``The Truman Show,'' is suing Australian
Consolidated Publishing, publishers of Woman's Day, over an article
published in the magazine last year.
	   The actor claims the article suggested actresses had refused to
work with
	   him as a result of his offensive behaviour.
	   The defamation action says the article claims that Carrey had
sexually harassed Alicia Silverstone, Jennifer Tilley, Drew
Barrymore and Courtney Love.
	   Carrey argues that the article meant he was crude, lewd and
disgusting in
	   his personal life and in his professional life dealt with
actresses in that manner.

Qatar submits report to World Court on disputed islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Qatar submitted a report Wednesday to the
International Court of Justice, seeking to refute Bahrain's
allegations that it used forged documents to stake claim over
disputed territories.
	   The report provides proof that the ownership documents it
submitted to the world court were authentic, said a Qatari official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. He did not give details.
	   Neighbors Bahrain and Qatar have been feuding since the
mid-1980s over water boundaries, the Hawar islands in the Gulf and
the Zubara land strip in Qatar where Bahrain's royal family used to
live 200 years ago.
	   Qatar was asked by the world court to provide an interim report
``as comprehensive and specific as possible'' by Sept. 30 in reply
to allegations in April by Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheik
Mohammed bin Mubarak Al Khalifa.
	   Sheik Mohammed told the world court, which is based in the
Hague, Netherlands, that 10 international experts who examined 75
Qatari documents found them to be forged.
	   Earlier this year, Bahrain unveiled plans to develop and link
the Hawar Islands to the mainland with a 22.5-kilometer (14-mile)
bridge.
	   Bahrain has already constructed a hotel on the tourist resort
island and launched a hovercraft service last year.

Blair seeks at Labor conference to break impasse of IRA arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to update ed's note &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Blair-Adams meeting, other details; SUBS 1st graf
to CORRECT formation of Assembly to formation of administration;
trims pvs to tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied
Sinn Fein party, said Wednesday that demands for the Irish
Republican Army to start surrending weapons should not hold up the
formation of Northern Ireland's new administration.
	   ``The time frame should not be allowed to slip,'' Adams told
reporters after a 40-minute meeting with Prime Minister Tony Blair
during the governing Labor Party's annual conference. ``People
should not be allowed to hardball each other or go down to the wire
on this.''
	   Blair also was meeting members of Northern Ireland's main
Protestant and Catholic parties Wednesday in a new bid to break the
impasse over IRA weapons.
	   Adams wants two posts for Sinn Fein in a new multi-party
administration, which will be drawn from the 108-member
power-sharing Assembly set up as part of Northern Ireland's
historic peace agreement.
	   April's agreement specifies that the administration must hold a
summit meeting with the Irish government by Oct. 31.
	   But David Trimble, head of the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party
and leader of the administration, is insisting the IRA start
decomissioning to show the sincerity of its 14-month-old truce
before Sinn Fein could assume any such posts.
	   Trimble says he and his Catholic deputy could meet with the
Irish government; Adams is insisting the entire administration must
be appointed in time to participate in the meeting.
	   The peace accord calls for the IRA and the province's outlawed
pro-British paramilitary groups to disarm under international
supervision by mid-2000, but set no deadline for the process to
start.
	   Underlining the huge change since the Belfast peace agreement,
Adams passed through the security cordons that surround the annual
gathering of Britain's governing party _ once used primarily to
guard against an IRA assassination attempt on Cabinet ministers.
	   He addressed meetings in hotels, calling for a united Ireland
and denouncing what he sees as Protestant intransigence, and
listened to Blair's keynote address Tuesday in the conference
chamber.
	   Trimble and Seamus Mallon, his moderate Catholic deputy in the
new Northern Ireland assembly, were both to address the conference
Wednesday.
	   Mallon, of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, criticized
both Trimble and Adams.
	   In a radio interview Wednesday, he said Trimble should not make
disarmament a condition for forming the administration and that
Adams should recognize the importance of disarmament to sustaining
Protestant faith in the peace process.
	   ```Trust is a two-way street,'' Mallon said.

Tropical storm Yanni floods South Korea's south coast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with higher casualty figures, detail &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Tropical storm Yanni dumped heavy rain
along South Korea's southern coastal regions Wednesday, killing at
least six people and flooding vast residential and crop lands.
	   Officials said 20 other people were missing after their fishing
boats capsized in high waves, their cars were swept away in
floodwaters or their homes were buried in landslides.
	   The storm dumped up to 19 inches (48 centimeters) of rain on the
nation's southern tip. Small rivers threatened to overflow in two
small cities, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes.
	   Weathermen predicted the storm would drop 4 more inches (10
centimeters) of rain before moving out over the Sea of Japan early
Thursday.
	   At Ulsan, a southeastern industrial city, a Korean Air passenger
plane carrying 148 people skidded off the rain-slick runway during
landing. Three people were hospitalized with minor injuries, police
said.
	   On the southernmost island of Cheju, one man was killed and two
others were missing after they fell into rough seas. In Changhung
in the southwest, a man was reported missing in a rain-swollen
river.
	   In the provincial city of Taegu, 250 kilometers (155 miles)
southeast of Seoul, a family of four was missing after their car
was swept away in a rain-swollen creek.
	   Television footage showed trees in Mokpo and several other
cities uprooted and embankments collapsed. A flood warning was
issued in some areas.
	   MBC-TV reported that many sections of road were washed away and
62,000 hectares (153,000 acres) of rice paddies flooded along the
Yongsan River in the southwest. About 1,500 people along the river
were evacuated, it said.
	   Most air flights to and from the southern areas were canceled.
Operations also were halted on dozens of ferry routes.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Arab reaction to the White House-brokered
deal on a further Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank ranged
from outright opposition to a cautious welcome accompanied by calls
for further steps from Israel.
	   Lebanon's leading daily An-Nahar reported Wednesday that PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat had submitted to pressure. Hard-liners in
Iraq and Syria accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of making
too many concessions.
	   ``The Israeli measures to swallow the Palestinians' land is
being done with American support and encouragement,'' said Iraq's
Al-Thawra daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party.
	   The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, an
opposition faction based in the Syrian capital Damascus, accused
Arafat of ``new concessions'' and called for ``an immediate stop to
negotiations.''
	   In Jordan, even moderate newspapers raised questions about
Arafat's acceptance Tuesday of an an Israeli offer to withdraw from
over 13 percent of the West Bank's land, 3 percent of which will be
a ``nature reserve.''
	   Beirut's An-Nahar said Arafat ``submitted once again to pressure
by announcing yesterday his acceptance of the 10-plus-3 Israeli
formula.''
	   In an editorial entitled ``Burning Arafat as a Favor to
Clinton,'' the paper said the so-called breakthrough was helpful to
the American president in his efforts to escape from the scandal
over his sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.

Red Cross appeals for aid to feed Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Red Cross made an emergency appeal to
governments around the world Wednesday for more than dlrs 15
million to provide relief to impoverished people across the former
Soviet Union.
	   At least 73 million people are living below the poverty line in
the former Soviet Union, and many of them are suffering from
disease, malnutrition and extreme stress, Lyudmila Potravnova, head
of the Russian branch of the Red Cross, said at a news conference.
	   The Red Cross is asking for money to fund a six-month program
that would distribute food, medicine, hygiene items, and clothes in
Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova as their people try to get
through the winter.
	   The effort will target 1.5 million people who most urgently need
help in the four countries.
	   Citing a poor harvest this year, rising prices because of the
weakened ruble and potential fuel shortages, Potravnova said
Russians are particularly vulnerable this year.
	   ``These are chaotic times when people are seeing the worst
social upheaval since the birth of the Soviet state,'' said Bojre
Sjokvist, the head of the Moscow Regional Delegation of the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
	   The Red Cross made a similar appeal last year. Many people in
the former Soviet republics are far more impoverished than they
were under Soviet rule, suffering at times from malnourishment,
poor housing and inadequate medical care.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police denied responsibility
Wednesday for the massacre of ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo,
but said they were investigating ``based on press reports.''
	   The denial came after ethnic Albanians and at least one human
rights group assailed the Serbs in the deaths of 18 men, women and
children who were shot in the back of the head and mutilated.
	   Austria on Wednesday called for an international investigation.
	   The slaying of the victims, whose bodies were seen this week by
diplomats and journalists in a forest in the Drenica region west of
Pristina, have inflamed tensions in Kosovo.
	   In a separate incident Wednesday, an ethnic Albanian doctor was
killed and three other members of the International Committee of
the Red Cross, including one foreigner, were injured when their
vehicle hit a landmine.
	   The explosion occurred on the Donje Obriga-Likovac road, 30
kilometers (17 miles) west of Pristina, Serbian police and Red
Cross spokesman Roland Sidler in Geneva said.
	   One of the three injured victims was in serious condition, they
said.
	   The Serbs have been accused of hindering efforts to get outside
humanitarian aid to some of the estimated 275,000 people who have
been driven from their homes since the conflict in the separatist
province of Serbia exploded in February.
	   They also are accused of frequent attacks against civilians,
including the massacre which ethnic Albanians reported over the
weekend.
	   ``We rule out any possibility that our members did something
like this,'' Col. Bozidar Filic said. ``In that area, we had
clashes with terrorists and a number of them have been arrested.''
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch, whose staffers were in the
area, blamed the Serbs.
	   ``The massacre was clearly an attack on defenseless civilians
who were hiding in the woods,'' said Holly Cartner, executive
director of Human Rights Watch's European division. ``The Yugoslav
army and Serbian police are fighting a war against civilians, and
this is another sad example of the unspeakable atrocities being
committed against them.''
	   Both sides have been accused of massacres. Serbs have said that
at least 39 Serbs were tortured, mutilated and killed earlier this
month near Glodjane in western Kosovo after they were ``kidnapped
by the terrorists.''
	   There were no immediate reports of new fighting in Kosovo. The
status of the promised pullback of Yugoslav and Serb forces wasn't
clear.
	   Ethnic Albanians on Tuesday reported heavy Serb attacks south of
Pristina despite Serbs' claims they were moving men back to their
bases.
	   Filic said Kosovo had been calm since Tuesday and that police
units were continuing to withdraw, having established control over
roads.
	   He also repeated the call to Kosovo Albanians to surrender
weapons obtained through the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has
suffered a string of defeats in its fight against the Serbs. The
KLA is insisting on independence for Kosovo _ something world
leaders oppose for fear of the repercussions of another border
change in the volatile Balkans.

Philippine Airlines workers postpone vote on recovery plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with union president saying referendum will
be held Thursday; militant members considering court action to stop
it; PAL chairman Lucio Tan negotiating with creditors for loan
restructuring &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines workers postponed
voting Wednesday on a management-proposed plan aimed at putting the
closed national flag-carrier back in business, the workers' union
said.
	   The debt-laden airline, Asia's oldest, closed on Sept. 23 after
failing to persuade its ground crew union to accept the rescue
plan. Its closure left much of the Philippines without air service.
	   However, leaders of the union, PAL's largest, approved the plan
Monday after accepting a 10-year suspension of the union's
collective bargaining agreement in exchange for a 20 percent share
of the company's stock for workers.
	   The agreement must still be formally approved by workers,
regulators and PAL's creditors.
	   Union president Alex Barrientos said the rescue plan will be put
to a vote among its nearly 7,000 members by secret ballot Thursday.
Union leaders initially planned a signature campaign to ratify the
plan.
	   He said the union postponed the vote because it needed to print
ballots and confer with government labor officials, who are to
oversee the voting.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with militant
members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreement would
violate workers' rights and expose them to management abuses.
	   Isagani Dawal, a union leader opposed to the plan, said he plans
to seek a court injunction to stop the referendum.
	   Hundreds of workers opposing the plan protested Tuesday, urging
President Joseph Estrada to allow a government takeover of PAL
instead.
	   Estrada says the government cannot do that because there is no
money in public coffers to underwrite daily losses of up to 45
million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.
	   Under the recovery plan, PAL has guaranteed continued
recognition of the union, Barrientos said.
	   Estrada urged the workers to ratify the agreement, saying their
stock could appreciate when the airline's financial condition
improves.
	   PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan is negotiating
abroad with foreign creditors to restructure the airline's debts
ahead of PAL's possible reopening, Estrada said.
	   A government committee overseeing PAL also has asked several
European creditors to defer requests for the return of planes they
financed for PAL until after the fate of the airline becomes clear,
an Estrada spokesman said.
	   PAL has been ravaged by strikes and Asia's currency crisis. It
says creditors have insisted on a suspension of the bargaining
agreement before they accept a restructuring of the company's
finances.
	   Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4
billion modernization program, greatly inflating the amount of
money it must repay to overseas creditors. The airline has been
unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt.
	   Two foreign carriers, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Dragon
Airlines, have been enlisted by the government to fly certain
domestic routes to help fill the vacuum left by PAL's closure.

Taiwan premier hints at looser China business limits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan might ease restrictions on
investment in China if relations improve, and could lift a ban on
direct links between the sides after the signing of a peace treaty,
Premier Vincent Siew said Wednesday.
	   Siew's comments will likely encourage pressure on the government
to adjust economic policies toward China if a meeting next month
between the two sides' top negotiators goes well.
	   But he set severe conditions for lifting its ban on direct
trade, transportation and communications links that China will be
unlikely to meet.
	   Speaking at a meeting with Taiwanese who have invested in China,
Siew said limits on investments in infrastructure and other large
projects in China were ``transitional.''
	   ``If the mainland's government and economy remain stable, if
relations between the sides improve and the Chinese Communists
respect us as equals ... our government will revise the policy of
forbearance and patience'' in investing in China, Siew told the
meeting.
	   Taiwan has high hopes for a breakthrough in relations with China
during top Taiwanese negotiator Koo Chen-fu's visit to Beijing,
which begins Oct. 14. During his trip, Koo will meet his Chinese
counterpart for the first time since 1993.
	   Expectations that the visit will help end a three-year freeze in
talks between the semiofficial organizations the two men head were
stoked after successful preliminary meetings last week.
	   But Siew offered much stricter terms for lifting the ban on
direct links, which Taiwan's Nationalist government imposed in 1949
after being swept out of China by Mao Tse-tung's Communists.
	   China must first ``end hostility toward (Taiwan), not block our
space for international participation, and treat us with
reciprocity and equality,'' Siew said.
	   The sides would seal their mutual recognition with a peace
agreement, paving the way for an end to the ban, he said.
	   China claims Taiwan as a renegade province with no right to
international relations, and threatens to use force if necessary to
establish control over the island.
	   The ban forces businessmen to route their operations through
other points, usually Hong Kong. Like the investment restrictions,
it is extremely unpopular with China investors, who have sunk an
estimated U.S. dlrs 30 billion into the mainland economy.

Britain calls Contact Group meeting on Kosovo crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Wednesday
condemned the latest massacres in Kosovo, and called an
international meeting to discuss a political solution to end the
crisis.
	   Senior representatives from the six so-called Contact Group
countries _ the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and
Russia _ will meet Friday in London to find ``the way forward on a
political settlement,'' Cook said.
	   Despite assurances from the Yugoslav government that its
offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists is over, Cook said
the fighting continues.
	   On Sunday, the group Human Rights Watch reported 18 ethnic
Albanians were slaughtered in the forest near Obrija village in the
Drenica region northwest of Pristina.
	   Britain's Foreign Office said international monitors also
reported finding the bodies of 17 Albanians killed in fighting in
the Vucitern area.
	   ``I am appalled by these reports of massacres of civilians,
including women and children,'' Cook said. ``There is no
justification for any violence against the civilian population in
Kosovo.''
	   Cook called for the U.N. Security Council resolution demanding
an immediate ceasefire _ passed last week _ to be ``implemented
immediately.''
	   He also asked for an independent forensic examination of both
massacres, and urged the International Criminal Tribunal for
Yugoslavia to extend its investigations to include these sites.
	   Serbs began cracking down in February on Albanian separatists
who are fighting for independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia. Since then, hundreds of people have been
killed and an estimated 275,000 have been driven from their homes
in the province, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police denied responsibility
Wednesday for the massacre of ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo,
but said they were investigating it ``based on press reports.''
	   The denial came after ethnic Albanians and at least one human
rights group assailed the Serbs in the deaths of 18 men, women and
children who were shot in the back of the head and mutilated.
	   Austria on Wednesday called for an international investigation.
	   The slaying of the victims, whose bodies were seen this week by
diplomats and journalists in a forest in the Drenica region west of
Pristina, have inflamed tensions in Kosovo.
	   In a separate incident Wednesday, an ethnic Albanian doctor was
killed and three other members of the International Committee of
the Red Cross, including one foreigner, were injured when their
vehicle hit a landmine.
	   The explosion occurred on the Donje Obriga-Likovac road, 30
kilometers (17 miles) west of Pristina, Serbian police and Red
Cross spokesman Roland Sidler in Geneva said.
	   One of the three injured victims was in serious condition, they
said.
	   The Serbs have been accused of hindering efforts to get outside
humanitarian aid to some of the estimated 275,000 people who have
been driven from their homes since the conflict in the separatist
province of Serbia exploded in February.
	   They also are accused of frequent attacks against civilians,
including the massacre which ethnic Albanians reported over the
weekend.
	   ``We rule out any possibility that our members did something
like this,'' Col. Bozidar Filic said. ``In that area, we had
clashes with terrorists and a number of them have been arrested.''
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch, whose staffers were in the
area, blamed the Serbs.
	   ``The massacre was clearly an attack on defenseless civilians
who were hiding in the woods,'' said Holly Cartner, executive
director of Human Rights Watch's European division. ``The Yugoslav
army and Serbian police are fighting a war against civilians, and
this is another sad example of the unspeakable atrocities being
committed against them.''
	   Both sides have been accused of massacres. Serbs have said that
at least 39 Serbs were tortured, mutilated and killed earlier this
month near Glodjane in western Kosovo after they were ``kidnapped
by the terrorists.''
	   There were no immediate reports of new fighting in Kosovo. The
status of the promised pullback of Yugoslav and Serb forces wasn't
clear.
	   Ethnic Albanians on Tuesday reported heavy Serb attacks south of
Pristina despite Serbs' claims they were moving men back to their
bases.
	   Filic said Kosovo had been calm since Tuesday and that police
units were continuing to withdraw, having established control over
roads.
	   He also repeated the call to Kosovo Albanians to surrender
weapons obtained through the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has
suffered a string of defeats in its fight against the Serbs. The
KLA is insisting on independence for Kosovo _ something world
leaders oppose for fear of the repercussions of another border
change in the volatile Balkans.

Ukraine's parliament rejects government's 1999 budget draft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament rejected on Wednesday
the government's 1999 draft budget, saying the country's financial
crisis has made the document's figures unrealistic.
	   Lawmakers ordered the Cabinet to draft a new budget that takes
into account the fall of the hryvna currency and increased
inflation rate, which have struck Ukraine in the previous month
following the turmoil in Russia.
	   Finance Minister Ihor Mitiukov said the draft budget estimated
government revenues of 19.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 5.7 billion at the
current exchange rate) and spending of 22.9 billion hryvna (dlrs
6.8 billion).
	   The proposed 1999 deficit constituted 0.6 percent of gross
domestic product, down from this year's target of 2.5 percent.
	   However, lawmakers argued that the economic indicators the
government used to calculate budget figures are no longer realistic
since they were prepared in July, well before the crisis hit
Ukraine.
	   Mitiukov said the Cabinet would try to submit a new budget draft
by Oct. 15 so that it could receive final approval from parliament
by mid-December.

imprisonment &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Single names for Muladi, Sukarno, Suharto are correct &QL; 
 &UR; By HARIS SYAMAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In its sternest warning yet, the
Indonesian government said Wednesday that protesters who threaten
its existence could be sentenced to life imprisonment under a harsh
anti-subversion law enacted by former President Suharto.
	   ``Indonesia does not want to see its government overthrown by
demonstrations and riots as happened in the past to the two regimes
of President Sukarno and President Suharto,'' Justice Minister
Muladi said after a five-hour Cabinet meeting with President B.J.
Habibie.
	   The marathon meeting was dominated by security concerns
following a rise in anti-government protests.
	   Wednesday was the 33rd anniversary of an attempted communist
coup against the government of Sukarno. The military, led by then
Maj. Gen. Suharto, crushed the putsch after six other generals were
murdered. A storm of protest that followed led to Suharto taking
power from Sukarno.
	   Suharto ruled for 32 authoritarian years until a wave of unrest
forced him to quit in May this year amid the worst economic crisis
in decades.
	   Suharto enacted a tough anti-subversion law in 1973 and used it
repeatedly to stamp out dissent.
	   His successor, Habibie, has been plagued by a new wave of
protest over soaring food prices and mass unemployment. Food
shortages have triggered looting and lawlessness in some areas.
	   Muladi said the current sporadic unrest has not been strong
enough to threaten the government, which has promised democratic
reform.
	   ``But I have to warn protesters not to go much further. It might
lead to a situation in which there is a systematic plan and
movement to overthrow the government,'' he said.
	   Muladi said change in Indonesia must be based on the principles
of democracy and law.
	   ``Whoever violates these principles will be charged with
violating the law issued in 1973,'' Muladi said in reference to
Suharto's anti-subversion legislation, which has been widely
criticized by human rights groups.
	   Muladi said the government did not approve of the law and
planned to have it replaced.
	   In the meantime, he said, the government could use the law
against those who plot against it, such as separatist guerrilla
groups in the troubled provinces of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, and
Irian Jaya, which covers the western half of New Guinea.
	   National Police Chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi, who also attended
the Cabinet meeting, said a total of 1,924 protests and riots took
place on the islands of Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi and Borneo between
June and September this year. There were 335 disturbances in
Jakarta alone.

U.N. panel approves dlrs 691 million for individual claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. panel assessing compensation for loss and
damage caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Wednesday approved
payments totaling some dlrs 691 million.
	   The claims by some 278,000 individuals were the latest batch to
be resolved by the U.N. Compensation Commission, which so far has
given priority to people who suffered personal losses and who have
filed for less than dlrs 100,000 in damages.
	   The money will be paid to 67 governments and three international
organizations to be distributed to the successful claimants, the
commission said in a statement.
	   During its last three-day session in July, the panel awarded
four construction companies a total of some dlrs 187 million.
	   Compensation awards approved by the 15-nation commission are
paid using Iraqi oil sales approved by the U.N. Security Council.
	   In total, the commission has received around 2.6 million
compensation demands for a total of some dlrs 240 billion from
individuals, governments and corporations seeking compensation for
loss and damage caused by the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
	   Processing the claims is expected to take several more years.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Despite catastrophic floods and pressure from the
global financial crisis, China has managed to keep its economy
strong and its reforms on track, Premier Zhu Rongji said Wednesday
as China celebrated its 49th year under Communist Party rule.
	   The brief speech, one of only two major scheduled public
speeches the Chinese premier gives each year, consisted almost
entirely of praise for China's accomplishments.
	   Zhu ticked off a list: a good harvest expected despite the
floods, industrial production growing, foreign trade expanding, a
stable currency, and success in cracking down on corruption and
smuggling.
	   He also said Beijing was confident Hong Kong's economy would
recover from the battering of the financial crisis. Touching
briefly on Taiwan, he restated the government's position that the
``one country, two systems'' formula that was used to return Hong
Kong to China's control in 1997 could work for Taiwan.
	   Among the diplomats, party officials and other dignitaries
listening to the speech on the eve of the anniversary of the Oct.
1, 1949, founding of the communist state were 80 flood heroes.
	   According to the official record, 3,004 people died in floods
this summer that devastated south-central and northeastern China
and Tibet.
	   China's ``flood-fighting spirit'' _ a phrase now being
constantly used by the leadership to stir up nationalistic pride _
and national unity would allow the country to meet all its
development targets, Zhu said at a holiday banquet.
	   To underscore the theme of unity, Chinese ethnic minorities in
traditional dress attended a performances of songs and dances at
the banquet in the Great Hall of the People.
	   Outside the hall, the concrete expanse of Tiananmen Square was
decorated with mounds of flowers, temporary fountains, and a
portrait of Sun Yat-sen, the father of modern China, who briefly
served as president after the end of imperial rule in 1911.
	   A large red sign with white characters called for strong and
healthy economic development.
	   Crowds much larger than on ordinary nights gathered on the
square in unseasonably hot weather and heavy smog to admire the
decorations and have their pictures taken.
	   There was no mention of China's sliding growth rate and a
virtual halt in such reforms as privatizing home ownership in Zhu's
speech.
	   The leadership has set a target of 8 percent growth for the
year, a level considered the minimum needed to re-employ millions
of people being laid off from debt-ridden state factories. Many
economists expect growth of around 7 percent, down from 8.8 percent
last year.
	   Zhu has led China's economic reforms in recent years, steering
the economy to a soft landing after overheated growth and high
inflation that reached 21.7 percent in 1994.
	   He said ``more forceful financial policies'' now beginning would
help expand domestic demand to keep the economy growing rapidly.
Meanwhile, reform of state enterprises was moving ahead, giving the
country more means of providing for the basic needs of laid-off
workers and finding new jobs for them, Zhu said.
	   This was Zhu's first year to give the traditional National Day
speech. He became premier in March. The premier also gives a major
speech at the annual session of the legislature.
	   Although shorter than speeches by his predecessor, No. 2 in the
party hierarchy Li Peng, the National Day speech was full of the
same standard phrases praising the leadership of the Communist
Party.
	   ``History has eloquently proved that the Communist Party of
China is a great, glorious and correct party, that the socialist
system has incomparable superiority and vitality, and that the
Chinese people have a strong cohesion and great creativity,'' Zhu
said.

	   ROME (AP) _ Rome is offering tourists week-long passes to city
museums _ along with a chance to contribute to their conservation.
	   The ticket books, which cost 25,000 lire (dlrs 15), make
visitors temporary members of the Roma Caput Mundi (top of the
world) association, which is devoted to preserving the city's
cultural treasures.
	   The tickets are good for a number of Rome's smaller,
less-visited city museums and several other sites, officials of the
city and Caput Mundi announced at a news conference Wednesday.
	   Called the ``Itinere Card,'' the venture represents Caput
Mundi's first foray into international fundraising.
	   Among the participating museums are the Capitoline Museum, the
Museum of Rome, the Museum of Roman Civilization, The Forum of
Trajan, the Augustian Peace Altar and the Napoleonic Museum.
	   Organizers said the ticket books will be available through tour
organizers, travel agencies or from Caput Mundi itself.

Police arrest 3 more suspects in Omagh car bombing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Britain-Politics-Ireland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested three more suspects
Wednesday on suspicion of planning last month's car-bomb slaughter
in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh.
	   Since the Aug. 15 bombing, police on both sides of the Irish
border have arrested 18 other people suspected of involvement. All
were eventually freed without charge.
	   The attack by Irish Republican Army dissidents killed 29 people
and wounded 370 others, the bloodiest single strike in three
decades of conflict over Northern Ireland.
	   Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's police commander announced that
several security fortifications near the border would be scaled
down or dismantled soon in response to the IRA's 14-month-old
truce.
	   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said his forces this weekend
also would stop requiring backup from soldiers at two road
checkpoints along the border near Londonderry, the province's
second-largest city.
	   The announcement followed last week's withdrawal of about 400 of
the more than 16,000 soldiers based in Northern Ireland. Such
gestures are designed to appeal to supporters of the IRA-allied
Sinn Fein party, which has long demanded the withdrawal of all
troops.
	   April's peace agreement kept Northern Ireland firmly linked to
Britain, but the British government pledged to reduce army
deployments and to reform the province's predominantly Protestant
police force.
	   The accord also called on the IRA to destroy its hidden stores
of weaponry by mid-2000. So far, the IRA has refused.
	   The hard-line Protestant leader Ian Paisley on Wednesday accused
the British government of planning to order members of the army's
locally recruited unit, the Royal Irish Regiment, to hand in their
personal protection firearms as a further gesture to the IRA.
	   The more than 5,000 members of the predominantly Protestant
regiment have long carried army-issue handguns when off duty
because of the threat of IRA assassination.
	   Paisley, who opposes April's agreement, said soldiers from one
battalion had complained to him that their commander was asking
them to hand in their guns. Paisley said the move was ``part of
underhanded negotiations going on'' between the British government
and Sinn Fein.
	   Britain's governor for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, said
Paisley's claims had ``no foundation.''

 &UR; Austria calls for investigation of Kosovo massacre

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria called Wednesday for an
international investigation into the recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, including women and children in Kosovo.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel called on European
Union envoy to Kosovo Wolfgang Petritsch in Belgrade to begin an
investigation, the Austrian foreign ministry said in a statement
Wednesday.
	   Given the ``bestial situation of this massacre, certainly the
killing of women and children,'' an delegation of international
experts must conduct an investigation, the ministry said in a
statement.
	   Austria currently holds the presidency of the European Union.
	   Serb police have denied responsibility for the brutal killing of
the men, women and children who were shot in the back of the head
and mutilated. Ethnic Albanian civilians found Tuesday in Kosovo.
	   The denial came after ethnic Albanians and at least one human
rights group assailed the Serbs in the deaths.
	   The slaying of the victims, whose bodies were seen this week by
diplomats and journalists in a forest in the Drenica region west of
Pristina, have inflamed tensions in Kosovo.
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook also condemned
the massacres and called an international meeting to discuss a
political solution to end the crisis in the province.

U.N. panel approves dlrs 691 million for individual claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. panel assessing compensation for loss and
damage caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Wednesday approved
payments totaling some dlrs 691 million.
	   The claims by some 278,000 individuals were the latest batch to
be resolved by the U.N. Compensation Commission, which so far has
given priority to people who suffered personal losses and who have
filed for less than dlrs 100,000 in damages.
	   The money will be paid to 67 governments and three international
organizations to be distributed to the successful claimants, the
commission said in a statement.
	   During its last three-day session in July, the panel awarded
four construction companies a total of some dlrs 187 million.
	   Compensation awards approved by the 15-nation commission are
paid using Iraqi oil sales approved by the U.N. Security Council.
	   In total, the commission has received around 2.6 million
compensation demands for a total of some dlrs 240 billion from
individuals, governments and corporations seeking compensation for
loss and damage caused by the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
	   Processing the claims is expected to take several more years.

Ukraine to buy more gas from Russia this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government comments, NEW gas debt figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine plans to buy an additional 5
billion cubic meters (175 billion cubic feet) of gas from Russia
this year to meet its needs, a news agency said Wednesday.
	   Ukraine's government plans to pay for half of the gas in cash,
while the form of payment for the other half is under
consideration, said Ihor Bakai, head of Ukraine's oil and gas
monopoly, Naftogaz Ukrainy, according to Interfax.
	   Bakai said the Russian firm Gazprom has already agreed to sell
the gas to Ukraine for dlrs 80 per 1,000 cubic meters (35,000 cubic
feet).
	   Ukraine needs the gas by the end of the year or else it would
have to suspend supplies to enterprises throughout the country,
Bakai said.
	   However, the details of the dlrs 400 million deal have yet to be
finalized as some Cabinet officials voiced doubt that the
cash-strapped government would be able to find money to pay
Gazprom.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko said a
government delegation would fly to Moscow this week to try to
persuade Gazprom to accept payment in commodities for the whole
amount of gas Ukraine wants to buy, according to Interfax.
	   Ukraine, the world's sixth largest consumer of gas, imports
about 70 percent of its supply from Russia.
	   Ukraine's mounting gas debt to Russia has prompted tension
between the two countries. Holubchenko said Ukraine's gas debt to
Russia is dlrs 740 million, down from dlrs 1.2 billion at the
beginning of 1998.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kohl cabinet consulting Schroeder aide

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's outgoing Cabinet on Wednesday
offered 14 fighter planes for possible NATO airstrikes in Kosovo _
though a decision on whether they actually leave the ground will
probably fall to the newly elected government.
	   The action by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government sends ``a
clear signal'' to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that
Germany remains focused even as chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder
forms his government, outgoing Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said.
	   Before offering the planes, Kohl's Cabinet reviewed the Kosovo
situation on Tuesday with Rudolf Scharping, Schroeder's consultant
on foreign affairs and possibly the next defense minister.

Five houses, two cars damaged by mob in Bali
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A mob damaged five houses and two cars
and burned a motorcycle early Wednesday following a land dispute on
the Indonesian tourist island of Bali, the official Antara news
agency reported.
	   There were no casualties or arrests in the violence in the
village of Belang Samu in Gianyar regency, about 45 kilometers (28
miles) east of the Bali capital of Denpasar, Antara said.
	   It quoted local police as saying the riot was sparked by a
longstanding dispute over 3,400 square meters (36,600 square feet)
of land between a Balinese house of worship and 300 families around
the temple.
	   It said 49 residents of the temple were being sheltered at a
police station for protection.
	   Police were still investigating the case.
	   It was the latest in a series of violent outbreaks around the
country, now facing its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   On Tuesday, police clashed with troops after an exchange of
insults in West Kalimantan on Borneo Island. Four officers were
killed by gunshots and 12 others were injured.
	   The violence in Bali erupted amid fears of fresh riots during
the planned gathering of an opposition party there.
	   A faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party, led by opposition
figure Megawati Sukarnoputri, plans to convene a three-day congress
beginning Oct. 8 at a beach resort hotel on the island, known as a
major source of badly needed foreign exchange.
	   She was ousted from the party in June 1996 by a rebel party
congress sponsored by the government. Dozens of her supporters were
killed or injured in a clash with police and troops in the capital,
Jakarta, the following month.

Rodal's coach admits sexual relationship with female athlete
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The coach fired by Olympic gold medalist
Vebjorn Rodal in a sexual misconduct flap has admitted having
intimate relations with a young female runner on his team, a
newspaper said Wednesday.
	   Kjell Arve Husby was fired by the Oppdal Athletics Club and by
Rodal, who won the 800-meter gold medal at the 1996 Olympics, after
athletes accused Husby of improper conduct. Husby also faces a
police investigation.
	   In an interview published in the Oslo newspaper Aften on
Wednesday, Husby admitted having an intimate relationship in
November with a 24-year-old woman he coached.
	   ``I made a mistake, and allowed the woman to get too close,''
the 51-year-old coach was quoted as saying. ``It was a situation
she wanted as much as I did, and something we squared up
afterwards.''
	   Eight members of the local athletics club in Oppdal, 500
kilometers (300 miles) north of Oslo, quit the team last month,
saying in a letter to the club's board that they could no longer
work with Husby.
	   ``Several of the female athletes have felt great discomfort in
what we experienced as physical and sexual approaches by the
coach,'' they said in the letter, according to the newspaper.
	   Husby coached Rodal for more than a decade. During the period,
Rodal took gold at the Atlanta Olympics, silver in the 1994
European Athletics Championships, and bronze in the 1995 World
Championships.
	   Rodal said he had no personal grievances against about Husby,
but felt he could not continue working with him following the
allegations.
	   Police opened an investigation against Husby on Tuesday, which
the coach's lawyer said would help clear up misunderstandings and
rumors.

Major power cut at French hospital under investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Experts were being sent to a French hospital to
determine the cause of a massive power cut last week that is being
blamed for the death of at least five patients, France's health
minister said Wednesday.
	   A judicial inquiry into the power cut overnight Friday at Lyon's
Edouard Herriot Hospital is to investigate the deaths of 10 people
-- the number of patients who died over the course of the weekend,
French media reported.
	   ``We've tried to get a clear picture. That's not yet the case.
We've sent an expert and we'll send others,'' Health Minister
Bernard Kouchner said in an interview with Europe-1 radio.
	   ``As soon as we have precise details of what happened in Lyon,
we'll make them known,'' he added.
	   All power was completely cut for two hours at the hospital,
forcing doctors to transfer 26 patients from the intensive care
unit to another hospital.
	   Two patients died shortly after the transfer. On Tuesday, the
hospital said three other elderly patients, including a
100-year-old woman, also had died. The three were not transferred
since they were considered close to death, the hospital has said.
	   The hospital has denied that any of the patients died as a
direct result of the power cut, saying the deaths concerned
seriously ill people and were, therefore, ``inexorable.''
	   Autopsies of the victims were to be performed Thursday.
	   Referring to the deaths, Kouchner said he was unaware of ``how
much can be attributed to nature, and how much to an accident.''
	   A day before the power cut, surgeons at the same hospital had
grafted a new hand and forearm onto a patient in a rare operation,
winning international acclaim.
	   President Jacques Chirac said an investigation would hopefully
ensure against the recurrence of such an incident.
	   ``We must make sure the causes and responsibilities are
established, and ensure that such accidents never happen again,''
Chirac told a weekly meeting of Cabinet ministers, according to his
spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna.

Anwar arraigned again, case against him may weaken
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Anwar's wife's comments; trims; CHANGES

 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The government's sexual misconduct
case against the prime minister's most prominent opponent has
received a possible setback, and alleged police brutality against
him has come under fire at home and abroad.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, who was fired by Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad as his deputy and finance minister last month, was
in court for the second consecutive day Wednesday, pleading
innocent to another charge of an illegal homosexual act.
	   Bruises were apparent on his face, and he told a court Tuesday
he was beaten until he fell unconscious on his first night in
detention. Police said they would investigate, but Mahathir said
Anwar may have inflicted the injury himself to gain public
sympathy.
	   Anwar has contended the charges are politically motivated. After
his dismissal Sept. 2, he had led a campaign demanding reforms by
the prime minister who has ruled for 17 years. His arrest Sept. 20
has triggered regular street protests in Kuala Lumpur demanding
Mahathir's resignation.
	   Two of the sex-related charges against Anwar stemmed from
alleged relations with Munawar Anees, his former speech writer, and
Sukma Dermawan, Anwar's adopted brother.
	   Both were sentenced to six-month jail terms earlier this month,
but late Tuesday both appealed their convictions.
	   No date was set for hearing the appeal, which could weaken the
government case against Anwar if the two men say their confessions
were coerced.
	   Anwar had said earlier the confessions were obtained ``under
duress'' while the two were in detention.
	   Anees' lawyer, Balwant Singh Sindhue, on Wednesday did not
discuss the strategy of his client's appeal. He did not confirm
that Anees would retract his confession, but indicated it could
happen if the appeal were allowed.
	   In all, Anwar has been charged with five counts of sodomy and
five of corruption, mostly related to the sex charges. His trial is
likely to begin soon in the High Court.
	   Wednesday's charge alleged that Anwar committed an illegal
sexual act in 1992 with his wife's tailor, Abudul Razak Yahya.
	   Several hundred riot police surrounded the courthouse to keep
out crowds who had gathered to get a glimpse of Anwar after reading
newspaper accounts of his injuries.
	   Few onlookers, however, got to see the 51-year-old politician,
who was driven to and from the courthouse in a vehicle with tinted
windows and hustled into the courtroom through a back entrance.
	   ``Malaysians should be made aware of the deterioration of their
fundamental liberties and the dictatorial acts of Dr. Mahathir,''
Anwar said in a message read by his wife, Azizah Ismail, to
reporters outside the courthouse.
	   Azizah said she hoped for a fair trial, adding, ``I'm aware of
previous political instructions from the prime minister to the
judiciary.''
	   On Tuesday, Amnesty International said in a statement: ``Anwar's
treatment at the hands of the police shows the government's blatant
disregard for basic human rights.''
	   It called for an investigation.
	   In Washington, deputy U.S. State Department spokesman James
Foley said, ``We are deeply concerned as well by reports of police
brutality during the incarceration of Anwar.''
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said President Bill Clinton
would raise human rights concerns when he visits Malaysia in
November for a meeting of Asian and Pacific nations.
	   ``All Malaysians are asking how they could be safe when the
former deputy prime minister could be brutally assaulted while in
police custody,'' said Lim Kit Siang, leader of the opposition
Democratic Action Party.
	   Anwar said a policeman's punch inflamed his left eye and he
could not use it for two days after the beating. The eye was still
darkly bruised when he appeared in court.
	   An eye doctor examined Anwar on Tuesday and determined his
retina wasn't permanently damaged but said the wounds had come from
being ``assaulted.''
	   Mahathir had groomed Anwar since 1993 to succeed him, but
differences between the two became stark as Malaysia's economy
crumbled in the last year. The two openly differed on monetary
policy and Anwar refused to allow the Finance Ministry to be used
as a tool to help sagging businesses.

EU: Slovakia must improve rights; holds off on faster membership
</HEADLINE>
talks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Wednesday
the next Slovak government must take ``concrete steps'' in human
rights if it is to improve its chances of joining the EU when other
east European nations do.
	   EU spokeswoman Lousewies van der Laan said while the commission
was pleased by the strong showing of opposition parties in last
week's elections it cannot reward Slovakia by accelerating its
membership talks.
	   ``We will be looking for concrete steps'' from Slovakia to
improve its human rights record, Van der Laan said.
	   The EU has opened membership talks with Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus. ``Preparatory'' talks
have begun with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
	   Slovakia has been told to improve human rights, notably those of
Hungarian speakers, and bolster democracy across the board.
	   Van der Laan said the Commission will issue a report in
November, bringing the EU leaders, who meet in December in Vienna,
up to date on the country's membership chances.
	   ``That report will take into account the actions taken to
redress the (human rights) situation,'' she told reporters.
	   Speaking separately here, Jan Wiersma, a Dutch socialist member
of the European Parliament and an observer at the Slovak elections,
urged the EU to move Slovakia into the fast-track group of
candidates.
	   However, Van der Laan said that decision can only be taken by
the EU leaders, not the European Commission.
	   Since Czechoslovakia dissolved six years ago, its two
ex-communist parts have gone in different directions. While the
Czech Republic swiftly adopted free-market and democratic reforms,
Slovakia fell into diplomatic isolation because of the heavy-handed
rule of Vladimir Meciar.
	   The 56-year-old prime minister has blocked dissent, reined in
the media and has cracked down on the opposition and ethnic
minorities.

Iraqi minister arrives in Iran to attend trade fair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iraq's trade minister arrived Wednesday to
attend an international trade fair and hold discussions with his
Iranian counterpart, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Mohammed Mehdi Saleh and his seven-member delegation traveled by
land and crossed into Iran at the Khosrawi border point in the
western Kermanshah province, the official news agency said.
	   It quoted Saleh as saying that he would discuss with Iran's
Trade Minister Mohammad Shariat-Madari ways of expanding commercial
ties between the two countries. The fair is scheduled from Oct. 1
to 11.
	   This is the second consecutive year that Iraq is attending the
Tehran International Trade Fair, and points at the need for the two
neighbors to do business despite their traditional animosity.
	   Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war which ended with a
U.N.-brokered cease-fire.
	   Iran claims Iraq still holds 4,000 prisoners of war while Iraq
says Iran is holding about 20,000 prisoners. More than 1 million
people were killed or wounded on both sides during the 1980-88 war.
	   Tehran accuses Baghdad of helping Iranian opposition groups and
the two sides accuse each other of allowing infiltrators to sneak
across their borders for acts of sabotage.
	   In December, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan became the
highest-ranking Iraqi to visit Tehran since the 1991 Gulf War when
he attended the Organization of the Islamic Conference meeting.

Croatia's president reveals assets for first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman owns a luxury
home, five cars and an extensive art collection, according to his
financial disclosure released Wednesday.
	   The statement, giving Croats a first-ever look at their
president's wealth, complies with newly adopted legislation
requiring politicians to reveal their financial status upon taking
office.
	   However, politicians are not required to value their assets,
which would undoubtedly cause public dissension in a nation where
the average salary is about dlrs 400 a month.
	   Tudjman, an authoritarian ruler who led Croatia to independence
in 1991, listed among his ownings a large home in an upscale part
of the capital Zagreb, which he said he purchased in 1992 with
savings and with earnings from more than 70 printed publications.
He said four of the five cars he owns were gifts.
	   The 78-year-old leader is also the owner of a selection of
artworks, including paintings and sculptures.
	   Tudjman has often been the target of independent media and
critics who accuse him of indifference to increasing poverty in
Croatia and of amassing fortunes for his family.
	   Tudjman's wife, Ankica, is the founder of a humanitarian agency
for children which turns over millions of unaccounted dollars per
year, while his daughter Nevenka is the owner of two trading
companies.
	   Tudjman's older son, Miroslav, who recently stepped down as a
top intelligence official, owns a home and posh weekend house on an
Adriatic island, while his younger son, Stjepan, is reportedly
part-owner of two multimillion-dollar firms.
	   One of Tudjman's grandsons, Dejan, is part-owner of a rapidly
growing bank, while the other, Sinisa, is a race-car driver.

Thai politician fined for assault on colleague
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A court has ordered a former lawmaker
convicted of assaulting a fellow member of parliament to pay a fine
of 500 baht (dlrs 13), a government spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Thawich Klinprathum, 68, a former member of the Chart Thai (Thai
Nation) party, punched Winai Senniam of the Democrat Party in the
face during a debate in the House of Representatives.
	   The incident occurred in 1996 when the Chart Thai led a
coalition government and the Democrats were in the opposition.
	   Thawich lost his temper after Winai accused him of making a
wrong decision to lower some rents charged by the Port Authority of
Thailand, costing the government some 25 million baht (dlrs 1
million at 1996 exchange rates) in income.
	   Thawich's fine was halved from the original 1,000 baht (dlrs 26)
after he pleaded guilty in a pretrial hearing.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin sent a telegram of
congratulations Wednesday to Germany's chancellor-elect, Gerhard
Schroeder, Russian news agencies reported.
	   Yeltsin expressed the hope that Schroeder's government will
``ensure the continuity of relations between Russia and Germany and
uphold the traditions of good neighborliness, partnership and
cooperation between our countries in the interests of democracy,
stability and security in Europe,'' the presidential press service
said.
	   ``I will be happy to establish personal contacts with you and
invite you to visit Russia at any convenient time,'' the president
said in his message.
	   Yeltsin also telephoned Schroeder on Tuesday to congratulate him
on his victory in Sunday's election. His press service said then
that Schroeder had agreed to visit Moscow soon.
	   Schroeder defeated Helmut Kohl, one of Yeltsin's staunchest
allies.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An ethnic Albanian working for an
international aid agency in Kosovo died and three other people were
injured Wednesday, when their vehicle hit a landmine, officials
said.
	   The incident occurred early Wednesday, when a vehicle for the
International Committee of the Red Cross ran over a landmine on the
Donje Obriga-Likovac road, 30 kilometers (17 miles) west of
Pristina, said Col. Bozidar Filic, spokesman for Serbian police in
Kosovo.
	   Roland Sidler, spokesman for the Red Cross in Geneva, confirmed
the report.
	   The injured were taken to hospital in Pristina, where Shpetim
Rrobaj, an Albanian doctor working for the Red Cross died of his
injures late Wednesday.
	   Another local doctor, Ilir Toljaj, was hospitalized in critical
condition. Two nurses, Maggie Bryson, from New Zealand, and
Albanian Linda Bunjaku, suffered light injuries.
	   Some 250,000 people have been displaced in the southern Serb
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence. Hundreds of aid workers have been struggling to
provide the displaced with food and shelter, before winter sets in.

Zimbabwe post impressive score in third one-day cricket
</HEADLINE>
international

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe batsman Craig Wishart took a
fine century off the Indian bowlers Wednesday in the third and
final one day international of the series.
	   Zimbabwe closed their innings on 260.
	   His 102 almost doubled his previous best of 53 and he hit two
sixes and four fours in providing the foundation for Zimbabwe's
total of 260.
	   Wishart also formed a partnership of 113 with Andy Flower for
the third wicket, Flower making a bright contribution with 55,
including two sixes and three fours, at the Harare Sports Club.
	   The Zimbabwe innings started badly with the dismissal of skipper
Alistair Campbell by Debashish Mohanty with his fifth ball.
Campbell had high hopes of another big score after making 53 and 74
in his first two knocks against India but he was out for four.
	   Craig Evans and Gavin Rennie kept up the momentum lower down to
take Zimbabwe up to their highest score of the series and set India
a serious target.
	   This is Sachin Tendulkar's 200th one day international and all
eyes will be on him to turn it into an occasion in the afternoon.
He set a new record for centuries in internationals at Bulawayo on
Saturday, taking his total up to 18, more than anybody else in the
history of this form of cricket. It is, incidentally, India captain
Mohamad Azharuddin's 299th.
	   The Indian selectors brought in Mohanty and Sanghvi for this
match, the three match series already having been won, to give them
further match experience. Mohanty was steady, taking 1-38 in ten
overs but Sanghvi was severely punished, conceding 47 in six overs.

Attorney general says no need for independent investigating team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's attorney general said
Wednesday an independent team is not needed to investigate the
wealth of former President Suharto.
	   ``What we need is a team of experts,'' Attorney General Andi
Muhammad Ghalib said before attending a Cabinet ministers meeting
at the presidential office.
	   The experts _ academicians and experts on the law _ would
provide support and suggestions to the Attorney General's Office,
said Ghalib, who leads the government's investigation team.
	   Last week, Soehandoyo, a spokesman of Ghalib's office, said the
government was considering the establishment of an independent
team.
	   Such a team was proposed by Adnan Buyung Nasution, a noted
lawyer. Ghalib said Nasution could head the experts' team.
	   Suharto has been accused of illegally enriching himself, his
family and close associates during his 32-year rule, which ended in
May.
	   The 77-year-old autocrat, who resigned amid violent protests
amid the worst economic crisis in 30 years, has repeatedly denied
corruption or stashing cash overseas.
	   However, his denial was greeted with disbelief by many
Indonesians struggling with the crisis.
	   The U.S. magazine Forbes estimates his wealth at dlrs 4 billion.
	   Earlier this week, Suharto supplied a list of assets to his
successor, President B.J. Habibie.
	   Ghalib said his team will soon question those claiming to have
information about the wealth of Suharto and his family.
	   They include sociology professor George Aditjondro, opposition
and Muslim leader Amin Rais and Cristyianto Wibisono, an ethnic
Chinese economist and head of the Center of Indonesia Business
Data.

Clashes follow funeral of Hamas activist killed in explosion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hamas statement, call from man saying he spoke
for Hamas &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BIDDOU, West Bank (AP) _ Hundreds of Palestinians clashed
Wednesday with Israeli troops after the funeral of a Hamas activist
killed when a car rigged with powerful explosives blew up.
	   Two Hamas activists who survived Tuesday's blast denied they
were preparing the car for a bombing attack in Israel, Palestinian
police officials said.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
over renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to carry
out suicide bombings in the Jewish state. Hamas wants to avenge the
recent killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   On Tuesday, shortly after the car exploded in an industrial zone
of Beitunia, a West Bank village near Ramallah, Israel sealed its
borders with the Palestinian areas for Yom Kippur, the holiest day
in the Jewish calendar. The closure was to be lifted gradually
after 1 a.m. Thursday (2300 gmt Wednesday).
	   Israel shuts down during Yom Kippur and there was no official
comment on the Beitunia explosion.
	   The man killed in the blast, Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, was buried
Wednesday in his home village of Biddou, near Ramallah. Hundreds of
villagers walked in the funeral procession led by one marcher with
a Hamas flag.
	   After the funeral, about 400 teen-agers and young men rushed
toward a nearby Jewish settlement, Har Adar, and began throwing
stones at Israeli soldiers posted at the gates.
	   Troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas. Six protesters were
injured.
	   Zahran and his two friends, Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid, also
from Biddou, had been arrested twice by Israel and twice by the
Palestinian Authority for being involved in Hamas activities, most
recently in the spring.
	   The Abu Eid brothers told Palestinian investigators, however,
that they were not rigging the car for a bombing in Israel when the
blast went off Tuesday.
	   They said that just before the explosion, they met an Israeli
Arab man in the car parked in the Beitunia industrial zone,
expecting him to deliver three guns for dlrs 1,000.
	   The brothers said they sat in the front and Zahran sat in the
back with the Israeli Arab whose name is not being released by
Palestinian police. The Abu Eids said they wanted to conclude the
transaction quickly and therefore did not look in the bag the
Israeli Arab handed them before getting out of the car. They said
the bag exploded shortly after they started the car.
	   The Abu Eid brothers were taken to nearby Ramallah Hospital
where they remained in stable condition Wednesday, under police
guard.
	   A man who said he spoke for Hamas called the Palestinian-run
Jerusalem Media and Communications Center, or JMCC, after the blast
and claimed that Israel was behind the bombing.
	   The caller told JMCC owner Ghassan Khatib that the Israeli Arab,
whom he identified as Abu Fahed Yehiyeh from the village of Taibeh,
had sold weapons to Hamas in the past and was now collaborating
with Israeli security forces. Yehiyeh was a marked man and would be
killed, the caller said, according to Khatib.
	   However, Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the caller did not
speak on behalf of the group and that Hamas was launching its own
investigation.

Agassi rolls over Pioline in 34 minutes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Andre Agassi rolled over Cedric Pioline
6-0, 6-0 in only 34 minutes Wednesday to storm into the
quarterfinals of the dlrs 6.7 million Grand Slam Cup.
	   In the quickest match since the tournament's inception in 1990,
Pioline won only eight points in the first set and nine in the
second against an Agassi playing with amazing confidence.
	   Agassi was given a wild card to play in the tournament, which
nominally brings together players with best records in the year's
four Grand Slam events _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and
Wimbledon.
	   But three men's Grand Slam champions of the year have decided to
skip the tournament despite its huge prize money _ Wimbledon
champion and top-ranked Pete Sampras, U.S. Open champion Patrick
Rafter and Carlos Moya, the French Open champion.
	   Only Australian Open champion Petr Korda is among the 12 men
here.
	   ``Regardless of who is not here, this is still a great
tournament,'' Agassi said.
	   For his short work, Agassi earned dlrs 175,000. Even more
amazingly, Pioline picked up dlrs 100,000 given to first-round
losers _ without even winning a game and hardly breaking a sweat.
	   With the official scorecard giving the duration of the match at
34 minutes, it means Agassi made dlrs 5,147 a minute, while Pioline
made dlrs 2,941 a minute in his losing effort.
	   Agassi, ranked No. 8 in the world, hit winners from all over the
court from the start and the Frenchman never had a chance. Agassi
picked apart Pioline's serve with sizzling returns.
	   ``It was all kind of going my way,'' Agassi said. ``He tried
hard, he was hitting the ball decently.''
	   ``I stepped it up and I kept stepping it up. I can have a clean
swing at the ball here indoors,'' the American said. ``It's a great
surface for me, the ball travels fast but it has a slow bounce.''
	   Agassi, a former No. 1 who is making a comeback after dropping
out of the top 100, has won four titles this year. But his Grand
Slam record for the year is relatively poor: Round of 16 at the
Australian and the U.S. Open his best showing.
	   ``I've come here very prepared and I'll feel more satisfied I do
well since I got a wild card,'' said Agassi, a winner of three
Grand Slam titles in his career.

Bulgaria faces possible FIFA suspension over federation ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Bulgaria could face suspension by
FIFA over a government decision to ban the national federation from
running soccer affairs, a spokesman for the game's world governing
body said Wednesday.
	   FIFA contacted the Bulgarian federation at the beginning of this
week over the affair, but has set no deadline for authorities to
act, spokesman Keith Cooper said.
	   ``It's not a dramatic situation at the moment,'' Cooper added.
But ``it is within our power to suspend the federation from
international activity.''
	   In mid-September, the government Committee of Youth, Physical
Training and Sports banned the Bulgarian Football Union from
running soccer affairs, accusing it of failing to react to a
positive doping test of a local player.
	   The committee, which is empowered to license sports
organizations and teams, said it was revoking the license of the
BFU and gave it to the Professional Soccer League.
	   That move is ``not acceptable to us,'' FIFA spokesman Cooper
said. But there is no reason to suppose England's European
Championship qualifying match against Bulgaria on Oct. 10 is in
danger, he said.
	   The government committee said the BFU broke international and
Bulgarian regulations by allowing player Ilya Gruev to be included
in the national team although he had tested positive for
performance-enhancing substances in April. Gruev plays for
Neftochimik in the Black Sea city of Burgas.
	   The BFU is headed by Ivan Slavkov, son-in-law of late communist
ruler Todor Zhivkov. Slavkov has been criticized because of
Bulgaria's poor World Cup performance. The team was eliminated in
the first round of this summer's finals.
	   In August, Poland narrowly escaped suspension by FIFA with a
last-minute move by the country's sport minister to comply with a
deadline for the reinstatement of suspended administrators.
	   FIFA and UEFA, the European governing body, had threatened to
suspend Poland indefinitely if the administrators, suspended in
May, were not reinstated.

Opposition leader says ruling party in disarray over bank bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The leader of Japan's main opposition group said
Wednesday that disagreement within the ruling party threatened to
delay legislation aimed at fixing the nation's ailing banks.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
has yet to submit its proposal for how to strengthen banks whose
financial condition has become dangerously weak, said Naoto Kan,
leader of the Democratic Party.
	   ``There is still confusion and a lack of consensus within the
LDP,'' Kan said.
	   The legislation is controversial, even within the ruling party,
because it would involve the use of public money to bail out
private banks.
	   The delay by the ruling party in putting together a proposal
meant the bank crisis legislation may not pass Parliament's lower
house until next week, Kan said.
	   Meanwhile, Obuchi offered no indication of when his party would
come up with its plan, saying only that the government wanted to
draft and pass the legislation as soon as possible.
	   Lawmakers are hoping to pass a series of bank bills aimed at
cleaning up the debt-ridden financial system and, ultimately, at
rescuing Japan from its most stubborn recession since World War II.
	   Ruling and opposition parties have agreed on the basic outline
of the plan but have yet to turn the agreement into law.
	   And while they wrangle over the details, there are signs Japan's
financial crisis is worsening.
	   The nation suffered the biggest corporate bankruptcy in its
postwar history Monday when Japan Leasing Corp. announced it saw no
way to escape from a crushing burden of bad debt.
	   On Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service cut its rating for the
creditworthiness of Nomura Securities Co., Japan's top brokerage
and one of the world's largest. The move was the latest indication
that international trust in Japan's financial companies was
deteriorating.

Protesters stopped in Baku, some beaten by police during march
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Police in Baku blocked a parade of
protesters and beat some when they tried to march to a rally
outside the former Soviet republic's parliament building Wednesday.
	   Baku Mayor Rafael Allakhverdiyev had said Tuesday night that the
protest could not take place outside parliament because it would
endanger participants of a congress of Caucuses Muslims at the
building.
	   Opposition leaders ignored the order, but when they marched to
the building they ran into more than 100 policemen and soldiers
blocking their way. Police beat some protesters when they tried to
pass.
	   The opposition instead staged the demonstration outside the
Academy of Sciences building, along their route. They again called
for the release of political prisoners in Azerbaijan, and well as a
delay of presidential elections scheduled for Oct. 11.
	   Opposition leaders are boycotting the election because they
believe President Gaidar Aliyev, who is running again, is exerting
too much power over the Caspian Sea country's Central Election
Commission.
	   They threatened to hold a country-wide protest if their demands
are not met.
	   Such an action is likely to lead to clashes with police. Aliyev
recently warned protesters against ``destabilizing'' the country,
and has promised to go ahead with elections.

NATO preparations continue, but no decision on air strikes yet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo; Yugoslavia-Kosovo Massacre &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO is close to finalizing military
preparations for air strikes against Serb forces in Kosovo,
officials said Wednesday, but a meeting of alliance ambassadors
came no closer to actually ordering an attack.
	   Officials at NATO headquarters indicated the alliance was
unlikely to make such a decision until after U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan presents a report on Kosovo to the Security Council next
week.
	   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said alliance
warplanes and cruise missiles would be ready for action against the
Serbs soon after a decision to attack was taken.
	   U.S. diplomats had been hoping that the panel of 16 NATO
ambassadors would produce a stronger signal to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic that the alliance's patience was running out.
	   Pressure on NATO to stop the Serb crackdown against ethnic
Albanian separatists in Kosovo is growing following the discovery
this week of a massacre of ethnic Albanian villagers, including
women and children.
	   But European allies urged caution and resisted calls for NATO to
set a deadline for Milosevic to pull his forces out of Kosovo. Some
allies say a further U.N. resolution is needed before NATO can
strike.
	   NATO threatened last week to unleash its air power against the
Serb forces, after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution
calling on Milosevic to halt hostilities.
	   The U.N. said it would consider ``further action and additional
measures to maintain or restore peace and stability in the
region,'' if the Serbs failed to comply.
	   The United States argues that's all the authorization NATO
needs. Other allies, with Greece the most vocal, say specific U.N.
authorization of military action may be needed.
	   Meanwhile, several allied nations have pledged to make planes
available for a strike.
	   Germany has offered 14 Tornado fighter planes, the Netherlands
and Norway have each offered eight F-16 fighters and Spain has
pledged four F-18s.
	   The United States has declined to say publicly what forces what
it is offering, but NATO officials said U.S. cruise missiles were
ready for action in the Balkans.
	   NATO officials said the alliance had reports some Yugoslav army
forces and heavy weapons were pulling out of Kosovo as demanded by
NATO. But one official called the withdrawal ``totally
inadequate.''

Hong Kong luxury retailer to cut salaries by 10 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A major luxury retailer said Wednesday it will
cut staff salaries by an average of 10 percent, sparking fears that
more employers would follow suit.
	   The board of the locally listed Dickson Concepts (International)
Ltd. approved the pay cut in anticipation of a possible operating
loss for this fiscal year ``in this extremely difficult trading
climate,'' a company statement said.
	   However, the retailer, which employs 1,600 people in Hong Kong,
said that if there is a profit for the fiscal year ending next
March 31, half of it will be used to compensate its employees.
	   The company, whose operations include the Warner Brothers Studio
Stores and Polo/Ralph Lauren outlets in Hong Kong and Harvey
Nichols in Britain, said last week half-year results would be lower
than market expectations.
	   The territory's retail sales in the first seven months fell by
15 percent from January-July last year, the government announced
last week.
	   Dickson's announcement came two weeks after Hong Kong
Telecommunications, one of the territory's largest employers, with
13,800 workers, announced 10 percent across-the-board pay cuts.
	   Unionists warned the Telecom's decision would trigger a fresh
round of pay cuts as officials expect unemployment _ already at a
15-year high of 5 percent _ to worsen in the coming months.
	   Under mounting pressure, Telecom later withdrew the plan. It is
negotiating with union representatives on cost-cutting measures.
	   Hit hard by the regional retail slump, Dickson Concepts has
already laid off 80 staff since the beginning of this year, and
reduced salaries of its six directors by 20 percent in June, a
company spokeswoman said.
	   She said the company has promised no further pay cuts until the
next salary review in February, but cannot rule out further
layoffs.

Clashes follow funeral of Hamas activist killed in explosion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hamas statement, call from man saying he spoke
for Hamas &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BIDDOU, West Bank (AP) _ Hundreds of Palestinians clashed
Wednesday with Israeli troops after the funeral of a Hamas activist
killed when a car rigged with powerful explosives blew up.
	   Two Hamas activists who survived Tuesday's blast denied they
were preparing the car for a bombing attack in Israel, Palestinian
police officials said.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
over renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to carry
out suicide bombings in the Jewish state. Hamas wants to avenge the
recent killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   On Tuesday, shortly after the car exploded in an industrial zone
of Beitunia, a West Bank village near Ramallah, Israel sealed its
borders with the Palestinian areas for Yom Kippur, the holiest day
in the Jewish calendar. The closure was to be lifted gradually
after 1 a.m. Thursday (2300 GMT Wednesday).
	   Israel shuts down during Yom Kippur and there was no official
comment on the Beitunia explosion.
	   The man killed in the blast, Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, was buried
Wednesday in his home village of Biddou, near Ramallah. Hundreds of
villagers walked in the funeral procession led by one marcher with
a Hamas flag.
	   After the funeral, about 400 teen-agers and young men rushed
toward a nearby Jewish settlement, Har Adar, and began throwing
stones at Israeli soldiers posted at the gates.
	   Troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas. Six protesters were
injured.
	   Zahran and his two friends, Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid, also
from Biddou, had been arrested twice by Israel and twice by the
Palestinian Authority for being involved in Hamas activities, most
recently in the spring.
	   The Abu Eid brothers told Palestinian investigators, however,
that they were not rigging the car for a bombing in Israel when the
blast went off Tuesday.
	   They said that just before the explosion, they met an Israeli
Arab man in the car parked in the Beitunia industrial zone,
expecting him to deliver three guns for dlrs 1,000.
	   The brothers said they sat in the front and Zahran sat in the
back with the Israeli Arab whose name is not being released by
Palestinian police. The Abu Eids said they wanted to conclude the
transaction quickly and therefore did not look in the bag the
Israeli Arab handed them before getting out of the car. They said
the bag exploded shortly after they started the car.
	   The Abu Eid brothers were taken to nearby Ramallah Hospital
where they remained in stable condition Wednesday, under police
guard.
	   A man who said he spoke for Hamas called the Palestinian-run
Jerusalem Media and Communications Center after the blast and
claimed that Israel was behind the bombing.
	   The caller told JMCC owner Ghassan Khatib that the Israeli Arab,
whom he identified as Abu Fahed Yehiyeh from the village of Taibeh,
had sold weapons to Hamas in the past and was now collaborating
with Israeli security forces. Yehiyeh was a marked man and would be
killed, the caller said, according to Khatib.
	   However, Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the caller did not
speak on behalf of the group and that Hamas was launching its own
investigation.

No talks until Oct. 8; start of season in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The first delay to the start of an U.S. National
Basketball Association season was virtually assured on Wednesday
when the league announced labor talks will not resume until Oct. 8.
	   NBA spokesman Chris Brienza confirmed the decision Wednesday
morning, two days after commissioner David Stern, deputy
commissioner Russ Granik, players union director Billy Hunter and
union president Patrick Ewing met for one hour.
	   The league wanted to meet for a formal bargaining session as
soon as Thursday, but the union said nothing could be scheduled
until Oct. 8 because of previous commitments, Granik said.
	   ``I was bowled over to hear that we can't meet for nine days
while Rome is burning,'' Granik told the Philadelphia Daily News.
	   Granik was not in his office Wednesday. Hunter, who was in
Houston on Tuesday, did not return messages.
	   The regular season is scheduled to begin Nov. 3, and at least
three weeks would be needed after an agreement is reached to sign
players, make trades and hold abbreviated training camps.
	   So unless a deal can be completed within a day or two after the
sides reconvene, there appears to be no way the season can start on
time.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police denied responsibility
Wednesday for the massacre of ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo,
but said they were investigating it ``based on press reports.''
	   The denial came after ethnic Albanians and at least one human
rights group assailed the Serbs in the deaths of 18 men, women and
children who were shot in the back of the head and mutilated.
	   Austria on Wednesday called for an international investigation.
	   The slaying of the victims, whose bodies were seen this week by
diplomats and journalists in a forest in the Drenica region west of
Pristina, have inflamed tensions in Kosovo.
	   The majority ethnic Albanian province is part of Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic. Many Albanians, who once had a measure
of autonomym have demanded independence.

ADB approves dlrs 102 million loan for water project in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Asian Development Bank on
Wednesday approved a dlrs 102 million loan to help finance a
project to provide more drinking water and a cleaner environment
for a growing Chinese city.
	   The Manila-based bank said the economy of Fuzhou city in Fujian
province has grown by nearly 20 percent over the past decade and
that water demand has exceeded supply. The city can no longer treat
waste water and sewage properly, it said.
	   The project, to cost a total of dlrs 190 million, will pipe in
water from a river 20 kilometers (12 miles) away to a treatment
plant, from where it will be distributed to the city's 6 million
residents. It also includes the construction of a new sewage system
and waste water treatment plant.
	   The loan carries interest determined by the bank's pool-based
variable lending rate, which currently is 6.76 percent a year. It
is repayable in 24 years, including a four-year grace period.

Romanian stuntman killed by gang in Bucharest disco
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A much-loved stuntman was beaten to
death after he tried to defend a waitress who was being harassed at
a discotheque, media reported Wednesday.
	   Florin Marculescu was attacked by 16 unknown assailants after he
intervened with his colleagues to stop the men pestering a waitress
Saturday night. He was employed as a bodyguard at the disco.
	   Marculescu, 41, died the next day of internal hemorrhaging in
the Bucharest Emergency hospital. Police are investigating his
death, said Col. Nicolae Petre, a police officer quoted by daily
Libertatea.
	   Violence is on the rise in Romania. Gangs of skinheads and
bodybuilders recently have appeared attacking people.
	   Stuntmen are popular in Romania for their role in overthrowing
communism in a bloody 1989 revolt. About one dozen stuntmen died
then.
	   One of Marculescu's friends, Gheorghe Marcu from the Romanian
Stuntmen Association, said they would take revenge on Marculescu's
killers.
	   ``There are 200 stuntmen tracking the killers,'' Libertatea
quoted him as saying. ``These beasts will not escape us.''
	   Marculescu starred in several Romanian movies and was loved for
his generous nature. He financially supported seven elderly
relatives.
	   Marculescu is survived by his wife and two children. He will be
buried Thursday.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS name of manufacturer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Social Democrats weren't smiling about a
toothpaste ad appearing in newspapers Wednesday that takes
unauthorized advantage of chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's
winning smile.
	   The full-page ad for Perlweiss toothpaste includes a headshot of
Schroeder flashing his broad, toothy grin over the slogan ``He
showed them all.''
	   The Social Democrats general manager Franz Muentefering said the
party would send a complaint to the manufacturer, Carter-Wallace
Ltd. in Folkestone, England, and the German Advertising Council.
	   German law allows the unauthorized use of photos of public
figures for journalistic or satirical purposes, but not for
advertising, he said.
	   Muentefering said the party would not take legal action against
the firm unless it keeps running the ad.

Government's blueprint calls for reversal of free-market reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to include details of a draft economic
plan, comments from Fyodorov, TRIMS previous. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new Cabinet has prepared an economic plan
that would effectively erase free-market reforms by nationalizing
most commercial banks and reintroducing Soviet-era currency
controls, a newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The Kommersant business newspaper said the plan also calls for
printing more rubles to boost the money supply by 60 percent _ and
move that would fuel inflation.
	   The document was drafted by a group of Soviet-era economic
experts selected by Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist who is first deputy
prime minister in charge of economic strategy. Maslyukov was the
last chairman of the Soviet central planning agency, Gosplan.
	   ``Maslyukov's program again turns Russia into a transition
economy, only this time it will move backward _ to the Russian
Soviet Federal Socialist Republic,'' Kommersant said.
	   The plan calls for nationalizing most of Russia's commercial
banks and using their assets to help troubled industries. It also
proposes using factors other than the market _ such as the balance
of payments _ to set the ruble's exchange rate, the newspaper said.
	   Government spokesman Andrei Korotkov confirmed that Maslyukov
had worked out an economic plan that will be discussed by the
Cabinet on Thursday and will become the basis for a government
program to be unveiled on Oct. 8.
	   He said the document calls for more state controls over banks
and the currency market but would not give any specifics.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov so far has provided only sketchy
economic guidelines to cope with the worst economic crisis since
the 1991 Soviet collapse but said that Russia would stay on the
path of reform.
	   He said the government's top priority is to pay overdue wages
and pensions to millions of state workers.
	   ``There is no political crisis, but there is certain
socio-economic tension,'' Primakov said during a visit to
neighboring Belarus on Wednesday. Russia is pursuing ``reforms that
should serve people.''
	   Primakov has said the government already paid part of its debt,
including military wages, and promised to pay current wages on time
starting in October. He hasn't said, however, where the government
will get the money.
	   ``The question is excessive... They are going to crank up
money-printing presses,'' Kommersant said. ``Social pathos will
bring hyperinflation.''
	   Former tax chief Boris Fyodorov, who was ousted by President
Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday, said the government should move to boost
tax collection and radically cut spending instead of printing new
money.
	   ``Printing money is like a drug. Once you grow addicted to that,
it's hard to stop,'' he said in an interview published Wednesday in
the liberal daily Izvestia.
	   A top Central Bank official said Wednesday that Russia's new
government had little choice but to boost the money supply,
although she expressed reservations about the policy.
	   Tatiana Paramonova, who headed the Central Bank in 1995, won
parliamentary approval Wednesday to the bank's board. ``It will be
very difficult to limit the negative impact of money supply growth,
but it has to be a basis of our monetary policy,'' she said.
	   The new government has already begun to expand the country's
money supply as a way to help troubled banks and get the country's
financial system moving again.
	   Inflation has gone up 67 percent since August, and could reach
several hundred percent by the end of the year, according to
Central Bank predictions.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin filled several more vacant Cabinet posts
Wednesday. The new Cabinet has been almost three weeks in the
making, and the president has filled about 25 spots, and several
more remain vacant.
	   Yeltsin named Sergei Kalashnikov, 47, a member of Vladimir
Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist party, as minister of labor.
Kalashnikov has served as chairman of the parliament's social
affairs committee.
	   Yeltsin also selected ministers of culture, education and
health, and re-appointed the ministers of nuclear power and
agriculture, Russian media reported.

NATO preparations continue, but no decision on air strikes yet

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO is close to finalizing military
preparations for air strikes against Serb forces in Kosovo,
officials said Wednesday, but a meeting of alliance ambassadors
came no closer to actually ordering an attack.
	   Officials at NATO headquarters indicated the alliance was
unlikely to make such a decision until after U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan presents a report on Kosovo to the Security Council next
week.
	   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said alliance
warplanes and cruise missiles would be ready for action against the
Serbs soon after a decision to attack was taken.
	   U.S. diplomats had been hoping that the panel of 16 NATO
ambassadors would produce a stronger signal to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic that the alliance's patience was running out.
	   Pressure on NATO to stop the Serb crackdown against ethnic
Albanian separatists in Kosovo is growing following the discovery
this week of a massacre of ethnic Albanian villagers, including
women and children.
	   But European allies urged caution and resisted calls for NATO to
set a deadline for Milosevic to pull his forces out of Kosovo. Some
allies say a further U.N. resolution is needed before NATO can
strike.
	   NATO threatened last week to unleash its air power against the
Serb forces, after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution
calling on Milosevic to halt hostilities.
	   The Security Council said it would consider ``further action and
additional measures to maintain or restore peace and stability in
the region,'' if the Serbs failed to comply.
	   Meanwhile, several allied nations have pledged to make planes
available for a strike.
	   Germany has offered 14 Tornado fighter planes, the Netherlands
and Norway have each offered eight F-16 fighters and Spain has
pledged four F-18s.
	   The United States has declined to say publicly what forces it is
offering, but NATO officials said U.S. cruise missiles were ready
for action in the Balkans.
	   NATO officials said the alliance had reports some Yugoslav army
forces and heavy weapons were pulling out of Kosovo as demanded by
NATO. But one official called the withdrawal ``totally
inadequate.''

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's union workers said Wednesday that for the
first time ever they have complained about their government to the
United Nation's International Labor Organization over labor rights.
	   Mohammad Salman, the deputy president of the Kuwait Trade Union
Federation, told The Associated Press that the workers have ``tried
to work things out with the government, but found no response.''
	   He said authorities have not been licensing any new trade unions
while ``the right to establish them was guaranteed by the
constitution.''
	   Also, the Cabinet has not moved to approve a new labor law that
would give more rights to workers, Salman said.
	   The unionist said the Geneva-based ILO has reacted positively to
the complaint that was sent two weeks ago.
	   The ILO has offered to fly a delegation to this oil-rich Gulf
state to discuss the complaint, said Salman whose federation groups
14 unions, including several for oil workers.
	   Government officials could not be reached for comment.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The assets of the Central Bank of Jordan
dropped by 1.6 percent to 3.45 billion Jordanian dinars (dlrs 4.86
billion) because of reduced deposits by commercial banks, a bank
official said Wednesday.
	   The drop was recorded in August this year, compared with the
same month in 1997, said the official, who spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   He said the reduced deposits allowed Jordan's 22 financial
institutions to invest in development projects.
	   Last year, CBJ reduced commercial bank desposits with the
treasury by 20 percent to 15 percent to encourage investment as
part of reforms to ease the burden of dlrs 6.1 billion foreign
debts.
	   The official said local currency assets exceeded 1.057 billion
dinars (dlrs 1.488 billion), including 425 million dinars (dlrs 598
million) treasury bonds and notes, bills and securities, loans,
corporate bonds and credit facilities.
	   Foreign exchange resereves, including gold, increased by 1.2
percent to 2.4 billion dinars (dlrs 3.4 billion) in August,
compared with the same month in 1997, the official added.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's consumer price index, an indicator
of inflation, rose 4.3 percent in the 12 months to the end of
August, the government's main statistics agency has reported.
	   Prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, according to the most
recent report issued by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization
and Statistics.
	   Twelve-month consumer price inflation in August 1997 was 4.1
percent. Year-on-year inflation has topped 4% in each of the past
two reporting months, after spending the first six months of 1998
below 4 percent.
	   The Ministry of Economy attributed the jump to a periodic
reweighting of the basket of goods used to generate the CPI to
reflect new results from the nation's household income survey.
	   CAPMAS reweights the basket every five years, the ministry said.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ In another blow to Italy's scandal-shaken soccer
world, newspapers reported Wednesday that a positive drug test on a
first-division player was covered up.
	   Corriere della Sera, Italy's leading paper, said Wednesday that
random tests were done on four players after the Jan. 4
Roma-Udinese game. One Udinese player tested positive, the
newspaper said, but the lab altered the test results.
	   The report comes just two days after the head of the Italian
Olympic Committee, Mario Pescante, resigned amid growing criticism
that drug tests were not conducted properly.
	   Corriere said that the chemist who handled the Roma-Udinese
tests has talked to the prosecutor looking into alleged drug use by
soccer players, Raffaele Guariniello. The chemist said his superior
ordered him to alter the test results.
	   The Udinese players that underwent the post-game tests were
Francesco Statuto and Alessandro Calori. Udinese won the game 2-1.
	   ``This all seems strange to me; the situation is absurd,''
Statuto said Wednesday, adding, ``My conscience is clear.''
	   Udinese official Sergio Vignoni said the team was not aware of
the alleged test falsification. ``We are amazed,'' he said.
	   The urine tests were performed at lab designated by the Italian
Olympic Committee, which oversees Italy's antidoping program. It is
on the outskirts of Rome.
	   There have been a series of doping investigations this year into
Italian athletes. One investigation, done for the Olympic
Committee's doping commission, ended in August without finding
evidence of illegal drug use, but did find that the use of legal
muscle-builders is widespread.

Indonesian leader warns of possible anarchy amid economic crisis

rally, changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ On the 33rd anniversary of a bloody
communist coup attempt, Indonesia's president warned Wednesday that
looming anarchy could wipe out reforms for the crisis-ridden
economy and attempts to build a new democracy.
	   And, in its sternest warning yet, the government said it could
use a harsh anti-subversion law enacted by former President Suharto
to curb those who plot for its overthrow.
	   Suharto was forced to quit in May after riots killed about 1,200
people.
	   Four months later, his successor, President B.J. Habibie, has
been plagued by a new wave of protests over soaring food prices and
mass unemployment. Food shortages have triggered looting and more
riots in some areas.
	   Worried by growing lawlessness, Habibie used a national
television address to call for calm and national unity to help fix
deep economic and political problems.
	   He warned that competing groups were trying to force their
wishes on society and the government.
	   ``If this sort of thing happens, what will materialize will not
be a civil society, but a society that will sooner or later be
controlled by anarchy with all its consequences that will harm the
nation.
	   ``Anarchism will not solve the crisis and will not spin the
wheel of development toward achieving a just, prosperous, peaceful
society,'' he said. ``Anarchy is also against our endeavors to push
for a democratic way of life, based on law and the principles of
universal human rights.''
	   He said massive international loans and a program of tough
reform had produced some encouraging, albeit small, results for the
economy, which has been hard hit by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   Habibie's speech was broadcast after a five-hour Cabinet meeting
dedicated solely to internal security fears.
	   ``Indonesia does not want to see its government overthrown by
demonstrations and riots as happened in the past to the two regimes
of President Sukarno and President Suharto,'' Justice Minister
Muladi said at the end of the meeting.
	   Wednesday was the anniversary of an attempted communist coup
against the government of Sukarno. The military, led by then Maj.
Gen. Suharto, crushed the putsch after six other generals were
murdered. A storm of protest that followed led to Suharto taking
power from Sukarno. This in turn was followed by a bloodbath
against leftists.
	   Suharto enacted the tough anti-subversion law in 1973 and used
it repeatedly during the next quarter-century to stamp out dissent.
	   Earlier Wednesday, thousands of Muslims staged a rally at
Jakarta's biggest mosque and warned that communist-like groups were
behind rising civil unrest and student protests.
	   Muladi said the current level of unrest has not been strong
enough to threaten the government.
	   ``But I have to warn protesters not to go much further. It might
lead to a situation in which there is a systematic plan and
movement to overthrow the government,'' he said.
	   Muladi said change in Indonesia must be based on the principles
of democracy and law.
	   ``Whoever violates these principles will be charged with
violating the law issued in 1973,'' Muladi said in reference to
Suharto's anti-subversion legislation, which has been widely
criticized by human rights groups.
	   Muladi said the government did not approve of the law and
planned to have it replaced. But until then it could be used.

Schroeder visits Paris amid French fears of losing out to British

	   PARIS (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, on his first foreign trip as
Germany's chancellor-elect, arrived in France Wednesday seeking to
dispel worries that his desire for closer ties with Britain could
lower Paris' profile in Europe.
	   Schroeder warmly clasped hands with conservative President
Jacques Chirac in their first-ever meeting and the two exchanged a
joke.
	   Schroeder arrived in a chauffeur-driven French limousine,
sitting next to foreign policy adviser Brigitte Sauzay, a former
interpreter for the late French President Francois Mitterrand.
	   The French-German axis, honed by Mitterrand and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, was critical to building a stronger European Union,
including the euro single currency that takes effect in January.
The two countries are each other's largest trading partners.
	   But Schroeder, whose weekend election victory spelled the end to
16 years of leadership by Kohl, has caused jitters in Paris because
of his interest in better ties with London.
	   That Germany assumes the rotating six-month presidency of the
European Union in January can only increase the concern.
	   The 54-year-old Social Democrat, who speaks English but not
French, was expected to reaffirm his commitment to strong relations
with France during lunch with Chirac and a meeting with Socialist
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   Both Schroeder and Chirac portrayed themselves in comments after
lunch as on the same wavelength.
	   ``We found ourselves completely on the same line which I
welcomed,'' Chirac told reporters, saying the talks were the
beginning of ``a long and fruitful relationship.''
	   ``I felt the same way,'' Schroeder said. ``Paris is near in
every aspect.''
	   France and Germany plan to set up working groups on European
union reform, Schroeder added, stressing ``the need to work
together.''
	   An aide to Chirac, speaking on condition of not being further
identified, brushed aside reports of a French fear.
	   The issue of Britain was discussed, said the aide, and Chirac
expressed support for bringing Britain further into the process.

KGB spies tell all _ well, almost all _ about their lives abroad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ They was sitting on the terrace of a Mafia
chieftain's villa outside Palermo when the Godfather asked Leonid
Kolosov if he was really just a newspaper reporter in search of a
story.
	   ``I looked him straight in the eye, as we were taught in KGB
school, and lied,'' Kolosov recalls. He was really just a simple
reporter, he told the mobster. Even if he wanted to, he didn't have
time to be a spy.
	   Then he went ahead and recruited the mob chief as a valuable
informer for the Soviet spy agency.
	   Kolosov was a KGB agent in Rome, Paris and Madrid, and his are
among the revealing _ not to mention entertaining _ stories
collected in a new book, ``Undercover Lives: Soviet Spies in the
Cities of the World.''
	   The book, being published in Britain next month and Germany
early next year, is loosely based on a Russian-language book, the
``KGB Guidebook to Cities of the World,'' published two years ago.
	   But where that book offered a nuts-and-bolts guide to the
world's leading spook sights, the new book is more of a memoir of
spy's lives, from a time when the Cold War made the world's
capitals a playground for espionage.
	   A half-dozen former spies who contributed to the book gathered
Wednesday at the press center of the Foreign Intelligence Service _
one of the successor agencies to the KGB _ to tell their stories
and get a first look at copies of the book, edited by a British
journalist, Helen Womack.
	   Womack, a veteran Moscow correspondent, said she had been asked
to help translate and edit the original book when it was published
by a Moscow newspaper, ``Top Secret.''
	   ``They were giving travel tips to Russians who had never been
abroad _ you know, if you go to Paris, don't miss the Eiffel
Tower,'' she recalled. ``I realized it would have to be completely
different for Western readers.''
	   The book offers little in the way of sensational news, although
it does describe an aborted plan to assassinate Spanish dictator
Francisco Franco, and says there were talks between the Soviet
Union and West Germany to dismantle the Berlin Wall as early as the
1970s.
	   Mostly, if offers insights into the daily lives of agents whose
exploits sound like a low-rent mix of James Bond and Boris Badenov,
the nudnik Russian spy in the American cartoon series, ``Rocky and
his Friends.''
	   There are tales of love affairs and drinking bouts, of shooting
pens and booby-trapped cars, of treachery and _ a common theme
throughout the book _ honest, sincere patriotism.
	   ``Obviously, they weren't going to open up any state secrets,''
Womack said. ``But they did tell us a lot about their lifestyle in
our countries.''
	   Mikhail Lyubimov, a KGB agent in London, describes falling in
love with Britain, and fondly remembers days off in Hyde Park,
jogging or pushing a stroller with his newborn son.
	   He recalls his amazement at the civility of English police.
``Once at night a bobby stopped me: `Excuse me sir, perhaps it
would be a good idea if you put on your lights.' I thought I was
talking to Sir Walter Scott.''
	   But he never got over his Marxist outrage at the pampered lives
of the British upper class.
	   Vasily Timofeyev, once the KGB's man in Bangkok, offers a KGB
guide to dining with informants in the Thai capital. The key, he
says, is to find a restaurant off the beaten path that is busy, but
not too busy, with music that is loud, but not too loud. The lights
should be nice and dim.
	   Only about 5 percent of Bangkok's eateries qualify, he says.
	   Timofeyev also worked in New Delhi, and describes his absurd
efforts to recruit an American yoga enthusiast in the 1970s, when
many young Americans were seeking spiritual succor in India.
	   Most of the time, Timofeyev said, he was supposed to be
ferreting secrets out of Indians. But the KGB apparently considered
any American, no matter how useless their knowledge or clueless
their contacts, a prize catch.
	   Timofeyev describes tagging along with his American target to a
yoga seminar in a provincial Indian city, and being forced to
participate to prove his sincerity.
	   ``I sat in the Lotus position _ well, half-Lotus to be precise _
and did the Cowface, Cobra and Modified Fish postures,'' the
Russian spy recounts. ``And I breathed.''
	   Eventually, Timofeyev gave up on his would-be recruit, having
concluded: ``He was a yoga fanatic and nothing more.''
	   The spy said he probably should have kept up his yoga, though.
	   ``Intelligence work is very stressful, and perhaps yoga would
have been good for my body, mind and spirit,'' he writes. ``But I
was too busy. When I needed to unwind after work, it was easier
just to reach for the whiskey, then walk over to the fridge for the
ice. It was a professional weakness. I think most of my colleagues
were like that.''

allies say a further U.N. resolution is needed before NATO can
strike.
	   NATO threatened last week to unleash its air power against the
Serb forces, after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution
calling on Milosevic to halt hostilities.
	   The U.N. said it would consider ``further action and additional
measures to maintain or restore peace and stability in the
region,'' if the Serbs failed to comply.
	   The United States argues that's all the authorization NATO
needs. Other allies, with Greece the most vocal, say specific U.N.
authorization of military action may be needed.
	   Meanwhile, several allied nations have pledged to make planes
available for a strike.
	   Germany has offered 14 Tornado fighter planes, the Netherlands
and Norway have each offered eight F-16 fighters and Spain has
pledged four F-18s.
	   Britain has four Harrier jets in Italy, and four Harrier jets on
standby to go to the region if needed for air strikes, said a
spokesman for the Ministry of Defense in London.
	   The United States has declined to say publicly what forces what
it is offering, but NATO officials said U.S. cruise missiles were
ready for action in the Balkans.
	   NATO officials said the alliance had reports some Yugoslav army
forces and heavy weapons were pulling out of Kosovo as demanded by
NATO. But one official called the withdrawal ``totally
inadequate.''

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Craig Wishart's century paced Zimbabwe
to 260 for five in its 50 overs Wednesday in the third and final
one-day international against India.
	   His 102 almost doubled his previous best of 53 and including two
sixes and four fours.
	   Wishart also formed a third-wicket partnership of 113 with Andy
Flower, who added 55 including two sixes and three fours, at the
Harare Sports Club.
	   The Zimbabwe innings started badly with the dismissal of skipper
Alistair Campbell by Debashish Mohanty with his fifth ball.
Campbell had high hopes of another big score after making 53 and 74
in the first two one-dayers against India but was out for four.
	   Craig Evans and Gavin Rennie kept up the momentum lower down to
take Zimbabwe up to their highest score of the series and set India
a serious target.
	   The match marked Sachin Tendulkar's 200th one-day international.
He hit a record 18th century in one-day internationals at Bulawayo
on Saturda. The match also was India captain Mohamad Azharuddin's
299th.
	   The Indian selectors brought in Mohanty and Rahul Sanghvi for
this match. With the three match series already having been won by
India, the moves was to give them further match experience. Mohanty
was steady, taking 1-38 in 10n overs but Sanghvi was severely
punished, conceding 47 in six overs.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO is close to finalizing military
preparations for air strikes against Serb forces in Kosovo,
officials said Wednesday, but a meeting of alliance ambassadors
came no closer to actually ordering an attack.
	   Officials at NATO headquarters indicated the alliance was
unlikely to make such a decision until after U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan presents a report on Kosovo to the Security Council next
week.
	   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said alliance
warplanes and cruise missiles would be ready for action against the
Serbs soon after a decision to attack was taken.
	   U.S. diplomats had been hoping that the panel of 16 NATO
ambassadors would produce a stronger signal to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic that the alliance's patience was running out.
	   Pressure on NATO to stop the Serb crackdown against ethnic
Albanian separatists in Kosovo is growing following the discovery
this week of a massacre of ethnic Albanian villagers, including
women and children.
	   But European allies urged caution and resisted calls for NATO to
set a deadline for Milosevic to pull his forces out of Kosovo. Some
allies say a further U.N. resolution is needed before NATO can
strike.
	   NATO threatened last week to unleash its air power against the
Serb forces, after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution

German Social Democrats irked by toothpaste ad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 2 grafs with no comment from manufacturer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Social Democrats weren't smiling about a
toothpaste ad appearing in newspapers Wednesday that takes
unauthorized advantage of chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's
winning smile.
	   The full-page ad for Perlweiss toothpaste includes a headshot of
Schroeder flashing his broad, toothy grin over the slogan ``He
showed them all.''
	   The Social Democrats general manager Franz Muentefering said the
party would send a complaint to the manufacturer, Carter-Wallace
Ltd. in Folkestone, England, and the German Advertising Council.
	   German law allows the unauthorized use of photos of public
figures for journalistic or satirical purposes, but not for
advertising, he said.
	   Muentefering said the party would not take legal action against
the firm unless it keeps running the ad.
	   A Carter-Wallace spokeswoman referred calls to the company's
German licensee, Murnauer Markenvertrieb GmbH, which referred calls
to its advertising agency, Springer and Jacoby in Hamburg.
	   A spokeswoman there said the director was out of the office.

Polish WWII forced-labor survivors want to be indemnified
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Thousands of Poles who were brought to
Austria as forced laborers during World War II called Wednesday on
the Austrian government to set up a reparations fund to benefit
survivors.
	   Between 1939 and 1945, some 150,000 Poles were taken to what was
Nazi-ruled Austria and forced to work in state-run factories,
businesses and on privately own farms, according to Karol
Gawlowski, head of the Association of Poles Who Suffered Under the
Third Reich.
	   In all, up to 800,000 foreigners were forced to work in Austria
during the war to replace men fighting in the German Wehrmacht for
the Nazis, many of them inmates of the dreaded Mauthausen
concentration camp and its subsidiaries.
	   The Austrian government, as well as private companies and
associations representing other industries who used the Poles'
services between 1938-45, should set up a reparations fund,
Gawlowski said. Survivors would receive up to 35,000 schillings
(dlrs 3,000) each.
	   Today, only about 20,000 of the workers are still alive and many
of them suffer from poverty and failing health.
	   ``We're running out of time,'' said Gawlowski, who also was
brought to Austria as a force laborer.
	   Heinrich Neisser, a senior lawmaker in the Austrian Parliament,
told the Austria Press Agency Wednesday he supported the idea of
reparations.
	   The Austrian government on Tuesday nominated a Supreme Court
judge to head an independent commission of historians to examine
the question of forced labor in Austria under the Nazi regime.
	   Representatives of Austrian Farmers' and Industry Workers'
Associations also said they would consider contributing to a
reparations fund.
	   Forced labor was considered a war crime at the Nuremberg Trials,
but Austria, which for years considered itself the first victim of
Nazi aggression, has been slow in coming to terms with its wartime
past.

Iraqi opposition reports attacks by Saddam's forces in south
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraqi government forces have attacked at
least four villages in southern Iraq over the past week, killing
and displacing many people, an Iraqi opposition group said.
	   It did not say what prompted the attack but President Saddam
Hussein's troops often raid villages in the Shiite dominated
southern Iraq in search of Shiite Muslim rebels.
	   Iraqi forces began attacking the villages of Zerwat Al Juweiber,
Berket Sayed Youshe'a, Hour Al Saleh and Al-Dawarah in the
al-Nasiryah province on Sept. 22, the Supreme Council for the
Islamic Revolution in Iraq said.
	   The Shiite group is based in Tehran and there was no way to
verify its claims. The Iraqi government usually does not comment on
such reports.
	   The Supreme Council's leader, Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, sent a
letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday to inform him
about the attacks. A copy of the letter was faxed to The Associated
Press in Cairo, Egypt on Wednesday.
	   Al-Hakim said the Iraqi army shelled the villages before sending
in raiding parties of the elite Republican Guards and the
paramilitary Saddam's Commandos.
	   Many people were killed or displaced, al-Hakim said. He did not
give specific figures.
	   His letter urged Annan to take the ``immediate and urgent
measures that would deter Saddam's regime from committing these
crimes and protecting the innocent people from the dangerous
results'' of the attacks.
	   Al-Hakim said the commanders of the attack are former defense
minister and Saddam's cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, and former army
chief of staff, Iyad Futieh al-Rawi, who is currently mayor of
Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
	   In a separate statement, the group said resistance fighters and
civilians repulsed the attacks in some instances and killed more
than 20 soldiers besides destroying seven armed vehicles. It said
troops used bulldozers to destroy the village of Al-Dawarah.
	   The attacked areas are in a no-fly zone imposed over southern
Iraq since 1992 to stop Iraqi air attacks on Shiite Muslim rebels.
Warplanes of the United States and its allies patrol the zone.
	   Shiites are in a slight majority in Iraq but the government and
the military is controlled by the Sunnis.

graf 4 that Yeltsin has said he that he will not run again &QL; 
 &UR; Moscow mayor says he may run for Russian presidency &QL; 
 &UR; By BRYAN BRUMLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said Wednesday that he
might run for the Russian presidency in two years if he feels no
other candidate can solve his country's problems.
	   Luzhkov, whose name is often mentioned as a candidate, said he
had not made up his mind.
	   ``But if I see that the contenders running for the presidency do
not have appropriate state positions and views that will bring
stability and prosperity, then I may throw my hat into the ring,''
he said.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that he will not run for
re-election in 2000. His standing was shaken when his government
allowed the ruble to fall against Western currencies and declared a
moratorium on payments of loans.
	   Luzhkov, visiting Britain at the invitation of Prime Minister
Tony Blair, with whom he met Tuesday, called for a restructuring of
Russia's debt to the West to give the country ``a breathing
space.''
	   The Moscow mayor said he had ``absolute respect'' for the new
Russian Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, but he
took several back-handed swipes at former premier Viktor
Chernomyrdin, whose name also has been mentioned as a presidential
contender.
	   Chernomyrdin's political organization, Our Home is Russia, ``is
not a party at all,'' Luzhkov said. ``It's a group of members of
parliament.''
	   And Luzhkov criticized Western lending practices to Russia
during Chernomyrdin's tenure, saying that the International
Monetary Fund and other institutions had ``made mistakes on a grand
scale.''
	   Billions of Western dollars, he said, were spent on consumer
goods rather than industrial projects, ``which means the money was
thrown into the flames.''
	   Luzhkov also refuted speculation that Muscovites might go hungry
over the winter.
	   ``There will not be any shortages of food in Moscow,'' he said,
explaining that the city government had adequate stocks of
potatoes, grains and vegetables. ``Any mention of hunger in Moscow
is absurd,'' he said.
	   Besides, he joked, ``I plan to eat less.''

Another relief agency withdraws from North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from other agencies; trims &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo HK101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An international relief agency announced
Wednesday that it is withdrawing from North Korea because the
government has ordered it to stop treating starving and sick people
and to supply the local pharmaceutical industry instead.
	   ``We are being forced to pull out, and we don't understand
why,'' said Dr. Dominique Lafontaine of Doctors Without Borders, a
European charity. ``They do not acknowledge the fact that there is
huge humanitarian need'' because of famine.
	   The agency recently withdrew 11 of its 13 professionals,
including nine doctors, when talks with the communist government
broke down. It said the last two were leaving Wednesday.
	   Doctors Without Borders is one of about half a dozen relief
agencies that have set up operations within North Korea to help the
secretive country cope with its 3-year-old famine.
	   In early August, the Paris-based Doctors of the World left North
Korea when the government denied it access to a large population of
malnourished and sick children. Lafontaine said Chesci, an Italian
medical and agricultural aid organization, also pulled out because
of restrictions on its movements and who it could treat.
	   But the International Red Cross is continuing its work there,
said Enkas Chau, a Red Cross international relief service officer
based in Hong Kong. He said the organization has been able to cover
its target areas across the country because of its working
relationship with the North Korean Red Cross.
	   In Rome, Tom Shortley, North Korea desk officer at the World
Food Program, said the situation there was difficult but gradually
improving, and he hoped Doctors Without Borders would return.
	   He added, ``I think from our perspective _ and we've always
approached the children as our top priority _ you have to keep
engaged, you have to keep pressing the authorities for access.''
	   The World Food Program ships food to North Korea and monitors
the government's distribution to see whether the food is going to
target groups, mainly children.
	   U.S. officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of
North Korea this summer said 2 million North Koreans _ nearly 10
percent of the population _ may have died in the famine.
	   It was caused by two years of flooding and a drought that
devastated the country's inefficient state-run farming system.
	   Food shortages and widespread public health problems appear to
have left every sector of the nation's economy in ruins, except the
gigantic military that North Korea maintains.
	   That has left the country's 23 million people largely dependent
on foreign aid. But the government often frustrates relief agencies
by setting restrictions on how they can operate, where they can go
and which sectors of the public they can treat.
	   The government also has prevented many foreign journalists from
entering the country, which sometimes reduces the amount of money
that relief agencies can raise from the rest of the world.
	   Dr. Eric Goemaere, director-general of Doctors Without Borders,
said that it was ``forced to pull out'' its last two remaining
doctors when North Korean officials told the organization to stop
distributing medical aid.
	   The agency was forced to shut down its 1,400 health centers in
four provinces north of Pyongyang, where it was providing the
nation with basic medical equipment and medicines that it lacks,
and helping to train local doctors and health workers.
	   Doctors Without Borders also helped more than 15,000 children at
64 feeding centers in the provinces. But Goemaere and Lafontaine
said that restrictions on whom the relief agency could feed often
left them frustrated.
	   ``Without any antiseptics or antibiotics, the people will be
forced to go back to'' ineffective herbal medicines, said Goemaere.
	   Despite the prospects of a grim winter, North Korean officials
had asked the agency to focus on supplying raw materials and
chemicals for the production of basic antibiotics at the country's
own dysfunctional plants.
	   For instance, Goemaere said, such plants need large supplies of
acid derivatives and raw penicillin to produce something as simple
as basic aspirin and antibiotics.
	   The country's hospitals are so ill-equipped that Lafontaine said
that abortions and appendectomies are being performed without
antiseptics, anesthesia, or even gloves. Incisions are being made
using ordinary scissors, and intravenous infusions are being
applied with homemade tubes and bottle drips.
	   Lafontaine said many hospitals and clinics outside Pyongyang
suffer severe power outages and lack of clean water, forcing many
to drink from polluted rivers and streams. Many people are
suffering from typhoid and intestinal infections, he said.
	   ``We know some hospitals are refusing to take patients because
the problem is too great,'' said Lafontaine.
	   Earlier reports from North Korea have accused the government of
using donations to feed the military and government loyalists,
leaving other people without any aid at all.
	   Goemaere urged other relief agencies to remain in North Korea,
but to fight the restrictions they face by demanding concessions
before more aid is sent in.

EU: Finland in line with euro stability, growth pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Wednesday
Finland's economic and budgetary policies meet the stability and
growth requirements laid down for it and 10 other EU nations that
will switch to a single currency in January.
	   The Finnish government's objective of a budgetary surplus of 2.3
percent of gross domestic product in 2002 ``would create a
sufficient safety margin against the effects of cyclical
variations,'' the Commission said in a statement.
	   It said Finland's budgetary policies ``are expected to deliver a
surplus in 1998 which should rise to over 2 percent between now and
2002.''
	   However, it called for continued budgetary consolidation efforts
by the Finnish government to face rising expenditure pressures due
to the aging of the population.
	   Finland's debt to GDP ratio, which the Commission said is safely
below the maximum 60-percent ceiling laid down for euro membership,
is expected to fall to about 43 percent by 2002.
	   Finland is one of 11 European Union nations adopting the euro
next year.

German Social Democrat leader hails new British-German partnership
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With France-Germany

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ A leader of Germany's victorious
Social Democrats on Wednesday pledged new ``intensive'' cooperation
with Britain as leaders of the European Union, drawing this country
into what many saw as a French-German partnership.
	   ``We want the British government as a leading force in Europe
and in the European Union,'' Rudolph Scharping, Social Democrat
vice chairman and the minority leader in Germany's outgoing
parliament, told the annual conference of Britain's governing Labor
Party.
	   As a member of the center-left party that defeated German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in elections this week, Scharping received
an enthusiastic reception from Labor Party activists and Prime
Minister Tony Blair, who 17 months ago ousted Britain's
Conservative Party.
	   ``It is the first time in Europe's history that members of the
same political family are governing Great Britain, are governing
France, are governing Germany,'' Scharping, speaking in English,
told a news conference afterward.
	   ``It is historically unique, and we want to take that chance,''
he added.
	   Blair had invited chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, who is
involved in coalition negotiations to form the new administration,
to come to this north England town to celebrate with a fellow
left-of-center party.
	   But instead Schroeder chose to travel to Paris on Wednesday,
apparently hoping to reassure government leaders that his wish for
closer ties with Britain will not diminish France's role in Europe.
	   To loud applause in the conference chamber, Scharping hailed the
end of both 18 years of British Conservative administrations _
noted, particularly under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for
prickly relations with the rest of the EU _ and the political
demise of Kohl.
	   ``It is so good to know that the times are past when a
Conservative British prime minister said `no' to everything in
Europe and a German chancellor responded, `I don't care,' ''
Scharping said.
	   ``Now we are both in position for their sucessors, Tony Blair
and Gerhard Schroeder, to say `yes' to the British-German
partnership for close, intensive cooperation,'' he said.
	   Scharping, a possible defense minister when the new German
administration is formed, said priorities included job programs
similar to the ``New Deal'' introduced by Blair for long-term
unemployed. It combines extra state spending with threats of
welfare cuts for those who refuse jobs.
	   Of the euro, the EU's common currency that starts Jan. 1,
Scharping said its success will depend on ``political progress.''
	   Eleven of the 15 EU members, including Germany and France, will
adopt the euro, but Britain is standing aside and retaining the
pound. Blair says that if the euro works, Britain will decide on
joining early next century.
	   Scharping cautioned against any notion of joint government
programs, saying that each nation should continue its own policies
while coordinating overall.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists and protesting workers briefly blocked
several major highways on the outskirts of the Russian capital
Wednesday, but did not cause any major disruptions.
	   About 1,000 protesters, carrying red Communist flags and banners
denouncing President Boris Yeltsin, gathered on several major
highways near Moscow. Some protesters blocked traffic, but the
demonstrations lasted for only a few minutes in some places and not
longer than an hour at any location.
	   Police did not intervene to disperse the peaceful protests.
	   The Communist Party helped organize the demonstrations as a
rehearsal for a nationwide labor protest on Oct. 7. Labor unions
have said that millions of people could take part to express their
dissatisfaction with Yeltsin's government and its handling of the
current economic crisis.
	   More than 37,000 enterprises will stop work in protest and
rallies will be held in 10,000 cities and towns throughout Russia,
said Mikhail Shmakov, the chairman of the Federation of Independent
Unions of Russia, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   However, in previous years the protests have been one-day
affairs that have not inflicted serious damage on the economy.
	   There has been some discord between the organizers of next
week's protest.
	   The unions have been pushing for Yeltsin's resignation and the
disbanding of parliament. The Communists, who dominate parliament's
lower house, say the legislature should continue its work until
elections planned for December 1999.

Kenyan Muslims to protest banning of Islamic aid agencies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHEGE MBITIRU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Muslim leaders planned nationwide
demonstrations Friday to protest a government ban on five aid
agencies with ties to Islamic groups after terrorists attacked two
U.S. embassies in East Africa.
	   ``By banning the organizations, the government created the
impression Muslims were behind the bombings,'' said Said Athman, a
protest organizer.
	   Athman said at a news conference he feared a rift between
Muslims and non-Muslims, ``and that is very dangerous for this
country.''
	   U.S. officials allege Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden, a Saudi
Arabian living in exile in Afghanistan, masterminded and financed
the bombings that killed 259 people in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug.
7.
	   Athman said the five banned organizations were feeding at least
55,000 people in the arid northeastern Kenya, which is inhabited
mostly by Muslims.
	   In urban areas, where the agencies operated clinics, Athman said
all Kenyans, especially the poor, were served regardless of their
religious affiliations.
	   ``We are, therefore, calling upon all Kenyans to come and
protest this injustice,'' Athman said.
	   Mwandawiro Mghanga, secretary-general, said the opposition
Safina party supported the protest, and condemned the government
ban as ``an attempt to divide Kenyans along religious lines.''
	   In Nairobi, a street demonstration will follow Muslim prayers
and a rally addressed by a variety of leaders at the downtown Uhuru
(Freedom) Park, Athman said.
	   Similar processions were planned in other towns, he said.
	   On Monday, two bombing suspects sent to United States from
Kenya, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali,
were charged in indictments in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
with conspiring to bomb the embassies.
	   After the bombings, Kenyan authorities banned the five aid
agencies, saying they were a security threat. They also ordered an
unspecified number of foreigners, most of them from Arab countries,
including Saudi Arabia, to leave the country.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Experts were being sent to a French hospital to
determine the cause of a massive power cut last week that is being
blamed for the death of at least five patients, France's health
minister said Wednesday.
	   Judicial officials investigating the power cut overnight Friday
at Lyon's Edouard Herriot Hospital will probe the cause of death of
a total of 10 people -- the number of patients who died over the
course of the weekend, French media reported.
	   ``We've tried to get a clear picture. That's not yet the case.
We've sent an expert and we'll send others,'' Health Minister
Bernard Kouchner said in an interview with Europe-1 radio.
	   ``As soon as we have precise details of what happened in Lyon,
we'll make them known,'' he added.
	   All power was completely cut for two hours at the hospital,
forcing doctors to transfer 26 patients from the intensive care
unit to another hospital. Back-up generators also failed.

	   Makuhari, Japan (AP) _ A Japanese company has developed a
refrigerator smart enough to keep track of what's inside, store
recipes and make your grocery list.
	   The company unveiled its ``Internet Refrigerator'' at the
opening of the PC World Expo in Makuhari, east of Tokyo, on
Wednesday.
	   With a speedy Pentium II microprocessor and huge hard drive, it
packs more computing power than most home PCs, and has separate
compartments for fruits and vegetables.
	   The refrigerator is controlled with a touch panel monitor in the
door or verbally through a built-in microphone.
	   The company that developed the refrigerator, V-Sync, recommends
using it as the command center of a wired home by hooking it up to
similarly equipped household appliances such as a telephone, air
conditioner or television.
	   More than 600 computer-related companies are displaying products
at the annual computer expo, which runs through Saturday.

Yugoslav president meets newly-elected Bosnian Serbs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic met Wednesday a Bosnian Serb ultranationalist and a
moderate leader, both of whom were recently elected into office, an
official announcement said.
	   Milosevic met both ultranationalist Nikola Poplasen, who won the
race for the Bosnian Serb presidency in Sept. 12-13 nationwide
elections, and Socialist Zivko Radisic, the Western-backed moderate
elected to the Serb seat in Bosnia's three-member presidency.
	   They shared views on strengthening cooperation between the
Bosnian Serb sub-state and Yugoslavia, stressed common interests of
their people and discussed possibilities for improving commercial
ties, the state-run Tanjug news agency reported.
	   The statement further said that the Dayton peace agreement was a
sound foundation for peace in the interest of all living in Bosnia.
	   Milosevic congratulated both Bosnian Serbs on their election.
	   Poplasen's victory was considered a blow to the West's attempts
of stitching Bosnia's disparate ethnic groups closer together. His
Radical Party is allied with the Bosnian Serb faction backing war
crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic.
	   Poplasen pledged last Saturday to work more closely with Serbia,
comply with the Dayton peace agreement to the letter and adhere to
democratic rules in office.
	   Western worries that Poplasen would work against the Dayton
agreement, which ended the 3 1/2 year Bosnian war, were based on
his record of a paramilitary commander in the war and pressing for
a union of the Serb half of Bosnia with Serbia, the dominant
republic of Yugoslavia. Such a union is ruled out by the peace
agreement.
	   Moderate Radisic also promised to work closely with his Muslim
and Croat counterparts.

Six thousand workers protest poverty and possible job cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BUC101

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thousands of angry workers demanded
the government resign on Wednesday as they marched through the
capital to protest falling living standards and feared job cuts.
	   ``Down with the government!'' they chanted as they made their
way to government headquarters.
	   Trade union leaders said the unions cannot accept the
``disastrous'' state of the Romanian economy and the government's
apparent lack of economic strategy.
	   ``This is the last signal we give to the government,'' said
Dumitru Chirita, leader of the drivers' union, on national radio.
	   He said if the government did not take heed of the protests,
workers from the drivers' and energy unions would go on strike
within the next two weeks, national radio reported.
	   The demonstrators _ many from other Romanian cities _ were
specifically protesting a government plan to sell the state energy
sector to private owners. They fear mass unemployment would result.
	   ``I can hardly raise my children with the money I get, ... but I
do not want to lose my job,'' said Nichitean Brandusel, 51, who
works for the state-run electric plant in the northern city of
Suceava.
	   In Romania, the average salary equals just 1. 2 million lei
(dlrs 122), often not enough to cover basic expenses.
	   Purchasing power has dropped steeply over the last months and
the economy is shrinking. Foreign investment is low compared to
most other former Soviet bloc countries, due in part to persistent
political bickering within the government coalition, which is
slowing down efforts to modernize and transform the economy.

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A U.S. Justice Department official
assisting Lithuanian authorities with the trial of alleged Nazi war
criminal Aleksandras Lileikis was robbed of several hundred dollars
in Vilnius this week, authorities said.
	   The Vilnius police department said the robbery of Michael Craig
McQueen by several youngsters on Monday did not appear to be
connected to the controversial trial.
	   Lileikis, 91, is charged with genocide for allegedly turning
over scores of Jews to a Nazi execution squad during the 1941-44
German occupation of Lithuania.
	   The trial was to have started in early September, but was
postponed while a medical panel investigates the claim of Lileikis'
attorneys that he is too sick to testify.
	   Some Jewish groups have complained about the frequent delays in
bringing Lileikis to trial.
	   Lileikis, who emigrated to the United States and lived in
Norwood, Massachusetts, returned to Lithuania in 1996 as the United
States was moving to revoke his citizenship for concealing his past
when emigrating.
	   Lileikis was head of the security police in Vilnius during the
Nazi occupation.

U.N. team: no major disease outbreaks in China confirmed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Many people left homeless by China's worst floods
for decades are at risk of illness, but there is no confirmation of
major outbreaks of disease at present, a U.N. official said
Wednesday.
	   The leader of a U.N. disaster assessment team which returned
from China last week, Fabrizio Gentiloni, told reporters its visit
had confirmed the scale of the ``immense disaster.''
	   Team members who traveled to flood-hit areas in the south and
northeast stressed the importance of providing shelter to those
whose houses were destroyed, with the onset of winter in northern
China five to six weeks away.
	   Some 5 million people have become homeless in the Yangtze river
basin region, with about 2.9 million still camped atop dikes still
surrounded by water, said Eva Johansson, who traveled to the area.
	   ``The sanitary and health situations on these overcrowded dikes
are extreme,'' with a high risk of diarrhea, communicable diseases
and malnutrition, she said.
	   But ``I would like to stress that the ... mission cannot confirm
that there are major outbreaks at this stage,'' Johansson added.
	   Last week, the United Nations launched an appeal for a total
dlrs 139 million in disaster relief for flood victims threatened by
disease and impending cold weather.
	   The aid would be used to provide food, shelter, sanitation,
health care and other urgent needs of some 5.8 million people left
homeless.
	   Some dlrs 15 million has been contributed so far, according to
Ross Mountain, director of the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination
of Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva.
	   The appeal includes funds to buy construction materials, plastic
sheeting and insulation to enable families to put walls and roofs
on dugout mud shelters they are building in their destroyed homes.
	   The floods killed more than 3,000 people and affected about 233
million.

German high-speed line disrupted by saboteurs, railway says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German railway said Wednesday that
saboteurs caused a delay in opening a new high-speed train line
from Berlin to Hanover.
	   Rail workers found two metal claws hanging from electric power
cables near the town of Wustermark, west of Berlin in Brandenburg
state, a spokesman said.
	   The claws, typically used by anti-nuclear protesters trying to
disrupt transport of nuclear waste, caused a power failure on the
line, and forced three InterCity trains to halt on the line's
opening day Sunday.
	   No suspects have been identified.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The global fight against doping will falter unless
the IOC creates a permanent, multi-million-dollar research fund to
help drug testers keep up with drug cheats, according to a top
international anti-doping official.
	   Arne Ljungqvist, chairman of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation's medical committee, lobbied for the proposal in a
private meeting last week with IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch.
	   Samaranch called Ljungqvist to IOC headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland, to discuss the Olympic movement's anti-doping policies
and plans for an anti-drug summit in Lausanne in February.
	   Ljungqvist said he stressed the need for a permanent IOC fund to
develop tests for EPO, human growth hormone and other banned drugs.
	   ``You can not base a continuous fight against doping without
permanent funding,'' he said in a telephone interview from Sweden.
``If the IOC claims to be the umbrella body for world sport, it has
to take that responsibility as well.''
	   Ljungqvist, who is also a member of the IOC medical commission,
said one positive example has been the joint IOC-European Union
project on human growth hormone.
	   Each organization has contributed more than a dlrs 1 million to
a London lab seeking to develop a reliable test for human growth
hormone, one of the performance-enhancing drugs of choice in sport.
	   The London researchers have reported significant progress and
said they hope a test will be ready in time for the 2000 Sydney
Olympics.
	   But Ljungqvist said there has been much slower progress in
finding a test for EPO, the endurance-boosting hormone which was at
the center of this summer's Tour de France scandals.
	   ``There has been no common funding for EPO,'' he said. ``If we
had a coordinated EPO research project started five or six years
ago, I am sure we would have an analytical testing method available
today.''
	   In a continuous cat-and-mouse game, athletes have been able to
keep a step ahead of drug-testers by using synthetic versions of
naturally occurring substances.
	   ``We can analyze for everything, including growth hormone,''
Ljungqvist said. ``The problem is to validate whether it is
produced by the body or taken externally. That's why we need
research and development. We need manpower, knowledge and the right
people to do the right research.''
	   Ljungqvist said the IOC has always resisted pouring money into
research on grounds that this was the responsibility of individual
sports federations.
	   ``Fair enough,'' he said. ``But since the federations haven't
done it, the IOC has to step in.''
	   Ljungqvist said he supports the IOC's plan to set up an Olympic
anti-doping agency that will coordinate random drug-testing around
the world. The project is expected to gain final approval at the
Feb. 2-4 World Anti-Doping Conference in Lausanne.
	   Ljungqvist said all Olympic sports federations should commit
themselves to year-round out-of-competition testing. He said the
IAAF spends dlrs 1 million a year on 1,500 to 1,700 tests, while
other federations do little or nothing.
	   ``It can't go on that only one or two federations conduct these
tests,'' he said.
	   All summer and winter Olympic sports federations are scheduled
to meet with the IOC on Oct. 27 to discuss anti-doping issues and
preparations for the February conference.
	   Ljungqvist said federations should face expulsion from the
Olympics if they fail to comply with IOC anti-doping policies.
	   ``The situation will be very different for the federations if
the IOC says: `Look, we expect you to do this and we will pay for
it.' It would be very difficult for the federations to say no.''
	   One stumbling block has been the IOC's effort to get all
federations to endorse a single medical code embracing common
anti-doping rules, procedures and sanctions.
	   Ljungqvist said the IAAF and other federations are opposed to
the current medical code because it contains provisions for
``gender verification'' testing of female athletes.
	   ``The IAAF has done away with gender verification and we will
never accept a code with this,'' he said. ``Only five of the 34
Olympic federations conduct gender verification. One should not
jeopardize a common fight against doping with this. The new code
should contain only elements on doping.''

New Thai army commander emphasizes military restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ On his first day as Thailand's army
commander, Gen. Surayuth Chulanon announced Wednesday that he would
concentrate on restructuring the military for greater efficiency.
	   ``I will put an emphasis on the five-year restructuring plan
which will make the army smaller but more efficient to serve the
country and the people,'' he said in remarks to high-ranking
officers and journalists after his swearing-in.
	   In an interview with the ITV television station, he said he was
also considering plans to create additional jobs for army officers
to help them survive the hard times of Thailand's economic crisis.
	   He did not name any specific kind of work they could do, saying
only that the jobs must be legal and proper.

Iraqi opposition reports attacks by Saddam's forces in south
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraqi government forces have attacked at
least four villages in southern Iraq over the past week, killing
and displacing many people, an Iraqi opposition group said.
	   It did not say what prompted the attack but President Saddam
Hussein's troops often raid villages in Shiite-dominated southern
Iraq in search of Shiite Muslim rebels.
	   Iraqi forces began attacking the villages of Zerwat Al Juweiber,
Berket Sayed Youshe'a, Hour Al Saleh and Al-Dawarah in the
al-Nasiryah province on Sept. 22, the Supreme Council for the
Islamic Revolution in Iraq said.
	   The Shiite group is based in Tehran and there was no way to
verify its claims. The Iraqi government usually does not comment on
such reports.
	   The Supreme Council's leader, Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, sent a
letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday to inform him
about the attacks. A copy of the letter was faxed to The Associated
Press in Cairo, Egypt on Wednesday.
	   Al-Hakim said the Iraqi army shelled the villages before sending
in raiding parties of the elite Republican Guards and the
paramilitary Saddam's Commandos.
	   Many people were killed or displaced, al-Hakim said. He did not
give specific figures.
	   His letter urged Annan to take the ``immediate and urgent
measures that would deter Saddam's regime from committing these
crimes and protecting the innocent people from the dangerous
results'' of the attacks.
	   Al-Hakim said the commanders of the attack are former defense
minister and Saddam's cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, and former army
chief of staff, Iyad Futieh al-Rawi, who is currently mayor of
Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
	   In a separate statement, the group said resistance fighters and
civilians repulsed the attacks in some instances and killed more
than 20 soldiers besides destroying seven armed vehicles. It said
troops used bulldozers to destroy the village of Al-Dawarah.
	   The attacked areas are in a no-fly zone imposed over southern
Iraq since 1992 to stop Iraqi air attacks on Shiite Muslim rebels.
Warplanes from the United States and its allies patrol the zone.
	   Shiites are in a slight majority in Iraq but the government and
the military is controlled by the Sunnis.

Philippine president criticized for strike ban proposal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada came under
strong criticism Wednesday for supporting a moratorium on strikes,
with some critics saying he was advocating the same strongman
measures used by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   Estrada expressed support Tuesday for a proposed law banning
strikes during an economic crisis because ``the whole nation is
affected.''
	   ``Maybe we need a moratorium on strikes. We should all unite and
help each other,'' he said.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican tried to downplay Estrada's
statement, saying the president was merely referring to
``exceptions in extraordinary times.''
	   ``The president is emphasizing that the unions themselves could
probably have an interest in preserving those jobs and that the
strike mechanism is the last resort,'' Barican said.
	   But Manuel Sarmiento, secretary-general of the left-wing May One
Movement labor federation, said Estrada appeared to believe that
workers strike frivolously.
	   ``Does he think we wage strikes to sabotage our own livelihood?
How naive is he?'' Sarmiento said.
	   The legislation was proposed by Rep. Erico Aumentado following
last week's decision by Philippine Airlines to close down after
failing to receive union support for a recovery plan.
	   Aumentado's bill seeks to prohibit strikes, pickets and lockouts
in ``vital industries'' such as transportation, communications,
water, power, food, health and housing ``during the period of
national economic crisis or emergency situation as may be declared
by the president.''
	   Aumentado said such a situation emerged following PAL's closure.
	   The airline, however, may still resume operation. Leaders of its
largest union agreed Monday to a 10-year suspension of their
collective bargaining agreement in exchange for 20 percent
ownership of the company in a deal brokered by Estrada.
	   Militant members of the union denounced the agreement as a
sellout.
	   Rep. Ernesto Herrera, a former labor leader and a member of
Estrada's Struggle of the Filipino Masses party, reminded Estrada
that labor repression under Marcos led to greater economic and
political instability.
	   ``Banning the rights of workers to strike ... is completely a
violation of the constitution and international labor standards,''
Herrera said.
	   Marcos declared martial law in 1972 and ruled as a strongman,
padlocking Congress, banning strikes and demonstrations and
curtailing press freedom. He was ousted in a popular revolt in
1986.
	   Sen. Loren Legarda said a strike moratorium is not needed since
workers themselves tend to exercise greater restraint during
difficult times and go on strike only to protect their jobs.

Oil slick from sunken ferry reaches coastal villages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Oil leaking from a Philippine ferry
that sank outside Manila Bay has reached many coastal villages,
threatening beach resorts and marine life, an official said
Wednesday.
	   Coast guard personnel were using chemicals to battle the oil
slick from the Princess of the Orient, which sank Sept. 18 in
stormy weather off Batangas province, south of Manila, the official
said.
	   At least 70 people died and 80 others are still missing from the
sinking of the ferry, which carried 505 people, according to
revised figures from the coast guard.
	   Coast guard spokesman Lt. Joel Garcia said the oil slick has
reached several coastal areas in Cavite province and metropolitan
Manila. In some areas, the slick is two inches (5 centimeters)
thick, he said.
	   The slick has already disrupted fishing and could destroy oyster
and fish farms. It could also affect a number of beach resorts and
damage marine resources, he said.
	   The ferry, which was en route to central Cebu province, was
carrying at least 600,000 liters (160,000 gallons) of fuel oil and
11,000 liters (3,000 gallons) of lubricant oil, Garcia said.
	   He said the ferry's owner, Sulpicio Lines, has been asked to
provide money for the cleanup.
	   Sulpicio Lines has a total of 32 ships. It also owned the Dona
Paz, a ferry that collided with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in
the world's worst peacetime shipping disaster. A year later, 250
people died in the sinking of another ship owned by the company,
the Dona Marilyn.
	   The captain of the Princess of the Orient has not been found,
and some officials believe he is in hiding.
	   Ships and ferries are the main mode of transportation is this
country of 7,107 islands. Many of the vessels are old.

Muslims stage anti-communist rally on Indonesian coup anniversary

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Warning that communist-like forces
could be behind a rash of riots and protests, thousands of Muslims
staged rallies Wednesday on the 33rd anniversary of what the
government says was an abortive leftist coup.
	   Troops and police were deployed across the capital amid rumors
that anti-government protesters might take to the streets as the
country grapples with the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   However, the city of 11 million was quiet as red and white
Indonesian flags were flown at half-staff.
	   ``We want to show the public that we have to be careful about
the latent danger of communism. Today's situation is similar to the
situation in the 1960s,'' a rally organizer, Abdul Kadir, said
outside the Istiqlal Mosque, the biggest in Indonesia.
	   A similar rally in Medan, Indonesia's third biggest city and the
capital of North Sumatra, brought out students, workers, farmers,
fishermen and businessmen, the official Antara news agency
reported.
	   ``We the `66 generation who experienced the cruelty of the PKI
(communists) want to remind the society ... because communist-like
movements have begun to reappear,'' said Amran Y.S., a former
student activist quoted by Antara.
	   Sept. 30, 1965, was a bloody turning point in the history of the
sprawling Southeast Asian nation, which then too was in economic
turmoil.
	   Six army generals were executed and their bodies tossed down a
well on the outskirts of Jakarta. The military at the time blamed
communists for the murders and swiftly crushed what it said was a
coup attempt.
	   The operation was led by Suharto, a major general, who later
replaced Indonesia's founding President Sukarno as head of state.
	   Tens of thousands are said to have been slaughtered in a
backlash against leftists during the following months.
	   The burgeoning Indonesian Communist Party was decimated and
remains banned to this day.
	   Suharto led Indonesia for 32 authoritarian years, but was forced
to quit in May after about 1,200 people were killed in a wave of
riots and protests against him.
	   On Thursday, Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, is to
lead an annual commemoration of the end of the coup attempt.
	   Since taking office, Habibie has been targeted by student
protesters who have demanded that he step down over his failure to
control soaring prices, growing unemployment and rising poverty.
	   There have also been outbreaks of looting and rioting in some
areas hit badly by the crisis.
	   Abdul Kadir said it was possible that some student protesters
had been manipulated by activists with communist leanings. Students
have rejected this.

Russian banks freeze Lehman Bothers accounts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow's Court of Arbitration has frozen accounts
belonging to U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers International at
Oneximbank and a number of other large Russian banks, Oneximbank
said Wednesday.
	   Oneximbank filed a suit against Lehman Brothers on Monday,
accusing the American bank of failing to fulfill its obligations to
Oneximbank. It provided no further details.
	   A Lehman Brothers spokesman in London said the bank has not
received any notification from the Moscow court or from Oneximbank
about the seized accounts.
	   Oneximbank said Wednesday's action by the Moscow court prohibits
Lehman Brothers from conducting any operations with securities on
the accounts.
	   Last week, a London court froze assets held by Oneximbank and
Inkombank in Britain at the request of Lehman Brothers' British
affiliate. Lehman Brothers said it took the action because of the
Russian banks' failure to fulfill ruble forward contracts of dlrs
87 million and dlrs 25.9 million.
	   In a related development, the Interfax news agency said a London
court had frozen dlrs 15 million in British accounts belonging to
SBS-Agro, Russia's second biggest retail bank, at the request of
Lehman Brothers.
	   In the wake of the Russian government's decision Aug. 17 to
impose a 90-day moratorium on payments of foreign commercial debt,
a number of foreign creditors have threatened to seize Russian
assets overseas.

Think tank warns of possible return to cronyism in Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Upcoming decisions by the Philippine
government toward former ``cronies'' of the late dictator Ferdinand
Marcos will indicate whether the country's economy is moving again
away from free-market principles, an economic think tank said
Wednesday.
	   In its latest risk report on the Philippines, the Hong
Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd. said close
watch should be kept for signs of President Joseph Estrada helping
former Marcos business associates who are close to him. But it
concluded that the cartels and monopolies that flourished under
Marcos are not likely to return soon.
	   Millions of dollars of assets alleged to have been acquired
illegally by Marcos' associates were sequestered, or seized, by the
government after his ouster in 1986 and have been the subject of
court battles ever since.
	   The think tank said the question of what to do with the assets
has emerged once again.
	   ``Should (Estrada) facilitate the return of sequestered assets
rather then sell them off to the highest bidder, it would be a good
indication that the president is moving away from the free-market
policies of his predecessor in favor of the crony capitalism of the
past,'' it said.
	   The recent re-election of former Marcos ally Eduardo Cojuancgo
to the chairmanship of San Miguel Corp., 12 years after he was
ousted from the food and beverage group, raised eyebrows in some
quarters.
	   Cojuangco, an Estrada supporter, regained control of San Miguel
only a few weeks after Estrada won the presidency, on a court
ruling that enabled him to vote a 20 percent stake in San Miguel.
	   ``While it is true that the judiciary is likely to play an
important role in deciding the fate of sequestered shares, the
political dimension cannot be easily ignored,'' the think tank
said.
	   It said it is still too early in Estrada's presidency to tell
whether the Philippines is moving toward a new era of cronyism.
	   It noted with approval that there have been no indications that
Estrada's administration intends to bail out ailing companies run
by former Marcos allies.
	   In the case of grounded Philippine Airlines Inc., the government
has made clear there will be no bailout for majority shareholder
Lucio Tan, who had strong ties to Marcos and supported Estrada's
election campaign.

Diplomat: U.S. rethinks relationship with troubled Liberia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The United States is reassessing its
relationship with Liberia and is keeping its embassy closed until
an investigation into a gun battle there is completed, a U.S.
diplomat said Wednesday.
	   Liberian forces earlier this month opened fire on former warlord
Roosevelt Johnson as he was tried to take refuge in the American
embassy. The gun battle killed at least three of Johnson's aides
and wounded two Americans at the embassy.
	   In the wake of that fighting, Deputy Chief of Mission John
Bauman said the United States is rethinking its ties to this
turbulent West African country.
	   ``By West African standards, our embassy in Monrovia is one of
the largest in the region, but the tone of relationship between
Liberia and the U.S. following the shooting incident is quite
unsatisfactory,'' Bauman said.
	   Taylor's government, however, says the shooting took place
outside of the embassy on Liberian soil.
	   Bauman said most of the embassy diplomatic staff had been
evacuated and some had been reassigned. It was unclear for how
long.
	   All but essential diplomatic staff were evacuated from Monrovia
following two days of pitched battles between President Charles
Taylor's forces and Johnson's supporters.
	   Johnson managed to take refuge in the embassy after Taylor tried
to have him arrested on treason charges. The former warlord and
longtime Taylor rival was evacuated by helicopter over the weekend.
	   Liberia, a nation founded by freed American slaves, was for
years one of the largest U.S. aid recipients.

Thailand, U.S. agree to jointly set up law enforcement academy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The United States and Thailand signed
an agreement Wednesday to establish an Asian law enforcement
academy designed to combat transnational crime.
	   The agreement to establish the International Law Enforcement
Academy is part of a shared vision on how to respond to crimes such
as human trafficking, money laundering, intellectual property theft
and counterfeiting, said Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan.
	   The agreement was signed by Surin and American Ambassador to
Bangkok William H. Itoh.
	   The academy would be used for both career development for law
enforcement personnel and specialized training in areas such as
economic crime and counterfeiting, said Surin.
	   ``We have a very clear set goal with regard to counter-narcotics
but in areas such as human trafficking, cyber-crime and money
laundering, Thailand could need some help from the United States,''
he added.
	   Southeast Asian countries and China will participate in the
training at first, with the possibility of South Asian nations
taking part later, said a statement from the U.S. Embassy.
	   The academy will be headed by an executive director appointed by
Thailand and a program director from the United States, it said.
	   The United States has provided dlrs 2.5 million for the initial
fund for the project, it said.
	   One such academy is already operating in Hungary.

Chelsea, Newcastle hold slender leads; PSG, Lazio shaky
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Of the four clubs favored to win the Cup Winners
Cup, holder Chelsea and rejuvenated Newcastle go into Thursday's
first-round, second-leg matches with slender leads.
	   Paris Saint Germain and Lazio don't even have that and all four
could easily go out with this season's competition barely a month
old.
	   There are 16 games in the weakest of Europe's three major club
championships, but most eyes will be on just four.
	   _ Partizan Belgrade vs. Newcastle.
	   _ Lausanne, vs. Lazio.
	   _ Helsingborgs vs. Chelsea.
	   _ Maccabi Haifa vs. PSG.
	   Newcastle, which takes a 2-1 lead to Belgrade, got the winner
two weeks ago from former Olympiakos star Nikos Dabizas. He's
hoping to finish the job.
	   ``We are better than Partizan and must beat them,'' the Greek
international said. ``They are not at the same level as we are.''
	   ``There are four or five big clubs in this competition and we
are one of them. It is important we beat a smaller club like
Partizan and go on,'' he added.
	   Partizan, winners of every home match this season, is not bowed
by the cocky confidence.
	   ``They (Newcastle) think they are the smartest in the world,''
said coach Ljubisa Tumbakovic. ``They always play the same whether
at home or abroad. They have many reasons to be like that because
they have great individuals, but Partizan has its qualities, too.''
	   ``I will expect my players to be patient,'' he added. ``We have
nothing to lose because it's no shame to be beaten by such a
distinguished team.''
	   The big club with the biggest problem might be Lazio. Finalist
in last season's UEFA Cup, the Italians slink into to Lausanne
following a 1-1 home draw.
	   The best news is that Chilean striker Marcelo Salas should be
ready after skipping practice this week with a bruised leg.
Croatian Alen Boksic is still recovering from a knee injury and
Spain's Ivan de la Pena has a thigh injury and hasn't practiced for
two weeks.
	   Lausanne knows it can pull an upset.
	   ``While we should be confident, because we've proven our
strength, let's keep our feet on the ground and leave them the role
of favorites,'' said striker Fabio Celestini.
	   In Sweden, defending champion Chelsea arrives with a fragile 1-0
lead. Home striker Magnus Powell, fighting off a virus, should play
Thursday with Helsingborgs expecting to pressure Gianluca Vialli's
team.
	   ``We have to move up the game and press Chelsea higher up on the
field,'' said midfielder Peter Wibraan.
	   In Israel, Paris Saint-Germain comes off a 1-1 first leg at home
and is desperate to advance after a disastrous start to the season.
PSG _ Cup Winners Cup champions two years ago _ lost to lowly
Sochaux on Friday, its third defeat of the season. Sochaux played
with only 10 men for most of the game.
	   Afterward, PSG captain Marco Simone criticized club president
Charles Bietry for interference in team matters.
	   ``A defeat (in Israel) would be catastrophic,'' said midfielder
Bruno Carotti. Left back Didier Domi is out with a pulled thigh
muscle and Christian Woerns is doubtful with a sprained ankle.
	   In other games including the scores from the first leg:
	   Jablonec, Czech Republic vs. Apollon Limassol, Cyprus (1-2);
Spartak Trnava, Slovakia vs. Besiktas, Turkey (0-3); Lokomotiv
Moscow, Russia vs. CSCA Kiev, Ukraine (2-0); Genk, Belgium vs.
Duisberg, Germany (1-1).
	   Mallorca, Spain vs. Hearts, Scotland (1-0); Amica Wronko,
Poland, vs. Heerenveen, Netherlands (1-3); FC Copenhagen, Denmark
vs. Levski Sofia, Bulgaria (2-0); Braga, Portugal vs. Metalurgs
Liepaja, Latvia (0-0).
	   Haka, Finland vs. Panionios, Greece (0-2); Valerenga, Norway vs.
Rapid Bucharest, Romania (2-2); MTK Budapest, Hungary vs. Ried,
Austria (0-2); Varteks, Croatia vs. Rudar Velenje, Slovenia (1-0).
	   In Thursday's other game, Scotland's Rangers are home to
Israel's Beitar Jerusalem after a 1-1 draw in the UEFA Cup
first-round, first-leg match.

Primakov, Lukashenko call for stronger union between three Slavic
</HEADLINE>
countries &QL; 
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The president of Belarus renewed his call
Wednesday for a stronger union with Ukraine and Russia, despite
continuing resistance from leaders in Ukraine.
	   ``To those who say there is no union and that the union won't
be, don't foster those illusions,'' Lukashenko said. ``The union
exists and will be. And as for Ukraine and other governments being
included or not included ... they will be!''
	   Lukashenko made the comments during meetings with Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was in Belarus for his first visit
abroad in his new post.
	   Primakov agreed with Lukashenko, although he was more
diplomatic. ``The number of supporters willing to join the union
will grow as its economic efficiency becomes evident,'' Primakov
said.
	   The remarks come only a day after rightist members of Ukraine's
parliament snubbed an appeal for closer integration by the speaker
of the Russian parliament's lower house, Gennady Seleznyov.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said he ``objects absolutely''
the union among Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, the three Slavic
members of the former Soviet Union.
	   Ukraine, at odds with its two neighbors because it is seeking
closer ties with NATO, is looking to the West as it tries to shed
dependence on Russia and recreate itself as the center of Europe.
	   Lukashenko and Primakov also discussed Russia's latest financial
crisis, which has hit Belarus hard, in part because of its close
economic ties to its bigger neighbor.
	   Primakov said Russia would not abandon market reforms, but
leaders planned to ``strengthen government regulation ... so that
the people can take advantage of reforms to a greater degree.''
	   Russia's new Cabinet has already prepared an economic plan that
would nationalize most commercial banks and reintroduce Soviet-era
currency controls, a Russian newspaper said Wednesday.

Six thousand workers protest poverty and possible job cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thousands of angry workers demanded
the government resign on Wednesday as they marched through the
capital to protest falling living standards and feared job cuts.
	   ``Down with the government!'' they chanted as they made their
way to government headquarters.
	   Trade union leaders said members cannot accept the
``disastrous'' state of the Romanian economy and the government's
apparent lack of economic strategy.
	   ``This is the last signal we give to the government,'' said
Dumitru Chirita, leader of the drivers' union, on national radio.
	   He said if the government did not take heed of the protests,
workers from the drivers' and energy unions would go on strike
within the next two weeks, national radio reported.
	   The demonstrators _ many from other Romanian cities _ were
specifically protesting a government plan to sell the state energy
sector to private owners. They fear mass unemployment would result.
	   ``I can hardly raise my children with the money I get, ... but I
do not want to lose my job,'' said Nichitean Brandusel, 51, who
works for the state-run electric plant in the northern city of
Suceava.
	   In Romania, the average salary equals just 1. 2 million lei
(dlrs 122), often not enough to cover basic expenses.
	   Purchasing power has dropped steeply over the last months and
the economy is shrinking. Foreign investment is low compared to
most other former Soviet bloc countries, due in part to persistent
political bickering within the government coalition, which is
slowing down efforts to modernize and transform the economy.

Italian appliance maker goes ultra high-tech; ovens with Internet
</HEADLINE>
access &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Need an oven with Internet access? The
Italian appliance maker Merloni is betting that you do _ or will in
the near future.
	   Merloni Elettrodomestici announced a new product line Wednesday
that includes appliances that can do everything from preventing
blackouts to surfing the 'Net.
	   Under the brand name Ariston Digital, Merloni has developed
washing machines, refrigerators, dishwashers and cooking appliances
that can communicate with each other _ and the outside world.
	   These appliances can monitor and adjust power consumption to
avoid power failures as well as detect malfunctions and alert the
Ariston service center.
	   The ``intelligent oven'' even has remote-control cooking
programs and will soon have built-in Internet access for recipes.
	   In a news conference Wednesday, Merloni Chief Executive Officer
Francesco Caio said 97 percent of home Internet use is now via
computer. But estimates are it could reach 50 percent in five
years.
	   ``We want to be part of that 50 percent,'' he said.
	   Merloni, Europe's fourth-largest home appliance producer, plans
to unveil the new product line at the Smau information and
telecommunications show in Milan in October and start selling in
the second half of 1999.
	   Merloni spent five years and about dlrs 18 million to develop
the new line with the help of researchers in the United States,
France and Italy.
	   Caio admits that the high-tech products will account for a
limited portion of overall revenues at first, but would ``be
surprised if they account for less than 10 percent'' in the next
four to five years.
	   Merloni says it plans to price the futuristic housewares no more
than 10 percent above its traditional washers, fridges and stoves.

Thai finance minister sees no quick boost from U.S. rate cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The cut in U.S. interest rates won't
help increase foreign capital inflow to Thailand in the short term,
but is likely to help the country's foreign trade in the future,
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said Wednesday.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve Board decided Tuesday to cut interest
rates by a quarter percentage point to 5.25 percent out of concern
for how ``increasing weakness in foreign economies'' would hit the
U.S. economy.
	   ``I don't think we will see money flowing into Thailand
immediately,'' Tarrin said. ``There must be other factors involved.
Interest rates alone won't help.''
	   In the longer term, however, the rate cut should help arrest any
economic slowdown in the United States, making it more likely to
continue to be a big investor in Thailand and importer of its
goods, he said.
	   Other foreseeable benefits include lower local lending rates and
a possibility that U.S. companies would move investments to
Thailand, Tarrin said.
	   Deputy Bank of Thailand Governor Kitti Patpong-pibul said
Wednesday that the U.S. rate cut would help to keep the Thai baht
stable, and that the baht's continued stability would allow
domestic fixed-deposit account interest rates to remain at current
low levels of around 7 percent.
	   ``When the baht is stable, interest rates can remain at low
levels,'' he said at a news conference.
	   Deposit rates were in double digits only a few weeks ago.
Domestic rates have been falling since the central bank drastically
eased monetary policy in mid-June.
	   Prime lending rates at commercial banks have fallen to
14.50-15.00 percent, and are expected to fall another two
percentage points in the coming months.
	   However, high non-performing loan levels _ unofficially
estimated at around 40 percent of total loans _ make it difficult
for banks to bring down the spread between deposit and lending
rates. The bad loans were an outgrowth of an economic downturn that
devastated the financial sector last year.
	   Kitti said, however, that the market was ``disappointed'' by the
modest drop in the key U.S. rate, and that further cuts were
expected.
	   In line with other regional currencies, the baht ended lower in
Asian spot trading Wednesday.
	   Dealers said falling domestic interest rates led to dollar
buying as baht-denominated funds offer lower yields.
	   At the close of Asian spot trading Wednesday, the dollar was at
39.45 baht, up from 39.025 baht at Tuesday's close.
	   At Wednesday's close, the baht has dropped 34.4 percent in value
since the Thai government abandoned its fixed foreign exchange
system on July 2 last year.

Israeli-Palestinian deal brings both cautious welcome and

opposition
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS grafs 9-10 with Syrian call for renewed talks; EDITS
11th graf for transition and tightens. &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Arab reaction to the White House-brokered
deal on a further Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank ranged
from outright opposition to a cautious welcome accompanied by calls
for further steps from Israel.
	   Lebanon's leading daily An-Nahar reported Wednesday that PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat had submitted to pressure. Hard-liners in
Iraq and Syria accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of making
too many concessions.
	   ``The Israeli measures to swallow the Palestinians' land is
being done with American support and encouragement,'' said Iraq's
Al-Thawra daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party.
	   The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, an
opposition faction based in the Syrian capital Damascus, accused
Arafat of ``new concessions'' and called for ``an immediate stop to
negotiations.''
	   In Jordan, even moderate newspapers raised questions about
Arafat's acceptance Tuesday of an an Israeli offer to withdraw from
over 13 percent of the West Bank's land, 3 percent of which will be
a ``nature reserve.''
	   Beirut's An-Nahar said Arafat ``submitted once again to
pressure.
	   In an editorial entitled ``Burning Arafat as a Favor to
Clinton,'' the paper said the so-called breakthrough was helpful to
the American president in his efforts to escape from the scandal
over former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   Many newspapers in the Arab world did not carry editorial's on
Arafat's move because the announcement missed their deadlines. On
Wednesday, Arab countries made no official statements about the
decision.
	   Syria, however, renewed its call for Israel to resume peace
negotiations at the point where they broke off in 1996 when the
previous Israeli government was discussing a full return of the
Golan Heights seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Israel's present government refuses a full return of the Golan,
arguing security prevents such a move. Syrian Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam urged the renewed talks in a speech in
Damascus.
	   The proposed pullback in the West Bank would be a second stage
of Israel's withdrawal. Israel earlier gave the Palestinians full
control of about 3 percent of West Bank land and agreed to share
control over 24 percent.
	   In Washington on Tuesday, Arafat told reporters after meeting
President Clinton that he agreed to the Israeli offer ``to
facilitate the negotiations'' for an overall West Bank settlement.
	   It remained unclear how the ``nature reserve'' would be
governed.
	   The Palestinian envoy to Washington, Hassan Abdel-Rahman, told
Egypt's Sawt al-Arab radio that agreeing to the reserve was not a
concession ``because this area will still be under the complete
administrative and civil control of the Palestinian Authority,
while the security control will be under joint Israeli-Palestinian
control.''
	   In Jordan, the mass circulation Al-Ra'i carried a front-page
editorial saying the agreement ``gives new hopes for breaking the
deadlock which has for long griped the peace process. But there
must be other steps, otherwise, this will be just a publicity
stunt.''
	   The Jordan Times, a liberal English-language daily, was more
skeptical.
	   ``So what happens after the next redeployment?'' it asked. ``Can
Netanyahu and Israel at large lay aside the rhetoric and make an
effort for peace?''
	   The Times said a Palestinian state was inevitable.
	   ``The options are clear: a unilateral declaration of an
independent Palestine or multilateral recognition of an independent
Palestine,'' the paper said. ``Either way, there will be a state.''

Mexico's government newspaper closes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ After 69 years and 25,024 editions, the
government newspaper El Nacional published for the last time
Wednesday, marking yet another step in the breakup of a
once-monolithic government control of press, media and industry
here.
	   El Nacional first appeared on May 27, 1929, the same year
Mexico's ruling party was formed, and over the years the paper
reflected the views of the government and the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has held the presidency without
interruption since then.
	   As opposition parties grew stronger and decades of one-party
rule weakened, the government tried to sell off El Nacional in
1993, but no private investors were interested in the money-losing
daily.
	   A guest editorial in Wednesday's final edition blamed the
paper's demise on the fact that opposition parties gained control
of congress in 1997 and demanded that the government sell the
newspaper or close it.
	   ``Blackmail by a right-wing party ... it should be understood as
a historical revenge'' against the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, wrote columnist Ofelia Casillas, herself a party member, of
the paper's closing.
	   The paper demise was not mourned by the rest of the Mexican
press. One columnist expressed sympathy, but mainly for the paper's
340 employees.
	   ``The paper did not vary in its line: texts of official
speeches, praise for the president ... and insidious criticism of
the opposition orchestrated by the Interior Secretariat,'' wrote
journalist Fernando Benitez in the daily La Jornada.
	   A previous move to close the paper was averted in 1994 when the
government decided to continue publishing _ but 760 of its 1,100
employees lost their jobs.
	   During last year's congressional discussions on the 1998 budget,
lawmakers called for all ``insolvent, bureaucratic and useless''
state businesses to be dissolved.
	   El Nacional is being liquidated along with the state newsprint
paper company, Productora e Importadora de Papel, which in the past
had been used as an instrument of government control over the
press.
	   The newspaper's employees will receive severance pay and are
still exploring the possibility of buying the paper's assets in
alliance with private investors.
	   However, the paper has managed to attract few readers despite
its low cover price of less than 30 cents _ about half what other
major dailies cost.
	   The paper's low readership was the subject of jokes. A story
told in media circles claims that a past director of El Nacional
once asked Mexico's president if he could print a sensitive story.
	   After much cajoling, the president reportedly answered, ``Go
ahead and print it, but just don't mention it to anyone.''

Date set for former British spy's extradition hearing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French appeals court on Wednesday set an October
21 date for a hearing to rule on a British request for the
extradition of former intelligence agent David Shayler.
	   The Paris court also deferred until Oct. 7 a ruling on Shayler's
request to be freed in the meantime. His defense lawyers
successfully argued that they had not received the appropriate
summons to appear for Wednesday's hearing.
	   Shayler, 32, worked for Britain's internal MI5 intelligence
agency from 1994 until 1997. He fled to France last year after
selling stories about the agency's operations to a British
newspaper.
	   If extradited, he faces being charged under the Official Secrets
Act.
	   He maintains, among other things, that Britain plotted the
assassination of of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ an allegation
the government denies.
	   Libya also has asked France to extradite Shayler, or to allow
Libyan judicial authorities to question him in France.
	   Shayler was arrested in Paris on Aug. 1 after living with his
girlfriend in a remote part of rural France. He is being held in La
Sante prison without charge.

Jim Carrey wins minor battle in defamation case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Hollywood star Jim Carrey had a
minor victory Wednesday in a court case in which he is suing an
Australian magazine that described him as a groper.
	   A Supreme Court judge ruled out a submission by lawyers
representing Woman's Day magazine in the defamation case that an
article headlined ``Hollywood Stars Ban Groper Jim'' meant that
Carrey was ``psychologically unstable.''
	   Justice John Hedigan noted that the headline had described the
plaintiff as ``Groper Jim,'' not ``Crazy Jim.''
	   Hedigan said the phrase ``psychologically unstable is so wide as
to be virtually meaningless.''
	   The judge said that aspect of the defense would be disallowed.
	   The defamation action is continuing and is expected to go before
a jury on a date yet to be set.
	   Carrey, star of successful movies including ``The Mask,''
``Liar, Liar'' and ``The Truman Show,'' is suing Australian
Consolidated Publishing, publishers of Woman's Day, over an article
published in the magazine last year.
	   The actor claims the article suggested actresses had refused to
work with him as a result of his offensive behavior.
	   The defamation action says the article claims that Carrey had
sexually harassed Alicia Silverstone, Jennifer Tilley, Drew
Barrymore and Courtney Love.
	   Carrey argues that the article meant he was crude, lewd and
disgusting in his personal life and in his professional life dealt
with actresses in that manner.

Iran imposes death penalty on certain drug possession cases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ In its latest crackdown on drugs, the
Iranian government decreed Wednesday a death sentence for
individuals possessing opium and even small amounts of heroin.
	   The new law put the quantities drawing the death sentence at
more than 30 grams (1.05 ounces) of heroin and 5 kilograms (11
pounds), the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   ``The new law was approved as part of the major new campaign by
the Islamic Republic of Iran to fight the merchants of death,'' it
quoted Attorney General Ayatollah Morteza Moqtadaie as saying.
	   The death sentence will also be imposed for armed drug
trafficking and repeat offenses of growing opium poppies, he said.
	   Offenders who possess between 0.5 kilograms (1.1 pounds) and 5
kilograms (11 pounds) of opium will be fined up to 200 million
rials (dlrs 67,000), receive 74 lashes and a 15-year jail term.
	   According to the new law, addiction is considered a crime,
unless the addict is going through a rehabilitation program in
which case the sentence will be suspended, Moqtadaie said.
	   If the addict successfully finishes the program, his sentence
will be dropped, he said.
	   Large drug hauls, especially of heroin and opium, are common in
Iran, which lies on a route used by smugglers to get drugs from
Pakistan and Afghanistan to the oil-rich Gulf and Europe.

Chelsea, Newcastle hold slender leads; PSG, Lazio shaky
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Of the four clubs fancied to win the Cup Winners
Cup, holder Chelsea and rejuvenated Newcastle go into Thursday's
first-round, second-leg matches with slender leads.
	   Paris Saint Germain and Lazio don't even have that and all four
could easily go out with this season's competition barely a month
old.
	   There are 16 games in the weakest of Europe's three major club
championships, but most eyes will be on just four:
	   _ Partizan Belgrade vs. Newcastle.
	   _ Lausanne, vs. Lazio.
	   _ Helsingborgs vs. Chelsea.
	   _ Maccabi Haifa vs. PSG.
	   Newcastle, which takes a 2-1 lead to Belgrade, got the winner
two weeks ago from former Olympiakos star Nikos Dabizas. He's
hoping to finish the job.
	   ``We are better than Partizan and must beat them,'' the Greek
international said. ``They are not at the same level as we are.''
	   ``There are four or five big clubs in this competition and we
are one of them. It is important we beat a smaller club like
Partizan and go on,'' he added.
	   Partizan, winners of every home match this season, is not bowed
by the cocky confidence.
	   ``They (Newcastle) think they are the smartest in the world,''
said coach Ljubisa Tumbakovic. ``They always play the same whether
at home or abroad. They have many reasons to be like that because
they have great individuals, but Partizan has its qualities, too.''
	   ``I will expect my players to be patient,'' he added. ``We have
nothing to lose because it's no shame to be beaten by such a
distinguished team.''
	   The big club with the biggest problem might be Lazio. Finalist
in last season's UEFA Cup, the Italians slink into to Lausanne
following a 1-1 home draw.
	   The best news is that Chilean striker Marcelo Salas should be
ready after skipping practice this week with a bruised leg.
Croatian Alen Boksic is still recovering from a knee injury and
Spain's Ivan de la Pena has a thigh injury and hasn't practiced for
two weeks.
	   Lausanne knows it can pull an upset.
	   ``While we should be confident, because we've proven our
strength, let's keep our feet on the ground and leave them the role
of favorites,'' said striker Fabio Celestini.
	   In Sweden, defending champion Chelsea arrives with a fragile 1-0
lead. Home striker Magnus Powell, fighting off a virus, should play
Thursday with Helsingborgs expecting to pressure Gianluca Vialli's
team.
	   ``We have to move up the game and press Chelsea higher up on the
field,'' said midfielder Peter Wibraan.
	   In Israel, Paris Saint-Germain comes off a 1-1 first leg at home
and is desperate to advance after a disastrous start to the season.
PSG _ Cup Winners Cup champions two years ago _ lost to lowly
Sochaux on Friday, its third defeat of the season. Sochaux played
with only 10 men for most of the game.
	   Afterwards, PSG captain Marco Simone criticized club president
Charles Bietry for interference in team matters.
	   ``A defeat (in Israel) would be catastrophic,'' said midfielder
Bruno Carotti.
	   Left back Didier Domi is out with a pulled thigh muscle and
Christian Woerns is doubtful with a sprained ankle.
	   In other games including the scores from the first leg:
	   Jablonec, Czech Republic vs. Apollon Limassol, Cyprus (1-2);
Spartak Trnava, Slovakia vs. Besiktas, Turkey (0-3); Lokomotiv
Moscow, Russia vs. CSCA Kiev, Ukraine (2-0); Genk, Belgium vs.
Duisberg, Germany (1-1).
	   Mallorca, Spain vs. Hearts, Scotland (1-0); Amica Wronko,
Poland, vs. Heerenveen, Netherlands (1-3); FC Copenhagen, Denmark
vs. Levski Sofia, Bulgaria (2-0); Braga, Portugal vs. Metalurgs
Liepaja, Latvia (0-0).
	   Haka, Finland vs. Panionios, Greece (0-2); Valerenga, Norway vs.
Rapid Bucharest, Romania (2-2); MTK Budapest, Hungary vs. Ried,
Austria (0-2); Varteks, Croatia vs. Rudar Velenje, Slovenia (1-0).
	   In Thursday's other game, Scotland's Rangers are home to
Israel's Beitar Jerusalem after a 1-1 draw in the UEFA Cup
first-round, first-leg match.

EU Truckers, management talks fail; EU to legislate working
</HEADLINE>
conditions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Wednesday
it plans to propose legislation covering working conditions for the
trucking industry after talks between unions and management broke
down earlier in the day.
	   ``We are very disappointed with the breakdown of these talks and
will now come forward with a package of our own measures,'' said EU
spokeswoman Barbara Nolan.
	   The EU transport ministers will have an opportunity to assess
the way forward on Thursday at a previously scheduled meeting in
Luxembourg.
	   On Wednesday, truckers unions and management missed a deadline
to conclude a deal on working conditions _ notably limiting driving
time. Disagreements about that have led to protest actions and
strikes by truckers in several EU nations in the past year.
	   The EU head office has urged both sides to approve a draft
agreement limiting average working hours for truck and coach
drivers to 45 hours a week.
	   Current EU legislation limits the time the drivers should spend
at the wheel, but does not include time spent on other work such as
loading and unloading trucks or cleaning and maintenance of
vehicles.
	   Nolan said the EU Commission will now draft proposals to extend
social legislation to the transport sector.
	   Truckers in France have been most insistent about their working
conditions. Last November, a strike disrupted France and traffic
with neighboring nations for five days, and in 1996 they stopped
work for 12 days.

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) - In a country of 83.5 million people and
better know for its sleek speeding cars, German residents own some
60 million bicycles, officials at the International Bicycle Fair in
Cologne said Wednesday.
	   Some 1,200 bicycle exhibitors from 39 countries are taking part
in the fair that runs through Sunday, with the biggest participants
from Germany, Taiwan, Italy, the Netherlands, India and China.
	   The fair is focused on new technology, color and design trends,
as well as training gear and sports clothing.
	   A main attraction is the fastest bicycle in the world, made by
Peugeot, which company representatives claim can attain a downhill
speed of almost 212 kilometers per hour (131 mph). It is also the
most expensive at 25,000 marks (15,625 dlrs).
	   German industry statistics show that in the year ending June 30,
1.95 million bicycles were produced, an increase of 4 percent over
the same period last year.
	   Imports were also up 18 percent for the period to 1.2 million
bicycles, with 36 percent imported from western European countries,
29 percent from Asia and 34 percent from eastern Europe, the
industry said.
	   Exports of German bicycles through June 30 was up nearly 50
percent to 274,000 units over the previous year.
	   As in the past, about half the bicycles sold in Germany were
bought from professional dealers, with about 33 percent purchased
at self-service supermarkets. The rest were through mail-order and
other outlets.
	   Compared to its 60 million bicycles, car-loving Germany claims
39.9 million automobiles and 2.2 million commercial vehicles were
registered as of the end of 1997.
	   One of the reasons for increased bicycle popularity is Germany's
1997 Tour de France champion Jan Ulrich who came in second at the
event this year, industry officials say.

Expo 98 draws to a close with 24-hour events
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ At least 200,000 people were expected at
the Lisbon world's fair Wednesday, the final day of a
four-month-long event which drew more than 9.8 million visitors.
	   A surge in attendance in the last two weeks swelled the final
total, after an average of just 33,000 people a day in the fair's
opening weeks.
	   Government officials attended a formal closing ceremony in the
afternoon but the fair, known as Expo 98, was scheduled to close
only at 8 a.m. (0700 GMT) Thursday after a night of rock concerts,
including one by Chuck Berry.
	   Officials expected the dlrs 2.4 billion fair, which was
organized around the central theme of the world's oceans and the
dangers they face, to focus international attention on Portugal and
give a major boost to its tourism industry.
	   ``Expo 98 marks our arrival on the world stage,'' Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres said in his speech.
	   However, the total number of visitors was far below forecasts.
Organizers had predicted at least 15 million admissions, and the
government estimates a revenue shortfall of dlrs 400 million which
likely will have to be picked up by the taxpayer.
	   The fair's image was also bruised by allegations of graft in the
awarding of contracts. Police are investigating the claims.
	   Some of the fair's main pavilions will reopen next month as
permanent tourist attractions while others will be dismantled. The
surrounding area will be developed for housing, offices and
shopping malls.
	   The next world's fair will be staged in Hanover, Germany in
2000.

Leaders of Niger, Chad fly to Libya, violating U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two African presidents flew to Libya
Wednesday, the second time in less than a month, violating U.N.
sanctions that ban air travel there, Libyan radio reported.
	   President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of Niger and Idriss Deby of
Chad landed in the northern coastal town of Sirte, state-run radio
said in a report monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. They
followed President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, who arrived Tuesday.
	   The radio said the two presidents flew separately and arrived
``in implementation of the courageous decision adopted by the
Organization of African Unity'' to ignore the sanctions.
	   The OAU earlier this year said it no longer would abide by the
sanctions when travel to Libya was required for humanitarian
activities or official business.
	   Mainassara and Deby flew to Libya on Sept. 5 with four other
African leaders in violation of the sanctions to take part in
Libya's celebrations marking the 29th anniversary of the coup that
brought Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to power in 1969.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions in 1992 to try
to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270
people.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Helmut Kohl's stinging defeat in his bid
for a fifth-term claimed more victims Wednesday in his Christian
Democratic Union, including his much-criticized campaign manager.
	   Peter Hintze, who ran Kohl's campaign as Christian Democrats
general secretary, said he would step down to give the new party
boss ``a free hand'' for reform. Just a couple days earlier, he had
said he intended to serve out his term until 2000.
	   Deputy party chairman Christoph Bergner announced he would not
seek re-election, and Rita Suessmuth, who loses her post as
president of the lower house of parliament with the Christian
Democrats' defeat, said she would not run for another spot on
parliament's presiding committee.

Jamaica: Caribbean islands depend on world's fragile ecosystem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Many island nations _ especially in the
Caribbean _ link their survival and development to the maintenance
of the world's fragile ecosystem, Jamaica's deputy prime minister
said Wednesday.
	   The Caribbean islands ``are continually subject to the pressures
of urbanization and resource exploitation; to the pollution of
their coastal waters; to the threat of natural disasters,'' Seymour
Mullings told the U.N. General Assembly in a speech advocating
protection of oceans and seabeds.
	   ``We are endangered by the threat of sea-level rise and face the
destruction of our coral reefs,'' he said.
	   The danger of natural disasters was brought home most recently
by Hurricane Georges, which caused ``widespread loss of life and
property'' in Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican
Republic, Haiti and St. Kitts and Nevis, Mullings said.
	   ``We take this opportunity to appeal to the international
community to provide urgent and generous humanitarian assistance
and support of the reconstruction of our sister Caribbean states,''
he said.
	   Mullings also applauded the efforts of the International Seabed
Authority, which manages deep sea mining. The agency, based in
Kingston, Jamaica, ``continues to make progress on the negotiation
of a mining code,'' he said.
	   Created by the 1994 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, ISA
regulates the use of seabed resources in international waters,
where millions of tons of cobalt, manganese, copper and other
metals lie under the ocean floor.

 &UR; At least 17 hurt in West Bank clashes &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Israel-Hebron &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Clashes broke out Wednesday between
Palestinians and Israeli troops in the divided West Bank town of
Hebron and a village near Ramallah, leaving at least 17 people
hurt.
	   In Hebron, two Palestinian-owned cars caught fire Wednesday, and
witnesses said they had heard explosions. Meanwhile, a reporter for
Israel army radio said two grenades were thrown at a border police
jeep in Hebron and that three border policemen were hurt, including
one who was in serious condition.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the two incidents were
connected. The army said it was looking into the incidents and had
no immediate comment.
	   At least 11 Palestinians were hurt and taken to Hebron's Alia
Hospital. None of the injuries was serious.
	   Hebron, where about 500 Jewish settlers live among 130,000
Palestinians, is a frequent flashpoint for violence.
	   Earlier clashes near a village of Biddou outside the town of
Ramallah left six others hurt, when hundreds of Palestinians
clashed with Israeli troops after the funeral of a Hamas activist
killed when a car rigged with powerful explosives blew up.
	   Two Hamas activists who survived Tuesday's blast denied they
were preparing the car for a bombing attack in Israel, Palestinian
police officials said.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
over renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to carry
out suicide bombings in the Jewish state. Hamas wants to avenge the
recent killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   On Tuesday, shortly after the car exploded in an industrial zone
of Beitunia, a West Bank village near Ramallah, Israel sealed its
borders with the Palestinian areas for Yom Kippur, the holiest day
in the Jewish calendar.
	   The closure was to be lifted gradually after 1 a.m. Thursday
(2300 gmt Wednesday).
	   The man killed in the Beitunia blast, Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, was
buried Wednesday in Biddou, his home village. Hundreds of villagers
walked in the funeral procession led by one marcher with a Hamas
flag.
	   After the funeral, about 400 teen-agers and young men rushed
toward a nearby Jewish settlement, Har Adar, and began throwing
stones at Israeli soldiers posted at the gates. Troops fired rubber
bullets and tear gas, and six protesters were injured.
	   Zahran and his two friends, Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid, also
from Biddou, had been arrested twice by Israel and twice by the
Palestinian Authority for being involved in Hamas activities, most
recently in the spring.
	   The Abu Eid brothers told Palestinian investigators, however,
that they were not rigging the car for a bombing in Israel when the
blast went off Tuesday.
	   They said that just before the explosion, they met an Israeli
Arab man in the car parked in the Beitunia industrial zone,
expecting him to deliver three guns for dlrs 1,000.
	   The Abu Eid brothers were taken to nearby Ramallah Hospital
where they remained in stable condition Wednesday, under police
guard.
	   A man who said he spoke for Hamas called the Palestinian-run
Jerusalem Media and Communications Center, or JMCC, after the blast
and claimed that Israel was behind the bombing. However, Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the caller did not speak on behalf of
the group and that Hamas was launching its own investigation.

Iraq says it was obliged to cut cooperation with inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout to UPDATE with speech to General Assembly by
foreign minister &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister compared the
effects of 8-year-old U.N. sanctions against his country to
genocide Wednesday and called for a denunciation of countries who
insist on retaining the sanctions.
	   Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf didn't specifically name the United
States in prepared remarks of his speech to the General Assembly.
But he harshly criticized the U.N. Special Commission, which
carries out weapons inspections in Iraq, as working only on behalf
of one ``arrogant, powerful state,'' to keep the sanctions in place
_ a clear reference to Washington.
	   That undue influence, al-Sahaf said, forced Iraq to stop
cooperating with inspectors last month ``because keeping to a
course with nothing but dead ends and vicious circles in sight can
have no other outcome than the continuation of the blockade on the
people of Iraq,'' he said, according to the text.
	   ``The situation calls for the strong denunciation of those who
insist, for ulterior political motives, on continuing to inflict on
the people of Iraq the destructive blockade whose tragic
consequences are tantamount to the internationally proscribed acts
of genocide,'' he said.
	   Inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, must
certify Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles and chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons programs before the Security Council
will lift sanctions that were imposed after Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   The sanctions prevent Iraq from selling its most valuable
commodity _ oil _ on the open market.
	   Al-Sahaf said Iraq has cooperated fully with U.N. resolutions
demanding it destroy its weapons of mass destruction. ``But the
blockade has not so far been lifted, thus rendering the
continuation of cooperation both meaningless and useless,'' he said
in the text.
	   Al-Sahaf welcomed efforts by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
seek an end to the impasse by conducting a ``comprehensive review''
of Iraq's progress over the last seven years to disarm itself.
	   Such a review could force the council to recognize Iraq's
progress in dismantling its proscribed weapons programs and could
increase pressure for some easing of sanctions.
	   ``While we support carrying out such a comprehensive review in
an objective, fair and impartial manner, we affirm Iraq's right to
expect the Security Council to proceed to take action to lift the
inhumane sanctions imposed on the people for eight years now,''
al-Sahaf said in his prepared remarks.
	   ``The people and leadership of Iraq will accept nothing less.''
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is in New York this week,
meeting with members of the council and Annan to try to work out
details of the comprehensive review.
	   The council has said that no such review would take place before
Iraq rescinds its Aug. 5 announcement that it was halting
cooperation with inspectors. The decision has paralyzed searches
because U.N. weapons experts must be accompanied by Iraqi escorts.
	   Aziz told reporters on Monday that the council must make the
first move by accepting the comprehensive review, but has shown a
more conciliatory line to council members and the U.N. chief
himself in closed meetings, diplomats have said.

Agassi rolls over Pioline in 34 minutes, Novotna loses

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Novotna upset by Schnyder, Pioline quotes &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Andre Agassi rolled over Cedric Pioline
6-0, 6-0 in only 34 minutes Wednesday to storm into the
quarterfinals of the dlrs 6.7 million Grand Slam Cup.
	   In the quickest match since the tournament's inception in 1990,
Pioline won only eight points in the first set and nine in the
second against an Agassi playing with amazing confidence.
	   Agassi was given a wild card to play in the tournament, which
nominally brings together players with best records in the year's
four Grand Slam events _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and
Wimbledon.
	   But three men's Grand Slam champions of the year have decided to
skip the tournament despite its huge prize money _ Wimbledon
champion and top-ranked Pete Sampras, U.S. Open champion Patrick
Rafter and Carlos Moya, the French Open champion.
	   Only Australian Open champion Petr Korda is among the 12 men
here.
	   ``Regardless of who is not here, this is still a great
tournament,'' Agassi said.
	   While most of the top women are here, one of the most prominent
ones had a short stay. Jana Novotna, the Wimbledon champion and No.
3 player in the world, was upset by ninth-ranked Patty Schnyder
2-6, 7-5, 7-5.
	   Novotna had several of her trademark lapses on key moments and
once again demonstrated her inability to close out matches that
seem already won.
	   Serving for the match at 5-4 in the second set, she committed a
double-fault on match point.
	   She served for the match twice more in the decisive set and both
times dropped her serve. The tenacious Swiss teen-ager finally
prevailed when Novotna slice backhand sailed wide, ending the match
after two hours and eight minutes. Novotna had 10 double-faults.
	   For his short work, Agassi earned dlrs 175,000. Even more
amazingly, Pioline picked up dlrs 100,000 given to first-round
losers _ without even winning a game and hardly breaking a sweat.
	   With the official scorecard giving the duration of the match at
34 minutes, it means Agassi made dlrs 5,147 a minute, while Pioline
made dlrs 2,941 a minute in his losing effort.
	   Agassi, ranked No. 8 in the world, hit winners from all over the
court from the start and the Frenchman never had a chance. Agassi
picked apart Pioline's serve with sizzling returns.
	   ``It was all kind of going my way,'' Agassi said. ``He tried
hard, he was hitting the ball decently.''
	   ``I stepped it up and I kept stepping it up, kept making shots.
I can have a clean swing at the ball here indoors,'' the American
said. ``It's a great surface for me, the ball travels fast through
the air but it sits up good once it bounces.''
	   Agassi, a former No. 1 who is making a comeback after dropping
out of the top 100, has won four titles this year. But his Grand
Slam record for the year is relatively poor: Round of 16 at the
Australian and the U.S. Open his best showing.
	   ``I've come here very prepared and I'll feel more satisfied I do
well since I got a wild card,'' said Agassi, a winner of three
Grand Slam titles in his career.
	   Pioline blamed pain in both knees for his quick exit. ``It's
like a needle.''
	   The Frenchman admitted that had it not been for the money, he
might have decided not to play.
	   ``Yeah, that's a big point, for sure,'' he said.

Start of NBA season in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS detail, background; SUBS 2nd graf to CLARIFY league only
confirmed date of new talks &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The start of the U.S. National Basketball
Association season is almost certain to be delayed for the first
time in history, with talks with the players union unable to resume
until Oct. 8.
	   The NBA on Wednesday confirmed the date for new collective
bargaining negotiations aimed at ending a lockout that begins its
fourth month Thursday.
	   The development comes two days after a previously undisclosed
one-hour meeting among commissioner David Stern, deputy
commissioner Russ Granik, union director Billy Hunter and union
president Patrick Ewing.
	   The league wanted a bargaining session as soon as Thursday, but
the union said nothing could be scheduled until Oct. 8 because of
earlier commitments, Granik said.
	   ``I was bowled over to hear that we can't meet for nine days
while Rome is burning,'' Granik told the Philadelphia Daily News.
	   Granik was not in his office Wednesday. Hunter, who was in
Houston on Tuesday, did not return messages.
	   The regular season is scheduled to begin Nov. 3, and at least
three weeks would be needed after an agreement is reached to sign
players, make trades and hold abbreviated training camps.
	   So unless a deal can be completed within a day or two after the
sides reconvene, there appears to be no way the season can start on
time.
	   The league already has announced an indefinite postponement of
training camps and has canceled 25 exhibition games. The remainder
of the preseason could be scrapped this week.
	   The league ``locked out'' the players on July 1. A lockout is
essentially a strike by the club owners, who _ under American law _
refuse to pay players and keep them from training and playing at
club facilities until a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA)
is reached.
	   The CBA is a contract which sets up general rules between
players and club onwers, such as roster limits, salary caps,
minimum salaries and pension benefits.
	   In addition, players negotiate individual contracts with the
teams for salaries and other benefits.
	   The NBA club owners are seeking a CBA that includes a definitive
ceiling on team payrolls, or a ``hard'' salary cap. The union
insists it will not accept such a deal.
	   Under current rules, the ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows teams
to circumvent their cap to re-sign their own free agents.
	   Only one formal bargaining session was held during the summer,
and the meeting ended abruptly when the owners walked out upon
hearing the players' latest proposal.
	   The league sent the union a new proposal last week, which the
union dismissed as being almost identical to the owners' previous
offer in May. Players have made two proposals, one in April and one
in August.
	   Both sides await a ruling from arbitrator John Feerick on the
union's grievance over whether players with guaranteed contracts
for the upcoming season should be paid during the lockout.
Feerick's decision could come at any time before Oct. 19.
	   League officials suspect the union is stalling in hopes that a
victory in the grievance will give provide leverage in
negotiations.

Clerides calls for U.N. action against Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Cypriot president called on the U.N.
Security Council Wednesday to take steps to force Turkey to end its
occupation of the northern third of the island.
	   President Glafcos Clerides said unspecified action must be taken
if Turkey continues to reject council resolutions for the
reunification of the island and insists on the recognition of the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north.
	   Clerides was speaking in an address to mark the 24th anniversary
of the island's independence from British colonial rule.
	   Cyprus was split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and the
occupied north in 1974 when Turkey invaded in the wake of an
abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   The breakaway state in the north is only recognized by Turkey,
which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   U.N.-sponsored reunification talks have been deadlocked since
August last year after the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
made recognition of his state a precondition for their resumption.

Political discussions begin on upcoming Algerian elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Members of the 10 political parties in
the Algerian parliament began discussions Wednesday about
presidential elections scheduled for February.
	   The talks followed President Liamine Zeroual's announcement
Sept. 11 that he was cutting short his term and calling new
elections.
	   The purpose of Wednesday's talks was to to discuss election
procedures and ways to ensure the vote would be held in a
democratic fashion.
	   A former general, Zeroual said the decision to step down had
been taken in order to try to to create ``a climate favorable to
the alternation of power.''
	   Zeroual has been unable to quell an Islamic insurgency that
began in 1992 after the government canceled parliamentary elections
that an Islamic party was set to win. At least 75,000 people have
died in the violence since then.
	   At least one party, the populist National Democratic Assembly,
said Wednesday that it would try to convince Zeroual to stay on as
president.

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Clashes broke out Wednesday between
Palestinians and Israeli troops in the divided West Bank town of
Hebron and a village near Ramallah, leaving at least 17 people
hurt.
	   In Hebron, two Palestinian-owned cars caught fire Wednesday, and
witnesses said they had heard explosions. Meanwhile, a reporter for
Israel army radio said two grenades were thrown at a border police
jeep in Hebron and that three policemen were injured, including one
who was in serious condition.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the two incidents were
connected. The army said it was investigating and had no immediate
comment.
	   At least 11 Palestinians were injured and taken to Hebron's Alia
Hospital. None of the injuries was serious.
	   Hebron, where about 500 Jewish settlers live among 130,000
Palestinians, is a frequent flashpoint for violence.
	   Earlier clashes near the village of Biddou, outside the town of
Ramallah, left six others injured when hundreds of Palestinians
clashed with Israeli troops after the funeral of a Hamas activist
killed when a car rigged with powerful explosives blew up.
	   Two Hamas activists who survived Tuesday's blast denied they
were preparing the car for a bombing attack in Israel, Palestinian
police officials said.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
over renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to carry
out suicide bombings in the Jewish state. Hamas wants to avenge the
recent killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   On Tuesday, shortly after the car exploded in an industrial zone
of Beitunia, a West Bank village near Ramallah, Israel sealed its
borders with the Palestinian areas for Yom Kippur, the holiest day
in the Jewish calendar.
	   The closure was to be lifted gradually after 1 a.m. Thursday
(2300 gmt Wednesday).
	   The man killed in the Beitunia blast, Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, was
buried Wednesday in Biddou, his home village. Hundreds of villagers
walked in the funeral procession led by one marcher with a Hamas
flag.
	   After the funeral, about 400 teen-agers and young men rushed
toward a nearby Jewish settlement, Har Adar, and began throwing
stones at Israeli soldiers posted at the gates. Troops fired rubber
bullets and tear gas, and six protesters were injured.
	   Zahran and his two friends, Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid, also
from Biddou, had been arrested twice by Israel and twice by the
Palestinian Authority for being involved in Hamas activities, most
recently in the spring.
	   The Abu Eid brothers told Palestinian investigators, however,
that they were not rigging the car for a bombing in Israel when the
blast went off Tuesday.
	   They said that just before the explosion, they met an Israeli
Arab man in the car parked in the Beitunia industrial zone,
expecting him to deliver three guns for dlrs 1,000.
	   The Abu Eid brothers were taken to nearby Ramallah Hospital
where they remained in stable condition Wednesday, under police
guard.
	   A man who said he spoke for Hamas called the Palestinian-run
Jerusalem Media and Communications Center, or JMCC, after the blast
and claimed that Israel was behind the bombing. However, Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the caller did not speak on behalf of
the group and that Hamas was launching its own investigation.

Expo 98 draws to a close with 24-hour events
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ At least 200,000 people were expected at
the Lisbon world's fair Wednesday, the final day of a
four-month-long event which drew more than 9.8 million visitors.
	   A surge in attendance in the last two weeks swelled the final
total, after an average of just 33,000 people a day in the fair's
opening weeks.
	   Government officials attended a formal closing ceremony in the
afternoon but the fair, known as Expo 98, was scheduled to close
only at 8 a.m. (0700 GMT) Thursday after a night of rock concerts,
including one by Chuck Berry.
	   Officials expected the dlrs 2.4 billion fair, which was
organized around the central theme of the world's oceans and the
dangers they face, to focus international attention on Portugal and
give a major boost to its tourism industry.
	   ``Expo 98 marks our arrival on the world stage,'' Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres said in his speech.
	   However, the total number of visitors was far below forecasts.
Organizers had predicted at least 15 million admissions, and the
government estimates a revenue shortfall of dlrs 400 million which
likely will have to be picked up by the taxpayer.
	   The fair's image was also bruised by allegations of graft in the
awarding of contracts. Police are investigating the claims.
	   Some of the fair's main pavilions will reopen next month as
permanent tourist attractions while others will be dismantled. The
surrounding area will be developed for housing, offices and
shopping malls.
	   The next world's fair will be staged in Hanover, Germany in
2000.

Dominca: Caribbean banana trade deserves protection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Seeking to protect its banana industry _
the economic mainstay in the Caribbean _ Dominica's prime minister
called Wednesday for more cooperation between the United Nations
and the Caribbean community.
	   ``That cooperation ... is nowhere more necessary than in our
fight to maintain the integrity of the market for bananas,'' Edison
C. James told the U.N. General Assembly in a speech that also
called for Taiwan to regain its U.N. seat.
	   Free-trade agreements that go into effect in 2002 threaten the
Caribbean banana industry, which brought prosperity to the islands
in the 1960s and 1970s.
	   Last year, the United States and Central American countries
challenged the trade preferences some European countries give their
former colonies _ including those in the Caribbean _ and succeeded
in getting them eliminated. In 2002, the Caribbean countries will
have to compete in a free market.
	   ``Our fight is against some very powerful members of this very
United Nations who seem determined to derail our democracy, upset
our efforts at eradicating poverty and undermine the peace and
security of our region,'' said James, whose island nation gained
independence from Britain in 1978.
	   Caribbean producers generally have higher costs and produce less
fruit than U.S.-owned companies operating in Central and South
America.
	   ``We seek a level playing field in which our people can engage
meaningfully in trade and development, rather than be forever
subjected to the aid and dependency syndrome,'' James said.
	   In his speech, James also recognized efforts Taiwan has made in
the Caribbean as it battles for influence against China. Taiwan
uses its billions of dollars in reserves to help its allies. Five
of the 27 countries that recognize Taiwan are in the Caribbean.
	   Taiwan held China's seat in the United Nations until October
1971, when the General Assembly transferred the U.N. seat to
Beijing.
	   ``The 21.5 million people of (Taiwan) aspire to be represented
in this body,'' James said. ``They have a legitimate expectation
that their country, a founding member of the United Nations, should
have its membership restored.''
	   Taiwan, considered by China to be a renegade province, is
governed by Nationalists who lost a civil war to the Communists and
fled the Chinese mainland in 1949.

Largest opposition parties start bargaining
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) - Slovakia's two largest opposition
parties met on Wednesday for a first bargaining round toward
forming a coalition government without the currently governing
party of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar.
	   The talks between the Slovak Democratic Coalition, the main
opposition alliance, and the Democratic Left of former Communists
came a day after Meciar's party said it would nominate someone else
to try to form a new government following parliamentary elections
last week.
	   But the decision to drop Meciar likely was not enough for the
ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia to remain in power
because the combined opposition has won a majority of seats in the
new parliament in the ballot held Friday and Saturday last week.
	   Interior Minister Gustav Krajci said Tuesday that Sergej Kozlik,
the vice chairman of Meciar's party, or someone else will be
appointed to put together a new Cabinet, but not Meciar. Krajci
said that Meciar will have to respect the decision.
	   Krajci also made clear that his party may be forced to go into
opposition.
	   ``Do you see any other solution? We will try to form a
government, but it is not probable that we will be able to form a
majority government,'' he said.
	   On Wednesday, Kozlik, changing somewhat his tune, said:
	   ``We will be preparing ourselves for new elections, in about two
years.
	   ``I do not think that their government will be able to stay firm
and effective for more than two years,'' Kozlik said on Wednesday,
suggesting that the new likely coalition government would not
govern for a full four-year term.
	   In last week's ballot, the Slovak Democratic Coalition gained 42
seats in the new parliament.
	   Meciar's party finished ahead of everyone else, but mustered
only a disappointing 27 percent of the vote and will hold only 43
seats in parliament. The party's only future coalition partner, the
Slovak National Party, gained 14 seats.
	   Confident that the combined coalition can agree on the makeup of
a new government, Jozef Migas of the Democratic Left said, `` It
will be a coalition of more than two political parties.''
	   Mikulas Dzurinda, who heads the Slovak Democratic Coalition and
has been mentioned as the top opposition candidate for prime
minister, said a new government should be put together as soon as
possible after the new Parliament convenes no later than Oct. 29.
	   Meanwhile, Slovak Foreign Minister Zdenka Kramplova, who took
over only in June, resigned Wednesday. A former Translator of
English and Bulgarian, Kramplova will not leave politics
completely.
	   She hopes to be appointed ambassador to Canada before a new
government is installed.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Germany's chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, on
his first foreign trip, arrived in France Wednesday seeking to
dispel worries that his desire for closer ties with Britain could
whittle down Paris' role in Europe.
	   Schroeder warmly clasped hands with conservative President
Jacques Chirac in their first-ever meeting. The two exchanged a few
words in English and then a joke. The French leader laughed
heartily.
	   Schroeder arrived in a chauffeur-driven French limousine,
sitting next to foreign policy adviser Brigitte Sauzay, a former
interpreter for the late French President Francois Mitterrand.
	   Schroeder scheduled a news conference at the end of his visit.
	   The French-German axis was critical to building a stronger
European Union, including the euro single currency that takes
effect in January. The two countries are each other's largest
trading partners.
	   But Schroeder, whose weekend election victory spelled the end to
16 years of rule by conservative Chancellor Helmut Kohl, has caused
jitters in Paris because of his interest in better ties with
London.
	   In contrast with Kohl, who lived through World War II,
Schroeder, 54, represents a new generation of Germans that some
French officials feel will be less burdened by the past.
	   The Social Democrat, who speaks English but not French, was
expected to reaffirm his commitment to strong relations with France
during lunch with conservative Chirac and a meeting with Socialist
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.

German Social Democrats irked by toothpaste ad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Social Democrats weren't smiling about a
toothpaste ad appearing in newspapers Wednesday that takes
unauthorized advantage of chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's
winning smile.
	   The full-page ad for Perlweiss toothpaste includes a headshot of
Schroeder flashing his broad, toothy grin over the slogan ``He
showed them all.''
	   The Social Democrats general manager Franz Muentefering said the
party would send a complaint to the British firm that makes the
toothpaste, Carter-Woolis, and the German Advertising Council.
	   German law allows the unauthorized use of photos of public
figures for journalistic or satirical purposes, but not for
advertising, he said.
	   Muentefering said the party would not take legal action against
the firm unless it keeps running the ad.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher on
Wednesday led a team of medical specialists to Africa to help
victims of terrorist attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
	   ``We want to build on the long-term partnership that has existed
between our countries to help innocent Kenyans who suffered in the
bombing,'' Satcher said at a news conference.
	   ``At the same time, we want to help Kenya prepare to meet future
medical disasters, regardless of their cause.''
	   The bombings on Aug. 7 killed 259 people, including 12
Americans, and injured more than 5,500.
	   The U.S. team includes plastic surgeons with experience in
physical reconstruction, and a psychiatrist who worked in Oklahoma
City, where 168 people were killed in a bombing in 1995.
	   The team planned to leave Nairobi on Thursday for Dar es Salaam.
	   Besides meeting the immediate physical and emotional needs of
bombing victims, the United States will consider helping set up a
disaster response center in Kenya, Satcher said.
	   In addition to providing assistance using resources of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Satcher said he will
report to Congress on additional needs.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has requested dlrs 50 million in
emergency assistance funding from Congress for Tanzania and Kenya.
	   The U.S. government already has contributed dlrs 3.2 million in
assistance to the two countries.
	   On Friday, the Kenyan government planned to pay the first 32
death claims of 100,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 1,667) each.

Serbs deny massacre; Red Cross vehicle hits landmine, one killed

Red Cross vehicle hits landmine; INCORPORATES BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo
Massacre, BC-Yugoslavia-Red Cross; changes byline. No pick up &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police denied responsibility
Wednesday for the massacre of ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo,
but said they were investigating it ``based on press reports.''
	   The denial came after ethnic Albanians and at least one human
rights group assailed the Serbs in the deaths of 18 men, women and
children who were shot in the back of the head and mutilated.
	   Austria on Wednesday called for an international investigation.
	   The slaying of the victims, whose bodies were seen this week by
diplomats and journalists in a forest in the Drenica region west of
Pristina, have inflamed tensions in Kosovo.
	   In a separate incident Wednesday, an ethnic Albanian doctor was
killed and three other members of the International Committee of
the Red Cross, including one foreigner, were injured when their
vehicle hit a landmine.
	   The explosion occurred on the Donje Obriga-Likovac road, 30
kilometers (17 miles) west of Pristina, Serbian police and Red
Cross spokesman Roland Sidler in Geneva said.
	   One of the three injured victims was in serious condition, they
said.
	   The Serbs have been accused of hindering efforts to get outside
humanitarian aid to some of the estimated 275,000 people who have
been driven from their homes since the conflict in the separatist
province of Serbia exploded in February.
	   They also are accused of frequent attacks against civilians,
including the massacre which ethnic Albanians reported over the
weekend.
	   ``We rule out any possibility that our members did something
like this,'' Col. Bozidar Filic said. ``In that area, we had
clashes with terrorists and a number of them have been arrested.''
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch, whose staffers were in the
area, blamed the Serbs.
	   ``The massacre was clearly an attack on defenseless civilians
who were hiding in the woods,'' said Holly Cartner, executive
director of Human Rights Watch's European division. ``The Yugoslav
army and Serbian police are fighting a war against civilians, and
this is another sad example of the unspeakable atrocities being
committed against them.''
	   Both sides have been accused of massacres. Serbs have said that
at least 39 Serbs were tortured, mutilated and killed earlier this
month near Glodjane in western Kosovo after they were ``kidnapped
by the terrorists.''
	   There were no immediate reports of new fighting in Kosovo. The
status of the promised pullback of Yugoslav and Serb forces wasn't
clear.
	   Ethnic Albanians on Tuesday reported heavy Serb attacks south of
Pristina despite Serbs' claims they were moving men back to their
bases.
	   Filic said Kosovo had been calm since Tuesday and that police
units were continuing to withdraw, having established control over
roads.
	   He also repeated the call to Kosovo Albanians to surrender
weapons obtained through the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has
suffered a string of defeats in its fight against the Serbs. The
KLA is insisting on independence for Kosovo _ something world
leaders oppose for fear of the repercussions of another border
change in the volatile Balkans.

Zimbabwe post impressive score in third one-day cricket
</HEADLINE>
international

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe batsman Craig Wishart took a
fine century off the Indian bowlers Wednesday in the third and
final one day international of the series.
	   Zimbabwe closed their innings on 260.
	   His 102 almost doubled his previous best of 53 and he hit two
sixes and four fours in providing the foundation for Zimbabwe's
total of 260.
	   Wishart also formed a partnership of 113 with Andy Flower for
the third wicket, Flower making a bright contribution with 55,
including two sixes and three fours, at the Harare Sports Club.
	   The Zimbabwe innings started badly with the dismissal of skipper
Alistair Campbell by Debashish Mohanty with his fifth ball.
Campbell had high hopes of another big score after making 53 and 74
in his first two knocks against India but he was out for four.
	   Craig Evans and Gavin Rennie kept up the momentum lower down to
take Zimbabwe up to their highest score of the series and set India
a serious target.
	   This is Sachin Tendulkar's 200th one day international and all
eyes will be on him to turn it into an occasion in the afternoon.
He set a new record for centuries in internationals at Bulawayo on
Saturday, taking his total up to 18, more than anybody else in the
history of this form of cricket. It is, incidentally, India captain
Mohamad Azharuddin's 299th.
	   The Indian selectors brought in Mohanty and Sanghvi for this
match, the three match series already having been won, to give them
further match experience. Mohanty was steady, taking 1-38 in ten
overs but Sanghvi was severely punished, conceding 47 in six overs.

Agassi rolls over Pioline in 34 minutes

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Andre Agassi rolled over Cedric Pioline
6-0, 6-0 in only 34 minutes Wednesday to storm into the
quarterfinals of the dlrs 6.7 million Grand Slam Cup.
	   In the quickest match since the tournament's inception in 1990,
Pioline won only eight points in the first set and nine in the
second against an Agassi playing with amazing confidence.
	   Agassi was given a wild card to play in the tournament, which
nominally brings together players with best records in the year's
four Grand Slam events _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and
Wimbledon.
	   But three men's Grand Slam champions of the year have decided to
skip the tournament despite its huge prize money _ Wimbledon
champion and top-ranked Pete Sampras, U.S. Open champion Patrick
Rafter and Carlos Moya, the French Open champion.
	   Only Australian Open champion Petr Korda is among the 12 men
here.
	   ``Regardless of who is not here, this is still a great
tournament,'' Agassi said.
	   For his short work, Agassi earned dlrs 175,000. Even more
amazingly, Pioline picked up dlrs 100,000 given to first-round
losers _ without even winning a game and hardly breaking a sweat.
	   With the official scorecard giving the duration of the match at
34 minutes, it means Agassi made dlrs 5,147 a minute, while Pioline
made dlrs 2,941 a minute in his losing effort.
	   Agassi, ranked No. 8 in the world, hit winners from all over the
court from the start and the Frenchman never had a chance. Agassi
picked apart Pioline's serve with sizzling returns.
	   ``It was all kind of going my way,'' Agassi said. ``He tried
hard, he was hitting the ball decently.''
	   ``I stepped it up and I kept stepping it up. I can have a clean
swing at the ball here indoors,'' the American said. ``It's a great
surface for me, the ball travels fast but it has a slow bounce.''
	   Agassi, a former No. 1 who is making a comeback after dropping
out of the top 100, has won four titles this year. But his Grand
Slam record for the year is relatively poor: Round of 16 at the
Australian and the U.S. Open his best showing.
	   ``I've come here very prepared and I'll feel more satisfied I do
well since I got a wild card,'' said Agassi, a winner of three
Grand Slam titles in his career.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's half brother, who served as
Iraq's ambassador to the U.N. headquarters in Geneva, has refused
to return to Iraq after his diplomatic service ended last month,
Iraqi dissidents and Arab diplomats said Wednesday.
	   His defection would mark the second-biggest break in Saddam's
troubled family since the end of the 1991 Gulf War. Saddam's two
sons-in-law defected to Amman, Jordan, in 1995, only to be killed
upon their return to Iraq six months later.

EU, ACP countries open talks on new trade-aid accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union and 71 African,
Caribbean and Pacific countries on Wednesday launched delicate
negotiations to revise the Lome Convention, their 23-year old
trade-and-aid agreement.
	   The negotiations are expected to last around a year. The current
five-year agreement expires in 2000.
	   The EU wants to gradually replace the current system of trade
preferences with free trade accords with the more
economically-advanced regions or individual countries among the ACP
group.
	   Pressure for change is partly generated by the World Trade
Organization which has castigated the 15-nation EU for the current
accord, which it says violates fair competition rules by
privileging Europe's former colonies.
	   Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the EU commissioner in charge of
relations with the ACP group said free trade accords will help ACP
countries eradicate poverty more efficiently than the current
system of preferences.
	   But Barbados Foreign Minister Billie Miller, who co-chaired the
meeting with Pinheiro, insisted the system of trade preferences
remains crucial to those ACP countries still in their early stages
of development.
	   ``Preferential access in this context is intended not to be a
right available in perpetuity but rather a means of giving the ACP
states breathing space to grow,'' she said.
	   ``In other words, it has a development aspect which is
crucial.''
	   Pinheiro said the new accord should also focus on intensifying
political cooperation between the EU and ACP countries, and working
together on conflict prevention, in view of the ``extremely
worrying situation in many African countries.''
	   In 1996, 3.8 percent of the EU's total imports came from ACP
countries. Of these imports, 33.7 percent were agricultural goods.
	   The share of the EU's total exports to ACP countries was only 3
percent, according to Eurostat, the EU's official statistics
agency.
	   But the ACP countries rely heavily on trade with the EU, since
some 45 percent of exports from these countries go to the EU.
	   The Lome Convention was first set up in 1975.

Former Arsenal manager in talks with Spurs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Having once guided Arsenal to two league
title triumphs, George Graham could be in charge of north London
rival Tottenham in time for Saturday's game against Derby.
	   Graham's current club, Leeds United, Wednesday gave Spurs
permission to negotiate a deal with the 53-year-old Scot who has
been at Elland Road for three seasons but has said he'd prefer a
move back to London.
	   Graham, a standout player with Arsenal in the early 1970s,
gained great success as a manager at Highbury before leaving under
a cloud in 1995.
	   He received a world-wide ban from soccer for taking a kickback
from a Norwegian agent over a transfer deal and took up the Leeds
job when after the ban ended in the summer of '96.
	   Last season he guided Leeds to fifth place in the Premier League
and a berth in the UEFA Cup. Leeds gained the UEFA Cup second round
Tuesday by ousting Maritimo of Portugal after a penalty shootout
and club owner Peter Ridsdale announced the latest development on
Graham's likely move to Tottenham when the team touched down at
Leeds airport.
	   ``I can confirm that we have come to an arrangement with
Tottenham Hotspur whereby they have agreed to pay compensation in
line with the contract that George Graham signed last December,''
Ridsdale said.
	   ``I have spoken to George and he has asked for permission to
talk to Tottenham, therefore we have given George Graham that
permission to speak with them.
	   ``At the moment George is still our manager until somebody tells
me otherwise. But we now have to anticipate that we will go into
Saturday's game (at home to Leicester) without him.''
	   A move to Tottenham would spice up relations between Spurs and
Arsenal even more than usual. In recent years, Tottenham followers
have been jealous of Arsenal's success, especially the two league
titles under Graham in 1989 and '91 and the Cup Winners Cup triumph
in '94.
	   The Gunners also won the league and FA Cup titles last season
under French coach Arsene Wenger and Spurs, who went close to
relegation last season, have not lifted the league title since 1961
and the FA Cup since '91.
	   ``I am obviously delighted that we have been given permission to
speak to George,'' Spurs owner Alan Sugar said Wednesday.
	   ``It has taken us a long time just to get to this position, so I
don't want to get carried away.
	   ``But I would imagine that we will get round a table sometime
tomorrow, probably in the morning, and hopefully we can sort out a
deal.''

Mogadishu warlord praises Gadafi; says diplomats safe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OSMAN WEHELIYE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ North Mogadishu warlord Ali Mahdi
Mohamed praised Libyan leader Moamar Gadhafi Wednesday at a
luncheon celebrating his 30 years in power and called for an end to
the U.N. air embargo against Libya.
	   Ali Mahdi, who joined forces with Gen. Mahamed Farah Aidid in
1991 to oust Mohamed Siad Barre, plunging Somalia into civil
conflict and famine, called the Libyan leader a hero and a brother
to the Arab world.
	   He dismissed an ultimatum Tuesday by leaders of six splinter
factions in the capital that the Libyan and Egptian envoys must
leave Mogadishu by Thursday, saying they do not represent the
wishes of the Somali people.
	   The warlord of North Mogadishu said under a new joint
administration backed by his fighters and those loyal to Hussein
Mohamed Aidid, the late general's son, the city now has enough
police to protect diplomats.
	   Although there has been no central government in Somalia since
1991, Libya, Egypt and Sudan have maintained diplomatic
representatives in Mogadishu.
	   Hussein Hajji Bod, former deputy chairman of Ali Mahdi's
faction, on Tuesday accused the Egyptian and Libyan envoys of
backing Ali Mahdi and Aidid to the detriment of other opposed to
them, including his own.
	   Libyan envoy Saeed Sabir hosted several hundred senior
politicians and warlords at the luncheon and said he was not
leaving.
	   Hussein Hajji Bod and the other splinter faction leaders don't
recognize the new joint administration. Observers say it is mainly
because they do not stand to benefit from it economically.
	   Several African leaders, including Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, Chadian President Idriss Deby and Niger President Ibrahim
Bare Menassara flew to Libya in defiance of the air embargo to
congratulate Gadhafi on the anniversary.

Lesotho security stable, Nigeria-Britain resume flights, Kaunda

case &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Most of Lesotho's soldiers had returned
to their bases Wednesday for registration and possible return to
duty, following a mutiny earlier this month that led to last week's
South Africa-led intervention.
	   Precisely how many still were away without official leave, and
thus presumed to be rebels, is unclear because there apparently is
no up-to-date roster, the South African Press Association reported.
	   The Royal Lesotho Defense Force was estimated by officials to
have between 2,000 and 3,000 members.
	   Those who disobeyed the order to return to base were said to be
hiding in the villages and mountains, and were regarded as
dangerous. There still is gunfire at night near the main base,
Makoanyane, police commissioner Bolutu Makoaba said.
	   Officials were compiling an official tally of the dead so their
families may be notified. A total 58 soldiers _ plus nine from
South Africa _ were reported killed.
	   However, the Lesotho total may be higher as rebels who resisted
the South Africans apparently took injured or fallen comrades with
them into hiding.
	   Rival parties were to meet Friday at U.N. headquarters in Maseru
to attempt to resolve political divisions that stem from last May's
national elections, and which underlie the military unrest.
	   -----
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian Airways will resume flights to
Britain beginning in November as part of a new agreement with
British Airways, spokesmen for both airlines said.
	   The accord was signed Tuesday in the commercial capital Lagos by
senior administrators from both airlines.
	   Beginning Nov. 4, flights from Lagos will land at London's
Heathrow Airport three times per week, Nigeria Airways Managing
Director Jani Ibrahim told reporters.
	   ``We very much look forward to operating this new service in
cooperation with Nigeria Airways and providing customers with an
improved choice of services between London and Lagos,'' said
British Airways representative David Noyes.
	   Last year, air links between the two countries were severed
after Britain banned all Nigerian-registered aircraft from flying
into London for not complying with safety standards. Nigeria
responded by barring British flights into Lagos.
	   -----
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Army chiefs Wednesday wrapped up a two-day
meeting on the threats to regional security. They declined to
reveal their conclusions.
	   The Southern African Development Community's military heads
gathered in the Angolan capital against the backdrop of Congo's
civil war, Angola's faltering peace process, and Lesotho's military
mutiny.
	   ``If these conflicts aren't resolved promptly, they could rock
our whole region, seriously affecting our much desired social and
economic development,'' Angola's Defense Minister Pedro Sebastiao
said.
	   Most of Congo's nine neighbors have taken sides in the country's
nine-week conflict between President Laurent Kabila and the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition.
	   In Angola, a four-year-old peace process has been delayed by
deepening hostility between President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and
Jonas Savimbi, the leader of former rebel group UNITA.
	   More recently, Lesotho has agreed to discuss the disputes that
led to a miltary mutiny and a bloody intervention by neighboring
South Africa a week ago.
	   The army chiefs' next meeting was scheduled for November.
	   -----
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ The state-appointed Human Rights
Commission said Wednesday it will investigate the wounding,
allegedly by police, of former president Kenneth Kaunda and another
opposition leader.
	   The two were shot two years ago during a rally which police
broke up.
	   Judge Lombe Chibesakunda, head of the commission, said Wednesday
her organization was seeking about 65 million kwacha (dlrs 35,000)
from the government and private donors to carry out a public
inquiry.
	   She said the inquiry can only begin when the money is made
available.
	   Kaunda, 73, shot in the arm, accused the government of planning
to assassinate him, a charge the government denied.
	   Earlier this year Kaunda retired from opposition politics after
being cleared of involvement in a failed military coup by junior
military officers. He led the nation to independence from Britain
in 1964 and ruled until the first democratic elections in 1991.
	   ______
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ The government said it scrapped a deal
with a Malaysian firm to build a 300-room hotel in the commercial
capital of Blantyre.
	   The state Malawi Development Corp. said instead the hotel will
be built by Zimbabwe and South African investors.
	   Elvas Kadzako, head of MDC, told reporters the regional
investors will build a total of four new hotels in Malawi.
	   One of the hotels will be built at the at the tourist attraction
of Cape Maclear on the shores of Lake Malawi.

Council of Europe visitors denied visas for media conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with conference being canceled, CORRECTS name of body
to Council of Europe.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A conference on media freedom was
canceled Wednesday after Serbian authorities refused to issue visas
to several Council of Europe officials due to attend the
conference, organizers said.
	   ``The act signaled a new government clampdown on free speech and
a continuation of this regime's persistent stifling of fledgling
independent media,'' said Veran Matic, manager of the Association
of Independent Electronic Media.
	   The international conference, entitled ``Broadcasting for a
Democratic Europe,'' sponsored by the Council of Europe, was due to
begin this Friday.
	   It was to be first of its kind in Serbian capital Belgrade.
	   Visas were withheld for as many as 18 Council of Europe visitors
and eight of these had their visa applications refused outright,
Matic said. Most were British or Dutch citizens.
	   The association addressed a complaint to the ministry of
interior but was referred to ministry of information were they were
unable to obtain any explanations.
	   ``It goes to show the full hypocrisy of the regime _ while
proclaiming to want membership to the Council of Europe, it
harasses independent media and stifles the very principles the
Council stands for,'' Matic said
	   Foreign reporters and employees of humanitarian agencies have
also reported long and unexplained delays in trying to get visas.
	   ``We decided the situation compelled us to cancel this landmark
conference rather than host a partial one,'' Matic told reporters
later Wednesday.

Jamaica: Caribbean islands depend on world's fragile ecosystem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Many island nations, _ especially in the
Caribbean _ link their survival and development to the maintenance
of the world's fragile ecosystem, Jamaica's deputy prime minister
said Wednesday.
	   The Caribbean islands ``are continually subject to the pressures
of urbanization and resource exploitation; to the pollution of
their coastal waters; to the threat of natural disasters,'' Seymour
Mullings told the U.N. General Assembly in a speech advocating
protection of oceans and seabeds.
	   ``We are endangered by the threat of sea-level rise and face the
destruction of our coral reefs,'' he said.
	   The danger of natural disasters was brought home most recently
by Hurricane Georges, which caused ``widespread loss of life and
property'' in Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican
Republic, Haiti and St. Kitts and Nevis, Mullings said.
	   ``We take this opportunity to appeal to the international
community to provide urgent and generous humanitarian assistance
and support of the reconstruction of our sister Caribbean states,''
he said.
	   Mulling also applauded the efforts of the International Seabed
Authority, which manages deep sea mining. The agency, based in
Kingston, Jamaica, ``continues to make progress on the negotiation
of a mining code,'' he said.
	   Created by the 1994 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, ISA
regulates the use of seabed resources in international waters,
where millions of tons of cobalt, manganese, copper and other
metals lie under the ocean floor.

Rodal's coach admits relationship with female athlete
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with five grafs to UPDATE with Husby saying relationship
was not sexual, CHANGES overline to reflect &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The coach fired by Olympic gold medalist
Vebjorn Rodal in a sexual misconduct flap has admitted having
intimate relations with a young female runner on his team, a
newspaper said Wednesday.
	   Kjell Arve Husby was fired by the Oppdal Athletics Club and by
Rodal, who won the 800-meter gold medal at the 1996 Olympics, after
athletes accused Husby of improper conduct. Husby also faces a
police investigation.
	   In an interview published in the Oslo newspaper Aften on
Wednesday, Husby admitted having an intimate relationship in
November with a 24-year-old woman he coached.
	   ``I made a mistake, and allowed the woman to get too close,''
the 51-year-old coach was quoted as saying. ``It was a situation
she wanted as much as I did, and something we squared up
afterwards.''
	   At a news conference later Wednesday, Husby said the
relationship was not sexual, the Norwegian state radio network
reported from the west coast city of Bergen.
	   Eight members of the local athletics club in Oppdal, 500
kilometers (300 miles) north of Oslo, quit the team last month,
saying in a letter to the club's board that they could no longer
work with Husby.
	   ``Several of the female athletes have felt great discomfort in
what we experienced as physical and sexual approaches by the
coach,'' they said in the letter, according to the newspaper.
	   Husby coached Rodal for more than a decade. During the period,
Rodal took gold at the Atlanta Olympics, silver in the 1994
European Athletics Championships, and bronze in the 1995 World
Championships.
	   Rodal said he had no personal grievances against about Husby,
but felt he could not continue working with him following the
allegations.
	   Police opened an investigation against Husby on Tuesday, which
the coach's lawyer said would help clear up misunderstandings and
rumors.

Iran begins war games near the Afghan border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian armed forces began their first stage
of military exercises near Afghanistan on Wednesday in a move that
could heighten tension along their border.
	   Armored and infantry units advanced toward imaginary enemy
positions after the army laid down artillery fire, Iranian
television reported, showing footage of the exercises.
	   The maneuvers, code named Zulfaqar 2, are the second to be held
this month and come amid tension with Afghanistan's Taliban
militia.
	   Taliban fighters killed nine Iranian diplomats and an Iranian
journalist after capturing the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban, which rule about 90 percent of Afghanistan, said
that renegade fighters killed the Iranians, but its leaders have
refused Iranian demands to hand over the killers. They accuse Iran
of backing Afghanistan's northern-based opposition alliance.
	   Taliban leaders say they have moved 20,000 troops to the border
in response to Iran's war games.
	   In all, some 200,000 troops will take part in the Iranian
exercises, which will cover a 50,000-square kilometer (20,000
square-mile) area in eastern Iran.

Report: Crashed El Al cargo jet carried raw material for deadly
</HEADLINE>
sarin gas &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ An Israeli El Al cargo jet that
crashed in Amsterdam six years ago was carrying chemicals used to
produce the deadly sarin nerve gas, a Dutch newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The plane was carrying 190 liters (50 gallons) of the chemical
identified as dimethyl methylphosphonate when it crashed into an
apartment block outside Amsterdam in 1992, according the respected
national daily NRC Handelsblad.
	   Citing a freight document, the newspaper said the chemical came
from an American company in Pennsylvania and was headed for the
Israel Institute for Biological Research in Ness Ziona near Tel
Aviv.
	   The U.S. company was identified as Solkatronic Chemicals Inc. in
Morrisville, Pa.
	   A copy of the document was printed on the front page of the
newspaper, which did not say how it acquired the document.
	   Nearly six years after the accident, controversies still
surround the plane's cargo, despite repeated investigations.
	   Ahead of the report, the Dutch parliament announced Thursday it
will launch a parliamentary inquiry into the accident.
	   According to NRC, the amount of dimethyl methylphosphonate on
board was enough to produce up to 270 kilograms (594 pounds) of the
nerve gas.
	   The raw material is also used in building materials as a flame
retardant.
	   Four main components are needed for the production of sarin and
three of them were on board the El Al jet, said the daily.
	   The newspaper said it was not clear whether the burning of these
chemicals following the accident was to blame for health complaints
by residents near the crash site.
	   The Boeing 747-200 crashed into an apartment complex in southern
Amsterdam on Oct. 4, 1992, killing at least 43 people.
	   Israeli officials said earlier the plane did not carry any
dangerous materials.
	   A spokesman for the Dutch Transport Ministry declined comment on
the report, saying all the details concerning the plane's cargo
were announced previously.

Zimbabwe wins third ODI

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Zimbabwe victory and close of Indian innings.

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A century by Zimbabwe opening batsman
Craig Wishart and failures by top India batsmen Sachin Tendulkar
and Mohamad Azharuddin were the main reasons why the home side won
the third one-day international of a three-match series Wednesday.
	   India had already won the first two so except for individual
performances at the Harare Sports Club it was all academic.
	   But the victory by Zimbabwe at least gives them heart ahead of
the one-off Test which starts in Harare on October 8.
	   Wishart's 102 was easily his highest score in this form of
cricket, almost doubling his previous best of 53. He hit two sixes
and four fours and used 122 balls. Zimbabwe went on to achieve a
total of 260 to set a tough target for the Indians. Andy Flower
weighed in with a confident 55.
	   The Indian fielding was better than in the second city of
Bulawayo last weekend, but none of the bowlers posed a serious
threat to the Zimbabweans.
	   Tendulkar, playing in his 200th international and determined to
make an impact with it, instead fell for just two runs, caught at
mid-wicket by Craig Evans off Heath Streak.
	   Azharuddin came in and very soon went out again, also scoring
just two. Some gallant efforts at recovery came from Robin Singh in
particular with 57 in 66 balls and from Rahul Dravid and Nayan
Mongia.
	   But Zimbabwe always had the upper hand. At the half-way mark of
25 overs India needed seven an over for victory and at 40 overs
they needed nine an over.
	   It was a lost cause and Zimbabwe mopped up the tail in the 48th
over.

EU: Finland in line with euro stability, growth pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Wednesday
Finland's economic and budgetary policies meet the stability and
growth requirements laid down for it and 10 other EU nations that
will switch to a single currency in January.
	   The Finnish government's objective of a budgetary surplus of 2.3
percent of gross domestic product in 2002 ``would create a
sufficient safety margin against the effects of cyclical
variations,'' the Commission said in a statement.
	   It said Finland's budgetary policies ``are expected to deliver a
surplus in 1998 which should rise to over 2 percent between now and
2002.''
	   However, it called for continued budgetary consolidation efforts
by the Finnish government to face rising expenditure pressures due
to the aging of the population.
	   Finland's debt to GDP ratio, which the Commission said is safely
below the maximum 60-percent ceiling laid down for euro membership,
is expected to fall to about 43 percent by 2002.
	   Finland is one of 11 European Union nations adopting the euro
next year.

Moroccan debt main issue on agenda in Paris talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ Moroccan Prime Minister Abderrahmane
Youssoufi begins a two-day visit to Paris on Thursday during which
the country's debt repayments are expected to top the agenda.
	   It will be Youssoufi's first visit to France since taking office
earlier this year. French and Moroccan officials hold bi-annual
summits. The last was held in Rabat in December 1997.
	   Youssoufi said recently the country's global debt was ``an
enormous burden'' for the North African country.
	   Morocco currently has debt estimated at dlrs 19 billion,
equivalent to almost 60 percent of the country's growth domestic
product.
	   Finance Minister Fathallah Oualalou, in an interview published
Wednesday by French newspaper La Croix, said debt repayments eat up
one third of the national budget.
	   He said 17 percent of that debt was with France, and noted that
French interest rates are higher than those charged by other
creditors.
	   ``Morocco will never see the end of it if we don't manage to
ease the pressure of the debt,'' Oualalou was quoted as saying.
	   During his visit, Youssoufi will meet with French President
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, as well as other
officials.

EU Truckers, management talks fail; EU to legislate working
</HEADLINE>
conditions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Wednesday
it plans to propose legislation covering working conditions for the
trucking industry after talks between unions and management broke
down earlier in the day.
	   ``We are very disappointed with the breakdown of these talks and
will now come forward with a package of our own measures,'' said EU
spokeswoman Barbara Nolan.
	   The EU transport ministers will have an opportunity to assess
the way forward on Thursday at a previously scheduled meeting in
Luxembourg.
	   On Wednesday, truckers unions and management missed a deadline
to conclude a deal on working conditions _ notably limiting driving
time. Disagreements about that have led to protest actions and
strikes by truckers in several EU nations in the past year.
	   The EU head office has urged both sides to approve a draft
agreement limiting average working hours for truck and coach
drivers to 45 hours a week.
	   Current EU legislation limits the time the drivers should spend
at the wheel, but does not include time spent on other work such as
loading and unloading trucks or cleaning and maintenance of
vehicles.
	   Nolan said the EU Commission will now draft proposals to extend
social legislation to the transport sector.
	   Truckers in France have been most insistent about their working
conditions. Last November, a strike disrupted France and traffic
with neighboring nations for five days, and in 1996 they stopped
work for 12 days.

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Several hundred demonstrators
gathered on Vladivostok's main square Wednesday to protest the
city's mayoral elections, which remain unresolved four days after
voters went to the polls.
	   Carrying placards and posters, the crowd of primarily
middle-aged and elderly protesters called for an investigation into
why incumbent Mayor Viktor Cherepkov's name was struck from
election ballots at the last moment.
	   Preliminary results show that a majority of voters rejected all
12 remaining candidates.
	   Protestors also demanded the resignation of regional Gov.
Yevgeny Nazdratenko and several other officials, including the
regional and local election commission chiefs.
	   A city court ruled last Thursday that Cherepkov could not run
because he had illegally paid for his campaign with city money.
City official Vladimir Murashov was also barred, in his case
because of anti-Semitic statements.
	   City Electoral Commission officials were still counting ballots
from the election, held Sunday.
	   If preliminary results stand up to legal scrutiny, new elections
will be called within four months, as required by law.
	   Official results from the election are expected Oct. 1, as is a
ruling from the regional Supreme Court on an emergency appeal by
the City Electoral Commission and a lawyer for Cherepkov on the
legality of Cherepkov's disqualification.

Congolese rebels say they captured eastern town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels said Wednesday they had
captured the town of Punia on the way to the key air base at Kindu,
a target of their two-month rebellion.
	   Punia is 310 kilometers (192 miles) west of rebel stronghold at
Goma, and 180 kilometers (110 miles) north of Kindu, troops loyal
to President Laurent Kabila had been reportedly reinforced by
troops from Sudan and rebels fighting the governments of Uganda and
Rwanda.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claim.
	   Rebel spokesmen said their forces had pushed to within 25
kilometers (15 miles) south of Punia in the direction of Kindu, but
that muddy roads were slowing their advance.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members
of Kabila's army and political opponents _ took up arms Aug. 2,
accusing Kabila of corruption and division among Congo's 400 ethnic
groups.
	   They were beaten back from the outskirts of the capital,
Kinshasa, by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of sponsoring the revolt.
	   Since losing the battle for Kinshasa, rebel forces have been
contained in the eastern third of the country. They are trying to
take Kindu because aircraft belonging to Kabila's allies use the
base from which to bomb rebel positions.
	   Bizima Karaha, a rebel leader, said rebel forces had taken
prisoner the Sudanese soldiers and Ugandan and Rwandan rebels, who
were apparently sent to bolster the defense of the town.
	   Sudan denies the accusation.
	   On Wednesday, the Ugandan government-owned daily New Vision
reported that Taban Amin, one of the sons of exiled dictator Idi
Amin Dada, was commanding a group of Ugandan rebels in Kindu.
	   Rebels from the West Nile Bank Front, which include former Amin
fighters, have been launching sporadic attacks against Uganda from
bases in southern Sudan and northeastern Congo.
	   The conflict in Congo has drawn in most of the African nation's
nine neighbors.
	   On Tuesday, Congolese Information Minister Didier Mumengi said
in Kinshasa that troops from Chad had joined the government forces.

Kazak president proposes political reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BIRGIT BRAUER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASTANA, Kazakstan (AP) _ The president of Kazakstan promised an
anti-corruption campaign and measures to strengthen political
parties in his annual address to the country on Wednesday.
	   ``The choice before us is clear: reform or regress, streamline
or stagnate, democracy or decay,'' President Nursultan Nazarbayev
told lawmakers and foreign diplomats listening to his speech in
parliament.
	   ``We must continue to build a modern Kazakstan or slide into
chaos,'' he said.
	   Nazarbayev said he would mount a vigorous campaign against
corruption in all levels of government, which he said was hindering
business and discouraging foreign investment in the former Soviet
republic in Central Asia.
	   He said he would create an anti-corruption agency to be headed
by a well-known and trusted national figure.
	   An anti-corruption law adopted a few months ago has led to the
arrest of more than 300 people, including regional governors,
judges and other officials, he said.
	   In addition, Nazarbayev recently fired a local governor for
``violating the norms of official etiquette.'' Transportation
Minister Yerkin Kaliyev resigned after being investigated for
flying free on the national airline, Air Kazakstan.
	   ``Believe me, I'm talking about people with whom from the human
point of view it was very difficult for me to part,'' Nazarbayev
said of the officials who had been arrested. ``But there should be
no exceptions.''
	   Nazarbayev also said he has submitted a list of proposed
constitutional amendments to parliament to increase democracy and
the role of political parties before the next legislative elections
are held in December 1999.
	   The proposals include increasing the number of seats in the
lower house of parliament, the Mazhilis, to 77 from 67, allowing
candidates to indicate their political affiliation on the ballots
and dropping the requirement for a 50 percent voter turnout to
validate elections.
	   Several lawmakers urged Nazarbayev to move up the next
presidential election from 2000 to 1999, so that it does not
coincide with Russia's presidential election, but he refused.
	   ``We don't want to depend on the election result in Russia,''
said lawmakers Anvar Batalov. ``But above all, we want to decide
all political questions in this century.''
	   After his speech, Nazarbayev told a news conference he would
soon send parliament a draft law on private land ownership, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Land will be sold only to Kazak citizens who have an
agricultural education and farming experience, he said.
	   Nazarbayev also told reporters that other countries should be
interested in restoring stability to Russia.
	   ``Russia is a very large country. It has immense influence on
other countries. Stabilization in Russia is needed by all of us,
including its close neighbors, Europe and the rest of the world.''

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Britain and Austria called Wednesday
for an international investigation into what one official described
as the ``bestial'' massacre of ethnic Albanian men, women and
children in a Kosovo forest.
	   Even as outrage mounted over the slayings of as many as 18
people who were shot in the back of the head and mutilated, reports
emerged of a second killing spree last weekend, in which residents
of a nearby village claimed Serbs executed at least 13 men.
	   Residents of Golubovac, 35 kilometers (21 miles) west of
Pristina, said the victims were already buried, but pointed to
saucer-sized pools of dried blood and empty cartridges in front of
a fence where they said most of the refugees were shot.
	   ``They pointed to the men and took them to beside my house,''
said Naim Hodzaj, a 53-year-old farmer. ``They shot them all.''
	   The mass killings last weekend in the Drenica region, where
Serb-led forces were on their latest offensive against ethnic
Albanian rebels, are among the most gruesome developments reported
in eight months of all-out fighting in the separatist province of
Serbia.
	   There was no way to corroborate the ethnic Albanians' accounts.
Both sides have been accused of massacres in Kosovo, and Serb
police denied responsibility for the killings in nearby Obrija,
eight kilometers (five miles) north of Golubovac.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency called Western reports a
``media farce,'' and said the Obrija killing was staged to generate
more pressure on Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   In yet another part of Kosovo, the Vucitrn area northwest of
Pristina, Britain's Foreign Office said international monitors also
reported finding the bodies of 17 Albanians killed in fighting.
	   International officials were appalled by the killings of
civilians.
	   Austria, which holds the European Union presidency, called on
the EU to begin an investigation. Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel cited the ``bestial circumstances of this massacre,
certainly the killing of women and children.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said there was no
justification for the use of violence against civilians. He said
the Contact Group countries _ the United States, Britain, Germany,
France, Italy and Russia _ would meet Friday in London to find
``the way forward on a political settlement.''
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO officials said the Alliance was
unlikely to decide whether to launch attacks against the Serbs
until U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan presents a report to the
Security Council next week. The council has demanded an end to the
fighting and threatened unspecified, further measures if its order
is ignored.
	   Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain have offered
jetfighters for any NATO operation to enforce the council order.
Britain said it has four Harrier jets in Italy and four more on
standby if needed. NATO officials said U.S. cruise missiles were
ready for action in the Balkans.
	   There were no new reports about fighting or pullbacks by Serb
forces, who promised earlier this week to retreat to their barracks
after claiming victory over the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   A Serb police spokesman said police units were continuing to
withdraw, having established control over roads. Only occasional
gunshots could be heard in Drenica.
	   In a separate incident Wednesday, an ethnic Albanian doctor was
killed and three other members of the International Committee of
the Red Cross, including one foreigner _ a nurse from New Zealand _
were injured when their vehicle hit a landmine.
	   The explosion occurred on the Donje Obrinje-Likovac road, 30
kilometers (18 miles) west of Pristina, Serbian police and Red
Cross spokesman Roland Sidler in Geneva said.
	   The Serbs have been accused of hindering efforts to get outside
humanitarian aid to some of the estimated 275,000 people who have
been driven from their homes since the conflict exploded in
February.
	   In Golubovac, Hodzaj said that in addition to the executions,
Serb police had killed several other men individually, including
his 37-year-old brother Ramadan, who was doused with gasoline and
set on fire.
	   His brother's body lay curled up on a path on the edge of the
woods. The torso was badly burned but the legs and head were
untouched.
	   The slayings of the Obrija victims, whose bodies were seen this
week by diplomats and journalists in a Drenica forest, inflamed
tensions in Kosovo. Some were carved up with knives, limbs hacked
off; a 10-year-old boy had his throat slit.
	   ``We rule out any possibility that our members did something
like this,'' Serb police Col. Bozidar Filic said. ``In that area,
we had clashes with terrorists and a number of them have been
arrested.''
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch, whose staffers were in the
area, blamed the Serbs.
	   ``The massacre was clearly an attack on defenseless civilians
who were hiding in the woods,'' said Holly Cartner, executive
director of Human Rights Watch's European division. ``The Yugoslav
army and Serbian police are fighting a war against civilians, and
this is another sad example of the unspeakable atrocities being
committed against them.''

Utility cuts power to trams, halting public transportation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ The primary means of public
transportation in this Pacific port city ground to a halt for a
second day Wednesday after the regional energy utility shut off
power to the city's tramways.
	   Residents along the city's main boulevards resorted to either
walking or using taxis, minibuses or private cars. The city's
system of trolley buses, which operate on other streets, continued
to operate, although the utility has threatened to shut off
electricity to them as well.
	   The municipal Tram-Trolley Administration owes a total of 32.5
million rubles (dlrs 2 million) to the regional utility, Dalenergo.
The debts date to mid-1997.
	   Dalenergo said it would continue to provide electricity to the
city's tramways only during morning and evening rush hours. Earlier
this year, Dalenergo shut off electricity to the city's trolley bus
lines for non-payment of electricity bills.
	   ``If we were obeying the laws of any market economy, we would
have turned off electricity a long time ago. But we can't do that
in a city the size of Vladivostok. The electrical infrastructure
here is a mess,'' a Dalenergo spokesman was quoted as saying by the
Vladivostok News.

Iraq says it was obliged to cut cooperation with inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Iraq calling on UN chief to
personally supervise comprehensive review; speech delivered, minor
changes in quotes to reflect official translation. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister compared the
effects of 8-year-old U.N. sanctions against his country to
genocide Wednesday and called for a denunciation of countries who
insist on retaining the sanctions.
	   Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf didn't specifically name the United
States in his speech to the General Assembly. But he harshly
criticized the U.N. Special Commission, which carries out weapons
inspections in Iraq, and its chairman as working only on behalf of
one ``arrogant, powerful state,'' to keep the sanctions in place _
a clear reference to Washington.
	   That undue influence, al-Sahaf said, forced Iraq to stop
cooperating with inspectors last month ``because insisting on this
dead-end path ... can only lead to the continuation of the blockade
against the people of Iraq, which is unacceptable,'' he said.
	   He condemned countries who ``who insist, for ulterior political
motives, on continuing to inflict on the people of Iraq this
destructive blockade, a blockade parallel in its tragic
consequences to the internationally proscribed acts of genocide,''
he said.
	   Inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, must
certify Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles and chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons programs before the Security Council
will lift sanctions that were imposed after Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   The sanctions prevent Iraq from selling its most valuable
commodity _ oil _ on the open market.
	   Al-Sahaf said Iraq has cooperated fully with U.N. resolutions
demanding it destroy its weapons of mass destruction. ``However,
the blockade has not so far been lifted, thus rendering the
continuation of cooperation both meaningless and useless,'' he
said.
	   Al-Sahaf welcomed efforts by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
seek an end to the impasse by conducting a ``comprehensive review''
of Iraq's progress over the last seven years to disarm itself.
	   Such a review could force the council to recognize the steps
Iraq has taken to dismantle its proscribed weapons programs and
could increase pressure for some easing of sanctions.
	   Al-Sahaf called for Annan to personally supervise the review and
ensure that it is bound by a clearly defined timetable and not ``to
be an aimless process with no end in sight.''
	   ``While we support carrying out such a comprehensive review in
an objective, fair and impartial manner, we reaffirm Iraq's right
to expect the Security Council to proceed to take action to lift
the inhumane sanctions imposed on the people of Iraq for eight
years in a row,'' al-Sahaf concluded.
	   ``The people and leadership of Iraq will accept no less than
that.''
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is in New York this week,
meeting with members of the council and Annan to try to work out
details of the comprehensive review.
	   The council has said that no such review would take place before
Iraq rescinds its Aug. 5 announcement that it was halting
cooperation with inspectors. The decision has paralyzed searches
because U.N. weapons experts must be accompanied by Iraqi escorts.
	   Aziz told reporters on Monday that the council must make the
first move by accepting the comprehensive review, but has shown a
more conciliatory line to council members and the U.N. chief
himself in closed meetings, diplomats have said.

Government stock holdings to be disclosed in late October
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new final graf to UPDATE with motion in legislature. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government will disclose in late October
the massive stock and futures holdings it accumulated in an
unprecedented buying spree aimed at driving out market speculators,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Its holdings will be disclosed by an independent company
established by the government to manage securities it bought in
late August, Acting Financial Secretary Rafael Hui told a news
conference.
	   Exchange Fund Investment Ltd. will manage the estimated U.S.
dlrs 15 billion of stocks and futures the government bought in its
market foray, aimed at driving up share prices to levels at which
speculators, who bet the market would fall, were stuck with huge
losses.
	   The government claimed victory and later introduced a series of
regulations to restrict speculative activity and stabilize the
markets.
	   Officials have not yet disclosed its holdings because existing
regulations on disclosure do not apply to the government. They said
any premature disclosure could wreak further havoc in the markets
and that they would disclose the details only after speculators
have left the Hong Kong markets.
	   Most analysts believe the government has spent at least 15
percent of its U.S. dlrs 96 billion in reserves. Reserves fell 4.6
percent to dlrs 92.1 billion at the end of August, but the drop may
not reflect transactions made but not settled by that time.
	   Hui said the new company will be subject to all the regulations
of private companies, but gave little further detail about the
company's board members or finances.
	   He added the company will not be engaged in active stock
trading, ``to avoid giving the wrong impression that the government
continues to operate in the stock market indirectly through the new
company.''
	   Hui also reiterated that the government intends to hold the
shares as a long-term investment, but said the company will enter
the market when it sees ``value-added opportunities for the
eventual disposal of shares.''
	   After the government intervened in the markets, economists,
analysts and politicians sharply criticized the move, saying it
damaged Hong Kong's reputation as a free market and wasted
taxpayers' money.
	   Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the de
facto central bank, said the government had not bought any shares
in September.
	   Late Wednesday, the legislature defeated a motion put forth by
the Democratic Party to review the monetary authority, with members
and Hui arguing it was unecessary and would send the wrong message
to the international community, government-run Radio Hong Kong
reported.

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Britain calling emergency meeting of U.N.
Security Council &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Wednesday
called an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to condemn
the massacre of ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav region of Kosovo.
	   ``This was not an act of war, it was plain cold murder,'' Cook
said at a press briefing at the Labor Party conference in
Blackpool.
	   Cook said Thursday's meeting would request an urgent report from
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on whether Serbia had complied
with last week's Security Council resolution that called for a
cease-fire in Kosovo, a withdrawal of Serbian troops, and the start
of ``serious dialogue on real autonomy'' for the province.
	   Mr Cook said NATO airstrikes could follow the receipt of Annan's
report early next week.
	   ``Military action will flow from a political decision,'' he
said.

	   Britain takes over the presidency of the Security Council on
Thursday.
	   A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking on customary
anonymity, said Blair had talked Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright who ``shares our sense of outrage'' over
the violence.
	   Earlier, Cook had announced that senior representatives from the
six so-called Contact Group countries _ the United States, Britain,
Germany, France, Italy and Russia _ would meet here Friday to find
``the way forward on a political settlement'' for Kosovo.
	   Despite assurances from the Yugoslav government that its
offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists is over, Cook said
the fighting continues.
	   On Sunday, the group Human Rights Watch reported 18 ethnic
Albanians were slaughtered in the forest near Obrija village in the
Drenica region northwest of Pristina.
	   Britain's Foreign Office said international monitors also
reported finding the bodies of 17 Albanians killed in fighting in
the Vucitern area.
	   ``I am appalled by these reports of massacres of civilians,
including women and children,'' Cook said. ``There is no
justification for any violence against the civilian population in
Kosovo.''
	   Cook asked for an independent forensic examination of both
massacres, and urged the International Criminal Tribunal for
Yugoslavia to extend its investigations to include these sites.
	   Serbs began cracking down in February on Albanian separatists
who are fighting for independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia. Since then, hundreds of people have been
killed and an estimated 275,000 have been driven from their homes
in the province, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.

Explosion goes off near border police jeep; two seriously wounded

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An explosion went off Wednesday next to
an Israeli border police jeep in downtown Hebron, injuring nine
Israelis and 11 Palestinians, paramedics and an Israeli security
official said. Two of the Israelis were in serious condition.
	   In the West Bank village of Biddou, hundreds of Palestinians
clashed with Israeli soldiers after the funeral of a Hamas activist
killed a day earlier when a car rigged with explosives blew up.
	   The violence erupted during Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the
Jewish calendar, as Israeli troops enforced a blanket closure on
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   The bloodshed came amid intensive U.S. efforts to broker an
agreement on an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank. In talks
with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat accepted an Israeli formula for turning over 13
percent of the West Bank to Palestinians.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to return to the
Middle East next week to prepare another Mideast summit in
Washington in mid-October.
	   The Hebron incident began at about 4:30 p.m. (1430 gmt) near the
outdoor vegetable market when an explosion went off near a jeep of
Israel's paramilitary border police, said a security official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Two border policemen were seriously injured and seven lightly
injured in the blast, officials from the Magen David Adom paramedic
service said.
	   The army said it was investigating and had no immediate comment.
	   At least 11 Palestinians were hurt and taken to two Hebron
hospitals. None of the injuries was serious.
	   Two civilian cars, a white station wagon and a yellow van, were
badly damaged in the blast.
	   Hebron, where about 500 Jewish settlers live among 130,000
Palestinians, is a frequent flashpoint for violence.
	   Earlier clashes near the village of Biddou outside the town of
Ramallah left six Palestinians hurt. Soldiers fired rubber bullets
and tear gas to disperse hundreds of stone throwers.
	   The clashes erupted after the funeral of Zahran Ibrahim Zahran,
a Hamas activist killed in the explosion of a rigged car Tuesday in
an industrial zone in the village of Beitunia, near Ramallah.
	   Two Hamas activists who survived the blast denied they were
preparing the car for a bombing attack in Israel, Palestinian
police officials said.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
over renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to carry
out suicide bombings in the Jewish state. Hamas wants to avenge the
recent killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   Zahran and his two friends, Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid, also
from Biddou, had been arrested twice by Israel and twice by the
Palestinian Authority for being involved in Hamas activities, most
recently in the spring.
	   The Abu Eid brothers told Palestinian investigators that just
before the explosion, they met an Israeli Arab man in a car in the
Beitunia industrial zone, expecting him to deliver three guns for
dlrs 1,000. The man delivered a package and got out of the car
before the explosion went off, they said.
	   The Abu Eid brothers were taken to nearby Ramallah Hospital
where they remained in stable condition Wednesday, under police
guard.
	   A man who said he spoke for Hamas called the Palestinian-run
Jerusalem Media and Communications Center, or JMCC, after the blast
and claimed that Israel was behind the bombing. However, Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the caller did not speak on behalf of
the group and that Hamas was launching its own investigation.

Brazil to play Confederations' Cup games in Guadalajara
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ World Cup runners-up Brazil and three
other teams will play their Confederations Cup group matches next
January in Guadalajara, Mexico, world soccer's governing body FIFA
announced Wednesday.
	   The Mexican organizing committee chose the city's Jalisco
stadium to host the six Group B matches rather than Monterrey or
Queretaro because of the weather and the larger 50,000 capacity of
the stadium, a FIFA press release said.
	   Another factor, the press release said, is Brazil's popularity
among the local fans. Brazil played in Guadalajara in the 1970 and
1986 World Cups.
	   The stadium will also host a semi-final match and the match for
third place.
	   The tournament will be played from January 8-20 next year and
the draw for the two groups will be made in Mexico City on Sunday.
	   The United States, Mexico, Bolivia, Brazil, France, Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and the winner of the current Oceania contest in
Brisbane, Australia, will participate in the eight-nation
tournament.

Britain calls U.N. Security Council meeting on Kosovo crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: combines pvs; UPDATES with further Cook comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Wednesday
called an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to condemn
the massacre of ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   ``This was not an act of war, it was plain cold murder,'' Cook
said at a press briefing at the Labor Party conference in
Blackpool.
	   Cook said Thursday's meeting would request an urgent report from
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on whether Serbia had complied
with last week's Security Council resolution that called for a
cease-fire in Kosovo, a withdrawal of Serbian troops, and the start
of ``serious dialogue on real autonomy'' for the province.
	   Cook, whose country takes over the Security Council presidency
on Thursday, said NATO airstrikes could follow the receipt of
Annan's report early next week.
	   ``Military action will flow from a political decision,'' he
said.
	   Of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Cook said, ``He must
move to comply with the Security Council resolution and he must
move fast.''
	   A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking on customary
anonymity, said Blair had talked Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright who ``shares our sense of outrage'' over
the violence.
	   Earlier, Cook had announced that senior representatives from the
six so-called Contact Group countries _ the United States, Britain,
Germany, France, Italy and Russia _ would meet here Friday to find
``the way forward on a political settlement'' for Kosovo.
	   Despite assurances from the Yugoslav government that its

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Sri Lanka's military claimed a major
battlefield prize Wednesday, but reports of the staggering costs of
the victory _ at least 1,300 Sri Lankan soldiers and Tamil rebels
dead in the worst fighting in a year _ underlined how difficult it
will be for either side to win the 15-year-old war.
	   The victory and the deaths occurred along a strategic highway
that links Colombo, the capital, to the government-held northern
town of Jaffna. The military launched a campaign that has proceeded
since May, 1997, and has wrested two-thirds of it from the rebels.
	   Red Cross spokesman Harsha Gunawardene said the bodies of 600
soldiers were collected from rebels Wednesday, apparent casualties
in the latest fighting that began Sunday.
	   Gunawardene said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam handed
over the bodies at Mallavi, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Kilinochchi, a key town at the northern end of the highway where
fighting reportedly continued Wednesday.
	   Gunawardene spoke by telephone from Colombo to The Associated
Press in New Delhi, capital of neighboring India.
	   The Red Cross toll is in addition to 262 soldiers whose bodies
the military recovered itself in the battles since Sunday. In
Colombo, hospital officials speaking on condition of anonymity said
another 53 soldiers have died in hospitals. The military also said
it killed 477 rebels in the fighting.
	   The Sri Lankan government has imposed censorship, restricting
what local and foreign correspondents can report about the war and
casualties.
	   Journalists haven't been allowed near the fighting. Few details
were available, and it was unknown why the reported number of
casualties was so high.
	   Sri Lankan military officials said the fighting on Wednesday
yielded Mankulam, a town straddling the highway just 100 kilometers
(60 miles) from Jaffna. Rebels dug in behind bunkers had fiercely
resisted the onslaught on Mankulam, but finally withdrew from the
battered town 245 kilometers (150 miles) north of Colombo as
government troops encircled it.
	   Meanwhile, fighting continued to rage around Kilinochchi, which
the rebels stormed on Sunday. Kilinochchi is 35 kilometers (21
miles) north of Mankulam.
	   The rebels claim that they captured Kilinochchi and the town of
Paranthan further north. The government says it still controls
parts of the towns.
	   There was little public reaction to the carnage, since
censorship has kept news of the fighting out of local newspapers.
Despite the news blackout, signs of the fighting were evident at
the city's hospitals. Colombo's huge state-owned National Hospital
was one of several sending home all but the most seriously ill to
make room for hundreds of wounded soldiers.
	   Some of the wounded were being treated on stretchers in hospital
corridors.
	   The military has not seen such casualties since 1996, when 1,240
soldiers were killed when rebels overran a garrison at Mullaittivu,
175 miles (280 kilometers) north of Colombo.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control the
government and the military.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed since the fighting
began in 1983.
	   For now, the government is relying on expensive air and sea
deliveries of food and other commodities to Jaffna's half-million
residents. The area was further isolated Wednesday when civilian
flights between Jaffna and Colombo were suspended indefinitely a
day after a plane apparently crashed on the way from Jaffna.
	   Rebels had warned the two private carriers who serve Jaffna to
stop their flights, but it was not clear if they had shot down the
passenger plane carrying 55 people. The plane remained missing
Wednesday.
	   The Sri Lankan government under President Chandrika Kumaratunga
has vowed to crush the Tigers on the battlefield. In August, she
extended a state of emergency from the northern and eastern areas
to the rest of the Indian Ocean island, saying the country faced a
difficult security situation.

Bulgaria faces possible FIFA suspension over federation ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Bulgaria meeting in 9th thru 11th grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Bulgaria could face suspension by
FIFA over a government decision to ban the national federation from
running soccer affairs, a spokesman for the game's world governing
body said Wednesday.
	   FIFA contacted the Bulgarian association at the beginning of
this week over the affair, but has set no deadline for authorities
to act, spokesman Keith Cooper said.
	   ``It's not a dramatic situation at the moment,'' Cooper added.
But ``it is within our power to suspend the federation from
international activity.''
	   In mid-September, the government Committee of Youth, Physical
Training and Sports banned the Bulgarian Soccer Union from running
soccer affairs, accusing it of failing to react to a positive
doping test of a local player.
	   The committee, which is empowered to license sports
organizations and teams, said it was revoking the license of the
Soccer Union and gave it to the Professional Soccer League, a part
of the Union including only professional teams.
	   That move is ``not acceptable to us,'' FIFA spokesman Cooper
said. But there is no reason to suppose England's European
Championship qualifying match against Bulgaria on Oct. 10 is in
danger, he said.
	   The government committee said the Union broke international and
Bulgarian regulations by allowing player Ilya Gruev to be included
in the national team although he had tested positive for
performance-enhancing drugs in April. Gruev plays for Neftochimik
in the Black Sea city of Burgas.
	   The Union is headed by Ivan Slavkov, son-in-law of late
communist ruler Todor Zhivkov. Slavkov has been criticized because
of Bulgaria's poor World Cup performance. The team was eliminated
in the first round of this summer's finals.
	   Bulgarian lawmakers on Wednesday tried for three hours to
arrange a deal between the committee and the Union. Officials from
both sides promised to start talks as soon as possible for the
committee to return the Union's license if it punishes Gruev.
	   The Union has appealed its suspension before Bulgaria's supreme
court, which is scheduled to rule on the case Oct. 20, Union
official Ivan Vutsov said. The body remains in charge until then,
he added.
	   ``In the interest of Bulgarian soccer we suggest that you settle
things between you before the case is brought to the court,''
Borislav Kitov, head of the parliamentary commission, told
officials.
	   In August, Poland narrowly escaped indefinite suspension by FIFA
with a last-minute move by the country's sport minister to comply
with a deadline for the reinstatement of suspended administrators.

Deputy premier says Yugoslav army will strike back at NATO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Vojislav Seselj, the
ultranationalist deputy premier of Serbia, has warned that the
Yugoslav army would strike back in case of NATO attacks on its
forces, media reported Wednesday.
	   Speaking on a local Serbian television station Tuesday evening,
Vojislav Seselj advised people to stay calm in case of NATO
bombings, but added a general mobilization would be called.
	   ``As high government officials, we should be ready, with our
sons, to respond to the draft call and set an example by being
stationed at the most dangerous locations,'' Seselj said.
	   ``Citizens should remain calm and composed in anticipation of
NATO bombings,'' he advised.
	   Seselj's statement came as NATO moved close to finalizing
preparations for air and missile strikes against military targets
in Serbia.
	   Seselj said the attacks were ``possible.'' He said the Yugoslav
army was ready to respond adequately, using its ``modern armaments,
such as surface-to-surface missiles.''

NBA players lead team for friendly games in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ After overcoming security fears, a North
American basketball team led by NBA players from Portland,
Sacramento and Vancouver opened a series of friendly games
Wednesday in Lebanon.
	   The first game in Beirut's Sports City, which was rebuilt after
the country's 15-year civil war infamous for the kidnapping of
Westerners, was against Lebanon's national team. The visitors won
90-81.
	   During their stay through Sunday, they also will meet an Arab
All-Star team and practice with a local team.
	   Coach Anthony Ronzone of San Francisco, Calif., said it took two
months of negotiations to round up the team to play in Lebanon,
which is still struggling to shed its civil war image as a nasty
place.
	   ``It took me a lot of effort to get it done,'' said Ronzone, who
is leading the team on behalf of FIBA, the international basketball
federation. ``I had to talk to many people, their families, their
wives.''
	   Ronzone said the players' first question was ``Is it safe?''
	   He termed that ``understandable,'' and added: ``Now that they
are here, everything they are getting is outstanding.''
	   Among the visiting team were National Basketball Association
players Rick Brunson of the Portland Trail Blazers, Michael Stewart
of the Sacramento Kings and Sam Mack of the Vancouver Grizzlies.
	   Former NBA players include Brad Davis, Dell Demps and David
Wood.
	   The team was invited by Beirut's Sporting Club, with costs
underwritten by private Lebanese TV stations. Neither Ronzone nor
the Lebanese sponsors revealed fees or costs.
	   The games are the first in the Sports City's indoor stadium and
are designed to promote basketball in a region where soccer is the
public's first love.
	   ``The growth of basketball in the Middle East and Lebanon is
phenomenal,'' Ronzone said. ``People love the game, and my role is
to promote that entertaining game.''
	   The Sports City, which was destroyed during Israel's 1982
invasion of Lebanon, was rebuilt to host the summer of 1997
pan-Arab track and field games.
	   During its 1975-90 civil war, Lebanon became synonymous with
violence. Lebanese gunmen attacked and kidnapped foreigners, mainly
Americans and other Westerners.
	   In July 1997, the U.S. State Department lifted a 10-year ban on
American travel to Lebanon, replacing it with a travel advisory.
Since then, Americans have begun returning.

Ultranationalist leader wants to run for governor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky
said Wednesday that he wants to run for governor of the region
surrounding St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city.
	   The position became open when Leningrad region Gov. Vadim Gustov
was appointed deputy premier of Russia.
	   Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia,
said he would campaign on a platform to unify St. Petersburg and
the Leningrad region into one large industrial zone, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   The election is expected to be held sometime next year.

KGB spies tell all _ well, almost all _ about their lives abroad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to include name of mob chief &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ They were sitting on the terrace of a Mafia
chieftain's villa outside Palermo when the Godfather asked Leonid
Kolosov if he was really just a newspaper reporter in search of a
story.
	   ``I looked him straight in the eye, as we were taught in KGB
school, and lied,'' Kolosov recalls. He was really just a simple
reporter, he told the mobster. Even if he wanted to, he didn't have
time to be a spy.
	   Then he went ahead and recruited the mob chief, Nicola Gentile,
as a valuable informer for the Soviet spy agency.
	   Kolosov was a KGB agent in Rome, Paris and Madrid, and his are
among the revealing _ not to mention entertaining _ stories
collected in a new book, ``Undercover Lives: Soviet Spies in the
Cities of the World.''
	   The book, being published in Britain next month and Germany
early next year, is loosely based on a Russian-language book, the
``KGB Guidebook to Cities of the World,'' published two years ago.
	   But where that book offered a nuts-and-bolts guide to the
world's leading spook sights, the new book is more of a memoir of
spy's lives, from a time when the Cold War made the world's
capitals a playground for espionage.
	   A half-dozen former spies who contributed to the book gathered
Wednesday at the press center of the Foreign Intelligence Service _
one of the successor agencies to the KGB _ to tell their stories
and get a first look at copies of the book, edited by a British
journalist, Helen Womack.
	   Womack, a veteran Moscow correspondent, said she had been asked
to help translate and edit the original book when it was published
by a Moscow newspaper, ``Top Secret.''
	   ``They were giving travel tips to Russians who had never been
abroad _ you know, if you go to Paris, don't miss the Eiffel
Tower,'' she recalled. ``I realized it would have to be completely
different for Western readers.''
	   The book offers little in the way of sensational news, although
it does describe an aborted plan to assassinate Spanish dictator
Francisco Franco, and says there were talks between the Soviet
Union and West Germany to dismantle the Berlin Wall as early as the
1970s.
	   Mostly, if offers insights into the daily lives of agents whose
exploits sound like a low-rent mix of James Bond and Boris Badenov,
the nudnik Russian spy in the American cartoon series, ``Rocky and
his Friends.''
	   There are tales of love affairs and drinking bouts, of shooting
pens and booby-trapped cars, of treachery and _ a common theme
throughout the book _ honest, sincere patriotism.
	   ``Obviously, they weren't going to open up any state secrets,''
Womack said. ``But they did tell us a lot about their lifestyle in
our countries.''
	   Mikhail Lyubimov, a KGB agent in London, describes falling in
love with Britain, and fondly remembers days off in Hyde Park,
jogging or pushing a stroller with his newborn son.
	   He recalls his amazement at the civility of English police.
``Once at night a bobby stopped me: `Excuse me sir, perhaps it
would be a good idea if you put on your lights.' I thought I was
talking to Sir Walter Scott.''
	   But he never got over his Marxist outrage at the pampered lives
of the British upper class.
	   Vasily Timofeyev, once the KGB's man in Bangkok, offers a KGB
guide to dining with informants in the Thai capital. The key, he
says, is to find a restaurant off the beaten path that is busy, but
not too busy, with music that is loud, but not too loud. The lights
should be nice and dim.
	   Only about 5 percent of Bangkok's eateries qualify, he says.
	   Timofeyev also worked in New Delhi, and describes his absurd
efforts to recruit an American yoga enthusiast in the 1970s, when
many young Americans were seeking spiritual succor in India.
	   Most of the time, Timofeyev said, he was supposed to be
ferreting secrets out of Indians. But the KGB apparently considered
any American, no matter how useless their knowledge or clueless
their contacts, a prize catch.
	   Timofeyev describes tagging along with his American target to a
yoga seminar in a provincial Indian city, and being forced to
participate to prove his sincerity.
	   ``I sat in the Lotus position _ well, half-Lotus to be precise _
and did the Cowface, Cobra and Modified Fish postures,'' the
Russian spy recounts. ``And I breathed.''
	   Eventually, Timofeyev gave up on his would-be recruit, having
concluded: ``He was a yoga fanatic and nothing more.''
	   The spy said he probably should have kept up his yoga, though.
	   ``Intelligence work is very stressful, and perhaps yoga would
have been good for my body, mind and spirit,'' he writes. ``But I
was too busy. When I needed to unwind after work, it was easier
just to reach for the whiskey, then walk over to the fridge for the
ice. It was a professional weakness. I think most of my colleagues
were like that.''

World Equestrian Games kick off with dressage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Karin Rehbein of Germany, riding Donnerhall, took
the provisional lead in the dressage event Wednesday as the World
Equestrian Games opened at the refurbished Flaminio stadium.
	   An initial group of 40 riders competed Wednesday, while a second
group of 44 will ride Thursday to complete the dressage event, for
which both individul and team titles will be awarded.
	   Rehbein scored 1,830 points, while her teammate Ulla Salzgeber,
riding Rusty, held second position with 1,808 points.
	   The U.S. team, which is strongest in the jumping, placed just
one rider in the top 10 Wednesday. Robert Dover, on Lennox,
finished seventh with 1,688 points, while Shelly Francis, riding
Pikant, was 17th with 1,619 points.
	   About 700 horses and 550 riders and drivers from 42 countries
will compete in the championships which run through Oct. 11. Eleven
titles will be assigned in five disciplines, including the Olympic
events of dressage, three-day-event and jumping.
	   In addition to the Flaminio stadium in Rome, events will be
staged at two other sites outside the city.
	   International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
presided over the opening ceremony Wednesday.

Agassi rolls over Pioline in 34 minutes, Novotna loses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES Kucera beating Arazi &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Andre Agassi rolled over Cedric Pioline
6-0, 6-0 in only 34 minutes Wednesday to storm into the
quarterfinals of the dlrs 6.7 million Grand Slam Cup.
	   In the quickest match since the tournament's inception in 1990,
Pioline won only eight points in the first set and nine in the
second against an Agassi playing with amazing confidence.
	   Agassi was given a wild card to play in the tournament, which
nominally brings together players with best records in the year's
four Grand Slam events _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and
Wimbledon.
	   But three men's Grand Slam champions of the year have decided to
skip the tournament despite its huge prize money _ Wimbledon
champion and top-ranked Pete Sampras, U.S. Open champion Patrick
Rafter and Carlos Moya, the French Open champion.
	   Only Australian Open champion Petr Korda is among the 12 men
here.
	   ``Regardless of who is not here, this is still a great
tournament,'' Agassi said.
	   While most of the top women are here, one of the most prominent
ones had a short stay. Jana Novotna, the Wimbledon champion and No.
3 player in the world, was upset by ninth-ranked Patty Schnyder
2-6, 7-5, 7-5.
	   Novotna had several of her trademark lapses on key moments and
once again demonstrated her inability to close out matches that
seem already won.
	   Serving for the match at 5-4 in the second set, she committed a
double-fault on match point.
	   She served for the match twice more in the decisive set and both
times dropped her serve. The tenacious Swiss teen-ager finally
prevailed when Novotna slice backhand sailed wide, ending the match
after two hours and eight minutes. Novotna had 10 double-faults.
	   In another men's first-round match, Karol Kucera ousted Hicham
Arazi of Morocco 6-4, 6-4.
	   For his short work, Agassi earned dlrs 175,000. Even more
amazingly, Pioline picked up dlrs 100,000 given to first-round
losers _ without even winning a game and hardly breaking a sweat.
	   With the official scorecard giving the duration of the match at
34 minutes, it means Agassi made dlrs 5,147 a minute, while Pioline
made dlrs 2,941 a minute in his losing effort.
	   Agassi, ranked No. 8 in the world, hit winners from all over the
court from the start and the Frenchman never had a chance. Agassi
picked apart Pioline's serve with sizzling returns.
	   ``It was all kind of going my way,'' Agassi said. ``He tried
hard, he was hitting the ball decently.''
	   ``I stepped it up and I kept stepping it up, kept making shots.
I can have a clean swing at the ball here indoors,'' the American
said. ``It's a great surface for me, the ball travels fast through
the air but it sits up good once it bounces.''
	   ``I've come here very prepared and I'll feel more satisfied I do
well since I got a wild card,'' said Agassi, a winner of three
Grand Slam titles in his career.
	   Pioline blamed pain in both knees for his quick exit. ``It's
like a needle.''
	   The Frenchman admitted that had it not been for the money, he
might have decided not to play.

Report: Leftist to be German finance minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Oskar Lafontaine, an old-style Social
Democrat who calls for higher wages to spur the economy, will be
Germany's new finance minister, a newspaper reported.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder has decided to tap
Lafontaine, who is the party's chairman, the Rheinische Post said
in a report to appear Thursday.
	   The report gave no sources, and party officials declined
comment. Party leaders have said, however, that no Cabinet
appointments are definite pending talks with the small Greens party
on forming a government coalition.
	   Lafontaine, who often appeared with Schroeder on the campaign
trail, has united the party since he took over as chairman in 1995.
He has quelled infighting between its moderate and left wings.
	   Many planks in the party platform bear his stamp: a push for
higher wages; reversing cuts in sick pay and looser firing rules
pushed through by the outgoing government of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, and a call for reining in international financial markets.

Saudi Arabia invites U.S. oil companies to look at returning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with U.S., Saudi and industry comments;

 &UR; By H. JOSEF HEBERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ After more than two decades in exile, U.S. oil
companies are being asked by Saudi Arabia for ideas on how they
might once again participate in developing the kingdom's huge oil
reserves, according to U.S. and Saudi officials.
	   Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah met privately over the weekend with
senior executives from seven U.S. oil companies to discuss the
Americans' possible involvement in oil and gas development, said
administration and industry sources.
	   The meeting was confirmed by Saudi officials, although they did
not elaborate.
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who did not participate in the
meeting, said he was told by Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi that
``the meeting with the executives went extremely well.''
	   Richardson, who is to visit Saudi Arabia in December to discuss
increased energy ties between the two countries, met with Naimi and
Abdullah earlier this week.
	   Abdullah has held the reins of the Saudi government since 1995,
when his half-brother, King Fahd, had a stroke. While the crown
prince is pushing for increased ties with the U.S. companies, Naimi
was said to be less enthusiastic about it and argued against such a
move, fearing a political backlash from Islamic nationalists.
	   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest petroleum producer,
nationalized its oil industry in 1973 and has excluded foreign
companies from its exploration and production operations ever
since. Some U.S. companies continue to participate in refining and
petrochemical activities in the kingdom.
	   Industry and administration sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Saudi overture stems from Saudi's growing
economic problems caused by low oil prices, soft worldwide demand
and increased competition, especially from Mexico and Venezuela.
	   While industry officials confirmed the meeting, some
participants characterized it as a general discussion about
increased cooperation. Others said the Saudis had sought specific
recommendations from the U.S. executives.
	   Naimi is expected to conduct further discussions with oil
companies individually in the coming days, according to one U.S.
source, who spoke on the condition of not being further identified.
	   The Washington Post, which first reported the weekend meeting in
Wednesday's editions, quoted one participant as saying Abdullah had
asked for specific recommendations and suggestions from the
companies on what role they might play in exploring and developing
existing and new Saudi oil fields.
	   Those attending the meeting included senior executives from
Mobil Corp., Exxon Corp., Texaco Inc. and Chevron Corp. _ all
partners in the Arabian American Oil Co., Aramco, in the 1930s.
Also present were executives from Atlantic Richfield Co., Conoco
Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co.
	   Saudi Arabia has the world's largest oil reserves _ more than
260 billion barrels _ the lowest costs of extracting oil and the
most production of any country in the world _ 8 million barrels a
day.
	   But it has lost market share over the past decade to Mexico,
Venezuela and Canada and has been forced to slash production
recently because of the collapse of Asian economies.

Government's blueprint calls for reversal of free-market reforms

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new government is about to consider a
Soviet-style economic plan that would set back the clock with
nationalized banks and a flood of newly minted money, a newspaper
said Wednesday.
	   The head of the Central Bank strongly denied that the government
was going to take over banks.
	   The government did not specifically deny the rest of the
reported plan, which was said to have been drafted by a group of
Soviet-era economists. According to the Kommersant business
newspaper, it would boost the money supply by 60 percent,
undoubtedly fueling inflation.
	   It also would reintroduce currency controls, Kommersant said.
	   The newspaper, which is generally well respected, said the plan
would be considered by the Cabinet on Thursday.
	   Government spokesman Andrei Korotkov confirmed that Yuri
Maslyukov, a Communist who is first deputy prime minister for
economic strategy, had worked out an economic plan that will be
discussed by the Cabinet on Thursday. He said it would become the
basis for a government program to be unveiled on Oct. 8.
	   Korotkov would not describe the plan in detail, but acknowledged
that it calls for more state controls over banks and the currency
market. He said it was aimed at ``the recovery and stabilization of
the banking system,'' and overall economic stabilization, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Central Bank chief Viktor Gerashchenko vehemently denied that
the government intended to nationalize banks.
	   ``I wouldn't work in such a system. I would retire,'' he said,
according to Interfax.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, traveling in Belarus, continued
to insist that he supported free-market economic reforms, but with
more state control and a greater emphasis on social welfare.
	   ``This movement is not a backward, but a forward change in the
economy, and consists of market changes in particular, but with a
strengthening of government regulation so that the economy turns
its face toward the people,'' Primakov told reporters in Minsk, the
Belarusian capital.
	   Kommersant was less approving. ``Maslyukov's program again turns
Russia into a transition economy, only this time it will move
backward _ to the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic,'' the
newspaper wrote.
	   ``They are going to crank up money-printing presses,''
Kommersant added. ``Social pathos will bring hyperinflation.''
	   Former tax chief Boris Fyodorov, who was ousted by President
Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday, said the government should move to boost
tax collection and radically cut spending instead of printing new
money.
	   ``Printing money is like a drug. Once you grow addicted to that,
it's hard to stop,'' he said in an interview published in the
liberal daily Izvestia.
	   Maslyukov was the last chairman of the Soviet central planning
agency, Gosplan. According to the newspaper, he will propose
nationalizing most of Russia's commercial banks and using their
assets to help troubled industries.
	   It also proposes using factors other than the market _ such as
the balance of payments _ to set the ruble's exchange rate, the
newspaper said.
	   The ruble's value has dropped sharply against other currencies
since being devalued last month. It stood at about 6 rubles to the
dollar before the devaluation and economic collapse; on Wednesday,
it was trading at about 16 to the dollar.
	   The Russian stock market closed sharply lower again Wednesday in
very light trading. Only dlrs 336,000 changed hands.

Council of Europe visitors denied visas for media conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with conference being canceled, CORRECTS name of body
to Council of Europe &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A conference on media freedom was
canceled Wednesday after Serbian authorities refused to issue visas
to several Council of Europe officials due to attend the
conference, organizers said.
	   ``The act signaled a new government clampdown on free speech and
a continuation of this regime's persistent stifling of fledgling
independent media,'' said Veran Matic, manager of the Association
of Independent Electronic Media.
	   The international conference, entitled ``Broadcasting for a
Democratic Europe,'' sponsored by the Council of Europe, was due to
begin this Friday.
	   It was to be first of its kind in the Serbian capital.
	   Visas were withheld for as many as 18 Council of Europe visitors
and eight of these had their visa applications refused outright,
Matic said. Most were British or Dutch citizens.
	   The association addressed a complaint to the ministry of
interior but was referred to ministry of information were they were
unable to obtain any explanations.
	   ``It goes to show the full hypocrisy of the regime _ while
proclaiming to want membership in the Council of Europe, it
harasses independent media and stifles the very principles the
Council stands for,'' Matic said
	   Foreign reporters and employees of humanitarian agencies have
also reported long and unexplained delays in trying to get visas.
	   ``We decided the situation compelled us to cancel this landmark
conference rather than host a partial one,'' Matic told reporters
later Wednesday.

USTA chief &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Andre Agassi spent more time lashing out
at the outgoing United States Tennis Association president
Wednesday than it took him to advance to the quarterfinals of the
Grand Slam Cup.
	   Agassi, trying to justify his absence from last weekend's U.S.
team's Davis Cup semifinal loss to Italy, said the outgoing USTA
president Harry Marmion was to blame for his refusal to play.
	   Without Agassi, Pete Sampras and Michael Chang, its top-ranked
stars, the U.S. team lost 4-1.
	   Agassi's post-match news conference took longer than his match _
a 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of Cedric Pioline in 34 minutes, the quickest
match since the inception of the Grand Slam Cup in 1990.
	   Agassi said he would have played the Davis Cup if the match had
been scheduled for the West Coast, nearer to his Las Vegas
residence, so that he could attend a charity event Saturday. Agassi
said the event raised dlrs 3.3 million for his foundation that
helps children.
	   ``It was very disappointing. I felt very bad for the guys over
there,'' Agassi said, adding that he had watched the match on
television.
	   ``It was very, very much the wrong call of the surface. The
court was very slow. We gave Italy the best chance possible and
they took advantage of it.''
	   The hard surface inside the Milwaukee Arena was chosen by the
Americans because it was supposed to favor their fast games. But it
played more like the clay courts the Italians grew up on.
	   Agassi and Sampras have been criticized for refusing to play
Davis Cup.
	   Agassi was upset by the choice of Milwaukee and said he wouldn't
play in the final if the United States advanced, declaring ``If it
was in my back yard, I wouldn't walk out the back door.''
	   ``I could have played on the West Coast, no problem,'' Agassi
said Wednesday, calling Marmion ``pathetic.''
	   ``You have to be pretty pathetic to take the best United States
Davis Cup player and absolutely make him never want to play
again,'' he said.
	   ``He won't pick what the players need, what's best for the team.
It's what's best for him,'' Agassi said.
	   Agassi said he had no problems playing for captain Tom
Gullikson, although ``he's made some decisions that have been
difficult for me to understand.''
	   ``Once Harry Marmion is out, I'll try to start new again with
the next president,'' Agassi said. ``Thank God his term is done.''
	   But Agassi made clear it did not mean he was ready to play Davis
Cup again. ``I wouldn't be able to deliver on that one.''
	   Agassi said Marmion was also against him receiving a wild card
for this lucrative dlrs 6.7 million tournament that nominally
brings together players with best records in the year's four Grand
Slam events _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
	   But three men's Grand Slam champions of the year have decided to
skip the tournament despite its huge prize money _ Wimbledon
champion and top-ranked Pete Sampras, U.S. Open champion Patrick
Rafter and Carlos Moya, the French Open champion. Only Australian
Open champion Petr Korda is among the 12 men here.
	   With the men's side lacking top stars, Agassi was given a wild
card to give some luster to the event.
	   A former No. 1 who is making a comeback after dropping out of
the top 100, Agassi has won four titles this year. But his Grand
Slam record for the year is relatively poor: Round of 16 at the
Australian and the U.S. Open his best showing.
	   He lived up to his part of the bargain, but Pioline did not
provide much opposition.
	   Agassi, ranked No. 8 in the world, picked apart Pioline's serve
with sizzling returns and the Frenchman never had a chance.
	   Pioline blamed painful knees for his dismal performance and
admitted that money played a big role in his decision to play.
	   ``Yeah, that's a big point, for sure,'' he said.
	   For 34 minutes of work, Agassi earned dlrs 175,000 _ dlrs 5,147
a minute. Pioline picked up dlrs 100,000 given to first-round
losers _ dlrs 2,941 a minute.
	   In a women's quarterfinal, Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna
double-faulted on her match point at 5-4 in the second set and went
on to lose 2-6, 7-5, 7-5 to Patty Schnyder.
	   In another men's first-round match, Karol Kucera beat Hicham

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Arab reaction to the White House-brokered
deal on a further Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank ranged
from outright opposition to a cautious welcome accompanied by calls
for further steps from Israel.
	   Lebanon's leading daily An-Nahar reported Wednesday that PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat had submitted to pressure. Hard-liners in
Iraq and Syria accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of making
too many concessions.
	   ``The Israeli measures to swallow the Palestinians' land is
being done with American support and encouragement,'' said Iraq's
Al-Thawra daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party.
	   The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, an
opposition faction based in the Syrian capital Damascus, accused
Arafat of ``new concessions'' and called for ``an immediate stop to
negotiations.''
	   Hezbollah, a guerrilla group fighting to expel Israel from
southern Lebanon, said the agreement fulfills ``the personal needs
of (President Bill) Clinton who is surrounded by his personal
scandals and crises.''

Explosion goes off near border police jeep; two seriously wounded

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Israeli security source saying
explosion went off next to border police jeep, two Israelis
seriously hurt; EDITS to TRIM &QL;

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An explosion went off Wednesday next to
an Israeli border police jeep in downtown Hebron, injuring nine
Israelis and 11 Palestinians, paramedics and an Israeli security
official said. Two of the Israelis were in serious condition.
	   In the West Bank village of Biddou, hundreds of Palestinians
clashed with Israeli soldiers after the funeral of a Hamas activist
killed a day earlier when a car rigged with explosives blew up.
	   The violence erupted during Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the
Jewish calendar, as Israeli troops enforced a blanket closure on
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   The bloodshed came amid intensive U.S. efforts to broker an
agreement on an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank. In talks
with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat accepted an Israeli formula for turning over 13
percent of the West Bank to Palestinians.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to return to the
Middle East next week to prepare another Mideast summit in
Washington in mid-October.
	   The Hebron incident began at about 4:30 p.m. (1430 GMT) near the
outdoor vegetable market when an explosion went off near a jeep
belonging to Israel's paramilitary border police, said a security
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Two border policemen were seriously injured and seven lightly
injured in the blast, officials from the Magen David Adom paramedic
service said.
	   The army said it was investigating and had no immediate comment.
	   At least 11 Palestinians were injured and taken to two Hebron
hospitals. None of the injuries was serious.
	   Two civilian cars, a white station wagon and a yellow van, were
badly damaged in the blast.
	   Hebron, where about 500 Jewish settlers live among 130,000
Palestinians, is a frequent flashpoint for violence.
	   Earlier clashes near the village of Biddou outside the town of
Ramallah left six Palestinians hurt. Soldiers fired rubber bullets
and tear gas to disperse hundreds of stone throwers.
	   The clashes erupted after the funeral of Zahran Ibrahim Zahran,
a Hamas activist killed in the explosion of a rigged car Tuesday in
an industrial zone in the village of Beitunia, near Ramallah.
	   Two Hamas activists who survived the blast denied they were
preparing the car for a bombing attack in Israel, Palestinian
police officials said.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
over renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to carry
out suicide bombings in the Jewish state. Hamas wants to avenge the
recent killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   Zahran and his two friends, Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid, also
from Biddou, had been arrested twice by Israel and twice by the
Palestinian Authority for being involved in Hamas activities, most
recently in the spring.
	   The Abu Eid brothers told Palestinian investigators that just
before the explosion, they met an Israeli Arab man in a car in the
Beitunia industrial zone, expecting him to deliver three guns for
dlrs 1,000. The man delivered a package and got out of the car
before the explosion went off, they said.
	   The Abu Eid brothers were taken to nearby Ramallah Hospital
where they remained in stable condition Wednesday, under police
guard.
	   A man who said he spoke for Hamas called the Palestinian-run
Jerusalem Media and Communications Center, or JMCC, after the blast
and claimed that Israel was behind the bombing. However, Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the caller did not speak on behalf of
the group and that Hamas was launching its own investigation.

Iran begins war games near the Afghan border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian armed forces began their first stage
of military exercises near Afghanistan on Wednesday in a move that
could heighten tension along their border.
	   Armored and infantry units advanced toward imaginary enemy
positions after the army laid down artillery fire, Iranian
television reported, showing footage of the exercises.
	   The maneuvers, code named Zulfaqar 2, are the second to be held
this month and come amid tension with Afghanistan's Taliban
militia.
	   Taliban fighters killed nine Iranian diplomats and an Iranian
journalist after capturing the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban, which rule about 90 percent of Afghanistan, said
that renegade fighters killed the Iranians, but its leaders have
refused Iranian demands to hand over the killers. They accuse Iran
of backing Afghanistan's northern-based opposition alliance.
	   Taliban leaders say they have moved 20,000 troops to the border
in response to Iran's war games.
	   In all, some 200,000 troops will take part in the Iranian
exercises, which will cover a 50,000-square kilometer (20,000
square-mile) area in eastern Iran.

New procedure may reduce lymph node removal in breast cancer
</HEADLINE>
surgery &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A new procedure may allow surgeons to reduce
dramatically the number of lymph nodes they remove during breast
cancer surgery, sparing women some of the pain and possible
complications.
	   During operations to remove breast cancer, doctors also
routinely take out the lymph nodes around the armpit in case the
cancer has spread to these glands.
	   Removing the nodes may improve the chances of survival. The
presence of cancer there also tells doctors how aggressively to use
cancer drugs.
	   Just as doctors have learned that they can often safely remove
just the lump rather than the whole cancerous breast, they are now
experimenting with the idea that not all the lymph nodes need to
come out, either.
	   In a study in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine, doctors from the University of Vermont provided
encouraging evidence that a far less drastic procedure may work.
	   The procedure involves injecting radioactive material around the
tumor and then removing only the nodes that eventually absorb it.
	   ``It's quick and easy to precisely locate the node before ever
making an incision. That's the key advantage,'' said Dr. David
Krag, who helped pioneer the technique.
	   Krag trained 11 other surgeons to use the method. They reported
the results of testing on 443 patients.
	   Ducts in the breast carry fluid to the lymph nodes under the
arms. Each area of the breast drains to a different node.
	   The doctors inject technetium-99 into the breast around the
tumor. Eventually, about 1 percent of this radioactive material
makes its way to the lymph nodes. The doctors use a handheld gamma
ray counter to find which ones absorbed it.
	   Doctors then remove only these so-called sentinel nodes and see
if they are cancerous.
	   In this study, however, they also took out all the remaining
lymph nodes so they could see how accurate the procedure had been.
	   They found that if the gamma ray counter picked up a signal, the
procedure was 97 percent accurate at pinpointing all the cancerous
nodes. However, the procedure missed cancerous nodes in 13 of the
114 women with spreading cancer.
	   In an accompanying analysis, Dr. V. Suzanne Klimberg of the
University of Arkansas and others said the chance of missing
cancerous nodes is the main drawback.
	   Krag said that by doubling the dose of radioactive material, it
may be possible to lower the number of missed cases substantially.
	   Doctors will test this idea in a large study, sponsored by the
National Cancer Institute, that will get under way in about three
months. The sentinel node procedure will be tested against standard
lymph node removal in about 4,000 women.
	   The primary advantage of the new approach is that it removes
about 50 times less tissue than standard surgery. Krag said doctors
take out one to three grams of tissue instead of the usual 100 to
150 grams.
	   This means the technique can be done under local rather than
general anesthesia, and recovery is much faster. Patients are also
likely to avoid many of the possible complications, such as arm
swelling, limited shoulder motion and lingering pain from damaged
nerves.
	   Krag said some surgeons are already using the procedure, but he
recommends limiting it for now to medical studies.

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Britain's top official in Northern
Ireland urged the Irish Republican Army on Wednesday to start
surrendering weapons quickly, but gave no deadline over the issue
that some fear could unhinge the peace process.
	   ``There are difficulties ahead, high hurdles still to climb
over,'' Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam told the annual
conference of Britain's governing Labor Party. ``But we have come
so far that I am confident there is no going back.''
	   However, Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party,
and David Trimble, head of Northern Ireland's largest Protestant
party and leader of the province's new power-sharing Assembly, each
came to the Labor gathering showing few signs of compromise.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair met separately Wednesday with Adams,
Trimble and Seamus Mallon, Trimble's moderate Catholic deputy in
the new power-sharing setup, in a renewed effort to break the
impasse.
	   Addressing the conference, Trimble complained that beatings and
shootings of civilians had continued, despite the early releases of
42 imprisoned members of the IRA and outlawed pro-British groups
under terms of Northern Ireland's historic peace agreement.
	   ``It is an obligation under the agreement,'' he said of
disarmament. ``It must happen if the agreement is to work.''
	   Sinn Fein wants two posts in a multi-party administration to be
drawn from the new power-sharing Assembly set up as part of the
April peace agreement.
	   Under terms of the accord, the administration must meet with the
Irish government by Oct. 31.
	   Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionist Party, insists that the IRA
must start decomissioning to show the sincerity of its 14-month-old
cease-fire before Sinn Fein can get any posts.
	   The accord calls only for the IRA and pro-British paramilitary
groups to disarm under international supervision by mid-2000,
without setting a deadline for the process to start.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Adams said the arms issue should not delay
formation of the new administration.
	   ``The timeframe should not be allowed to slip,'' Adams said
after his 40-minute meeting with Blair. ``People should not be
allowed to hardball each other or go down to the wire on this.''
	   Underlining the huge change since the peace agreement, he had
passed easily through the security cordons that surround the annual
gathering of Britain's governing party _ once used primarily to
guard against an IRA assassination attempt on Cabinet ministers.
	   Mallon, of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, criticized
both Trimble and Adams, and warned that their dispute could derail
the peace process.
	   ``If we continue _ all of us _ to mishandle this issue, we run
the risk of wrecking what we have achieved,'' Mallon said. ``The
enemies of the agreement, the politics will rejoice, the beast will
run loose again.''
	   The Labor conference was meeting for the last time for the
foreseeable future in Blackpool, an unfashionable resort with acres
of boardinghouses, bright lights and cheap souvenir shops,
prompting charges of elitism in Blair's centrist ``New Labor''
party.
	   Labor and the opposition Conservative Party have met here on
alternate years for some seven decades.

Waiter dies of burns suffered in gas explosion at Mallorca cafe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ A waiter died
Wednesday of severe burns suffered in a weekend gas explosion that
destroyed a crowded cafe in this Spanish resort town.
	   Francisco Cordoba Maldonado, 21, died in a hospital in Valencia
where he was rushed in critical condition Sunday evening, hours
after the blast which left 40 people injured.
	   Cordoba had suffered severe burns over 95 percent of his body,
officials told the state news agency Efe.
	   Nine of the injured remained hospitalized Wednesday.
	   The explosion at the Gran Cafe Capuccino on Palma's bustling
sea-front avenue brought down the ceiling and sent concrete and
glass flying in all directions.
	   The injured included four Britons, three French and two Dutch
citizens, police said.
	   More than 100 people were at the cafe when the blast occurred.
	   The Balearic island of Mallorca is one of the world's top
tourist destinations.
	   Police said the blast may have been caused by a gas leak in the
basement of the cafe or possibly in the adjacent building.

Saddam's half brother refuses to return to Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Swiss authorities unaware of any request
involving al-Tikriti in 7th graf, U.N. officials confirming he's no
longer ambassador in 10th graf. Minor editing.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's half brother, who served as
Iraq's ambassador to the U.N. headquarters in Geneva, has refused
to return to Iraq after his diplomatic service ended last month,
Iraqi dissidents and Arab diplomats said Wednesday.
	   His defection would mark the second-biggest break in Saddam's
troubled family since the end of the 1991 Gulf War. Saddam's two
sons-in-law defected to Amman, Jordan, in 1996, only to be killed
upon their return to Iraq a few months later.
	   The half brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, was among 30 Iraqi
ambassadors and other diplomats recalled to Baghdad in recent weeks
in a major diplomatic reshuffle ordered by the Iraqi president.
	   Al-Tikriti has since sent his resignation to Saddam telling him
he will not go back to Baghdad under any circumstances, said the
dissidents, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Saddam immediately put under house arrest al-Tikriti's two
brothers _ Sabawi, a former security chief, and Watban, a former
interior minister _ following the defection, they said.
	   Al-Tikriti has received permanent residency in Switzerland as a
businessman, the dissidents told The Associated Press in telephone
interviews from several European capitals. Vera Britsch,
spokeswoman for Switzerland's Federal Office for Refugees, said
they were not aware of any asylum request involving al-Tikriti.
	   A spokesman for the Iraqi mission in Geneva confirmed that
al-Tikriti is no longer ambassador and was recalled to Baghdad. But
he refused to confirm whether he was still in the country.
	   Arab diplomats said al-Tikriti has sent a personal letter to
heads of diplomatic missions in Geneva telling them that he is no
longer a member of Iraq's diplomatic corps.
	   U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
al-Tikriti wrote to Vladimir Petrovsky, the head of the U.N. office
in Geneva, on Aug. 5th to say he was no longer ambassador. He then
wrote to Swiss authorities Aug. 30th to say the same, they said.
	   The dissidents said al-Tikriti has informed Arab diplomats that
he refused to return because of his feud with Saddam's eldest son,
Odai, who has long been groomed as the Iraqi leader's successor.
	   They said he was joined in exile by the second-ranking official
in the mission, Mohammed Abdel Aziz al-Douri, who is a brother of
Iraq's former intelligence chief, Saber al-Douri. Saber al-Douri is
currently the governor of Kerbala in southern Iraq.
	   The defection was the latest feud to visit Saddam's family,
particularly over the role of Odai.
	   Odai reportedly shot and wounded Sabawi in 1995 and bludgeoned
to death a favorite servant of Saddam in 1988. Reports at the time
said Odai was angry at the servant for arranging romantic liaisons
for Saddam and wanted to defend the honor of his mother, Sajida.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Britain and Austria called Wednesday
for an international investigation into what one official described
as the ``bestial'' massacre of ethnic Albanian men, women and
children in a Kosovo forest.
	   Even as outrage mounted over the slayings of as many as 18
people who were shot in the back of the head and mutilated, reports
emerged of a second killing spree last weekend, in which residents
of a nearby village claimed Serbs executed at least 13 men.
	   Residents of Golubovac, 35 kilometers (21 miles) west of
Pristina, said the victims were already buried, but pointed to
saucer-sized pools of dried blood and empty cartridges in front of
a fence where they said most of the refugees were shot.
	   ``They pointed to the men and took them beside my house,'' said
Naim Hodzaj, a 53-year-old farmer. ``They shot them all.''
	   The mass killings last weekend in the Drenica region, where
Serb-led forces were on their latest offensive against ethnic
Albanian rebels, are among the most gruesome developments reported
in eight months of all-out fighting in the separatist province of
Serbia.
	   There was no way to corroborate the ethnic Albanians' accounts.
Both sides have been accused of massacres in Kosovo, and Serb
police denied responsibility for the killings in nearby Obrija,
eight kilometers (five miles) north of Golubovac.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency called Western reports a
``media farce,'' and said the Obrija killing was staged to generate
more pressure on Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   In yet another part of Kosovo, the Vucitrn area northwest of
Pristina, Britain's Foreign Office said international monitors also
reported finding the bodies of 17 Albanians killed in fighting.
	   International officials were appalled by the killings of
civilians.
	   Austria, which holds the European Union presidency, called on
the EU to begin an investigation. Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel cited the ``bestial circumstances of this massacre,
certainly the killing of women and children.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said there was no
justification for the use of violence against civilians. He said
the Contact Group countries _ the United States, Britain, Germany,
France, Italy and Russia _ would meet Friday in London to find
``the way forward on a political settlement.''
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO officials said the Alliance was
unlikely to decide whether to launch attacks against the Serbs
until U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan presents a report to the
Security Council next week. The council has demanded an end to the
fighting and threatened unspecified, further measures if its order
is ignored.
	   Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain have offered
jetfighters for any NATO operation to enforce the council order.
Britain said it has four Harrier jets in Italy and four more on
standby if needed. NATO officials said U.S. cruise missiles were
ready for action in the Balkans.
	   There were no new reports about fighting or pullbacks by Serb
forces, who promised earlier this week to retreat to their barracks
after claiming victory over the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   A Serb police spokesman said police units were continuing to
withdraw, having established control over roads. Only occasional
gunshots could be heard in Drenica.
	   In a separate incident Wednesday, an ethnic Albanian doctor was
killed and three other members of the International Committee of
the Red Cross, including one foreigner _ a nurse from New Zealand _
were injured when their vehicle hit a landmine.
	   The explosion occurred on the Donje Obrinje-Likovac road, 30
kilometers (18 miles) west of Pristina, Serbian police and Red
Cross spokesman Roland Sidler in Geneva said.
	   The Serbs have been accused of hindering efforts to get outside
humanitarian aid to some of the estimated 275,000 people who have
been driven from their homes since the conflict exploded in
February.
	   In Golubovac, Hodzaj said that in addition to the executions,
Serb police had killed several other men individually, including
his 37-year-old brother Ramadan, who was doused with gasoline and
set on fire.
	   His brother's body lay curled up on a path on the edge of the
woods. The torso was badly burned but the legs and head were
untouched.
	   The slayings of the Obrija victims, whose bodies were seen this
week by diplomats and journalists in a Drenica forest, inflamed
tensions in Kosovo. Some were carved up with knives, limbs hacked
off; a 10-year-old boy had his throat slit.
	   ``We rule out any possibility that our members did something
like this,'' Serb police Col. Bozidar Filic said. ``In that area,
we had clashes with terrorists and a number of them have been
arrested.''
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch, whose staffers were in the
area, blamed the Serbs.
	   ``The massacre was clearly an attack on defenseless civilians
who were hiding in the woods,'' said Holly Cartner, executive
director of Human Rights Watch's European division. ``The Yugoslav
army and Serbian police are fighting a war against civilians, and
this is another sad example of the unspeakable atrocities being
committed against them.''

Zimbabwe wins third ODI

 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS margin of victory to 37 runs, Zimbabwe total to 259. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Craig Wishart nearly doubled his
previous best with a 102 and led Zimbabwe to a 37-run victory over
India in their third and final one-day international Wednesday.
	   His first one-day century, off 122 balls, almost doubled his
previous personal record of 53 and including two sixes and four
fours.
	   Wishart also formed a third-wicket partnership of 113 with Andy
Flower, who added 55 including two sixes and three fours, at the
Harare Sports Club.
	   India won the first two one-dayers on Saturday and Sunday, but
Wednesday's victory gave a boost to Zimbabwe heading into the
one-off test beginning Oct. 8 in Harare.
	   Led by Wishart, Zimbabwe reached 259 for five and then bowled
out India for 222 in 47.2 overs.
	   Sachin Tendulkar, playing in his 200th international, fell for
just two runs, caught at mid-wicket by Craig Evans off Heath
Streak.
	   Mohammad Azharuddin came in and very soon went out again, also
scoring just two. Some gallant efforts at recovery came from Robin
Singh, with 57 in 66 balls, and from Rahul Dravid (27) and Nayan
Mongia (25).
	   But Zimbabwe remained in control. After 25 overs, India needed
seven an over for victory and after 40 overs, the number jumped to
nine.

Genetic test reveals seriousness of heart rhythm disorder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Blood tests may soon allow doctors to predict
which people with a heart condition called long QT syndrome are at
risk of dying from the disorder.
	   Three separate genetic defects can cause this abnormality, which
results in fainting or sudden death.
	   A study in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine found that two of the genetic defects are likely to result
in fainting, while the third is more apt to cause death.
	   The researchers say this is the first time that doctors have
been able to predict the course of a form of heart disease by
analyzing a patient's genes.
	   Researchers said a blood test is being developed that will tell
patients which of the three genes is causing their disease.
	   The study was performed on 541 people with long QT syndrome. It
was conducted by Dr. Wojciech Zareba and others from the University
of Rochester.
	   About 25,000 Americans have long QT syndrome. About 3,000 die
without warning each year.
	   The disorder's name refers to a particular pattern of squiggles
on an electrocardiogram. It indicates that the heart muscle is
having difficulty recharging after it beats.

Agassi makes quick work of Pioline, then assails U.S. tennis

 &UR; Eds: AMs; ADDS name of incoming USTA president &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Andre Agassi spent more time lashing out
at the outgoing United States Tennis Association president
Wednesday than it took him to advance to the quarterfinals of the
Grand Slam Cup.
	   Agassi, trying to justify his absence from last weekend's U.S.
team's Davis Cup semifinal loss to Italy, said the outgoing USTA
president Harry Marmion was to blame for his refusal to play.
	   Without Agassi, Pete Sampras and Michael Chang, its top-ranked
stars, the U.S. team lost 4-1.
	   Agassi's post-match news conference took longer than his match _
a 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of Cedric Pioline in 34 minutes, the quickest
match since the inception of the Grand Slam Cup in 1990.
	   Agassi said he would have played the Davis Cup if the match had
been scheduled for the West Coast, nearer to his Las Vegas
residence, so that he could attend a charity event Saturday. Agassi
said the event raised dlrs 3.3 million for his foundation that
helps children.
	   ``It was very disappointing. I felt very bad for the guys over
there,'' Agassi said, adding that he had watched the match on
television.
	   ``It was very, very much the wrong call of the surface. The
court was very slow. We gave Italy the best chance possible and
they took advantage of it.''
	   The hard surface inside the Milwaukee Arena was chosen by the
Americans because it was supposed to favor their fast games. But it
played more like the clay courts the Italians grew up on.
	   Agassi and Sampras have been criticized for refusing to play
Davis Cup.
	   Agassi was upset by the choice of Milwaukee and said he wouldn't
play in the final if the United States advanced, declaring ``If it
was in my back yard, I wouldn't walk out the back door.''
	   ``I could have played on the West Coast, no problem,'' Agassi
said Wednesday, calling Marmion ``pathetic.''
	   ``You have to be pretty pathetic to take the best United States
Davis Cup player and absolutely make him never want to play
again,'' he said.
	   ``He won't pick what the players need, what's best for the team.
It's what's best for him,'' Agassi said.
	   Agassi said he had no problems playing for captain Tom
Gullikson, although ``he's made some decisions that have been
difficult for me to understand.''
	   ``Once Harry Marmion is out, I'll try to start new again with
the next president,'' Agassi said. ``Thank God his term is done.''
	   Marmion's term expires at the end of the year. He is expected to
be replaced by Judy Levering, who has been nominated as the next
president. She will take over Jan. 1 if no other candidate files by
Oct. 26.
	   Agassi made clear it did not mean he was ready to play Davis Cup
again. ``I wouldn't be able to deliver on that one.''
	   Agassi said Marmion was also against him receiving a wild card
for this lucrative dlrs 6.7 million tournament that nominally
brings together players with best records in the year's four Grand
Slam events _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
	   But three men's Grand Slam champions of the year have decided to
skip the tournament despite its huge prize money _ Wimbledon
champion and top-ranked Pete Sampras, U.S. Open champion Patrick
Rafter and Carlos Moya, the French Open champion. Only Australian
Open champion Petr Korda is among the 12 men here.
	   With the men's side lacking top stars, Agassi was given a wild
card to give some luster to the event.
	   A former No. 1 who is making a comeback after dropping out of
the top 100, Agassi has won four titles this year. But his Grand
Slam record for the year is relatively poor: Round of 16 at the
Australian and the U.S. Open his best showing.
	   He lived up to his part of the bargain, but Pioline did not
provide much opposition.
	   Agassi, ranked No. 8 in the world, picked apart Pioline's serve
with sizzling returns and the Frenchman never had a chance.
	   Pioline blamed painful knees for his dismal performance and
admitted that money played a big role in his decision to play.
	   ``Yeah, that's a big point, for sure,'' he said.
	   For 34 minutes of work, Agassi earned dlrs 175,000 _ dlrs 5,147
a minute. Pioline picked up dlrs 100,000 given to first-round
losers _ dlrs 2,941 a minute.
	   In a women's quarterfinal, Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna
double-faulted on her match point at 5-4 in the second set and went
on to lose 2-6, 7-5, 7-5 to Patty Schnyder.
	   In another men's first-round match, Karol Kucera beat Hicham
Arazi 6-4, 6-4.

	   Mohammad Azharuddin came in and very soon went out again, also
scoring just two. Some gallant efforts at recovery came from Robin
Singh, with 57 in 66 balls, and from Rahul Dravid (27) and Nayan
Mongia (25).
	   But Zimbabwe remained in control. After 25 overs, India needed
seven an over for victory and after 40 overs, the number jumped to
nine.

Swiss federation gives cyclists eight month bans, fines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss Cycling Federation has handed
down eight month bans to three cyclists expelled from the
scandal-rocked Tour de France for using an illegal
performance-boosting drug, the body announced Wednesday.
	   The federation's special anti-doping commission also fined
riders Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux und Armin Meier 3,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 2,164) each.
	   The bans on the cyclists will take effect immediately, the
commission said.
	   The federation's sentences must still be approved by cycling's
world governing body UCI.
	   The three cyclists were members of the Festina team thrown out
of this year's Tour de France.
	   Festina was expelled because its riders were said to have taken
the hormone EPO. Zuelle, Dufaux and Meier were among those who
later admitted taking the drug.

Snapshots of Israel's solemnest _ and quietest _ day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Even the stoplights stopped.
	   On Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, a raucous and
contentious country stood all but stock-still, coming as close as
Israel ever gets to collective silence.
	   For the 24 hours ending at sundown Wednesday, there were no
buses, no trains, no planes. Almost no one drove but ambulances. No
shops, no restaurants, no businesses were open. In this nation of
news junkies, there was no radio, no TV, no newspapers.
	   It is a day of inwardness and introspection, fasting and prayer.
For Jews the world over, the Day of Atonement is a concerted
communal effort to be at one with God and one another.
	   ``We're supposed to afflict the flesh,'' said Danny Hendrickson,
a singer in the choir at Jerusalem's soaring Great Synagogue. Like
others throughout Israel, it was packed with worshippers, including
many secular Jews who attend only once a year.
	   A big, burly man, Hendrickson freely acknowledges that singing
and chanting for an entire day with nothing to eat or drink would
be ``torture'' if not for the spiritual rewards.
	   ``In a strange way,'' he said, ``it's the year's happiest day.''
	   ___
	   Depending on the degree of observance, Yom Kippur's demands go
well beyond the prohibition on eating, drinking and driving. Many
Jews eschew use of any machinery, refrain from wearing leather
shoes as a sign of humility, renounce sex and smoking, give up
soaps and perfumes.
	   ``It's not that any of these things _ physical indulgences _ are
in themselves bad, but this is one day in which material aspects of
life are not to intrude,'' said Rabbi David Rosen, head of the
Israel branch of the Anti-Defamation League.
	   Beforehand, many religious Jews visit the mikvah, or ritual
bath. The secular, for their part, stock up on videos to pass the
long quiet hours.
	   For one day, Jerusalem becames a city of walkers. People stroll
down the center of boulevards normally jammed with honking cars,
and children rocket through empty streets on bikes and skateboards.
	   Some kids have too much fun; more than 150 were hurt taking
spills, hospitals said afterward.
	   A few tourists were unprepared for the scope of the shutdown. At
hotels inside Israel, only cold food or none was available. Taxis
were impossible to find, and idled tour buses littered the
sidewalks like beached whales.
	   Peter McDermott, a visiting Australian, said the effect was
eerie but somehow compelling. ``I guess we're seeing the country at
a special time,'' he said.
	   ___
	   More than any other, this holiday gives a glimpse of the gulf
dividing Israel and the Palestinians, even near neighbors.
	   While commercial districts in Jewish neighborhoods were silent
and shuttered, life kept to its usual bustling pace in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   ``Everything is normal _ why not?'' said sidewalk greengrocer
Ali Mansour, proffering fresh mint leaves just outside the massive,
crenellated Damascus Gate. ``It's just another day.''
	   Until news broadcasts resumed after sundown, most Israelis were
unaware of violent new clashes in the West Bank that left at least
17 Palestinians and nine Israeli troops hurt.
	   Even though Israel had sealed off the Palestinian lands _ its
usual practice on Jewish holidays _ drivers of communal taxis in
east Jerusalem solicited passengers for West Bank towns. They would
use back roads to slip around military checkpoints.
	   ``Ramallah, Ramallah!'' one driver yelled. Asked how he planned
to get there, he bent an arm and hooked it overhead _ an evocative
gesture meaning to do something in roundabout way.
	   ____
	   All those who keep the Yom Kippur fast have their own way of
getting through it. Hendrickson, the choir singer, swallows bunches
of whole grapes beforehand _ ``like little time-release capsules of
liquid,'' he said.
	   The Yom Kippur liturgy is at once self-lacerating and uplifting.
Prayers speak of having sinned against God in thoughts and words,
through hardened hearts. One passage even lists a sin for every
letter of the Hebrew alphabet.
	   ``It's meant to instill a state of self-examination, but in the
end to inspire and encourage,'' said Rosen, the rabbi. By sundown,
when synagogue services end with a blast of the shofar, or ram's
horn, exhaustion has often given way to elation.
	   Hendrickson says as the hours pass, he finds himself carried
along by the day's special rhythms: the marriage of music and
prayer, the give-and-take of cantor and choir, the delicate balance
of public performance and personal contemplation.
	   ``For just this one day,'' he said, ``we all try to be angels.''

Governor acknowledges pro-Japanese sentiment on disputed islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A regional governor acknowledged Wednesday there
is pro-Japanese sentiment on the Kuril Islands because of Russia's
current economic crisis, but insisted most residents want to remain
part of Russia.
	   ``There is no denying that such sentiments exist, but it would
be an exaggeration to say that most residents of the Sakhalin
region are calling for the Southern Kurils to be transferred to
Japan,'' said Sakhalin Gov. Igor Farkhutdinov.
	   ``Sakhalin residents are seriously discontented with federal
government, but an absolute majority of them do not link their
well-being to a change of citizenship,'' he said at a news
conference in Moscow.
	   The islands, north of Japan and east of the Russian mainland,
were claimed by the Soviet Union after World War II, and remain a
major point of contention.

<TEXT>
	   USEDOM, Germany (AP) _ Spruced up spuds - or the plain old
potato in all its delicious forms - are to be featured at hotels
and restaurants on the Baltic sea island of Usedom, the
organization of cooks there said Wednesday.
	   The ``Potato Days'' from Oct. 1-18 are being staged to wipe out
the image of the potato as ordinary fare, gourmet cooks on the
island say.
	   They're promising visitors to Usedom such tantalizing tuber
specialties as ``potato souffle with amaretto sauce, potato chunks
seaman's style, and potatoes with apples, pears and strips of
bacon.''
	   Potatoes are ``tubers with unending possibilities,'' the
organizers say.
	   The potato is believed native to South America and was
introduced to Europe in the 17th century.

Saddam's half brother refuses to return to Baghdad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's half brother, who served as
Iraq's ambassador to the U.N. headquarters in Geneva, has refused
to return to Iraq after his diplomatic service ended last month,
Iraqi dissidents and Arab diplomats said Wednesday.
	   His defection would mark the second-biggest break in Saddam's
troubled family since the end of the 1991 Gulf War. Saddam's two
sons-in-law defected to Amman, Jordan, in 1996, only to be killed
upon their return to Iraq a few months later.
	   The half brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, was among 30 Iraqi
ambassadors and other diplomats recalled to Baghdad in recent weeks
in a major diplomatic reshuffle ordered by the Iraqi president.
	   Al-Tikriti has since sent his resignation to Saddam telling him
he will not go back to Baghdad under any circumstances, said the
dissidents, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Saddam immediately put under house arrest al-Tikriti's two
brothers _ Sabawi, a former security chief, and Watban, a former
interior minister _ following the defection, they said.
	   Al-Tikriti has received permanent residency in Switzerland as a
businessman, the dissidents told The Associated Press in telephone
interviews from several European capitals. Vera Britsch,
spokeswoman for Switzerland's Federal Office for Refugees, said
they were not aware of any asylum request involving al-Tikriti.
	   A spokesman for the Iraqi mission in Geneva confirmed that
al-Tikriti is no longer ambassador and was recalled to Baghdad. But
he refused to confirm whether he was still in the country.
	   Arab diplomats said al-Tikriti has sent a personal letter to
heads of diplomatic missions in Geneva telling them that he is no
longer a member of Iraq's diplomatic corps.
	   U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
al-Tikriti wrote to Vladimir Petrovsky, the head of the U.N. office
in Geneva, on Aug. 5th to say he was no longer ambassador. He then
wrote to Swiss authorities Aug. 30th to say the same, they said.
	   The dissidents said al-Tikriti has informed Arab diplomats that
he refused to return because of his feud with Saddam's eldest son,
Odai, who has long been groomed as the Iraqi leader's successor.
	   They said he was joined in exile by the second-ranking official
in the mission, Mohammed Abdel Aziz al-Douri, who is a brother of
Iraq's former intelligence chief, Saber al-Douri. Saber al-Douri is
currently the governor of Kerbala in southern Iraq.
	   The defection was the latest feud over the role of Odai.
	   Odai reportedly shot and wounded Sabawi in 1995 and bludgeoned
to death a favorite servant of Saddam in 1988. Reports at the time
said Odai was angry at the servant for arranging romantic liaisons
for Saddam and wanted to defend the honor of his mother, Sajida.

Bomb damages office belonging to Ecuadorian president's party

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ An office belonging to President Jamil
Mahuad's Popular Democracy party was bombed Wednesday on the eve of
a national strike by leftist unions against the government's
economic reforms.
	   The bomb blew a hole in the building's main door in Guayaquil,
Ecuador's largest city, 165 miles (270 kilometers) southwest of the
capital Quito. No injuries were reported, police said.
	   Another bomb exploded on Tuesday in the headquarters of
Ecuador's Bishops Conference in an attack the government linked to
a strike call by the United Workers Front, Ecuador's largest labor
federation.
	   The bomb damaged several rooms in the bishop's conference
building. Glass shards from broken windows cut a Spanish nun.
	   The Catholic Church has agreed to carry out a census of
Ecuador's poor to determine who is eligible for a dlrs
16.40-a-month welfare payment Mahuad announced to ease the sting of
his economic austerity package.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the bombs. Union
representatives have denied they were behind them.
	   A reinforced police guard surrounded the government palace and
Catholic churches in downtown Quito on Wednesday after rumors
circulated that protesters would occupy a church to highlight their
demands.
	   The 24-hour strike called for Thursday is to force the
government to retreat on economic reforms that have devalued the
national currency and ended subsidies on cooking gas, electricity
and diesel fuel, sending prices soaring by up to 400 percent.
	   Mahuad has said the tough measures announced Sep. 14 were
necessary to end 40 percent inflation and reduce a ballooning
budget deficit that has the small Andean nation on the verge of
bankruptcy.
	   The strike has the support of highland Indian groups, which on
Monday began blocking highways in Ecuador's mountainous interior.
Oil workers have threatened to stop production. Oil is Ecuador's
principal export.
	   Police and soldiers on Wednesday cleared the highways of rocks
and tree trunks placed there by protesters.
	   Former President Abdala Bucaram was removed from power in 1997
by Congress after a leftist unions led strikes and wave of protests
against a similar economic austerity package he had implemented.

personal firearms, trims pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested three more suspects
Wednesday on suspicion of planning last month's car-bomb slaughter
in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh.
	   Since the Aug. 15 bombing, police on both sides of the Irish
border have arrested 18 other people suspected of involvement. All
were eventually freed without charge.
	   The attack by Irish Republican Army dissidents killed 29 people
and wounded 370 others, the bloodiest single strike in three
decades of conflict over Northern Ireland.
	   Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's police commander announced that
several security fortifications near the border would be scaled
down or dismantled soon in response to the IRA's 14-month-old
truce.
	   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said his forces this weekend
also would stop requiring backup from soldiers at two road
checkpoints along the border near Londonderry, the province's
second-largest city.
	   The announcement followed last week's withdrawal of about 400 of
more than 16,000 soldiers based in Northern Ireland. Such gestures
are designed to appeal to supporters of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party, which has long demanded the withdrawal of all troops.
	   April's peace agreement kept Northern Ireland firmly linked to
Britain, but the British government pledged to reduce army
deployments and to reform the province's predominantly Protestant
police force.
	   The accord also called on the IRA to destroy its hidden stores
of weaponry by mid-2000. So far, the IRA has refused, citing the
legal weapons held by police, soldiers and Protestant civilians.
	   But the British army admitted Wednesday that 160 members of its
locally recruited unit, the Royal Irish Regiment, had voluntarily
handed in their personal protection firearms in recognition that
the IRA no longer posed a threat to them.
	   The more than 5,000 members of the predominantly Protestant
regiment have long carried army-issue handguns when off duty
because of the threat from IRA assassins.
	   The army headquarters in Northern Ireland said officers had
confiscated the personal firearms held by another 20 members of the
regiment, which many Catholics consider threatening.

New prime ministers consults with allies on forming new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)- Pandeli Majko, the newly appointed
Socialist prime minister, started talks Wednesday with allied
parties to form a new Cabinet.
	   But the opposition said there will be no dialogue with the new
government and announced more protests.
	   Majko, the 30-year-old general secretary of the Socialist Party,
was nominated by his party Tuesday to replace Fatos Nano, who
resigned late Monday.
	   Majko was expected to announce the names of the new ministers on
Thursday. But with the opposition determined to boycott Parliament
and remain in the street, Albania was unlikely to emerge from the
deep political crisis any time soon.
	   Nano's resignation came after he failed to win approval for
Cabinet changes following riots two weeks ago that were caused by
the assassination of a popular opposition leader.
	   About 3,000 supporters of former President Sali Berisha, who
heads the opposition Democratic Party, gathered Wednesday in Tirana
to protest the appointment of the new prime minister.
	   Berisha told his supporters that there would be no dialogue with
the new government and that street protests would continue.
	   ``One clan was replaced with another. One terrorist government
was replaced with another terrorist government,'' said Berisha.
	   On Tuesday, Berisha proposed that the new government have a
broader base, with the participation of more parties outside the
government coalition.
	   However, the idea was rejected by all parties in the governing
coalition.
	   Berisha called for another anti-government rally to be held on
on Saturday.

Former KC relief pitcher dead at 45
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG TUCKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ Dan Quisenberry, a premier reliev
pitcher with the Kansas City Royals known for his quick wit and
underhanded delivery, has died of a brain tumor at age 45.
	   Quisenberry, a three-time U.S. Major League Baseball All-Star
who helped the Royals win two American League titles and the 1985
World Series, underwent surgery in January and June, but doctors
were unable to remove all of the malignant tumor. He was diagnosed
with his illness in December 1997.
	   The Royals confirmed Wednesday that Quisenberry had died, but
would not release details on when or where. KCTV reported that he
died this morning at his home in Leawood, Kansas.
	   In his 12-year career, Quisenberry led the American League in
saves five times, and his 45 saves in 1983 was the MLB at the time.
	   Pale and skinny, ``Quiz'' was never physically imposing. His
awkward-looking pitching release never had the speed compared to
contemporaries such as Rich Gossage.
	   ``I lull them into a false sense of security by letting them
watch me pitch,'' Quisenberry once explained. ``If overconfidence
can cause the Roman Empire to fall, I ought to be able to get a
ground ball.''
	   An inveterate jokester, his humor frequently was directed at
himself. Once, when he came out of a prolonged slump, he said, ``I
found a delivery in my flaw.'' Another time, when he was asked
about his contract, he quipped: ``It has guarantees until the year
2020 _ or until the last `Rocky' movie is made.''

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Even the stoplights stopped.
	   On Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, a raucous and
contentious country stood all but stock-still, coming as close as
Israel ever gets to collective silence.
	   For the 24 hours ending at sundown Wednesday, there were no
buses, no trains, no planes. Almost no one drove but ambulances. No
shops, no restaurants, no businesses were open. In this nation of
news junkies, there was no radio, no TV, no newspapers.
	   It is a day of inwardness and introspection, fasting and prayer.
For Jews the world over, the Day of Atonement is a concerted
communal effort to be at one with God and one another.
	   ``We're supposed to afflict the flesh,'' said Danny Hendrickson,
a singer in the choir at Jerusalem's soaring Great Synagogue. Like
others throughout Israel, it was packed with worshippers, including
many secular Jews who attend only once a year.
	   A big, burly man, Hendrickson freely acknowledges that singing
and chanting for an entire day with nothing to eat or drink would
be ``torture'' if not for the spiritual rewards.
	   ``In a strange way,'' he said, ``it's the year's happiest day.''
	   ___
	   Depending on the degree of observance, Yom Kippur's demands go
well beyond the prohibition on eating, drinking and driving. Many
Jews eschew use of any machinery, refrain from wearing leather
shoes as a sign of humility, renounce sex and smoking, give up
soaps and perfumes.
	   ``It's not that any of these things _ physical indulgences _ are
in themselves bad, but this is one day in which material aspects of
life are not to intrude,'' said Rabbi David Rosen, head of the
Israel branch of the Anti-Defamation League.
	   Beforehand, many religious Jews visit the mikvah, or ritual
bath. The secular, for their part, stock up on videos to pass the
long quiet hours.
	   For one day, Jerusalem becames a city of walkers. People stroll
down the center of boulevards normally jammed with honking cars,
and children rocket through empty streets on bikes and skateboards.
	   Some kids have too much fun; more than 150 were hurt taking
spills, hospitals said afterward.
	   A few tourists were unprepared for the scope of the shutdown. At
hotels inside Israel, only cold food or none was available. Taxis
were impossible to find, and idled tour buses littered the
sidewalks like beached whales.
	   Peter McDermott, a visiting Australian, said the effect was
eerie but somehow compelling. ``I guess we're seeing the country at
a special time,'' he said.
	   ___
	   More than any other, this holiday gives a glimpse of the gulf
dividing Israel and the Palestinians, even near neighbors.
	   While commercial districts in Jewish neighborhoods were silent
and shuttered, life kept to its usual bustling pace in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   ``Everything is normal _ why not?'' said sidewalk greengrocer
Ali Mansour, proffering fresh mint leaves just outside the massive,
crenellated Damascus Gate. ``It's just another day.''
	   Until news broadcasts resumed after sundown, most Israelis were
unaware of violent new clashes in the West Bank that left at least
17 Palestinians and nine Israeli troops hurt.
	   Even though Israel had sealed off the Palestinian lands _ its
usual practice on Jewish holidays _ drivers of communal taxis in
east Jerusalem solicited passengers for West Bank towns. They would
use back roads to slip around military checkpoints.
	   ``Ramallah, Ramallah!'' one driver yelled. Asked how he planned
to get there, he bent an arm and hooked it overhead _ an evocative
gesture meaning to do something in roundabout way.
	   ____
	   All those who keep the Yom Kippur fast have their own way of
getting through it. Hendrickson, the choir singer, swallows bunches
of whole grapes beforehand _ ``like little time-release capsules of
liquid,'' he said.
	   The Yom Kippur liturgy is at once self-lacerating and uplifting.
Prayers speak of having sinned against God in thoughts and words,
through hardened hearts. One passage even lists a sin for every
letter of the Hebrew alphabet.
	   ``It's meant to instill a state of self-examination, but in the
end to inspire and encourage,'' said Rosen, the rabbi. By sundown,
when synagogue services end with a blast of the shofar, or ram's
horn, exhaustion has often given way to elation.
	   Hendrickson says as the hours pass, he finds himself carried
along by the day's special rhythms: the marriage of music and
prayer, the give-and-take of cantor and choir, the delicate balance
of public performance and personal contemplation.
	   ``For just this one day,'' he said, ``we all try to be angels.''

Swiss federation gives cyclists eight-month bans, fines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss Cycling Federation has handed
down eight month bans to three cyclists expelled from the
scandal-rocked Tour de France for using an illegal
performance-enhancing drug, the body announced Wednesday.
	   The federation's special anti-doping commission also fined
riders Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux und Armin Meier 3,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 2,164) each.
	   The bans on the cyclists will take effect immediately, the
commission said.
	   The federation's sentences must still be approved by cycling's
world governing body, the International Cycling Union (UCI).
	   The three cyclists were members of the Festina team thrown out
of this year's Tour de France.
	   Festina was expelled because its riders were said to have taken
the hormone EPO. Zuelle, Dufaux and Meier were among those who
later admitted taking the drug.

Spain begins trial run of euro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MALAGA, Spain (AP) _ The euro came to town Wednesday for a
four-day test run in a carnival atmosphere.
	   People in this southern city and surrounding region were allowed
to buy up to 4,600 pesetas' worth (dlrs 32) of a specially minted
version of Europe's planned single currency.
	   For security reasons, only coins were available. The exchange
rate was 168 pesetas to the euro.
	   In Malaga's Churriana neighborhood, residents filled the streets
and peered from balconies as Finance Minister Rodrigo Rato bought
euros at a bank, then spent them at various shops.
	   ``We are trying to work with the conclusions and experiences of
the other (euro-zone) nations, and also determine what sort of
problems we may develop ourselves,'' Rato said.
	   While other members of the euro zone have already staged trial
runs of the euro, this is the first such test in Spain.
	   Although the euro will be launched on Jan. 1, the new coins and
notes won't actually become available to the public until 2002.
	   Jesus Fernandez, a pharmacist and lifelong resident of
Churriana, was the first to exchange euros with Rato. He sold him a
packet of cold medicine for 2.90 euros.
	   ``Everyone _ shopkeepers and clients _ here in Churriana is
collaborating on this project,'' Fernandez said.
	   At his final stop, Rato ducked into a bar for a soft drink.
	   Owner Antonio Jimenez beamed: ``The minister tipped me six
cents.''

Brazil to play Confederations Cup games in Guadalajara

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ World Cup runners-up Brazil and three
other teams will play their Confederations Cup group matches in
Guadalajara, Mexico, FIFA announced Wednesday.
	   The Mexican organizing committee chose the city's Jalisco
Stadium to host the six Group B matches rather than Monterrey or
Queretaro because of the weather and the larger 50,000 capacity of
the stadium, a FIFA press release said.
	   Another factor, the press release said, is Brazil's popularity
among the local fans. Brazil played in Guadalajara in the 1970 and
1986 World Cups.
	   The stadium will also host a semifinal match and the match for
third place.
	   The tournament will be played from January 8-20 and the draw for
the two groups will be made in Mexico City on Sunday.
	   The United States, Mexico, Bolivia, Brazil, France, Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and the winner of the current Oceania contest in
Brisbane, Australia, will participate in the eight-nation
tournament.

Iraqi nuclear scientist gets British asylum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An Iraqi nuclear scientist has won political
asylum in Britain after convincing immigration officials he would
be forced to work on atomic weapons research if returned to his
homeland.
	   The scientist, who has a doctorate in thermonuclear physics from
a British university, successfully appealed a deportation order
after a two-year legal fight. His identity has been kept secret
because he fears for family members who live in Iraq.
	   The man, who is married and has two young children born in
Britain, told immigration officials he was opposed to weapons
research.
	   He is now living in the northern England city of Manchester,
where he is studying to be a teacher, said his lawyer, Paul Morris.
	   Morris said the scientist was ``hugely relieved'' at the
decision announced Wednesday by the Immigration Appellate
Authority, after his appeals had been rejected three times by
Britain's Home Office.
	   ``On the balance of probabilities, his desire to remain in the
country arises from a genuine fear he will be persecuted if he
returns to Iraq and refuses to work in a military establishment,''
the ruling said.
	   The Home Office said it could not discuss applications for
political asylum when the person involved did not wish to be
identified.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's half brother, who served as
Iraq's ambassador to the U.N. headquarters in Geneva, has refused
to return to Iraq after his diplomatic service ended last month,
Iraqi dissidents and Arab diplomats said Wednesday.
	   His defection would mark the second-biggest break in Saddam's
troubled family since the end of the 1991 Gulf War. Saddam's two
sons-in-law defected to Amman, Jordan, in 1995, only to be killed

 &UR; Schroeder lends tacit support to NATO preparations for Kosovo
strikes

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ German chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder on
Wednesday lent tacit support for the outgoing German government's
decision to offer planes for possible NATO air strikes in Kosovo.
	   ``There's nothing to support or welcome about this,'' the head
of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) said. ``Today what was decided
follows the logic of earlier decisions the SPD found to be
correct.''
	   Schroeder, speaking to a news conference after meetings with
French leaders, also said such an intervention ``can only happen
with a U.N. mandate.'' But he also left open that ``if the
situation modifies, we may have to take a new position.''
	   Schroeder was visiting France following his party's victory
Sunday in Germany's parliamentary elections.
	   The government of outgoing conservative Chancellor Helmut Kohl
on Wednesday offered 14 fighter planes following a NATO request for
commitments of military equipment to raise the pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
	   ``The logical consequence has begun with the effort by NATO to
plan an intervention,'' Schroeder said. ``When you plan an
intervention, the logical consequence is you have to figure out who
does it and if you do it.''
	   But, he said, ``the decision on who goes has not happened. The
German government can't decide alone.''
	   The Social Democrats have insisted on U.N. approval for
international intervention, and the Greens, who could be take the
Foreign Ministry portfolio in a coalition Schroeder must negotiate,
have also demanded it.
	   Schroeder's position appeared to clash with the Social
Democratic foreign policy coordinator, Guenter Verheugen, who
backed away from that stance Wednesday by suggesting international
law could be short-circuited for humanitarian reasons.

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Two hand grenades were thrown Wednesday
at Israeli security forces in a downtown Hebron square, injuring 11
Israeli troops and 11 Palestinian civilians, an army official said.
One Israeli was in serious condition,
	   Soldiers opened fire on the assailant, apparently a Palestinian,
who fled into the Palestinian-controlled sector of divided Hebron,
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The man
apparently was shot in the leg during the pursuit.
	   The army poured reinforcements into Hebron, a troubled town of
130,000 Palestinian and 450 Jewish settlers, and imposed a curfew
on 30,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled sector.
	   Tensions in Hebron have been rising since the Aug. 20 killing of
a settler rabbi, apparently by a Palestinian militant. Last week,
shots were fired at a settler car near Hebron, without causing
injury, and on Monday an Israeli woman was wounded by shots fired
from the Palestinian sector.
	   In response, settlers have beaten Palestinian bystanders and
overturned tables in the downtown outdoor market.
	   In a related development, Israel TV's Channel Two said that
Palestinian security forces raided a Hamas bomb factory in Hebron
Tuesday night, seizing 300 kilos (640 pounds) of explosives and
half a ton of materials used in making bombs. The report said it
was the largest Hamas laboratory uncovered so far.
	   Wednesday's violence erupted during Yom Kippur, the holiest day
on the Jewish calendar, as Israeli troops enforced a blanket
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   The bloodshed came amid intensive U.S. efforts to broker an
agreement on an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West
Bank. Under a compromise, 3 percent of that land is to be set aside
as a nature reserve in which Israel retains control over security.
	   Earlier this week, U.S. President Bill Clinton hosted Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat separately and then in a three-way summit. Israeli and U.S.
officials were upbeat, saying the land issue had been resolved.
	   However, Palestinian negotiators said Wednesday that some
differences remained. Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian
representative in Washington, said one of the points of contention
was whether Palestinian police could enter the nature reserve.
	   Palestinian negotiators said Wednesday that U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Mideast envoy Dennis Ross are to
return to the region on Tuesday to prepare another Mideast summit
in Washington in mid-October.
	   The Hebron incident began at about 4:30 p.m. (1430 gmt) in
downtown Gross Square when an assailant threw two grenades. One
grenade rolled under a white station wagon and the second landed
near a group of Israeli troops before exploding.
	   The station wagone and a yellow van caught fire, with thick
smoke rising from the scorched vehicles.
	   The blast injured five soldiers and six officers from the
paramilitary border police, as well as 11 Palestinians, the army
and Palestinian doctors said. One Israeli was seriously wounded,
two were in moderate condition and the rest had light injuries.
	   In other developments Wednesday, some 400 Palestinians threw
stones at Israeli soldiers near the West Bank village of Biddou.
Troops fired rubber bullets, injuring six Palestinians.
	   The clashes erupted after the funeral of a Hamas activist,
Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, who was killed Tuesday when a car rigged
with powerful explosives blew up in the industrial zone of the
village of Beitunia, near the town of Ramallah.
	   Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid, two Hamas activists who survived the
blast, denied they were preparing the car for a bombing attack in
Israel, Palestinian police officials said.
	   The Abu Eid brothers told Palestinian investigators that just
before the explosion, they met an Israeli Arab man in a car in the
Beitunia industrial zone, expecting him to deliver three guns for
dlrs 1,000. The man delivered a package and got out of the car
before the explosion went off, they said.
	   A caller to a Palestinian media center, saying he spoke for
Hamas, claimed that Israel was behind the bombing. However, Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar, said the group was still investigating the
incident.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
over renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to carry
out suicide bombings in the Jewish state. Hamas wants to avenge the
recent killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.

Bulgaria faces possible FIFA suspension over federation ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Bulgaria meeting in 9th thru 11th grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Bulgaria could face suspension by
FIFA over a government decision to ban the national federation from
running soccer affairs, a spokesman for the game's world governing
body said Wednesday.
	   FIFA contacted the Bulgarian federation at the beginning of this
week over the affair, but has set no deadline for authorities to
act, spokesman Keith Cooper said.
	   ``It's not a dramatic situation at the moment,'' Cooper added.
But ``it is within our power to suspend the federation from
international activity.''
	   In mid-September, the government Committee of Youth, Physical
Training and Sports banned the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) from
running soccer affairs, accusing it of failing to react to a
positive doping test of a local player.
	   The committee, which is empowered to license sports
organizations and teams, said it was revoking the license of the
BFU and gave it to the Professional Soccer League.
	   That move is ``not acceptable to us,'' FIFA spokesman Cooper
said. But there is no reason to suppose England's European
Championship qualifying match against Bulgaria on Oct. 10 is in
danger, he said.
	   The government committee said the BFU broke international and
Bulgarian regulations by allowing player Ilya Gruev to be included
in the national team although he had tested positive for
performance-enhancing substances in April. Gruev plays for
Neftochimik in the Black Sea city of Burgas.
	   The BFU is headed by Ivan Slavkov, son-in-law of late communist
ruler Todor Zhivkov. Slavkov has been criticized because of
Bulgaria's poor World Cup performance. The team was eliminated in
the first round of this summer's finals.
	   Bulgarian lawmakers on Wednesday tried for three hours to
arrange a deal between the committee and the BFU. Officials from
both sides promised to start talks as soon as possible for the
committee to return the BFU its license if it punishes Gruev.
	   The BFU has appealed its suspension before Bulgaria's supreme
court, which is scheduled to rule on the case Oct. 20, BFU
spokesman Ivan Vutsov said. The body remains in charge until then,
he added.
	   ``In the interest of Bulgarian soccer we suggest that you settle
things between you before the case is brought to the court,''
Borislav Kitov, head of the parliamentary commission, told
officials.
	   In August, Poland narrowly escaped indefinite suspension by FIFA
with a last-minute move by the country's sport minister to comply
with a deadline for the reinstatement of suspended administrators.

New prime ministers consults with allies on forming new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Pandeli Majko, the newly appointed
Socialist prime minister, started talks Wednesday with allied
parties to form a new Cabinet.
	   But the opposition said there will be no dialogue with the new
government and announced more protests.
	   Majko, the 30-year-old general secretary of the Socialist Party,
was nominated by his party Tuesday to replace Fatos Nano, who
resigned late Monday.
	   Majko was expected to announce the names of the new ministers on
Thursday. But with the opposition determined to boycott Parliament
and remain in the street, Albania was unlikely to emerge from the
deep political crisis any time soon.
	   Nano's resignation came after he failed to win approval for
Cabinet changes following riots two weeks ago that were caused by
the assassination of a popular opposition leader.
	   About 3,000 supporters of former President Sali Berisha, who
heads the opposition Democratic Party, gathered Wednesday in Tirana
to protest the appointment of the new prime minister.
	   Berisha told his supporters that there would be no dialogue with
the new government and that street protests would continue.
	   ``One clan was replaced with another. One terrorist government
was replaced with another terrorist government,'' said Berisha.
	   On Tuesday, Berisha proposed that the new government have a
broader base, with the participation of more parties outside the
government coalition.
	   However, the idea was rejected by all parties in the governing
coalition.
	   Berisha called for another anti-government rally to be held on
Saturday.

Britain wants Security Council meeting on Kosovo, NATO finalizes
</HEADLINE>
preparations &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Britain called Wednesday for an emergency
meeting of the Security Council to condemn the massacre of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo while NATO finalized preparations for
airstrikes against Serb forces.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook called for a Thursday
council meeting, telling a news conference in London there was ``no
justification for any violence against the civilian population in
Kosovo.''
	   He warned NATO airstrikes could come after the U.N. chief
reports on the situation. The report could come as early as the end
of the week, U.N. officials said.
	   Serb police denied responsibility Wednesday for the massacre, in
which 18 men, women and children were shot in the back of the head
and mutilated.
	   The slaying of the victims, whose bodies were seen Tuesday by
diplomats and journalists in a forest in the Drenica region west of
Pristina, have inflamed tensions in Kosovo, where the ethnic
Albanian majority is fighting for independence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed, and over a quarter million
have fled their homes since a Serb crackdown began in February. The
West supports autonomy for Kosovo but not independence.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan was due to report on whether Serbia
had complied with a Sept. 23 council resolution that called for a
cease-fire in Kosovo, a withdrawal of Serbian troops, and the start
of ``serious dialogue on real autonomy'' for the province.
	   In its resolution, the council threatened unspecified additional
measures if both sides failed to comply with the resolution. The
resolution is militarily enforceable, but it did not explicitly
authorize NATO action.
	   Cook, whose country takes over the Security Council presidency
on Thursday, said NATO airstrikes could follow the receipt of
Annan's report.
	   ``Military action will flow from a political decision,'' he
said.
	   NATO was close to finalizing military preparations for
airstrikes against Serb forces in Kosovo, officials said Wednesday
in Brussels. Alliance ambassadors, however, were also awaiting
Annan's report before deciding whether to order airstrikes.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China are steadfastly
opposed to any use of force in Kosovo. China abstained from last
week's resolution, claiming that the fighting in Kosovo didn't
constitute a threat to international peace and security.
	   Russia signed off on the resolution, but argued that another
resolution was required for council authorization of military
action. Both Russia and China could veto any new resolution.
	   ``We are now in contact with other council members on taking
this forward,'' a British official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. He gave no details on what Britain sought from the
meeting.
	   It wasn't clear if Britain would push for a resolution
condemning the slayings, which would be backed by international
law, or a statement reflecting the consensus of the council.

Tajikistan: Afghan war could spread refugees, terrorism and drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The recent offensive by Afghanistan's
Taliban religious militia could force a flood of refugees from that
country and spread terrorism, arms and drugs across Central Asia,
Tajikistan's foreign minister warned on Wednesday.
	   ``We, together with our nearest neighbors and Russia, are very
seriously concerned about the threat, emanating from Afghanistan,
of destabilization of the situation in the entire Central Asia,''
Talbak Nazarov told the U.N. General Assembly.
	   He said his country particularly feared the ``possibility of
mass and spontaneous influx of Afghan refugees across the border to
Tajikistan'' and the spread of terrorism, arms and drugs.
	   Tajikistan shares a 1,200-kilometer (750-mile) border with
Afghanistan.
	   Tajikistan and the other former Soviet republics in Central Asia
have been increasing alarmed by the battlefield successes of the
Taliban, which controls nearly all of Afghanistan and captured the
northern stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif from opposition forces last
month.
	   Nazarov said that the situation in Afghanistan made peace
efforts in Tajikistan's own civil war between the hardline
government and the mostly Islamic opposition more difficult.
	   A U.N.-brokered peace accord signed last year provides for
opposition fighters to be integrated into the government's armed
forces and for opposition leaders to hold a number of key
government positions.
	   The opposition agreed Monday to resume cooperation with the
Tajik government and participation in reconciliation efforts. It
had halted cooperation after the killing of a leading rebel.
	   ``We believe that the peace process in Tajikistan, despite
difficulties, is becoming more established and moving forward
toward national accord,'' Nazarov said.

French yachtsman's death ruled accidental
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The June death of renowned French
yachtsman Eric Tabarly was ruled accidental on Wednesday.
	   Tabarly, 66, went overboard and drowned after being struck by
the boom of his vessel, according to Coroner Frank Hutchinson.
	   Tabarly, who crisscrossed oceans to win numerous solo titles,
was declared dead June 14, two days after he fell overboard near
Milford Haven while changing the main sail of his century-old
sailboat, the Pen Duick, as it headed toward Scotland in rough
seas. Air and sea searches failed to locate him. The body later
turned up in the net of a French trawler.
	   Tabarly shot to fame in 1964 when he won England's Transat solo
race across the Atlantic and achieved a series of victories in
other lone ocean racing events throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

Britain calls U.N. Security Council meeting on Kosovo crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS defense secretary statement, grafs 14, 15

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Wednesday
called an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to condemn
the massacre of ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   ``This was not an act of war, it was plain cold murder,'' Cook
said at a press briefing at the Labor Party's annual conference in
Blackpool, northwest England.
	   Cook said Thursday's meeting would request an urgent report from
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on whether Serbia had complied
with last week's Security Council resolution that called for a
cease-fire in Kosovo, a withdrawal of Serbian troops, and the start
of ``serious dialogue on real autonomy'' for the province.
	   Cook, whose country takes over the Security Council presidency
on Thursday, said NATO airstrikes could follow the receipt of
Annan's report early next week.
	   ``Military action will flow from a political decision,'' he
said.
	   Of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Cook said, ``He must
move to comply with the Security Council resolution and he must
move fast.''
	   A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking on customary
anonymity, said Blair had talked Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright who ``shares our sense of outrage'' over
the violence.
	   Earlier, Cook had announced that senior representatives from the
six so-called Contact Group countries _ the United States, Britain,
Germany, France, Italy and Russia _ would meet here Friday to find
``the way forward on a political settlement'' for Kosovo.
	   Despite assurances from the Yugoslav government that its
offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists is over, Cook said
the fighting continues.
	   On Sunday, the group Human Rights Watch reported 18 ethnic
Albanians were slaughtered in the forest near Obrija village in the
Drenica region northwest of Pristina.
	   Britain's Foreign Office said international monitors also
reported finding the bodies of 17 Albanians killed in fighting in
the Vucitern area.
	   ``I am appalled by these reports of massacres of civilians,
including women and children,'' Cook said. ``There is no
justification for any violence against the civilian population in
Kosovo.''
	   Cook asked for an independent forensic examination of both
massacres, and urged the International Criminal Tribunal for
Yugoslavia to extend its investigations to include these sites.
	   Also Thursday, British Defense Minister George Robertson said
that planning for NATO military action in the region was ''nearly
complete.''
	   ``NATO, with Britain committed to playing a full part, will act
decisively in the only way that Milosevic seems to respect, if he
continues to defy international opinion,'' Robertson said in a
statement.
	   Serbs began cracking down in February on Albanian separatists
who are fighting for independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia. Since then, hundreds of people have been
killed and an estimated 275,000 have been driven from their homes
in the province, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.

Spartak Moscow defeats Real Madrid 2-1

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Spartak Moscow defeated defending champions Real
Madrid 2-1 in pouring rain in a Champions League Group C second
rotation game Wednesday.
	   Real Madrid took the lead in the 63th minute when Clarence
Seedorf fired from eleven meters (yards) into the Russian post, the
ball bounced out and Raul headed it in.
	   Spartak midfielder Ilya Tsymbalar evened the score 12 minutes
later with a penalty kick that sent the ball over the defending
wall in the upper right corner of the Spanish net. Bodo Illgner,
Real's goalkeeper, who made several decisive saves at the beginning
of the second half, could not help.
	   In the 82nd minute, Russian striker Andrei Tikhonov made a
perfect pass from the left into the goal box and Luis Robson, the
Brazilian international player, headed it back to Egor Titov, who
fired in the winner.
	   Real coach Guus Hiddink sent in striker Fernando Morientes as a
substitute, but Spartak controlled the ball for the rest of the
game, giving the seven-time defending champions little opportunity
to tie.
	   The victory gives Spartak the lead with six points in the Group
C of the Champions League.
	   The 86,000-seat Luzhniki Stadium was almost full. It was a
record crowd for this season.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)- Pandeli Majko, the newly appointed
Socialist prime minister, started talks Wednesday with allied
parties to form a new Cabinet.
	   But the opposition said there will be no dialogue with the new
government and announced more protests.
	   Majko, the 30-year-old general secretary of the Socialist Party,
was nominated by his party Tuesday to replace Fatos Nano, who
resigned late Monday.
	   Majko was expected to announce the names of the new ministers on
Thursday. But with the opposition determined to boycott Parliament
and remain in the street, Albania was unlikely to emerge from the
deep political crisis any time soon.
	   Nano's resignation came after he failed to win approval for
Cabinet changes following riots two weeks ago that were caused by
the assassination of a popular opposition leader.
	   About 3,000 supporters of former President Sali Berisha, who
heads the opposition Democratic Party, gathered Wednesday in Tirana
to protest the appointment of the new prime minister.
	   Berisha told his supporters that there would be no dialogue with
the new government and that street protests would continue.
	   ``One clan was replaced with another. One terrorist government
was replaced with another terrorist government,'' said Berisha.
	   On Tuesday, Berisha proposed that the new government have a
broader base, with the participation of more parties outside the
government coalition.
	   However, the idea was rejected by all parties in the governing
coalition.
	   Berisha called for another anti-government rally to be held on
on Saturday.

Kagwe will be `marked man' in New York City Marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ This time, John Kagwe will be the marked man in
the New York City Marathon Nov. 1.
	   He is the defending champion, having won the race last year in
the second-fastest time in the event's history, 2 hours, 8 minutes,
12 seconds.
	   He probably would have smashed the course record of 2:08:01 set
by Tanzania's Juma Ikangaa in 1989 if he had not stopped twice to
tie his shoelaces and run the final 6 1-2 kilometers (4 miles) with
loose laces.
	   ``I think I would have broken it,'' the Kenyan said, ``but I
wasn't prepared (mentally) to break the record. I came to win.
Maybe I would have broken it if I were pursued at the end. But
since I was running alone over the last few miles, I didn't push
very hard.''
	   He took charge at the 35-kilometer (22-mile) mark and never was
seriously challenged.
	   Kagwe finished 1:15 ahead of runner-up Joseph Chebet, also of
Kenya, the biggest winning margin since 1992.
	   Last year's race was in sharp contrast to Kagwe's two previous
appearances in the New York City Marathon.
	   In 1995, he was bothered by the cold weather and finished fifth.
In 1996, he keyed on the wrong runners and wound up fourth.
	   ``I was marking some guys, like Moses Tanui, Cosmas Ndeti and
Martin Fiz, and they didn't move,'' he said of the 1996 race. ``I
tried to catch up and it was too late.''
	   Kagwe said it would be a mistake for other runners to try and
key off him this year.
	   ``If I don't move, they won't win,'' he said, laughing.
	   ``I don't know how I will do it, but I will try and see that
everyone is not marking me.
	   ``I will run my own race. I will not try to figure out who is
marking me. I will try to run like last year and make a break when
I think the others are tired.''
	   Kagwe said because of the difficulty of the New York course,
there was no chance of him _ or anyone else _ breaking the world
record of 2:06:05 set by Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa at the Berlin
Marathon Sept. 21.
	   ``New York is very difficult because of the hills and the
bridges, because the course is not very even and because there are
many corners,'' he said.
	   ``Given good weather, a good course and good competition, I
think I can run as fast (as da Costa), but it won't be in New
York.''
	   Kagwe has no plans of trying the fast, flat course in Berlin,
nor similar terrain in Rotterdam, where the record was set
previously by Belayneh Densimo of Ethiopia.
	   ``Everyone runs where he likes running,'' Kagwe said. ``It
doesn't matter if I run fast, but it matters if I win the race. I'm
running New York because I'm the defending champion.''
	   His next marathon after New York will be in the spring at
Boston, where he has run three times in the past four years. He was
fifth this year, 16th in 1995 and did not finish in 1996. He
skipped Boston in 1997 and won the Prague Marathon in 2:09:07 _ his
fastest time before New York.
	   Kagwe also ran with a loose shoelace during the Philadelphia
Distance Run Half-Marathon in 1997 and finished second in a
career-best 1:01:18.
	   With two career-bests with flapping laces, maybe he should stick
with that style again in the New York City race.
	   He ran Philadelphia last Sunday with his laces tight and
finished eighth in 1:06:22 _ more than five minutes slower than a
year ago.

Nacional faces unbeaten Palmeiras
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Palmeiras is running away with Group B
of the Copa Mercosur. Nacional of Uruguay hopes to slow the
Brazilians down.
	   The group's first- and second-place teams square off Thursday
night, with Nacional seeking to wrest a point from the so-far
unstoppable Brazilians.
	   Palmeiras has crushed every adversary in its path, winning its
last three games on the road by a combined score of 10-1. The worst
beating was against Nacional, a 5-0 thrashing in Montevideo.
	   Midfielder Alex and forward Magrao are tied for the tournament
scoring lead with three goals apiece, and they aren't even the
team's big guns. But starting forwards Paulo Nunes and Ozeas will
likely get a rest against Nacional.
	   With four victories in four games, Palmeiras has 12 points and
already is qualified for the next round. A tie against Nacional
will mathematically clinch first place in the group.
	   For Nacional, meanwhile, a draw would greatly enhance its
chances of clinching the group's second spot.
	   The visitors have six points, three more than Universidad de
Chile and Independiente of Argentina, which meet in Thursday's
other game. Nacional beat Universidad twice and lost to Palmeiras
and Independiente.
	   Nacional closes the first round at home against Indepeniente on
Oct. 13, while Universidad plays its last game against Palmeiras in
Sao Paulo.

Genetic defect linked to obesity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT). &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Scientists have discovered another genetic flaw
that seems to raise the risk of obesity.
	   Several genetic defects have already been found that increase
the tendency to put on weight. None of them, acting alone, appears
to be a frequent cause of obesity.
	   The latest was discovered by Dr. Michael Ristow and others from
the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. It was reported in Thursday's
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
	   The defective gene produces the protein for
peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2. It is involved
in one of the steps in the production of fat cells.
	   The researchers, working with scientists in Cologne, Germany,
looked for the defective gene in 358 German volunteers, 121 of whom
were overweight. Four of the obese people carried the mutated gene,
but none of the normal-size people had it.
	   The researchers concluded that the bad gene increases growth in
fat cells and contributes to obesity in some people.

Polish court orders retrial in 1981 martial law killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Polish Supreme Court on Wednesday
ordered a retrial of 22 riot policemen charged with killing nine
miners resisting the 1981 communist martial law crackdown.
	   The court cited procedural mistakes in the original trial, which
ended Nov. 21, 1997 with the acquittal of the former policemen, who
had taken part in the suppression of a sit-in at two mines in
southern Poland.
	   Justifying the verdict in November, the Provincial Court in
Katowice said the evidence was inadequate to prove the defendants'
guilt. However, prosecutors appealed the verdict, which caused
widespread public discontent in Poland.
	   No new trial date was immediately announced.
	   The nine miners killed on the third day of martial law were the
first fatalities in the 1 1/2-year crackdown, which claimed the
lives of 100 government opponents before it was lifted in July
1983.
	   Riot police were dispatched to Katowice and other Solidarity
strongholds on the first day of martial law, Dec. 13, 1981, by a
government anticipating resistance to the loss of basic freedoms
and the jailing of Solidarity leaders.
	   When miners who had barricaded themselves in the Wujek and the
Manifest Lipcowy mines wouldn't budge on the third day, riot police
opened fire, killing nine protesters and wounding 25.
	   The defendants _ charged on the basis of the incident report
compiled after the shooting _ said that they shot into the air,
well above the heads of the protesters.
	   Following a court decision in November, former communist
interior minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, also is facing a retrial
in a separate case, on charges on contributing to the deaths of the
nine miners. Kiszczak signed a coded message allowing riot police
to fire at protesters.
	   He initially was included in the trial of 22 riot policemen
charged with the actual shooting, but he was excused for health
reasons and tried separately in Warsaw.

Mexico's central bank says effects of crisis worse then expected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's central bank said Wednesday the
effects of global financial turmoil have gone beyond government
expectations in 1998 and the global economic recession could
intensify.
	   ``So far it has been impossible to estimate the magnitude and
duration of the current recessions and the contagion reaching new
regions,'' according to the Bank of Mexico's semi-annual report on
monetary policy.
	   ``The risk of the crisis intensifying and extending to other
regions persists,'' the report stated.
	   In the report, the central bank outlined measures taken this
year to deal with the pressure on the Mexican peso from the global
financial upheaval, and its impact on inflation.
	   ``Logically, throughout the year the Bank of Mexico has adjusted
its monetary policy in response to these events,'' the report
stated.
	   Such measures include a series of lending restrictions to
commercial banks and intervention in the foreign exchange market.
However, finance officials have denied reports they might consider
tying the peso's value to the U.S. dollar.
	   Inflation so far this year has fluctuated between 15 and 15.5
percent, ``interrupting the downward tendency that it had shown
since 1996,'' according to the bank.
	   Inflation, which by August was 2.0 percentage points above the
government's target, was fueled by the depreciation of the peso,
according to the bank.
	   The peso opened at 10.2050 against the U.S. dollar on spot
markets Wednesday, a depreciation of 21 percent from the end of
1997.

 &UR; New killings alleged as diplomats call for massacre investigation &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with Britain calling for emergency meeting
of U.N. Security Council, new claim of bodies found, more from
Golubovac, reports of fighting, border attack on Yugoslav army
forces; trims diplomatic developments. Changes dateline. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOLUBOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Even as international outrage grew
over the massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in a Kosovo forest,
residents of a nearby village claimed Wednesday that Serb forces
had executed at least 13 men in a separate killing spree.
	   Amid mounting pressure to do something about the Kosovo
bloodshed, Britain called an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security
Council to condemn the massacres.
	   The latest allegations of massacres by Serb police and the
Yugoslav army came after diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies earlier this week in
nearby Obrija, including those of women and children.
	   Eight kilometers (five miles) to the south, residents of
Golubovac. said Wednesday that Serb forces surrounded a pocket of
refugees there last Saturday and singled out the men to kill.
	   They said the victims were already buried, but pointed to
saucer-sized pools of dried blood and empty cartridges in front of
a fence where they said the refugees were shot.
	   ``They pointed to the men and took them to beside my house,''
said Naim Hodzaj, a 53-year-old farmer in the village 35 kilometers
(21 miles) west of Kosovo's capital Pristina. ``They shot them
all.''
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center claimed late
Wednesday 18 more bodies had been found nearby in the area around
Glogovac, showing clear signs of torture and three shot in the back
of the head. The claim could not be confirmed, and it was possible
it referred to the Golubovac site.
	   Britain and Austria called Wednesday for an international
investigation into what Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel called the ``bestial'' massacre at Obrija, which the
Serbs call Gornje Obrinje.
	   ``This was not an act of war, it was plain cold murder,''
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in calling later for the
Security Council meeting.
	   The mass killings last weekend in the Drenica region, where
Serb-led forces were on their latest offensive against ethnic
Albanian rebels, are among the most gruesome developments reported
in eight months of all-out fighting. The Serbs are trying to crush
the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is seeking independence for
Kosovo, where the population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   There was no way to corroborate the ethnic Albanians' accounts.
Both sides have been accused of massacres in Kosovo, and Serb
police denied responsibility for the killings in Obrija.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency called Western reports a
``media farce,'' and said the Obrija killing was staged to generate
more pressure on Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serb authorities promised earlier this week that troops would
retreat to their barracks after claiming victory over the KLA.
	   A U.N. spokesman in Belgrade said fighting was still going on in
the Suva Reka area southwest of Pristina but there was evidence the
pullback was continuing.
	   ``It appears there is a methodical, gradual withdrawal of the
military under way at the present time,'' said the spokesman, who
gave his name as J. Carter.
	   Only occasional gunshots could be heard in Drenica. But Fernando
del Mundo, the Kosovo spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said he saw Serb troops coming out of a village west of
Pristina where houses were ablaze.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported that attackers from Albania
staged an hours-long attack on Yugoslav army border forces
northwest of Djakovica. There was no immediate information on
casualties.
	   In a separate incident Wednesday, an ethnic Albanian doctor was
killed and three other members of the International Committee of
the Red Cross, including one foreigner _ a nurse from New Zealand _
were injured when their vehicle hit a landmine west of Pristina.
	   The Serbs have been accused of hindering efforts to get outside
humanitarian aid to some of the estimated 275,000 people who have
been driven from their homes since the conflict exploded in
February.
	   In Golubovac, Hodzaj said that in addition to the executions,
Serb police had killed several other men individually, including
his 37-year-old brother Ramadan, who was doused with gasoline and
set on fire.
	   His brother's body lay curled up on a path on the edge of the
woods. The torso was badly burned but the legs and head were
untouched.
	   The body of a 70-year-old man also lay prepared for burial in a
nearby cemetery. Villagers said Serb snipers shot the man in the
side as he tried to collect food from a nearby field.
	   Many of the houses of Golubovac are gutted by recent fire, and
the town's perimeter is dotted by small piles of artillery shells
and empty tins of food.
	   The slayings of the Obrija victims, whose bodies were seen this
week by diplomats and journalists in a Drenica forest, inflamed
tensions in Kosovo. Some were carved up with knives, limbs hacked
off; a 10-year-old boy had his throat slit.
	   ``We rule out any possibility that our members did something
like this,'' Serb police Col. Bozidar Filic said. ``In that area,
we had clashes with terrorists and a number of them have been
arrested.''

 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Two hand grenades were thrown Wednesday
at Israeli security forces in a downtown Hebron square, injuring 11
Israeli troops and 11 Palestinian civilians, an army official said.
One Israeli was in serious condition,
	   Soldiers opened fire on the assailant, apparently a Palestinian,
who fled into the Palestinian-controlled sector of divided Hebron,
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The man
apparently was shot in the leg during the pursuit.
	   The army poured reinforcements into Hebron, a troubled town of
130,000 Palestinian and 450 Jewish settlers, and imposed a curfew
on 30,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled sector.
	   Wednesday's violence erupted during Yom Kippur, the holiest day
on the Jewish calendar, as Israeli troops enforced a blanket
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   In a related development, Israel TV's Channel Two said that
Palestinian security forces raided a Hamas bomb factory Tuesday
night in Hebron, seizing 300 kilos (640 pounds) of explosives and
half a ton of materials used in making bombs. The report said it
was the largest Hamas laboratory uncovered so far.
	   Tensions in Hebron have been rising since the Aug. 20 killing of
a settler rabbi, apparently by a Palestinian militant. On Monday an
Israeli woman was wounded by shots fired from the Palestinian
sector.
	   In response, settlers have beaten Palestinian bystanders and
overturned tables in the downtown outdoor market.
	   The bloodshed came amid intensive U.S. efforts to broker an
agreement on an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West
Bank. Under a compromise, 3 percent of that land is to be set aside
as a nature reserve in which Israel retains control over security.
	   This week, U.S. President Bill Clinton hosted Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
separately and then in a three-way summit. Israeli and U.S.
officials were upbeat, saying the land issue had been resolved.
	   However, Palestinian negotiators said Wednesday that some
differences remained. Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian
representative in Washington, said one of the points of contention
was whether Palestinian police could enter the nature reserve.
	   Palestinian negotiators said Wednesday that U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Mideast envoy Dennis Ross are to
return to the region Tuesday to prepare another Mideast summit in
Washington in mid-October.
	   The Hebron incident began Wednesday afternoon in downtown Gross
Square when an assailant threw two grenades. One grenade rolled
under a white station wagon and the second landed near a group of
Israeli troops before exploding.
	   The station wagon and a yellow van caught fire, with thick smoke
rising from the scorched vehicles.
	   The blast injured five soldiers and six officers from the
paramilitary border police, as well as 11 Palestinians, the army
and Palestinian doctors said. One Israeli was seriously wounded,
two were in moderate condition and the rest had light injuries.
	   In other developments Wednesday, some 400 Palestinians threw
stones at Israeli soldiers near the West Bank village of Biddou.
Troops fired rubber bullets, injuring six Palestinians.
	   The clashes erupted after the funeral of a Hamas activist,
Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, who was killed Tuesday when a car rigged
with powerful explosives blew up in the industrial zone of the
village of Beitunia, near the town of Ramallah.
	   Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid, two Hamas activists who survived the
blast, denied they were preparing the car for a bombing attack in
Israel, Palestinian police officials said.
	   The Abu Eid brothers told Palestinian investigators that just
before the explosion, they met an Israeli Arab man in a car in the
Beitunia industrial zone, expecting him to deliver three guns for
dlrs 1,000. The man delivered a package and got out of the car
before the explosion went off, they said.
	   A caller to a Palestinian media center, saying he spoke for
Hamas, claimed that Israel was behind the bombing. However, Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar, said the group was still investigating the
incident.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
over renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to carry
out suicide bombings in the Jewish state. Hamas wants to avenge the
recent killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.

Jalabert pulls out of world cycling championships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The world's top-ranked cyclist, Laurent
Jalabert, announced Wednesday he was pulling out of the world
championships next week in the Netherlands, citing physical and
psychological fatigue.
	   The Frenchman insisted his decision had nothing to do with what
he called an ultimatum from the chairman of cycling's governing
body, Hein Verbruggen.
	   Verbruggen had said Jalabert would be banned from the
championships unless he apologized for describing the International
Cycling Union as a ``dictatorship'' and its commissioners as ``half
Dracula and half neo-Nazi.''
	   Jalabert, who rides for ONCE-Deutsche Bank, had said last
weekend he was considering pulling out. He made it official
Wednesday in a statement sent to the state-run Spanish news agency
Efe.
	   ``Now that several days have gone by since the Tour of Spain
finished, and I have seen that my physical and psychological
condition is not ideal for assuming the responsibility of
representing my country, I have decided in consultation with the
medical team of ONCE-Deutsche Bank to end the current season.''
	   Jalabert, who finished fifth in the Tour of Spain, added: ``This
decision has nothing to do with the statement-ultimatum that Mr.
Verbruggen sent to my team and which I will answer soon.''
	   Verbruggen, president of the UCI, told the French newspaper
L'Equipe Tuesday that Jalabert had until Sunday to write that he's
sorry or be excluded from the world championships, which begin
Tuesday in the Dutch town of Maastricht.

Dominican expatriates a vital lifeline for hurricane victims
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ At a college
cafeteria-turned-hurricane relief center in the Dominican capital,
40-year-old New Yorker Fernando Mateo barked out orders to legions
of volunteers.
	   ``Let's go! Let's go! Move it, my brothers!'' he said, as a
dozen young men loaded clothes and water jugs, bucket-brigade
style, onto a dump truck heading for a hurricane-wracked slum of
the capital, Santo Domingo.
	   Dominican expatriates wiring money or bringing in emergency
supplies from abroad are largely unsung players in the
international disaster relief effort for the Dominican Republic,
hard-hit by Hurricane Georges.
	   Cash and donations from Dominicans living in the United States _
substantial under normal circumstances _ have become a lifeline for
this Caribbean nation reeling from its worst natural disaster in
decades.
	   At least 210 people died and 100,000 were driven from flooded,
wind-damaged homes when Hurricane Georges' 110 mph (175 kph) winds
struck the Dominican Republic on Sept. 22. The storm killed at
least 370 across the Caribbean.
	   While official foreign relief is growing, shortages of food,
water and shelter are driving many storm victims to the point of
desperation.
	   Visiting U.S. congressmen and U.S. Agency for International
Development officials arrived here Wednesday to announce a dlrs 47
million aid package for the Dominican Republic and neighboring
Haiti _ the two countries most affected by the hurricane.
	   In Washington, the U.S. government said that three U.S. C-130
cargo aircraft were bringing humanitarian aid from New York state.
	   For many poor Dominicans, however, help from friends and family
who left for a better life abroad will be the most dependable and
long-lasting source of support.
	   An estimated 1.3 million Dominicans live in New York, New
Jersey, Miami, Boston and other areas, many of them educated
professionals who entered the United States illegally and work long
hours at low-paying jobs.
	   More than 1 million are in New York, where Dominicans formed a
1,500-car caravan to shuttle food, clothing and medicine to Kennedy
Airport last week.
	   ``It's the poorest people _ factory workers, small businessmen,
taxi drivers. You name it and they're coming forward,'' said Mateo,
an organizer of the New York aid drive and a self-made millionaire
in the flooring business whose parents brought him to the United
States when he was a toddler.
	   Working with Santo Domingo's mayor, merengue singer Johnny
Ventura, Mateo has marshaled 300 local volunteers and hopes to
bring in at least five planeloads of supplies.
	   His delivery of water, cooking oil, pillows and clothing to
Santo Domingo's flooded Sabana Perdida neighborhood Tuesday was the
first to arrive there since the hurricane. It nearly caused a riot
among starving residents fighting for aid.
	   Other Dominicans are getting help at the local Western Union
office or one of its competitors. Cash remittances to the Dominican
Republic, which at dlrs 1.5 billion last year were over half the
size of the government's budget, have surged since the hurricane.
	   Wire transfers _ most of them just a few hundred dollars _ rank
about even with tourism and exports from manufacturing and textile
plants as the country's top source of foreign exchange.
	   Just a few hundred dollars can be enough to fix a battered zinc
roof or repair plywood siding on a simple house.
	   ``The day after the hurricane we were mobbed with people, and
the next day it was even more crowded, '' said Marlenne Then, a
Western Union executive.
	   About one-third of the company's 135 offices are still closed
due to downed phone lines, but cash was getting to storm victims by
motorcycles and armored cars, Then said.
	   Mateo said a money-wiring service he owns has nearly doubled its
business.

Schroeder tries to calm French fears of losing out to British
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Schroeder news conference &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Germany's chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder bent
over backwards Wednesday to reassure France it will remain a key
ally in building a united Europe, despite his desire to expand ties
with Britain.
	   On his first foreign trip since defeating Helmut Kohl's
conservatives Sunday, the Social Democrat came with his French
foreign policy adviser who once interpreted for French presidents.
	   Schroeder's victory blew like a cool wind across the Rhine, with
French media and some politicians worrying Europe's giant would
neglect France for closer ties with Britain, after Europe's single
currency, forged by France and Germany, takes effect next year.
	   ``There's a great tradition of French and German relations,''
Schroeder told a news conference after talks with President Jacques
Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, chatting with them in
English.
	   ``These relations are important for France and Germany, and for
Europe,'' he said. But he said ties ``aren't exclusive,'' and the
``process of rapprochement with Great Britain has become greater.''
	   Schroeder also sought to reassure smaller members of the
15-nation European Union which may be wary of strong three-way ties
between Bonn, Paris and London.
	   ``No one should fear a bigger Germany or that the capital is in
Berlin,'' he added, referring to the impending move of the capital
of a reunified Germany with 80 million people.
	   The jitters were the latest in relations between France and
Germany, each the other's biggest trading partner and both
dependent on each other in trying to make the EU a world power.
	   Germans closely watched Chirac's election in 1995 and Jospin
last year, when both candidates criticized EU policies, although
the two leaders became strong pro-Europeans after coming to power.
	   They maintained a Franco-German axis honed by Kohl and the late
French President Francois Mitterrand.
	   Schroeder, whose victory spelled the end to 16 years of
leadership by Kohl, had called for better ties with London during
his campaign. Germany assumes the rotating six-month presidency of
the European Union in January, which could increase French concern.
	   But the 54-year-old Social Democrat and Chirac portrayed
themselves as on the same wavelength.
	   ``We found ourselves completely on the same line which I
welcomed,'' Chirac told reporters, saying the talks were the
beginning of ``a long and fruitful relationship.''
	   ``I felt the same way,'' Schroeder said. ``Paris is near in
every aspect.''
	   France and Germany plan to set up working groups on European
union reform, Schroeder added, stressing ``the need to work
together.''

Schroeder: Europe open to Turkey, but rights problems persist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Germany's future chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said
Wednesday that Turkey shouldn't be barred indefinitely from joining
the Europe Union, but he said the Ankara government has a long way
to go to resolve human rights and other problems.
	   ``The European door for Turkey must remain open,'' Schroeder
told a news conference after meeting with French leaders.
	   ``It is up to the Turks alone'' to work out their problems,
which could take a long time, he said, referring to economic and
human rights issues that have so far prevented the European Union
from considering Turkey as a member.
	   On human rights, ``it's an issue where there is much to do,''
Schroeder said. ``But people know that about Turkey.''
	   The 15-nation EU blocked Turkey from its first round of
expansion talks in December, angering Turkey, which put relations
with the EU on hold.
	   Germany, however, has long valued Turkey as a trading partner
and has a large population of Turkish immigrants.

Cabinet adopts measures to curb spending, revive economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMED AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen's Cabinet adopted several measures
Wednesday to cut government spending as part of its plan for
economic and administrative reforms, San'a radio reported.
	   The Cabinet acted on instructions from President Ali Abdullah
Saleh ``to speed up measures and necessary arrangements to overcome
the economic crisis,'' particularly after the collapse of oil
prices earlier this year, the radio reported.
	   The Cabinet decided to freeze new hirings for government jobs
and pay raises and cut general spending, the radio said.
	   Oil revenue, which represents about 40 percent of the country's
total income, is the main source for foreign currency in Yemen, a
poor country on the southwest corner of the Arabian Peninsula.
	   The 1998 budget projects oil income will increase 3 percent to
dlrs 1 billion from dlrs 970 million estimated for 1997. The
government aims to raise oil output capacity to 500,000 barrels a
day by 2000 from around 350,000 barrels a day now.
	   The measures will likely increase unemployment, which already
stands at 36 percent of the country's work force.
	   Since signing an economic reform program with the International
Monetary Fund in March 1995, Yemen has already received dlrs 350
million in credits. The government has cut back subsidies and
stepped up privatization as part of the reforms.
	   A hike in prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas by 40
percent and a 100 percent increase in the cost of public transport
in June prompted demonstrations in the capital and other cities.

Jalabert pulls out of world cycling championships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Top-ranked Laurent Jalabert on Wednesday
announced he was pulling out of the cycling World Championships
next week in the Netherlands, citing physical and psychological
fatigue.
	   The Frenchman insisted his decision had nothing to do with what
he called an ultimatum from the chairman of cycling's governing
body, Hein Verbruggen.
	   Verbruggen had said Jalabert would be banned from the
championships unless he apologized for describing the International
Cycling Union (UCI) as a ``dictatorship'' and its commissioners as
``half Dracula and half neo-Nazi.''
	   Jalabert, who rides for ONCE-Deutsche Bank, had said last
weekend he was considering withdrawing. He made it official
Wednesday in a statement sent to the state-run Spanish news agency
Efe.
	   ``Now that several days have gone by since the Tour of Spain
finished, and I have seen that my physical and psychological
condition is not ideal for assuming the responsibility of
representing my country, I have decided in consultation with the
medical team of ONCE-Deutsche Bank to end the current season.''
	   Jalabert, who finished fifth in the Vuelta a Espana, added:
``This decision has nothing to do with the statement-ultimatum that
Mr. Verbruggen sent to my team and which I will answer soon.''
	   Verbruggen, president of the UCI, told the French newspaper
L'Equipe Tuesday that Jalabert had until Sunday to write that he's
sorry or be excluded from the World Championships, which begin
Tuesday in the Dutch town of Maastricht.

Government's blueprint calls for reversal of free-market reforms

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new government will consider a
Soviet-style economic plan that would set back the clock with
nationalized banks and a flood of newly minted money, a newspaper
said Wednesday.
	   The head of the Central Bank strongly denied that the government
was going to take over banks.
	   The government did not specifically deny the rest of the
reported plan, which was said to have been drafted by a group of
Soviet-era economists. According to the Kommersant business
newspaper, it would boost the money supply by 60 percent,
undoubtedly fueling inflation.
	   It also would reintroduce currency controls, said Kommersant,
which is generally well respected.
	   Government spokesman Andrei Korotkov confirmed that Yuri
Maslyukov, a Communist who is first deputy prime minister for
economic strategy, had worked out an economic plan that will be
discussed by the Cabinet on Thursday. He said it would become the
basis for a government program to be unveiled on Oct. 8.
	   Korotkov would not describe the plan in detail, but acknowledged
that it calls for more state controls over banks and the currency
market. He said it was aimed at ``the recovery and stabilization of
the banking system,'' and overall economic stabilization, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Central Bank chief Viktor Gerashchenko vehemently denied that
the government intended to nationalize banks.
	   ``I wouldn't work in such a system. I would retire,'' he said,
according to Interfax.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, traveling in Belarus, continued
to insist that he supported free-market economic reforms, but with
more state control and a greater emphasis on social welfare.
	   ``This movement is not a backward, but a forward change in the
economy, and consists of market changes in particular, but with a
strengthening of government regulation so that the economy turns
its face toward the people,'' Primakov told reporters in Minsk, the
Belarusian capital.
	   Kommersant was less approving. ``Maslyukov's program again turns
Russia into a transition economy, only this time it will move
backward _ to the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic,'' the
newspaper wrote.
	   ``They are going to crank up money-printing presses,''
Kommersant added. ``Social pathos will bring hyperinflation.''
	   Former tax chief Boris Fyodorov, who was ousted by President
Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday, said the government should move to boost
tax collection and radically cut spending instead of printing new
money.
	   ``Printing money is like a drug. Once you grow addicted to that,
it's hard to stop,'' he said in an interview published in the
liberal daily Izvestia.
	   Maslyukov was the last chairman of the Soviet central planning
agency, Gosplan. According to the newspaper, he will propose
nationalizing most of Russia's commercial banks and using their
assets to help troubled industries.
	   The plan also proposes tying the value of the ruble to a basket
of other currencies, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. It did not say
which currencies would be used.
	   Kommersant said the government was considering several factors
other than the market to determine the rate of the ruble, such as
taking into account the country's balance of payments, the size of
the central bank's foreign exchange and gold reserves, as well as
the inflation rate.
	   The ruble's value has dropped sharply against other currencies
since being devalued last month. It stood at about 6 rubles to the
dollar before the devaluation and economic collapse; on Wednesday,
it was trading at about 16 to the dollar.

	   GOLUBOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Even as international outrage grew
over the massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in a Kosovo forest,
residents of a nearby village claimed Wednesday that Serb forces
had executed at least 13 men in a separate killing spree.
	   Amid mounting pressure to do something about the Kosovo
bloodshed, Britain called an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security
Council to condemn the massacres in the southern province in
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The latest allegations of massacres by Serb police and the
Yugoslav army came after diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies earlier this week in
nearby Obrija, including those of women and children. Serb police
denied responsibility.
	   Eight kilometers (five miles) south, residents of Golubovac said
Wednesday that Serb forces surrounded a pocket of refugees there
Saturday and singled out the men to kill.
	   They said the victims were already buried, but pointed to
saucer-sized pools of dried blood and empty cartridges in front of
a fence where they said the refugees were shot.
	   ``They pointed to the men and took them to beside my house,''
said Naim Hodzaj, a 53-year-old farmer in the village 35 kilometers
(21 miles) west of Kosovo's capital Pristina. ``They shot them
all.''
	   The mass killings last weekend in the Drenica region, where
Serb-led forces are trying to crush ethnic Albanian rebels, are
among the most gruesome developments since the offensive began in
February. The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is seeking independence
for Kosovo, where the population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center claimed late
Wednesday that 18 more bodies had been found nearby in the area
around a third village, Glogovac. They said all showed clear signs
of torture and that three were shot in the back of the head. The
claim could not be confirmed, and it was possible it referred to
the Golubovac site.
	   There was no way to corroborate the ethnic Albanians' accounts.
Both sides have been accused of massacres in Kosovo.
	   Britain and Austria on Wednesday urged an international
investigation into what Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel called the ``bestial'' massacre at Obrija, which the
Serbs call Gornje Obrinje.
	   ``This was not an act of war, it was plain cold murder,''
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said later in calling for the
Security Council meeting.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency called Western reports a
``media farce,'' and said the Obrija killing was staged to generate
more pressure on Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serb authorities promised earlier this week that troops would
retreat to their barracks after claiming victory over the KLA.
	   A U.N. spokesman in Belgrade said fighting was still going on
near Suva Reka, southwest of Pristina, but that the pullback was
continuing. ``It appears there is a methodical, gradual withdrawal
of the military under way,'' said the spokesman, who gave his name
as J. Carter.
	   Only occasional gunshots could be heard in Drenica. But Fernando
del Mundo, the Kosovo spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said he saw Serb troops coming out of a western village
where houses were ablaze.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported that attackers from Albania
staged an hours-long attack on Yugoslav army border forces
northwest of Djakovica. There was no immediate information on
casualties.
	   Also Wednesday, an ethnic Albanian doctor was killed and three
other members of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
including one foreigner _ a nurse from New Zealand _ were injured
when their vehicle hit a land mine west of Pristina.
	   The Serbs have been accused of hindering humanitarian aid for an
estimated 275,000 people driven from their homes.
	   In Golubovac, farmer Naim Hodzaj said that in addition to the
executions, Serb police had killed several other men individually,
including his 37-year-old brother Ramadan, who was doused with
gasoline and set on fire. His brother's burned body lay curled up
on a path on the edge of the woods.
	   Many of the houses of Golubovac are gutted by recent fire, and
the town's perimeter is dotted by small piles of artillery shells
and empty tins of food.
	   The slayings of the Obrija victims, whose bodies were seen this
week by diplomats and journalists in a Drenica forest, inflamed
tensions in Kosovo. Some were carved up with knives, limbs hacked
off; a 10-year-old boy had his throat slit.
	   ``We rule out any possibility that our members did something
like this,'' Serb police Col. Bozidar Filic said. ``In that area,
we had clashes with terrorists and a number of them have been
arrested.''

Swiss federation gives cyclists eight-month bans, fines

<TEXT>
	   ROTHRIST, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss Cycling Federation has
handed down eight month bans to three cyclists expelled from the
scandal-rocked Tour de France for using an illegal
performance-enhancing drug, the body announced Wednesday.
	   The federation's special anti-doping commission also fined
riders Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier 3,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 2,164) each.
	   The bans on the cyclists will take effect immediately, the
commission said. The punishments were not the lowest, nor the
highest, that could have been imposed. According to UCI rules,
cyclists who confess or test positive for drugtaking can be banned
for between six months and a year and face fines of between 2-4,000
francs.
	   Commission president Remo Von Daniken said the commission had
chosen a punishment above the minimum to ``send a signal.''
	   ``The judgement must be seen as a new start in this sorry doping
story,'' said Von Daniken.
	   The three cyclists left the hotel in the northeastern town of
Rothrist where the commission made its judgement without knowing
the results or offering comment.
	   ``I've no more to say on this matter,'' Armin Meier said later.
	   The three cyclists were members of the Festina team thrown out
of this year's Tour de France.
	   Festina was expelled because its riders were said to have taken
the hormone EPO. Zuelle, Dufaux and Meier were among those who
later admitted taking the drug.
	   The federation's sentences must still be approved by cycling's
world governing body, the International Cycling Union (UCI).

Evidence of worm-like animals found in billion-year-old rock
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Complex animals may have evolved far earlier
in Earth's history than previously believed, according to
researchers who say tiny tunnels preserved in rock in India were
dug by burrowing, worm-like creatures more than a billion years
ago.
	   The tunnels, about the size of a soda straw, are thought to be
the oldest trace fossil ever found and probably were carved by a
worms that lived under the muck at the bottom of a shallow sea,
Adolph Seilacher of Yale University said Wednesday.
	   A report on the study is to be published Friday in the journal
Science.
	   Multicellular animals made a dramatic appearance in the fossil
record about 540 million years ago at the beginning of what is
called the Cambrian period. Animals then developed skeletons,
shells and mineralized bodies that were preserved in the fossils.
	   Before that, it has been believed, life consisted of primitive,
soft-bodied organism that left no trace in the fossil record.
Scientists generally believed that life started some 4 billion
years ago with simple, single-celled creatures that crept slowly up
the evolutionary ladder until there an explosion of new, complex
life forms during the Cambrian.
	   But Seilacher, a professor emeritus at the University of
Tubingen in Germany, said that discovery of the worm tunnels in
India shows that there were multicellular animals, with complicated
and intricate lifestyles, more than a half-billion years before the
Cambrian.
	   ``This means that the birth of multicellular animals was at
least twice as long ago as we thought,'' he said. ``It means that
animals have a much longer history that we once believed.''
	   The announcement, made at a German news conference, met with
immediate skepticism among some paleontologist.
	   ``It this were true, it would be very important,'' said Bruce
Runnegar, a UCLA paleontologist. ``I would like to see evidence for
animals 1 billion years old. But I don't think this discovery
represents the final, unequivocal proof.''
	   Seilacher and his colleagues found the tunnels, now eroded to
mere meandering grooves, in sandstone in northern India.
	   The rock was formed from sand that once was the floor of a
shallow sea. Seilacher said he believes the worm-like creatures
lived in the sand and fed on a mat of decaying organic matter that
coated the sea floor. The organic matter, he said, probably was the
bodies of microorganisms and algae that lived in the water, died
and sank to the bottom.
	   Seilacher said the path of the tunnels seem to purposely follow
the contours of the sea floor, as if the animals were feeding from
below on the organic debris. Some of the tunnels have branches, he
said, suggesting that the animals sometimes dug forward and then
backed out to take a new burrowing path.
	   This, he said, suggests a complex life form that had nerves,
instincts and senses.
	   Seilacher said the sand containing the tunnels hardened over
time to become rock and this preserved the impressions of the
tunnels. In recent geologic times, the rock has been lifted up and
layers eroded away, revealing the tunnels as grooves in the soft
stone.

Britain wants Security Council meeting on Kosovo, NATO finalizes

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Britain called Wednesday for an emergency
meeting of the Security Council to condemn the massacre of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo while NATO finalized preparations for
airstrikes against Serb forces.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook called for a Thursday
council meeting, telling a news conference in London there was ``no
justification for any violence against the civilian population in
Kosovo.''
	   He warned NATO airstrikes could come after the U.N. chief
reports on the situation. The report could come as early as the end
of the week, U.N. officials said.
	   Serb police denied responsibility Wednesday for the massacre, in
which 18 men, women and children were shot in the back of the head
and mutilated.
	   The slaying of the victims, whose bodies were seen Tuesday by
diplomats and journalists in a forest in the Drenica region west of
Pristina, have inflamed tensions in Kosovo, where the ethnic
Albanian majority is fighting for independence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed, and over a quarter million
have fled their homes since a Serb crackdown began in February. The
West supports autonomy for Kosovo but not independence.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan was due to report on whether Serbia
had complied with a Sept. 23 council resolution that called for a
cease-fire in Kosovo, a withdrawal of Serbian troops, and the start
of ``serious dialogue on real autonomy'' for the province.
	   In its resolution, the council threatened unspecified additional
measures if both sides failed to comply with the resolution. The
resolution is militarily enforceable, but it did not explicitly
authorize NATO action.
	   Cook, whose country takes over the Security Council presidency
on Thursday, said NATO airstrikes could follow the receipt of
Annan's report.
	   ``Military action will flow from a political decision,'' he
said.
	   NATO was close to finalizing military preparations for
airstrikes against Serb forces in Kosovo, officials said Wednesday
in Brussels. Alliance ambassadors, however, were also awaiting
Annan's report before deciding whether to order airstrikes.
	   In a statement Wednesday _ and a possible precursor to the
report _ Annan condemned the reported massacre, which he said was
``particularly shocking'' since the Yugoslav foreign minister had
denied Serb involvement in any atrocities in their meeting here
Tuesday.
	   ``It is the duty of security forces to protect citizens, not to
intimidate them,'' Annan said.

Hoffman out as Dodgers manager
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with announcement &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Glenn Hoffman will not return as manager of
the Los Angeles Dodgers next year, following a season in which he
replaced Bill Russell in June.
	   The Dodgers said Wednesday that Hoffman will join the coaching
staff under the new manager.
	   ``I feel that Glenn displayed major league managerial talents
and believe that based on this experience and his being a member of
the new coaching staff, he will be further prepared for his next
managerial opportunity,'' general manager Kevin Malone said.
	   The Dodgers never contended in 1998, starting with four straight
losses and finishing 83-79.
	   The Dodgers had only two managers between 1954 and 1996 _ both
Hall of Famers. They had two this year alone, and now they'll have
another next season.
	   Montreal Expos manager Felipe Alou is believed to be the leading
candidate. Malone was general manager of the Expos in 1994 and
1995. More recently, he was assistant general manager for the
Baltimore Orioles.
	   Alou, 63, has one year remaining on his contract with the Expos,
but it's believed the team won't stop him from leaving to manage
the Dodgers.
	   Other possibilities to succeed Hoffman are former Boston Red Sox
manager Kevin Kennedy and former Baltimore Orioles manager Davey
Johnson.
	   The Dodgers said they would not make any announcements regarding
other coaches until a manager is hired.
	   Hoffman, 40, guided the Dodgers to a 47-41 record after
replacing Russell, who was fired along with general manager Fred
Claire on June 21.
	   Russell succeeded Tom Lasorda on July 29, 1996 _ after Lasorda
had a mild heart attack and was made a vice president of the team.
	   Lasorda held the managerial job for nearly 20 years starting in
1977. Before that, Walter Alston managed the team in Brooklyn and
Los Angeles from 1954-76.
	   Lasorda, who turned 71 last week, replaced Claire as interim
general manager last June, and was succeeded by Malone on Sept. 11.
	   Hoffman was managing the Dodgers' Albuquerque farm club of the
Pacific Coast League when Russell was fired.

bomb factory, UPDATES with army now saying three Israelis
moderately wounded and eight lightly &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An assailant, apparently a Palestinian,
on Wednesday lobbed two hand grenades at Israeli security forces in
downtown Hebron, the army said. Eleven troops and 11 Palestinian
bystanders were hurt.
	   Soldiers fired on the fleeing attacker who was shot in the leg
before reaching the Palestinian-controlled part of the divided
city.
	   The army poured reinforcements into Hebron, a troubled town of
130,000 Palestinian and 450 Jewish settlers, and imposed a curfew
on 30,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled sector.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded that
Palestinian police do more to prevent attacks on Israelis. Israel
has long complained that the Palestinian Authority is lax in
fighting terrorism, and Netanyahu has said he will not hand over
more West Bank land until he receives guarantees from Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat that militants will be disarmed and arrested.
	   Palestinian security officials, meanwhile, confirmed that they
have raided a Hamas bomb factory in Hebron. About half a ton of
explosives and materials used for making bombs were seized in the
raid earlier this week, the officials said.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
over renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to carry
out suicide bombings in the Jewish state. Hamas wants to avenge the
recent killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   Wednesday's violence erupted during Yom Kippur, the holiest day
on the Jewish calendar, as Israeli troops enforced a blanket
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Tensions in Hebron have been rising since last month's killing
of a settler rabbi, apparently by a Palestinian militant. On
Monday, an Israeli woman was wounded by shots fired from the
Palestinian sector.
	   In response, settlers have beaten Palestinian bystanders and
overturned tables in the downtown outdoor market.
	   The bloodshed came amid intensive U.S. efforts to broker an
agreement on an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West
Bank. Under a compromise, 3 percent of that land is to be set aside
as a nature reserve in which Israel retains control over security.
	   This week, U.S. President Bill Clinton hosted Netanyahu and
Arafat separately and then in a three-way summit. Israeli and U.S.
officials were upbeat, saying the land issue had been resolved.
	   However, Palestinian negotiators said Wednesday that some
differences remained. Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian
representative in Washington, said one of the points of contention
was whether Palestinian police could enter the nature reserve.
	   Palestinian negotiators said Wednesday that U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Mideast envoy Dennis Ross are to
return to the region Tuesday to prepare another Mideast summit in
Washington in mid-October.
	   The Hebron incident began Wednesday afternoon in downtown Gross
Square when an assailant threw two grenades. One grenade rolled
under a white station wagon and the second landed near a group of
Israeli troops before exploding.
	   The station wagon and a yellow van caught fire, with thick smoke
rising from the scorched vehicles.
	   The blast injured five soldiers and six officers from the
paramilitary border police, as well as 11 Palestinians, the army
and Palestinian doctors said. Three Israelis were in moderate
condition, while eight officers and the 11 Palestinians had light
injuries.
	   In other developments Wednesday, some 400 Palestinians threw
stones at Israeli soldiers near the West Bank village of Biddou.
Troops fired rubber bullets, injuring six Palestinians.
	   The clashes erupted after the funeral of a Hamas activist,
Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, who was killed Tuesday when a car rigged
with powerful explosives blew up in the industrial zone of the
village of Beitunia, near the town of Ramallah.
	   Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid, two Hamas activists who survived the
blast, denied they were preparing the car for a bombing attack in
Israel, Palestinian police officials said.
	   The Abu Eid brothers told Palestinian investigators that just
before the explosion, they met an Israeli Arab man in a car in the
Beitunia industrial zone, expecting him to deliver three guns for
dlrs 1,000. The man delivered a package and got out of the car
before the explosion went off, they said.
	   A caller to a Palestinian media center, saying he spoke for
Hamas, claimed that Israel was behind the bombing. However, Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar, said the group was still investigating the
incident.

15 feared killed in boat capsize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ At least 15 people were feared drowned
Wednesday when a boat carrying a group of pilgrims capsized in the
Ganges River in one of India's holiest cities, Varanasi, domestic
news agencies reported.
	   Rescue workers have pulled out seven bodies so far, the Press
Trust of India reported. But eight people were still reported
missing. Nineteen people were rescued by divers.
	   The boat was carrying 34 people when it dashed against an iron
barricade near the river bank, built to protect pilgrims taking
holy dips in the Ganges from the boat traffic on the river.
	   Divers in 23 boats were looking for survivors or bodies, PTI
said. Several cities down stream on the Ganges have been alerted to
look for bodies.

Court clears five police officers in death of Italian student
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) _ A military judge on Wednesday cleared
five police officers of aggravated manslaughter charges in the 1995
death of an Italian student in police custody, a case that caused
considerable friction between the Colombian and Italian
governments.
	   The judge, police Col. Javier Bermudez, said it had not been
proven that any of the officers even struck 24-year-old Giacomo
Turra, as lawyers for the dead man's family had alleged.
	   Turra, a philosophy student and poet from Padua, died on Sept.
3, 1995 after police removed him, allegedly drunk and under the
influence of cocaine, from a restaurant in this Caribbean resort.
	   Authorities said Turra, high on drugs, banged his head against
the wall and floor of the restaurant, whose owner called police.
Turra's family alleged that police subsequently beat the Italian to
death.
	   The family denied that Turra took drugs, but his father ordered
the body cremated and thorough forensic tests were never performed
on the corpse.
	   Turra's family has sued the Colombian government for dlrs
200,000 and the family's lawyer, Dayra Galvis, said she would
appeal the verdict. ``I've never had any faith in military
justice,'' she said. In Colombia, the national police are legally
an arm of the military and thus fall under the military court
system.
	   ``We can't be satisfied with this verdict,'' said the Italian
ambassador, Felice Scauso. ``We're very disillusioned. ... Not all
the circumstances have been cleared up.'' Scauso did not say
whether his government would take any action to protest the
verdict.
	   Defense lawyers argued that Turra's injuries were all
self-inflicted but a doctor who examined the young man on two
occasions _ shortly after he was taken into police custody and
later on when police returned with the foreigner _ said Turra had
new injuries the second time she saw him.
	   Those convicted of aggravated manslaughter (homicidio
preterintencional) face five years in prison.

Police clash with opposition activists, 50 injured

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Riot police fired tear gas and struck
with batons Wednesday to disperse angry opposition activists
protesting the arrest of three opposition politicians a day
earlier. At least 50 people were injured, witnesses said.
	   Nearly 300 activists from the country's main opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party marched through the Bangladeshi
capital to protest Tuesday's arrest of K.M. Obaidur Rahman, Shah
Moazzem Hossain and Nurul Islam Manjur.
	   The three were arrested in connection with the murder of four
jailed politicians in 1975, barely three months after the country's
first president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated in a
military coup.
	   The four leaders were ministers in the government of Sheikh
Mujib, his popular name in Bangladesh.
	   Wednesday's clashes started after demonstrators threw stones at
police and smashed some vehicles, witnesses said. None of the
injuries were serious.
	   Police said they arrested two protesters.
	   The opposition party denied their leaders' involvement in the
killing.
	   ``This case is absolutely politically motivated,'' Sadek Hossain
Khoka, an opposition leader told the demonstrators.

Tyson wants to settle traffic dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Wednesday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson's handlers want to clear a major
obstacle toward regaining a license for the former heavyweight
champion _ settlement with two men who accuse Tyson of assault
following a traffic accident.
	   The Nevada Athletic Commission will rule on Tyson's effort to
return to the ring, and on Wednesday waited for reports from
doctors who examined Tyson at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston last week.
	   The reports were to have been submitted by Monday. When they
weren't, the commission postponed Saturday's licensing hearing. The
commission said a date for the new hearing probably won't be
determined until Thursday.
	   The attempt to settle comes after two Nevada boxing
commissioners said they want to know what happened in Maryland
before they vote on giving Tyson a license.
	   ``Hopefully, this will all be resolved before the hearing,''
Tyson adviser Jeff Wald said. ``We're going to try to deal with it
before then.''
	   Tyson refused to answer questions about the matter at his Sept.
19 hearing before the Nevada commission.
	   But with commissioners now on the record saying they want
answers before giving Tyson a new license, the boxer's lawyers have
begun negotiations on a settlement.
	   Richard Hardick, 50, says Tyson kicked him in the groin after
Hardick's car rear-ended a Mercedes driven by Tyson's wife, Monica,
Aug. 31 in a Maryland suburb. Hardick and Abmielec Saucedo, 62, who
said Tyson punched him in the face, have filed criminal complaints.
	   Calls to both men and their lawyers Wednesday were not returned,
but Tyson's lawyers confirmed they want to settle. Wald declined to
discuss the negotiations.
	   Wald said clearing up this dispute means more to Tyson than just
a return of the license he lost for biting Evander Holyfield's ears
last year.
	   Tyson is still on probation from his rape conviction in Indiana
and could conceivably be returned to prison if convicted of another
crime.
	   ``The impact on Mike's life if there were charges in this
incident far exceeds his boxing license,'' Wald said. ``It comes to
the matter of his freedom.''
	   Wald said Tyson would not give up his right to presumed
innocence by talking about the incident before the commission.
	   Others close to Tyson, who asked not to be identified, said any
settlement would not be especially lucrative for the two men, even
if they believe they have leverage over Tyson because of the
pending commission vote.

British lawmaker to stand trial for fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ A governing Labor Party lawmaker who
is the first Muslim member of Britain's House of Commons will stand
trial for electoral fraud in November, court officials said
Wednesday.
	   Mohammed Sarwar, a 46-year-old Glasgow millionaire businessman,
has refused to resign since being charged last year. He will stand
trial Nov. 2.
	   Copies of the indictment were not made public Wednesday.
	   Pakistan-born Sarwar, who came to Britain with his immigrant
parents as a 4-year-old, won a working class Glasgow district,
Govan, in national elections May 1, 1997.
	   Shortly afterward, a national newspaper, The News of the World,
reported he had given a rival candidate a $8,150 bribe to ease off
campaigning.
	   Sarwar was suspended from the Labor Party when police started
investigating.
	   In December, police issued a warrant for his arrest on charges
relating to late registration of voters, obstructing justice and
violating election expenses rules.

Tarango through to second round to meet giantkiller Rosset
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) - Jeff Tarango, the only U.S. player
competing in the dlrs 400,000 Toulouse Open, won his first round
match Wednesday against Switzerland's Ivo Heuberger after losing
the first set.
	   The Manhattan Beach, Ca. player, who beat Karol Kucera in the
recent MFS Pro Championships, was firm favorite to beat Heuberger,
but had to come from a set down to win 6-1, 6-4.
	   In the second round, Tarango will meet another Swiss player,
Marc Rosset.
	   Rosset pulled off the biggest shock of the tournament so far
when he beat Fabrice Santoro of France, the World No. 29, on
Monday.
	   Germany's Martin Sinner recorded his best result of 1998
Wednesday when he beat hard-hitting Dutchman Paul Haarhuis in
straight sets.
	   Sinner, 30, never looked back after breaking the Dutchman's
serve in the second game of the match, and advanced easily to the
second round, 6-2, 6-4.
	   Sinner dropped out of the top 100 last spring, while Haarhuis
entered the tournament with a No. 64 ranking.
	   There was disappointment for French No. 3 Guillaume Raoux, who
lost to Swiss qualifier Roger Federer, 6-2, 6-2.
	   But France's Jerome Golmard advanced, beating David Prinosil of
Germany, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ An Israeli El Al cargo jet that
crashed in Amsterdam six years ago was carrying chemicals used to
produce the deadly sarin nerve gas, a Dutch newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The plane was carrying 190 liters (50 gallons) of the chemical
identified as dimethyl methylphosphonate when it crashed into an
apartment block outside Amsterdam in 1992, according the respected
national daily NRC Handelsblad.
	   Citing a freight document, the newspaper said the chemical came
from an American company in Pennsylvania and was headed for the
Israel Institute for Biological Research in Ness Ziona near Tel
Aviv.
	   The U.S. company was identified as Solkatronic Chemicals Inc. in
Morrisville, Pennsylvania.
	   A copy of the document was printed on the front page of the
newspaper, which did not say how it acquired the document.
	   Nearly six years after the accident, controversies still
surround the plane's cargo, despite repeated investigations. Ahead
of the report, the Dutch parliament announced Thursday it will
launch a parliamentary inquiry into the accident.
	   The Boeing 747-200 crashed into an apartment complex in southern
Amsterdam on Oct. 4, 1992, killing 43 people. Israeli officials
said earlier the plane did not carry any dangerous materials.
	   On Wednesday, David Bar-Illan, the senior adviser to Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ``flatly'' denied that the plane
was carrying chemicals used to produce sarin.
	   Nahman Klieman, spokesman for El Al, said Wedensday that the
cargo manifests were turned over to Dutch authorites immediately
after the accident. He also said that El Al flies all cargo
materials in accordance with international regulations.
	   However, Klieman would not comment when asked whether chemicals
used for making the nerve gas sarin were aboard the plane when it
crashed.
	   According to NRC, the amount of dimethyl methylphosphonate on
board was enough to produce up to 270 kilograms (594 pounds) of the
nerve gas.
	   The raw material is also used in building materials as a flame
retardant.
	   Four main components are needed for the production of sarin and
three of them were on board the El Al jet, said the daily.
	   The newspaper said it was not clear whether the burning of these
chemicals following the accident was to blame for health complaints
by residents near the crash site.
	   A spokesman for the Dutch Transport Ministry declined comment on
the report, saying all the details concerning the plane's cargo
were announced previously.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An assailant, apparently a Palestinian,
on Wednesday lobbed two hand grenades at Israeli security forces in
downtown Hebron, the army said. Eleven troops and 11 Palestinian
bystanders were hurt.
	   Soldiers fired on the fleeing attacker who was shot in the leg
before reaching the Palestinian-controlled part of the divided
city.
	   The army poured reinforcements into Hebron, a troubled town of
130,000 Palestinian and 450 Jewish settlers, and imposed a curfew
on 30,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled sector.
Troops also set up roadblocks around Hebron, barring Palestinians
from leaving or entering the city.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ At a college
cafeteria-turned-hurricane relief center in the Dominican capital,
40-year-old New Yorker Fernando Mateo barked out orders to legions
of volunteers.
	   ``Let's go! Let's go! Move it, my brothers!'' he said, as a
dozen young men loaded clothes and water jugs, bucket-brigade
style, onto a dump truck heading for a hurricane-wracked slum of
the capital, Santo Domingo.
	   Dominican expatriates wiring money or bringing in emergency
supplies from abroad are largely unsung players in the
international disaster relief effort for the Dominican Republic,
hard-hit by Hurricane Georges.
	   Cash and donations from Dominicans living in the United States _
substantial under normal circumstances _ have become a lifeline for
this Caribbean nation reeling from its worst natural disaster in
decades.
	   The Dominican death toll rose Wednesday from 210 to 249,
President Leonel Fernandez's office said, without offering details.
At least 100,000 lost their homes when Hurricane Georges' 110 mph
(175 kph) winds struck the Dominican Republic on Sept. 22.
	   Across the Caribbean, Georges killed at least 404 people last
week.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An assailant on Wednesday lobbed two
hand grenades at Israeli security forces in downtown Hebron,
injuring 11 troops and 11 Palestinian bystanders.
	   Soldiers fired on the fleeing attacker, apparently a
Palestinian, who was shot in the leg before reaching the
Palestinian-controlled part of the divided city, the army said.
	   The army poured reinforcements into Hebron, a troubled town of
130,000 Palestinian and 450 Jewish settlers, and imposed a curfew
on 30,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled sector.
Troops also set up roadblocks around Hebron, barring Palestinians
from leaving or entering the city.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded that
Palestinian police do more to prevent attacks on Israelis. Israel
has long complained that the Palestinian Authority is lax in
fighting terrorism, and Netanyahu has said he will not hand over
more West Bank land until he receives guarantees from Yasser Arafat
that militants will be disarmed and arrested.
	   Palestinian security officials, meanwhile, confirmed that they
have raided a Hamas bomb factory in Hebron. About half a ton of
explosives and materials used for making bombs were seized in the
raid earlier this week, the officials said.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
over renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to carry
out suicide bombings in the Jewish state. Hamas wants to avenge the
recent killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   Wednesday's violence erupted during Yom Kippur, the holiest day
on the Jewish calendar, as Israeli troops enforced a blanket
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Tensions in Hebron have been rising since last month's killing
of a settler rabbi, apparently by a Palestinian militant. On
Monday, an Israeli woman was wounded by shots fired from the
Palestinian sector.
	   In response, settlers have beaten Palestinian bystanders and
overturned tables in the downtown outdoor market.
	   The bloodshed came amid intensive U.S. efforts to broker an
agreement on an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West
Bank. Under a compromise, 3 percent of that land is to be set aside
as a nature reserve in which Israel retains control over security.
	   This week, U.S. President Bill Clinton hosted Netanyahu and
Arafat separately and then in a three-way summit. Israeli and U.S.
officials were upbeat, saying the land issue had been resolved.
	   However, Palestinian negotiators said Wednesday that some
differences remained. Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian
representative in Washington, said one of the points of contention
was whether Palestinian police could enter the nature reserve.
	   Palestinian negotiators said Wednesday that U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Mideast envoy Dennis Ross are to
return to the region Tuesday to prepare another Mideast summit in
Washington in mid-October.
	   The Hebron incident began Wednesday afternoon in downtown Gross
Square when an assailant threw two grenades. One grenade rolled
under a white station wagon and the second landed near a group of
Israeli troops before exploding.
	   The station wagon and a yellow van caught fire, with thick smoke
rising from the scorched vehicles.
	   The blast injured five soldiers and six officers from the
paramilitary border police, as well as 11 Palestinians, the army
and Palestinian doctors said. Three Israelis were in moderate
condition, while eight officers and the 11 Palestinians had light
injuries.
	   In other developments Wednesday, some 400 Palestinians threw
stones at Israeli soldiers near the West Bank village of Biddou.
Troops fired rubber bullets, injuring six Palestinians.
	   The clashes erupted after the funeral of a Hamas activist,
Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, who was killed Tuesday when a car rigged
with powerful explosives blew up in the industrial zone of the
village of Beitunia, near the town of Ramallah.
	   Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid, two Hamas activists who survived the
blast, denied they were preparing the car for a bombing attack in
Israel, Palestinian police officials said.
	   The Abu Eid brothers told Palestinian investigators that just
before the explosion, they met an Israeli Arab man in a car in the
Beitunia industrial zone, expecting him to deliver three guns for
dlrs 1,000. The man delivered a package and got out of the car
before the explosion went off, they said.
	   Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar, said the group was still
investigating the incident.

NBA players lead team for friendly games in Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ After overcoming security fears, a North
American basketball team led by NBA players from Portland,
Sacramento and Vancouver opened a series of friendly games
Wednesday in Lebanon.
	   The first game in Beirut's Sports City, which was rebuilt after
the country's 15-year civil war infamous for the kidnapping of
Westerners, was against Lebanon's national team. The visitors won
90-81.
	   During their stay through Sunday, they also will meet an Arab
All-Star team and practice with a local team.
	   Coach Anthony Ronzone of San Francisco, California, said it took
two months of negotiations to round up the team to play in Lebanon,
which is still struggling to shed its civil war image as a nasty
place.
	   ``It took me a lot of effort to get it done,'' said Ronzone, who
is leading the team on behalf of FIBA, the international basketball
federation. ``I had to talk to many people, their families, their
wives.''
	   Ronzone said the players' first question was ``Is it safe?''
	   He termed that ``understandable,'' and added: ``Now that they
are here, everything they are getting is outstanding.''
	   Among the visiting team were National Basketball Association
players Rick Brunson of the Portland Trail Blazers, Michael Stewart
of the Sacramento Kings and Sam Mack of the Vancouver Grizzlies.
	   Former NBA players include Brad Davis, Dell Demps and David
Wood.
	   The team was invited by Beirut's Sporting Club, with costs
underwritten by private Lebanese TV stations. Neither Ronzone nor
the Lebanese sponsors revealed fees or costs.
	   The games are the first in the Sports City's indoor stadium and
are designed to promote basketball in a region where soccer is the
public's first love.
	   ``The growth of basketball in the Middle East and Lebanon is
phenomenal,'' Ronzone said. ``People love the game, and my role is
to promote that entertaining game.''
	   The Sports City, which was destroyed during Israel's 1982
invasion of Lebanon, was rebuilt to host the summer of 1997
pan-Arab track and field games.
	   During its 1975-90 civil war, Lebanon became synonymous with
violence. Lebanese gunmen attacked and kidnapped foreigners, mainly
Americans and other Westerners.
	   In July 1997, the U.S. State Department lifted a 10-year ban on
American travel to Lebanon, replacing it with a travel advisory.
Since then, Americans have begun returning.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Graeme Souness won the battle of the
British coaches Wednesday when his Benfica side beat Bobby Robson's
PSV Eindhoven 2-1 in the European Champions League.
	   The win gave the Scotsman's Portuguese team its first points in
Group F after it lost at Kaiserslautern in the first rotation. The
Dutch outfit, under former England coach Robson, had beaten HJK
Helsinki in its first group game.
	   Nuno Gomes, the Portuguese first division's leading scorer,
notched the game's first goal two minutes after the interval in
front of 30,000 spectators at Benfica's Stadium of Light.
	   Gomes received the ball from Hugo Leal on the edge of the
penalty areas and beat a Dutch defender before chipping the ball
over goalie Ronald Waterreus.
	   Waterreus gained revenge when he saved Gomes' 70th-minute
penalty after Mark Pembridge was fouled in the area.
	   Two minutes later, PSV launched a counter-attack down the right
flank and Dane Dennis Rommedahl netted the equalizer.
	   But with 15 minutes left, Joao Pinto dribbled into the area to
score the winner.
	   PSV was under pressure from the start and was mostly pinned in
its own half.
	   Gilles de Bilde hit the post in the 13th minute.

Swiss federation gives cyclists eight-month bans, fines

<TEXT>
	   ROTHRIST, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss Cycling Federation has
handed down eight month bans to three cyclists expelled from the
scandal-rocked Tour de France for using an illegal
performance-enhancing drug, the body announced Wednesday.
	   The federation's special anti-doping commission also fined
riders Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier 3,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 2,164) each.
	   The bans on the cyclists will take effect immediately, the
commission said. The punishments were not the lowest, nor the
highest, that could have been imposed. According to UCI rules,
cyclists who confess or test positive for drugtaking can be banned
for between six months and a year and face fines of between 2-4,000
francs.
	   Commission president Remo Von Daniken said the commission had
chosen a punishment above the minimum to ``send a signal.''
	   ``The judgement must be seen as a new start in this sorry doping
story,'' said Von Daniken.
	   The three cyclists left the hotel in the northeastern town of
Rothrist where the commission made its judgement without knowing
the results or offering comment.
	   ``I've no more to say on this matter,'' Armin Meier said later.
	   The three cyclists were members of the Festina team thrown out
of this year's Tour de France.
	   Festina was expelled because its riders were said to have taken
the hormone EPO. Zuelle, Dufaux and Meier were among those who
later admitted taking the drug.
	   The federation's sentences must still be approved by cycling's
world governing body, the International Cycling Union (UCI).

New prime minister consults with allies on forming new government

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Pandeli Majko, Albania's new Socialist
prime minister, started talks Wednesday with allied parties to form
a new Cabinet.
	   But the opposition said there will be no dialogue with the new
government and announced more protests.
	   Majko, the Socialist Party's 30-year-old general secretary, was
nominated Tuesday to replace Fatos Nano, who resigned late Monday.
	   Majko was expected to announce the names of the new ministers on
Thursday. But with the opposition determined to boycott Parliament
and remain in the street, Albania was unlikely to emerge from the
deep political crisis any time soon.
	   Nano resigned after he failed to win approval for Cabinet
changes after riots two weeks ago that were caused by the
assassination of a popular opposition leader.
	   About 3,000 supporters of former President Sali Berisha, who
heads the opposition Democratic Party, gathered Wednesday in the
capital, Tirana, to protest the prime minister's appointment.
	   Berisha told his supporters that there would be no dialogue with
the new government and that street protests would continue.
	   ``One clan was replaced with another. One terrorist government
was replaced with another terrorist government,'' said Berisha.
	   On Tuesday, Berisha proposed that the new government have a
broader base, including more parties outside the governing
coalition.
	   However, coalition members rejected the idea.
	   Berisha called for another antigovernment rally Saturday.

Ajax downs Porto 2-1 in Champions League Group A
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Jari Litmanen became Ajax's top
European marksman of all time Wednesday, scoring an 86th minute
penalty to give the Amsterdam club a 2-1 Champions League victory
over Porto.
	   The Finnish international's 24th strike in European competitions
overtook living legend Johan Cruyff's tally of 23.
	   Polish midfielder Andrzej Rudy had earlier given the Amsterdam
powerhouse a 1-0 lead before Zlatko Zahovic equalized for Porto.
	   Rudy's powerful 57th-minute strike, from 25 meters (yards)
squirmed through the hands of Porto goalkeeper Rui Correia in front
of 40,000 fans at the Amsterdam Arena.
	   But just 12 minutes later Slovenian Zahovic sneaked behind the
Ajax defense and stretched out a left foot to poke the ball under
Edwin van der Sar for the equalizer.
	   Litmanen grabbed all three points for Ajax from the penalty spot
after a foul by Jorge Costa on substitute Gerald Sibon, who fell
heavily after a light of challenges.
	   Porto had the best chance before the break, when Ljubimko
Drulovic boke free down the left flank in the 12th minute and
centered to an unmarked Mario Jardel, but the Brazilian's powerful
downward header bounced off the turf and glanced the cross bar on
its way to safety.
	   Ajax finally strung together its first neat move in the 20th
minute and immediately threatened the Porto goal.
	   Litmanen, slipped the ball to Ronald de Boer, who passed to
Tijjani Babangida on the right wing. The Nigerian sent a measured
cross directly into the path of Peter Hoekstra, but Hoekstra's
strong header sailed just over the bar.

Elber's goal helps Munich draw against Manchester in strange match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Brazilian striker Giovane Elber's second
goal of a strange Champions League match in the 90th minute
Wednesday helped Bayern Munich salvage a 2-2 draw against
Manchester United.
	   In the first international meeting ever between the two famed
clubs, Elber headed in the equalizer after a mistake by Manchester
keeper Peter Schmeichel, who abandoned his goal to chase an
inbounds pass.
	   That was the third odd goal of a match played in a downpour,
with Manchester's Paul Scholes putting his club up 2-1 in the 49th
minute when two Germans had unaccountable blunders.
	   Before the match, a moment of silence was held for the eight
Manchester United players killed on Feb. 6, 1958 when their plane
crashed during a snowstorm during a stopover in Munich.
	   The English club had not returned to Munich in the 40 years
since then despite both team's long storied history on the European
stage.
	   Elber scored his first goal in the 11th minute, a gift from the
referees after he was offsides, and Dwight Yorcke's diving header
in the 30th minute equalized for Manchester.
	   Even Yorcke's goal, off a brilliant cross by David Beckham,
resulted from a mistake by German libero Lothar Matthaeus, who
kicked the ball directly at Beckham.
	   Manchester remained in good position in Group D play with two
draws, while Munich appears all but eliminated after a stunning 2-1
loss to Brondby in their opening match.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Youri Djorkaeff, a member of France's World
Cup titlists, slammed in a loose ball in the fourth minute of
second-half injury time Wednesday to lift Internazionale of Milan
past Austria's Sturm Graz 1-0 in a Champions League Group C game.
	   Without injured stars Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio, Inter Milan
wasted half a dozen clear scoring chances and found the woodwork
twice before Djorkaeff provided the winner from steps away. The
hosts tried several combinations in attack but poor finishing and a
driving rain kept the score 0-0 for over 90 minutes.

	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Brazilian striker Sonny Anderson led FC
Barcelona to an easy 2-0 win over Brondby of Denmark on Wednesday
in a Champions League Group D match.
	   Anderson put Barcelona ahead in the 44th minute, seizing on a
ball that had been deflected twice by Brondby defenders and firing
it in from 10 yards out at cavernous Camp Nou stadium.
	   Anderson struck again in the 85th minute after fellow Brazilian
Rivaldo made a blazing left-footed shot that Brondby goalkeeper
Mogens Krogh managed to stop, only to see Anderson head it in on
the fly.
	   The star-studded Catalan side played without Patrick Kluivert of
Holland, who signed too late to qualify for European play. Still,
it overwhelmed Brondby in time of possession and shots on goal.
	   In first-round play Barcelona salvaged a 3-3 tie at Manchester
United but has struggled in the Spanish league. On Sunday it tied
2-2 against lowly Celta, and lags in fourth place.
	   Brondby beat Bayern Munich 2-1 in the first rotation.
	   Wednesday's win put Barcelona in first place in Group D with
four points, ahead of Brondy with three, Manchester United with two
and Bayern Munich with one.

<TEXT>
	   WEMBLEY, England (AP) _ Tony Adams atoned for an early blunder
by firing Arsenal to a 2-1 victory over Panathinaikos in a
Champions Cup group game Wednesday.
	   After heading wide of a yawning goal only three minutes into the
game, the tall center-back powered the Gunners ahead with a close
range shot in the 65th minute after goalkeeper Jozef Wandzik failed
to hold on to Emanuel Petit's swinging corner.
	   Seven minutes later, Martin Keown made it 2-0 with a glancing
header from Petit's rightwing corner before Brazilian substitute
Mauro replied with a close range header from a free kick two
minutes from the end.
	   Adams missed an easy chance to put the Gunners ahead after only
three minutes when he arrived unmarked to meet a free kick at the
far post but his diving header with only the 'keeper to beat flew
across the face of the goal.
	   Three minutes later Nicolas Anelka got away from a defender but
goalkeeper Wandzik blocked his angled shot with his foot.
	   Andrea Lagonikakis had a 30-meter (yard) shot palmed over the
top by goalkeeper David Seaman and Nikos Liberopoulos volleyed a
20-meter shot inches too high.
	   Four minutes before halftime, Marc Overmars had a shot blocked
by the 'keeper's legs and Anelka's follow up effort was smothered
on the line and then cleared by defender Ioannis Goumas.
	   The Greek champion was without top scorer and captain Krzysztof
Warzycha, a veteran Polish international who was sidelined with a
torn thigh muscle.
	   Arsenal's decision to move the game to Wembley from its home of
Highbury appeared to backfire because, at scheduled kickoff time,
only 48,000 of the expected 73,000 crowd had made it to the
stadium. Fearing crushes outside the ground, police ordered the
kickoff be delayed by 20 minutes.

 &UR; Elber's goal helps Munich draw against Manchester in strange match &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: ADDS details, RECASTS in parts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ In a strange Champions League match
Wednesday, Brazilian striker Giovane Elber's second goal in the
90th minute helped Bayern Munich salvage a 2-2 draw against
Manchester United.
	   In the first international meeting ever between the two famed
clubs, Elber headed in the equalizer after a mistake by Manchester
keeper Peter Schmeichel, who abandoned his goal to chase an
inbounds pass.
	   That was the third odd goal of a match played in a downpour and
marked by defensive lapses, with Manchester's Paul Scholes putting
his club up 2-1 in the 49th minute when two Germans had
unaccountable blunders.
	   The match also marked a historical occasion, with a moment of
silence being held before the whistle for the eight Manchester
United players killed on Feb. 6, 1958 when their plane crashed in
Munich during a snowstorm.
	   The English club had not returned to Munich in the 40 years
since that fatal stopover in the city _ which followed a match
against Red Star Belgrade _ despite both team's long storied
history on the European stage.
	   Elber scored his first goal in the 11th minute, a gift from the
referees after he was offsides, although his short-range chip
finished some fine combination play with his teammates.
	   Dwight Yorcke's diving header in the 30th minute equalized for
Manchester after a brilliant cross by David Beckham.
	   But even Yorcke's goal resulted from a glaring error when German
libero Lothar Matthaeus putted the ball directly at Beckham.
	   Matthaeus also missed with his left foot when Scholes pushed the
ball into the penalty area on his go-ahead goal. The ball then
bounced over Munich keeper Ollie Kahn, who dived at it feet first.
	   Scholes, jumping over Kahn, then punched the ball into an empty
net in what seemed to be a typical moment for the match.
	   Manchester remained in good position in Group D play with two
draws, while Munich appears all but eliminated after a stunning 2-1
loss to Brondby in their opening match.

Champions: Dynamo ties Lens 1-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Dynamo Kiev, quarterfinalist in the
previous European champions' tournament, settled for a
disappointing 1-1 tie with Lens Wednesday in a Champions Cup Group
E second rotation game.
	   The Ukrainian team's desperate attempts to capitalize on
territorial advantage and get through Lens' tough defense were
rewarded only in the 61st minute when leading striker Andriy
Shevchenko headed home a corner kick.
	   French goalkeeper Guillaume Warmuz was to blame by stepping too
far off his line trying to catch the cross.
	   Shevchenko's goal made up for afailed opportunity in the first
half when he struck the post in front of goal.
	   Lens' Tony Vairelles disappointed a 60,000 crowd at Kiev's
Olimpiysky stadium just a minute after Dynamo's goal. He equalized
with a powerful shot in a quick counterattack, which left most of
Dynamo's defense stranded.
	   Dynamo pressed for the rest of the game, but the French defense
kept the Ukrainian forwards away from goal.
	   Lens responded with several more dangerous attacks but Dynamo's
goalkeeper, Oleksandr Shovkovsky, ensured no more mistakes and a
share of the points.

Olympiakos beats Croatia in Champions League

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Serbian striker Sinisa Gogic scored one
goal and setup another as Olympiakos Piraeus beat Croatia Zagreb
2-0 Wednesday in a Group A game for the Champions League.
	   The win sent Olympiakos at the top of the group, sharing the
position with Ajax Amsterdam with four points each after two games.
	   Playing aggressive from the start, midfield pressing and
constant attacks, Olympiakos caused immense problems to the
Croatian defense.
	   The hosts came close to open the scoring in the 16th minute when
a powerful shot by Vassilis Karapialis outside the area went wide,
scraping past the left bar of goalie Drazen Ladic.
	   Five minutes later, 70,000 fans cheered wildly as Alecos
Alexandris put Olympiakos ahead off a pass from Gogic.
	   The visitors, who played without their star Robert Prosinecki,
lost a good scoring chance in the 35th when goalie Dimitris
Eleftheropoulos made a decisive save to a free kick from Josko
Jelicic.
	   Dario Simic made a line save to a shot from Olympiakos'
midfielder Stelios Giannacopoulos in the 62nd.
	   Eleftheropoulos averted the equalizer in the 67th with a
spectacular save to a shot from Silvio Maric.
	   Nine minutes before the end of the game, Gogic gained the ball
in the Croatian area, dribbled past Goran Juric to make the final
2-0.

Britain arranging for urgent Kosovo meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with consultations scheduled for
Thursday, U.S. backing request, NATO finalizing preparations. No
pickup.
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Backed by the United States, Britain on
Wednesday called an emergency meeting of the Security Council to
denounce the latest massacre of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   Meanwhile, NATO proceeded with final preparations for airstrikes
against Serb forces.
	   ``This was not an act of war, it was plain cold murder,''
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said at a new conference at
the Labor Party's annual conference in Blackpool, England.
	   He said the meeting would request an urgent report on Kosovo
from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Britain takes over the
Security Council presidency on Thursday, which gives it the
authority to put matters on the agenda.
	   Informal consultations on Kosovo were scheduled for Thursday
afternoon.
	   Cook warned that NATO airstrikes could follow Annan's report,
which is a regular 30-day update that was expected late this week
or early next week.
	   ``Military action will flow from a political decision,'' he
said.
	   Cook also called for a meeting in London Friday of the six
countries represented in the so-called Contact Group on Yugoslavia:
the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia. He
said the meeting was to find a ``way forward on a political
settlement'' for Kosovo.
	   In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
Cook by telephone that she agreed with convening a council meeting
to discuss the atrocities in Kosovo, State Department spokesman
James Foley said.
	   As for the possibility of military action, Foley said,
``Clearly, the clock is ticking.''
	   Annan is evaluating whether Serbia has complied with last week's
Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire in Kosovo, a
withdrawal of Serbian troops, and the start of ``serious dialogue
on real autonomy'' for the province.
	   In a possible precursor to his report, Annan issued a statement
Wednesday condemning the slaughter of 18 people in the Serbian
province on Sunday. Annan added that the reported massacre was
``particularly shocking'' since the Yugoslav foreign minister had
as recently as Tuesday denied Serb involvement in any atrocities.
	   Serb police denied responsibility Wednesday for the killings, in
which men, women and children were shot in the back of the head and
mutilated. The bodies were seen Tuesday by diplomats and
journalists in a forest in the Drenica region of Kosovo, where the
ethnic Albanian majority is fighting for independence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed, and over a quarter million
have fled their homes since a Serb crackdown began in February. The
West supports autonomy for Kosovo but not independence.
	   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, the alliance
proceeded Wednesday with preparations for airstrikes against Serb
forces in Kosovo. The preparations are almost complete, NATO
officials said.
	   The Security Council threatened to consider unspecified
additional measures if both sides failed to comply with the Sept.
23 resolution. The resolution is militarily enforceable, but it did
not explicitly authorize NATO action.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China are opposed to any
use of force in Kosovo. China abstained from last week's
resolution, claiming that the fighting in Kosovo didn't constitute
a threat to international peace and security.
	   Russia signed off on the resolution, but argued that another
resolution was required for council authorization of military
action. Both Russia and China could veto any new resolution.
	   Council diplomats said the possible outcome of Thursday's
consultations would be a statement, read by council president
Jeremy Greenstock of Britain, condemning the massacre. A resolution
_ a formal document backed by international law _ was even less
likely, they said.
	   Foley reaffirmed the U.S. view that no council action would be
required for NATO to take military action but that any council
statement in support of NATO's determination to act would be
welcome.
	   ``The actual decision to use force, though, may not be far away
if indeed the situation doesn't change rapidly,'' Foley said.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Romanian playmaker Gheorghe Hagi fired
Galatasaray to victory with an injury time goal on Wednesday in a
2-1 triumph over Spain's Atletico de Bilbao in the European
Champions Cup.
	   The veteran also set up the match's opening goal in the 16th
minute, when he hit a powerful free kick that rebounded off Spanish
goalkeeper Imanol Etxebarria, allowing Galatasaray's Okan Buruk to
bullet the ball into the net.
	   Atletico left little time for the Turks to rejoice, as less than
a minute later, forward Ismael Urzaiz surprised the Galatasaray
defense by equalizing the score in the 17th minute.
	   Throughout the second half the two teams missed chance after
chance to tip the game to their favor with Galatasaray's
close-guarded striker Hakan Sukur missing at least four chances to
score.
	   In the 75th minute, Atletico's Bittor Alkiza fired the ball well
over the goal posts to the despair of his coach, Frenchman Luiz
Fernandes.
	   Hagi saved the day for the 20,000 Galatasaray fans attending the
game when in the 91st minute he spinned the ball into a corner of
the net leaving the Spanish goalkeeper helpless.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Substitute Erkka Lehtola volleyed over
the bar from two meters in the 83rd minute and HJK Helsinki had to
be content with a goalless draw in its Champions' Cup game against
Germany's Kaiserslautern Wednesday night.
	   Goalkeeper Andreas Reinke was by far the best player for
Kaiserslautern, capping a great performance with a splendid save in
overtime, turning away a hard shot from Mika Lehkosuo just inside
the post.
	   HJK's was also close to scoring at 68 minutes on a counterattack
as Aki Riihilahti shot from close range, but Reincke grabbed the
ball. Kaiserslautern striker Olaf Marschall then missed an open
goal with his header at 78 minutes on Uwe Roslers's cross.
	   HJK 'keeper Jani Viander thwarted the Kaiserslautern attack with
agility after 58 minutes when he grabbed a decisive pass from
Martin Wagner aimed for Marschall, waiting for a free header. And
Viander turned away Marian Hristov's header towards the upper
corner, from a centre by Andreas Buck.

Libyans, legal counsel arriving for Lockerbie consultations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout to UPDATE with Libyan team expected for
consultations. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A Libyan team is expected at U.N.
headquarters this week to work with the organization's top legal
officer on clarifying questions about a proposal to try two Libyan
suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing in the Netherlands, a U.N.
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The team was expected midweek, but spokesman Fred Eckhard
refused to say when they would arrive or whether they were already
here.
	   Legal counsel Hans Corell has been consulting with the Libyan
government since last month when Tripoli requested in a letter that
Secretary-General Kofi Annan help clarify some issues in the
U.S.-British proposal.
	   Libya has refused to hand over the men for years, saying they
wouldn't get a fair trial in the United States or Britain. The U.S.
and British governments proposed a Netherlands trial last month in
an attempt to close the decade-old case.
	   The Security Council has threatened Libya with more sanctions if
it doesn't turn the men over promptly. As an incentive, council
members agreed last month to suspend sanctions that bar air travel
to and from Libya once the two arrive in the Netherlands.
	   A suitcase bomb exploded on board Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people on board and on the ground.
	   The proposal says if convicted, the suspects must serve their
sentences in Britain.
	   Libya's U.N. ambassador, Abuzed Dorda, said in his General
Assembly speech on Tuesday that the suspects should serve their
terms in either the Netherlands or Libya.

Protesters force way into Peru's government palace

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Five thousand antigovernment protesters armed
with clubs and stones broke through a police cordon Wednesday and
forced their way into Peru's presidential palace.
	   A group of 60 demonstrators who battled through police lines
spray-painted ``Dictator!'' on the stone walls of the palace
courtyard in one of Peru's most violent protests in recent years.
	   President Alberto Fujimori was in his office at the time but
protesters did not reach him, a palace spokesman said.
	   Police fired shots into the air and lobbed tear gas to disperse
the 5,000 protesters, who represented Peru's main unions and
student groups. No injuries were reported.
	   Police were seen leading several protesters away, but there was
no official word of how many were arrested.
	   The General Confederation of Peruvian Workers, Peru's largest
labor federation, called the protest against government policies
that have thrown many out of work.
	   Students and unionists also marched in antigovernment protests
in major cities in the provinces of Cuzco, Trujillo, Arequipa, Ica
and Puno.
	   University students joined the march in the capital, Lima, to
protest the erosion of Peru's democratic institutions. They charged
that Fujimori has trampled Peru's constitution and laws to pave the
way to run in 2000 for a third consecutive term.
	   Congressional President Victor Joy Way urged calm and said the
protest was an attempt to destabilize the state.
	   Polls show that Fujimori's popularity has fallen in recent

British lawmaker to stand trial for fraud

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ A governing Labor Party lawmaker who
is the first Muslim member of the House of Commons will stand trial
for electoral fraud in November, court officials said Wednesday.
	   Mohammed Sarwar, a 46-year-old Glasgow millionaire businessman,
has refused to resign since being charged last year and has
protested his innocence. He will stand trial Nov. 2.
	   Copies of the indictment were not made public Wednesday.
	   Pakistan-born Sarwar, who came to Britain with his immigrant
parents as a 4-year-old, won a working class Glasgow district,
Govan, in national elections May 1, 1997.
	   Shortly afterward, a national newspaper, The News of the World,
reported he had given a rival candidate 5,000 pounds (dlrs 8,150)
to ease off campaigning.
	   Sarwar was suspended from the Labor Party when police started
investigating.
	   In December, police issued a warrant for his arrest on charges
relating to late registration of voters, obstructing justice and
violating election expenses rules.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Defending titlist Real Madrid surrendered the lead
and tumbled 2-1 to Spartak Moscow in the second round of Champions
Cup group games Wednesday.
	   The Spanish powerhouse failed to follow up its 2-0 victory over
Inter Milan in the opening round of games as Spartak moved three
points clear of its two biggest group rivals to become the only one
of the 24 contenders with maximum points from two games.
	   Inter edged Sturm Graz 1-0 thanks to a strike by French striker
Youri Djorkaeff four minutes into injury time so that it is tied on
three points with Real in the Group C standings.
	   A late blunder by Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel handed
Bayern Munich a 2-2 tie with Manchester United in Group D as
Barcelona move to the top with a 2-0 victory over Brondby,
ironically of Denmark.
	   Schmeichel collided with team-mate Jaap Stam and Brazilian
forward Elber was able to score his second of the game in the dying
minutes. After two ties, United has two points behind Barcelona
(four) and Brondby (three) and Bayern has one.
	   Romanian veteran Gheorghe Hagi netted an injury time winner as
Galatasaray moved to the top of Group B with a 2-1 victory over
Athletic de Bilbao in Istanbul. He also set up the first for Okan
Buruk.
	   Italian powerhouse Juventus was held to a 1-1 tie by Norway's
Rosenborg despite taking the lead through Filippo Inzaghi.
	   Another late strike, by Ajax forward Jari Litmanen, gave his
team a 2-1 victory over FC Porto in Group A and put him into the
club's record books with 24 goals.
	   The Finnish forward's 86th minute penalty put him ahead of
Johann Cruyff as the Amsterdam club's leading scorer in the
competition.
	   Greek club Olympiakos scored a 2-0 victory over Croatia Zagreb
and joins Ajax with four points atop the standings.
	   Tony Adams missed an early header but then fired Arsenal ahead
at Wembley as the Gunners downed Panathinaikos of Athens 2-1 to top
Group E. Dynamo Kiev and Lens tied 1-1 so that Panathinaikos is
second on three points having beaten Kiev two weeks ago.
	   Germany's Kaiserslautern remained top of Group F despite
dropping points in a 0-0 tie with HJK Helsinki. Benfica is tied
with PSV Eindhoven with three points after beating the Dutch team
2-1 in Lisbon.

Meciar announces his resignation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Meciar announcing his resignation,
saying he will not seek any other government office &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar
announced Wednesday he would step down when the new Parliament
convenes on Oct. 26.
	   Meciar's pullout came as no great surprise, because leading
politicians in his governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia had
made clear earlier this week they would seek to form a government
without Meciar in charge.
	   Meciar's party gained 27 percent of the vote in parliamentary
elections last Friday and Saturday _ more than any other party, but
it and its coalition partners lost too much to be able to renew
their coalition.
	   The new Slovak government is expected to be formed by the Slovak
Democratic Opposition, a five-party alliance, and other opposition
parties.
	   In an interview with Slovak state television, Meciar said that
he would not seek any government office but left open whether he
would also step down as chairman of the Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia.
	   But he said he would waive his parliamentary seat and will no
longer be part of the new legislature.
	   Despite his announced departure, Meciar remained defiant to the
end. He said that as the strongest party, the Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia would seek a mandate to form a new government.
	   If no coalition with a majority in parliament is achieved, his
party will return that mandate, Meciar explained.
	   Earlier in the day, Slovakia's two largest opposition parties
met for a first bargaining round toward forming a coalition
government without Meciar's party.
	   The talks between the Slovak Democratic Coalition and the
Democratic Left of former Communists came a day after Meciar's
party said it would nominate someone else to try to form a new
government following parliamentary elections last week.
	   Interior Minister Gustav Krajci said Tuesday that Sergej Kozlik,
the vice chairman of Meciar's party, or someone else will be
appointed to put together a new Cabinet, but not Meciar.
	   Krajci also made clear that his party may be forced to go into
opposition.
	   ``Do you see any other solution? We will try to form a
government, but it is not probable that we will be able to form a
majority government,'' he said.
	   On Wednesday, Kozlik, changing somewhat his tune, said:
	   ``We will be preparing ourselves for new elections, in about two
years.
	   ``I do not think that their government will be able to stay firm
and effective for more than two years,'' Kozlik said, suggesting
that in his opinion the new likely coalition government would not
govern for a full four-year term.
	   In last week's ballot, the Slovak Democratic Coalition gained 42
seats in the new parliament.
	   Meciar's party finished ahead of everyone else, but will hold
only 43 seats in the 150-seat parliament. The party's only future
coalition partner, the Slovak National Party, gained 14 seats.
	   Mikulas Dzurinda, who heads the Slovak Democratic Coalition and
has been mentioned as the top opposition candidate for prime
minister, said a new government should be put together as soon as
possible after the new Parliament convenes.
	   Meanwhile, Slovak Foreign Minister Zdenka Kramplova, who took
over only in June, resigned Wednesday. A former translator of
English and Bulgarian, Kramplova will not leave politics
completely.
	   She hopes to be appointed ambassador to Canada before a new
government is installed.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Five thousand antigovernment protesters armed
with clubs and stones broke through a police cordon around Peru's
presidential palace Wednesday and a smaller group forced their way
inside.
	   A group of 60 demonstrators battled through police lines all the
way into the palace in one of Peru's most violent protests in
recent years. Some spray-painted ``Dictator!'' on the stone walls
of the palace courtyard, while others broke furniture in inner
offices.
	   President Alberto Fujimori was in his office at the time but
protesters did not reach him, a palace spokesman said.
	   Police fired shots into the air and lobbed tear gas to disperse
the 5,000 protesters, who represented Peru's main unions and
student groups.
	   Police arrested at least five protesters and one bystander was
injured in his right leg by a firecracker, the radio station
Radioprogramas reported.
	   The General Confederation of Peruvian Workers, Peru's largest
labor federation, called the protest against government policies
that have thrown many out of work.
	   Students and unionists also marched in antigovernment protests
in major cities in the provinces of Cuzco, Trujillo, Arequipa, Ica
and Puno.
	   University students joined the march in the capital, Lima, to
protest the erosion of Peru's democratic institutions. They charged
that Fujimori has trampled Peru's constitution and laws to pave the
way to run in 2000 for a third consecutive term.
	   Congressional President Victor Joy Way urged calm and said the
protest was an attempt to destabilize the state.
	   Polls show that Fujimori's popularity has fallen in recent
months, with only about one in three Peruvians approving of his
performance.

Multivitamins could reduce colon cancer risk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEVIN HOFFMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Women can reduce their risk of colon cancer
by eating lots of fruits and vegetables rich in the B-vitamin
folate, a study found.
	   The study, in Thursday's issue of the Annals of Internal
Medicine, tracked 121,700 United States nurses from 1976 to 1994.
It found that women who had a high intake of folate from food or
from multivitamins for at least 15 years were 75 percent less
likely to get colon cancer.
	   A folate-rich diet was defined as one consisting of at least
four to five servings a day of leafy, green vegetables and fruits.
	   Foods rich in folate include spinach, romaine lettuce and
broccoli. Orange juice is another good source, as are fortified
breakfast cereals.
	   ``We don't want people to think that their diet doesn't matter,
that they don't need to exercise, that they can just take a pill
and prevent cancer,'' said Dr. Edward Giovannucci of Harvard
Medical School. ``But someone taking folate in the long term will
have a 75 percent reduced risk.''
	   While the study focused on women, increased levels of folic acid
could help men too, researchers said.
	   Researchers believe folate, or folic acid, the form present in
multivitamin supplements, is the key because the study found the
same results in women who ate fruits and vegetables and those who
took multivitamins.
	   Most multivitamins contain 400 micrograms of folic acid, the
recommended daily allowance. In contrast, a 6-ounce (180 ml)
serving of orange juice or a cup of romaine lettuce contains 80
micrograms of folate. Folic acid provides about twice as much of
the nutrient as folate does.
	   Dr. Kim Jessup, director of gastrointestinal oncology at the
University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, questioned why it takes
15 years of eating folate for women to redue their risk for cancer.
	   ``This makes you think it might be a relatively weak effect,''
said Jessup, noting studies that have shown aspirin can prevent 50
percent of colon cancers when used for more than one year.
	   Researchers aren't sure exactly why folate seems to shield
against cancer, but they suspect a folate deficiency can cause an
increase in genetic mutations that raise the risk of the disease.
	   The American Cancer Society estimates that 95,600 Americans will
be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 47,700 will die of
the disease.

Former student gets 20 years for role in killing three policemen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French court sentenced a former literature
student Wednesday to 20 years in jail for her part in a bungled
holdup that left three policeman, a taxi driver and her lover dead
after a wild car chase in 1994.
	   The jury deliberated for more than five hours before convicting
Florence Rey, now 23, of being an accomplice in the attempted
robbery and murders that followed.
	   The prosecutor had demanded 30 years, while Rey's lawyer argued
that she was just a ``little girl'' and appealed to the jury to be
lenient.
	   The crime was a sensation in France, and the trial of the young
student turned criminal during a nightime rampage four years ago
has been front-page news ever since it opened two weeks ago.
	   Rey declined to take advantage of her right to address the jury
before it began deliberations and remained mute during the final
arguments.
	   A second person, Abdelhakim Dekhar, 33, who was accused of being
the ``third man'' described by eyewitnesses in the episode was
sentenced to four years in jail for involvement with Rey and Audry
Maupin, her companion who died from gunshot wounds.
	   Rey and Maupin lived together at the time of the shooting. On
Oct. 4, 1994, armed with rifles, the two of them tried to hold up a
car lot in northeastern Paris.
	   They then commandeered a taxi, taking the driver and passenger
hostage. The scared driver deliberately rammed a police car,
prompting a shootout. Two police officers and the taxi driver were
killed and two passersby wounded.
	   Rey and Maupin commandeered a second car. Police chased them and
in a second shootout one police officer were killed and Maupin was
seriously injured. He died the next day.
	   During the trial, Rey admitted firing shots but said she didn't
kill anybody. She described the growing poverty and desperation of
the pair. Audry was also increasingly attracted by radical
left-wing politics.
	   Ballistics experts determined that the fatal shots came from
Maupin's weapons.

Spokesman: Repair awaiting ``check from Washington''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With the United Nations scraping for cash,
a U.N. spokesman had this to say Wednesday when a square piece of
sheetrock fell from the ceiling of the General Assembly building.
	   ``We'll fix it as soon as we get the check from Washington,''
spokesman Fred Eckhard said in joking reference to the at least
dlrs 1.3 billion owed by the United States in U.N. arrears.
	   The piece fell in the southeast corner of the third floor of the
circular assembly building, an area that is part of guided tours,
Eckhard said.
	   ``Someone said if you look up, you can see the sky,'' he said.
	   Only limited tours have been conducted this week, the second
week of the U.N. General Assembly debate.

AeroMexico pilots reach agreement, strike seen averted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Pilots for Aerovias de Mexico SA reached a
preliminary wage agreement with the airline and are close to
calling off a strike threatened to begin Thursday, a union official
said Wednesday.
	   Ariel Alvarez, spokesman of Mexico's airline pilot union, also
known as ASPA, said the union agreed to an 18.3 percent salary rise
plus a 4 percent increase in benefits.
	   ``There are a couple of issues that remain to be solved, such as
seniority payments,'' Alvarez said. ``But because we reached an
agreement on top issues, the threatened strike is very likely to be
called off soon.''
	   Nonwage benefits include higher pensions, sick leave and night
flight payments plus productivity incentives.
	   The union said last week that 746 AeroMexico pilots would strike
if the airline failed to grant their demands.
	   In June, the Mexican government took temporary control of
AeroMexico as 1,033 unionized flight attendants went on strike
demanding a 19 percent wage rise and other benefits. Mexico's
constitution gives the government the right to temporarily seize
companies vital to the country's economy or security.
	   The attendants continued to work under protest to avoid layoffs.
After six days, the attendants also agreed to an 18.3 percent wage
rise and other nonsalary benefits.
	   AeroMexico is a unit of Cintra SA, the holding company for
Mexico's two largest carriers, AeroMexico and Mexicana de Aviacion.

Opposition says time running out for military junta in Myanmar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The foreign minister of Myanmar said
Wednesday that his government was committed to the path it has
chosen, but the country's government in exile warned of a
confrontation unless the military junta agrees to democratic
reforms.
	   ``Political pressure has been put on us by those who would like
to adopt not only democracy but would like also to transplant a
democracy in its own mould,'' foreign minister Ohn Gyaw told world
leaders at the U.N. General Assembly.
	   Denouncing Western pressure, aimed at forcing the ruling
military junta to uphold the results of a 1990 election in which
the National League for Democracy won 82 percent of the seats in
Parliament, Gyaw said his government did not believe in that kind
of democracy.
	   ``We in Myanmar strongly believe that the path we have chosen is
the right one and is most suitable to our tradition,'' Gyaw said.
``We shall resolutely continue our endeavors to build a modern,
democratic, peaceful and prosperous nation in Myanmar,'' he said.
	   But just as he was speaking, the prime minister of the
provisional government, Sein Win, warned that time for the military
junta was running out.
	   ``We will not wait. We will do what has to be done and convene
the Parliament in Burma,'' Sein Win said. ``If the military
continues to say that it will not allow the Parliament to convene,
then I think there will be a confrontation very soon,'' he told
reporters.
	   ``There may be an uprising that we may not be able to control,''
he said.
	   The military government accuses the opposition NLD of being in
cahoots with Western powers to destabilize Myanmar, also known as
Burma. Western nations have been critical of the junta for its poor
human rights record and failure to move toward democracy.
	   In recent months, the government has been in a sustained
confrontation with the opposition and its leader, Aung Sang Suu
Kyi. It began mass arrests in May and intensified them in September
in an effort to block the NLD from carrying out a threat to convene
parliament on its own. The NLD won a landslide victory in 1990
elections, but the military never allowed parliament to meet.
	   Since the NLD declared it had convened parliament, official
newspapers have carried commentaries, cartoons and poems every day
mocking its plans and suggesting that the party should be
deregistered and opposition leader Aung Sang Suu Kyi deported for
disrupting stability.
	   Sein Win called on the Security Council to impose an arms
embargo on the military regime, and said all countries should cease
to invest or do business with it.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ They were sitting on the terrace of a Mafia
chieftain's villa outside Palermo when the Godfather asked Leonid
Kolosov if he was really just a newspaper reporter in search of a
story.
	   ``I looked him straight in the eye, as we were taught in KGB
school, and lied,'' Kolosov recalls. He was really just a simple
reporter, he told the mobster. Even if he wanted to, he didn't have
time to be a spy.
	   Then he went ahead and recruited the mob chief, Nicola Gentile,
as a valuable informer for the Soviet spy agency.
	   Kolosov was a KGB agent in Rome, Paris and Madrid, and his are
among the revealing _ not to mention entertaining _ stories
collected in a new book, ``Undercover Lives: Soviet Spies in the
Cities of the World.''
	   The book, being published in Britain this month and Germany
early next year, is loosely based on a Russian-language book, the
``KGB Guidebook to Cities of the World,'' published two years ago.

Meciar announces his resignation in Slovakia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Meciar appearance on talk show, singing
tearfully; trims, adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar,
Slovakia's authoritarian ruler for virtually its entire six years
of independence, announced Wednesday he would step down when the
new Parliament convenes Oct. 26.
	   In an emotional appearance on state television, he also said he
would not serve in the new legislature, and sang an impromptu
farewell song to Slovaks with tears in his eyes: ``God be with you,
I did not hurt any of you.''
	   His ouster as premier was forced by last week's national
elections, in which the governing Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia was outpolled by opposition parties. But the opposition
and some analysts had expected that the 56-year-old Meciar, who has
been widely criticized for anti-democratic practices, might fight
to cling to power.
	   Leading politicians in the governing Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia had already made clear earlier this week they would seek
to form a government without Meciar in charge.
	   Meciar's party gained 27 percent of the vote in parliamentary
elections last Friday and Saturday _ more than any other party _
but it and its coalition partners lost too much to be able to renew
their coalition.
	   The new Slovak government is expected to be formed by the Slovak
Democratic Opposition, a five-party coalition, and other opposition
parties who took a combined majority of the vote.
	   In his first public comments since the elections, Meciar said on
a talk show on state TV that he would not seek any government
office. But he left open whether he would also step down as
chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.
	   Meciar said he was disappointed with how Slovaks voted. ``There
will be hard times and devaluation, but you have chosen this,'' he
said.
	   Despite his announced departure, Meciar remained defiant to the
end. He said that as the strongest party, the Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia would seek a mandate to form a new government.
	   Other officials of the ruling party, however, acknowledged that
they are effectively reduced to hoping for early elections in two
years because they don't think the opposition alliance will be able
to govern effectively.
	   Meciar's party will hold only 43 seats in the 150-seat
Parliament. The opposition parties won 93 seats combined.
	   Meanwhile, Slovak Foreign Minister Zdenka Kramplova, who took
over only in June, resigned Wednesday. A former translator of
English and Bulgarian, Kramplova will not leave politics
completely.
	   She hopes to be appointed ambassador to Canada before a new
government is installed.

Iraq says it was obliged to cut cooperation with inspectors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister compared the
effects of 8-year-old U.N. sanctions against his country to
genocide Wednesday and called for a denunciation of countries who
insist on retaining the sanctions.
	   Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf didn't specifically name the United
States in his speech to the General Assembly. But he harshly
criticized the U.N. Special Commission, which carries out weapons
inspections in Iraq, and its chairman as working only on behalf of
one ``arrogant, powerful state,'' to keep the sanctions in place _
a clear reference to Washington.
	   That undue influence, al-Sahaf said, forced Iraq to stop
cooperating with inspectors last month ``because insisting on this
dead-end path ... can only lead to the continuation of the blockade
against the people of Iraq, which is unacceptable,'' he said.
	   He condemned countries who ``who insist, for ulterior political
motives, on continuing to inflict on the people of Iraq this
destructive blockade, a blockade parallel in its tragic
consequences to the internationally proscribed acts of genocide,''
he said.
	   Inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, must
certify Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles and chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons programs before the Security Council
will lift sanctions that were imposed after Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   The sanctions prevent Iraq from selling its most valuable
commodity _ oil _ on the open market.
	   Al-Sahaf said Iraq has cooperated fully with U.N. resolutions
demanding it destroy its weapons of mass destruction. ``However,
the blockade has not so far been lifted, thus rendering the
continuation of cooperation both meaningless and useless,'' he
said.
	   Al-Sahaf welcomed efforts by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
seek an end to the impasse by conducting a ``comprehensive review''
of Iraq's progress over the last seven years to disarm itself.
	   Such a review could force the council to recognize the steps
Iraq has taken to dismantle its proscribed weapons programs and
could increase pressure for some easing of sanctions.
	   Al-Sahaf called for Annan to personally supervise the review and
ensure that it is bound by a clearly defined timetable and not ``to
be an aimless process with no end in sight.''
	   ``While we support carrying out such a comprehensive review in
an objective, fair and impartial manner, we reaffirm Iraq's right
to expect the Security Council to proceed to take action to lift
the inhumane sanctions imposed on the people of Iraq for eight
years in a row,'' al-Sahaf concluded.
	   ``The people and leadership of Iraq will accept no less than
that.''
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is in New York this week,
meeting with members of the council and Annan to try to work out
details of the comprehensive review.
	   Aziz and Annan were dining together Wednesday at the Iraqi
ambassador's residence, a tony townhouse on Manhattan's upper east
side. Earlier in the day, Aziz met with British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako
Ogata, on Wednesday urged Serb authorities to halt ``excessive use
of force'' against civilians in Kosovo province.
	   On Sunday, the human rights group Human Rights Watch reported 18
ethnic Albanians were slaughtered in the forest near Obrija village
in the Drenica region northwest of Pristina.
	   Most were killed in a makeshift camp in the woods where they had
hidden after Serb troops overran their towns and villages.
	   Serbs began cracking down on Albanian separatists in the
southern province in February. Since then, hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 275,000 have been driven from their
homes.
	   Ogata, who has just returned from a five-day tour of the region,
said UNHCR believed excessive use of force against civilians by
Serb police, such as shelling, looting and burning of homes, was
designed to force people to leave villages.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is also guilty of using excessive
force, Ogata told a news conference in Geneva. But the largest
offensive so far had been carried out by the Serbs and she had
protested this to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. ``These
are real, genuine causes of fear,'' said Ogata. ``These are daily
widespread terroristic offenses that are taking place.''
	   A Serbian police spokesman denied that the police had committed
Sunday's massacre. ``We rule out any possibility that our members
did something like that,'' Col. Bozidar Filic said, confirming only
that ``in that area we had clashes with terrorists and a number of
them has been arrested.''
	   Ogata urged a cessation of hostilities followed by a just
political settlement and a long period of confidence rebuilding.
	   Ogata said UNHCR was very concerned about reports of mass graves
near villages from which people she met during her trip had fled.
	   Jose Diaz, Geneva-based spokesman for U.N. human rights
commissioner Mary Robinson, said her office was still trying to
confirm the reports of the Drenica massacre and mass graves.
	   The U.N. human rights office has three mobile staff operating in
Kosovo, but still hasn't received the go-ahead from the Yugoslav
authorities to establish a permanent office.
	   ``This (the reported massacres) just highlights the need for an
independent investigation,'' Diaz said.

Polish WWII forced-labor survivors want to be indemnified
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Thousands of Poles who were brought to
Austria as forced laborers during World War II urged the Austrian
government Wednesday to set up a reparations fund to benefit
survivors.
	   Between 1939 and 1945, some 150,000 Poles were taken to what was
Nazi-ruled Austria and forced to work in state-run factories,
businesses and on privately own farms, according to Karol
Gawlowski, head of the Association of Poles Who Suffered Under the
Third Reich.
	   In all, up to 800,000 foreigners were forced to work in Austria
during the war to replace men fighting in the German Wehrmacht for
the Nazis, many of them inmates of the dreaded Mauthausen
concentration camp and its subsidiaries.
	   The Austrian government, as well as private companies and
associations representing other industries who used the Poles'
services between 1938-45, should set up a reparations fund,
Gawlowski said. Survivors would receive up to 35,000 schillings
(dlrs 3,000) each.
	   Only about 20,000 of the workers are still alive and many of
them are poor and in failing health.
	   ``We're running out of time,'' said Gawlowski, who also was
brought to Austria as a force laborer.
	   Heinrich Neisser, a senior lawmaker in the Austrian Parliament,
told the Austria Press Agency Wednesday he supported the idea of
reparations.
	   The Austrian government on Tuesday nominated a Supreme Court
judge to head an independent commission of historians to examine
the question of forced labor in Austria under the Nazi regime.
	   Representatives of Austrian Farmers' and Industry Workers'
Associations also said they would consider contributing to a
reparations fund.
	   Forced labor was considered a war crime at the Nuremberg Trials,
but Austria, which for years considered itself the first victim of
Nazi aggression, has been slow in coming to terms with its wartime
past.

Mexico's says NAFTA trucking solution six months off,0135
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP)_ A dispute with the United States over access
of Mexican trucks will take at least six months to settle, Mexico's
commerce secretary said Wednesday.
	   Mexico last week sought the formation, under the North American
Free Trade Agreement, of an arbitration panel to review the matter.
	   Under NAFTA, Mexican trucks were supposed to be able to travel
in U.S. border states as of Dec. 18, 1995, but the United States
has denied access, arguing that they don't meet U.S. safety
standards.
	   Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco said both countries were in
the process of selecting five panelists but reiterated that Mexico
would drop the settlement procedure if the U.S. agreed to remove
the transport restrictions beforehand.

Corretja struggles to beat underdog Slovak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) - Alex Corretja of
Spain needed three sets Wednesday to defeat Dominik Hrbaty, ranked
40th in the world, in the first round of the Mallorca Open
clay-court tournament.
	   Corretja, seeded second in the tournament and ranked seventh in
the world, beat the Slovak 5-7, 6-3, 6-3.
	   The Spaniard dropped the first set because of problems with his
baseline play. In the third set Hrbaty saved four break points but
Corretja kept up the pressure and pulled out the match.
	   On Thursday Corretja faces fellow Spaniard Sergi Brugera while
top seeded Carlos Moya of Spain, who beat Ion Moldovan of Romania
on Tuesday, takes on Slava Dosedel of the Czech Republic.
	   In other matches Wednesday, Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten, winner of
the French Open in 1997, beat Belgium's Johan Van Herck when the
latter withdrew at 0-1 in the second set because of pain in his
right wrist. Kuerten had won the first set 7-6.
	   In the upset of the day, little-known Spaniard Tomas Carbonell
beat world 24th-ranked Swede Magnus Gustafsson 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
Gustafsson had been due to play Brazil's Fernando Meligeni but the
latter pulled out because of pain in his left knee.
	   An equally obscure Spaniard, 164th-ranked Oscar Serrano,
defeated Argentine Franco Squillari, ranked 53rd, 6-3, 6-1.
	   Jose Antonio Marin of Costa Rica beat Romanian Andrei Pavel by a
score of 6-2, 3-6, 6-4.

Chile proposes 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chile's government on Wednesday submitted
its 1999 budget proposal that raises social service spending _ an
increase expected to meet congressional resistance.
	   In announcing a balanced budget of 8,817 trillion pesos (dlrs
18.8) billion, Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said spending on
social services will increase 6 percent. Social services includes
public health, education, and housing, which combined account for
more than 40 percent of the budget.
	   The right-wing opposition, which controls the Senate, has firmly
opposed to any increase in fiscal spending.
	   The government flatly rejected freezing its spending but,
admitting the impact on Chile of the Asian financial crisis, curbed
the increase to 2.8 percent.
	   A Finance Ministry communique said Chile's economy is expected
to grow by 3.8 percent in 1999, down from 5.3 percent this year.
But it said the budget was prepared assuming the international
economic crisis would lower the figure to 3 percent.

Olympiakos beats Croatia in Champions League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Serbian striker Sinisa Gogic scored one
goal and setup another as Olympiakos Piraeus beat Croatia Zagreb
2-0 Wednesday in a Group A game for the Champions League.
	   The win sent Olympiakos at the top of the group, sharing the
position with Ajax Amsterdam with four points each after two games.
	   Playing aggressive from the start, midfield pressing and
constant attacks, Olympiakos caused immense problems to the
Croatian defense.
	   The hosts came close to open the scoring in the 16th minute when
a powerful shot by Vassilis Karapialis outside the area went wide,
scraping past the left bar of goalie Drazen Ladic.
	   Five minutes later, 70,000 fans cheered wildly as Alecos
Alexandris put Olympiakos ahead off a pass from Gogic.
	   The visitors, who played without their star Robert Prosinecki,
lost a good scoring chance in the 35th when goalie Dimitris
Eleftheropoulos made a decisive save to a free kick from Josko
Jelicic.
	   Dario Simic made a line save to a shot from Olympiakos'
midfielder Stelios Giannacopoulos in the 62nd.
	   Eleftheropoulos averted the equalizer in the 67th with a
spectacular save to a shot from Silvio Maric.
	   Nine minutes before the end of the game, Gogic gained the ball
in the Croatian area, dribbled past Goran Juric to make the final
2-0.

Rosenborg ties Juventus 1-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRONDHEIM, Norway (AP) _ Even with two penalties, Rosenborg
failed to take home the victory against Juventus in the second
round of the European Champions League Wednesday. Rosenborg had to
settle with a 1-1 draw.
	   Juventus took charge of the game in the 27th minute when Edgar
Deschamps took advantage of a rebound from Rosenborg's Roar Strand
in the box, and Filippo Inzaghi redirected the shot from Deschamps
and made it 1-0.
	   In the first minutes of the second half Juventus seemed to
control the game with dangerous shots from Allessandro del Piero.
	   However, Rosenborg came back with substitutes Tore Andre Dahlum
and Borge Hernes, who sped up the Rosenborg attacking game.
	   Dahlum made a cross ball to Strand in the 68th, but Strand was
taken down in the box, and Rosenborg captain Bent Skammelsrud made
no errors when he executed the penalty making it 1-1.
	   In the 79th Jahn Ivar ``Mini'' Jakobsen was brought down inside,
but this time Skammelsrud failed to convert the penalty in front of
15,385 fans.
	   Rosenborg's Runar Berg was booked in the 74th and misses next
game against Galatasaray.

Ajax downs Porto 2-1 in Champions League Group A
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Jari Litmanen became Ajax's top
European marksman of all time Wednesday, scoring an 86th minute
penalty to give the Amsterdam club a 2-1 Champions League victory
over Porto.
	   The Finnish international's 24th strike in European competitions
overtook Johan Cruyff's tally of 23.
	   Polish midfielder Andrzej Rudy had earlier given the Amsterdam
powerhouse a 1-0 lead before Zlatko Zahovic equalized for Porto.
	   Rudy's powerful 57th-minute strike, from 25 meters (yards)
squirmed through the hands of Porto goalkeeper Rui Correia in front
of 40,000 fans at the Amsterdam Arena.
	   But just 12 minutes later Slovenian Zahovic sneaked behind the
Ajax defense and stretched out a left foot to poke the ball under
Edwin van der Sar for the equalizer.
	   Litmanen grabbed all three points for Ajax from the penalty spot
after a foul by Jorge Costa on substitute Gerald Sibon, who fell
heavily under a light challenge.
	   ``It is a relief,'' said Litmanen. ``We haven't been playing
well in recent weeks ... but it is going better now.''
	   Porto had the best chance before the break, when Ljubimko
Drulovic broke free down the left flank in the 12th minute and
centered to an unmarked Mario Jardel, but the Brazilian's powerful
downward header bounced off the turf and glanced the cross bar on
its way to safety.
	   Ajax finally strung together its first neat move in the 20th
minute and immediately threatened the Porto goal.
	   Litmanen, slipped the ball to Ronald de Boer, who passed to
Tijjani Babangida on the right wing. The Nigerian sent a measured
cross directly into the path of Peter Hoekstra, but Hoekstra's
strong header sailed just over the bar.

Spartak Moscow defeats Real Madrid 2-1

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Spartak Moscow defeated defending champions Real
Madrid 2-1 in pouring rain in a Champions League Group C second
rotation game Wednesday.
	   Real Madrid took the lead in the 63th minute when Clarence
Seedorf fired from eleven meters (yards) into the Russian post, the
ball bounced out and Raul headed it in.
	   Spartak midfielder Ilya Tsymbalar evened the score 12 minutes
later with a penalty kick that sent the ball over the defending
wall in the upper right corner of the Spanish net. Bodo Illgner,
Real's goalkeeper, who made several decisive saves at the beginning
of the second half, could not help.
	   In the 82nd minute, Russian striker Andrei Tikhonov made a
perfect pass from the left into the goal box and Luis Robson, the
Brazilian international player, headed it back to Egor Titov, who
fired in the winner.
	   Real coach Guus Hiddink sent in striker Fernando Morientes as a
substitute, but Spartak controlled the ball for the rest of the
game, giving the seven-time defending champions little opportunity
to tie.
	   The victory gives Spartak the lead with six points in the Group
C of the Champions League.
	   The 86,000-seat Luzhniki Stadium was almost full. It was a
record crowd for this season.

Braves rout Cubs 7-1 in opener
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ John Smoltz became the winningest pitcher in
postseason history, allowing only five hits in 7 2-3 innings as the
Atlanta Braves cruised to a 7-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs in
Game 1 of the National League division series Wednesday.
	   Tucker, who had just two home runs in the past three months and
was dropped to eighth in the batting order, got the offense going
with a two-run homer in the second inning.
	   Ryan Klesko turned the game into a rout with a seventh-inning
grand slam against Matt Karchner, but the runs really weren't
needed with Smoltz on the mound. He pushed his record to 11-3 in 21
postseason starts, breaking the record for wins shared with Whitey
Ford and Dave Stewart.
	   Smoltz was picked for Game 1 based on his playoff success and a
12-1 record in the second half of the season. The Braves' pitching
is so deep they have 20-game winner Tom Glavine and four-time Cy
Young winner Greg Maddux ready to go in the next two games.
	   Smoltz was 17-3 and had the best winning percentage in the
majors during the regular season _ a remarkable performance
considering he had elbow surgery in December and went on the
disabled list twice early in the season.
	   The Cubs, weary from a three-team wild-card race and forced to
win a one-game playoff against San Francisco on Monday, were in a
full-scale letdown mode, going down meekly in their first playoff
game since 1989.
	   Through the first seven innings, Smoltz allowed only one runner
past first _ Sammy Sosa on a seventh-inning double. Tyler Houston
led off the eighth with a homer to end the shutout, and Smoltz left
to a thunderous ovation after getting the next two outs.
	   Sosa, cheered each time he came to the plate, couldn't add to
the 66 homers he hit during the regular season. He went 2-for-4
with a double.
	   During the regular season, the Cubs had more success against the
Braves than any NL team, winning six of nine games. But the
postseason is more familiar territory for Atlanta, which has
captured an unprecedented seven straight division titles.
	   Mark Clark (9-14), a stopgap starter for the Cubs, pitched
respectably in his first playoff appearance, pitching into the
seventh and allowing two earned runs on seven hits.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Five thousand antigovernment protesters armed
with clubs and stones broke through a police cordon around Peru's
presidential palace Wednesday, and enabling some to force their way
inside and vandalize parts of the complex.
	   A group of 60 demonstrators battled their way through police
lines all the way into the palace in Peru's most violent protest in
recent years. Some spray-painted ``Dictator!'' and ``Down with
Fujimori!'' on the stone walls of the palace's courtyard, while
others broke furniture in inner offices.
	   President Alberto Fujimori was in his office at the time but
protesters did not reach him, a palace spokesman said.
	   Soldiers fired shots into the air and police lobbed tear gas to
disperse the 5,000 protesters, who represented Peru's main unions
and student groups.
	   Police arrested at least 20 protesters and one bystander was
injured in his right leg by a large firecracker, radio station
Radioprogramas reported.
	   The General Confederation of Peruvian Workers, Peru's largest
labor federation, called the protest government labor and economic
policies.
	   The unions are demanding that the government stop privatizing
state companies, raise public employees' salaries, create jobs and
reverse laws that make it easier to fire workers and more difficult
to unionize.
	   Fewer than half of Peruvian workers have stable, full-time jobs.
Most work at low-paying, temporary jobs with no benefits. Polls
show that unemployment and low wages are the main concern of
Peruvians.
	   Congressional President Victor Joy Way said the government would
not give in to union demands for the government to change its
free-market economic course.
	   ``I have no doubt that this was a coordinated action to
destabilize the country,'' said Joy Way, a member of Fujimori's
governing coalition.
	   Students and unionists also marched in antigovernment protests
in major cities in the major cities of Cuzco, Trujillo, Arequipa,
Ica and Puno.
	   University students joined the march in the capital, Lima, to
protest the erosion of Peru's democratic institutions. They charged
that Fujimori has trampled Peru's constitution and laws to pave the
way to run in 2000 for a third consecutive term.
	   Last year, the Fujimori-controlled Congress removed three judges
from its top constitutional court who had voted against a law
letting the president run again, sparking the largest student
protests in his eight years in power.
	   Congress on Aug. 27 rejected a proposal for a referendum on
Fujimori's re-election, leading to renewed charges of
authoritarianism.
	   Supporters of the measure had collected more than 1.4 million
signatures backing the referendum.
	   ``This day will be a landmark in efforts by Peru's democratic
forces to unify and construct a new government. This one is
authoritarian,'' said Angel Delgado, a coordinator of the signature
drive.
	   Fujimori was elected as a political unknown in 1990 and
re-elected in a 1995 landslide by Peruvians grateful for his
success in fighting leftist guerrillas and ending hyperinflation.
	   But his popularity has fallen in recent years because of
continued poverty and unemployment, and the perception he is
authoritarian. Polls show that only one in three Peruvians approves
of his performance as president.

Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, JP Morgan agree to set up investment-trust
</HEADLINE>
firm: Report

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and J.P. Morgan
and Co. of the United States have reached a basic agreement to
jointly set up an investment-trust company here by the year's end,
Japanese newspapers reported Thursday.
	   The deal marks the first capital tie-up between a large Japanese
commercial bank and a foreign financial institution, the Nihon
Keizai business daily said in a front-page story.
	   The official announcement is expected later Thursday, newspaper
reports said.
	   Under the agreement, the 50-50 venture between the DKB and J.P.
Morgan groups will have an initial capitalization of 3-5 billion
yen (dlrs 22-37 million), they said.
	   The entity will create and manage investment trusts _ Japan's
version of mutual funds. The funds will be sold to Japanese
consumers by DKB and other financial companies, the reports said.
	   DKB and J.P. Morgan may eventually expand the scope of their
alliance to include investment banking _ the lucrative business of
underwriting new stocks and bonds for companies, the newspapers
said.
	   In the past, foreign financial companies have had difficulty
setting up operations in Japan and buying out domestic rivals. But
the Japanese government has begun to remove regulations that have
sheltered domestic banks, brokers and insurers from competition in
sweeping deregulation dubbed the ``Big Bang.''
	   Japanese institutions are now rushing to form alliances with
each other and with foreign financial giants as part of their
efforts to stay competitive.

Mexican government criticized for its policy on Cuban refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A group of Mexican writers and journalists on
Wednesday criticized immigration authorities over what they called
``arbitrary deportation'' of a group of Cuban refugees who landed
in Mexico while trying to reach the United States.
	   Alejandro Carrillo Castro, head of Mexico's immigration
institute, denied the allegations and said the Cubans had declined
to apply for asylum in Mexico.
	   The group of ten Cubans _ men, women and children _ were picked
up at sea by a passing ship when their raft ran into trouble in
July while trying to reach Miami. The ship then took them to the
Mexican port of Veracruz.
	   In a letter sent to newspapers, some of Mexico's best-known
authors said the deportation of the Cubans represented ``an
unacceptable abandonment of Mexico's humanitarian policy.''
	   Among those who signed were columnists Carlos Monsivais and
Jorge G. Castaneda, and novelists Carlos Fuentes and Laura
Esquivel.
	   Carrillo said the Cubans did not request asylum because they
were set on joining their relatives in Miami. ``They claimed that
their intent was reaching the United States, and that this was
their only purpose in leaving Cuba,'' he added.
	   He denied that the process was carried out in ``total secrecy,''
as the authors claimed, but acknowledged that only provincial
newspapers were informed about it.
	   Carrillo said there was no reason for the institute to issue a
press release in Mexico City, where most international media are
based.
	   In response to Carrillo's statements, novelist Homero Aridjis
insisted the Cubans should not have been sent back home. ``Some of
these Cubans could be subject to punishment,'' he said.
	   Carrillo denied Mexico had a policy of automatically sending
Cuban refugees back home.
	   However, other Cuban refugees have been denied asylum by
immigration authorities who claimed that discontent over economic
and social conditions in Cuba would not make them eligible for
asylum.
	   The United States and most other countries near Cuba have
agreements with the communist government to return Cubans who do
not face persecution at home.
	   The agreements are designed to discourage Cubans from setting
out on life-threatening sea journeys and to prevent uncontrolled
waves of immigrants of the sort that flooded into the United States
in 1980 and 1994.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton came to South
America to give a boost to women and got a boost herself from her
fellow first ladies of the Americas.
	   ``I'm new at this job and you're a role model for me,'' one said
in a note she slipped to Mrs. Clinton after the U.S. first lady
spoke of the need for more women in leadership roles, said her
chief of staff, Melanne Verveer.
	   One after another, they embraced her and shared private
comments. In public, no one even hinted of President Bill Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
	   Mrs. Clinton, attending an annual conference of first ladies of
the Americas, stuck to her designated topic.
	   ``Empowerment of women is as critical for a vibrant democracy as
are issues like trade, diplomacy and national security,'' she said.
	   While complaining that ``women still do not hold enough
positions of authority, responsibility and power,'' she noted with
approval that ``today a growing number of countries require a
minimum level of women's participation in local and national
elections.''
	   Many countries, she said, have surpassed the United States in
increasing the percentage of elected representatives and other
leaders who are women.
	   The crowd of several hundred seemed to appreciate Mrs. Clinton's
willingness to follow through on her commitment to speak here, the
fourth first ladies meeting she has attended.
	   ``For her, it's a very difficult situation, but she is facing
these facts with great dignity, I think,'' said Maria Elena Ovalle,
an economist and member of Chile's central bank.
	   Mrs. Clinton, on a four-day trip that will also take her to
Uruguay, flew here after touring damage in Puerto Rico caused by
Hurricane Georges.
	   Her day began with a visit to an art museum, where she and the
other first ladies viewed an exhibit of art created by Chilean
children under the guidance of professional artists from each of
the countries represented at the conference.
	   ``What a wonderful idea!'' Mrs. Clinton enthused, her arm around
Chilean first lady Marta Larraeches de Frei, who had suggested the
exhibit. The first ladies tousled the hair of some of the young
artists and chatted with them before strolling around the garden,
greeting the professional artists along the way.
	   The U.S. artist, 50-year-old Jesse Trevino of San Antonio, who
was chosen by a presidential commission, got an effusive welcome
from Mrs. Clinton.
	   ``She gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek,'' he said later,
laughing. ``She's like my hero.''
	   Trevino said he began drawing when he was 4 and stuck with it
even after losing his right hand in the Vietnam War. ``I spent two
years in the hospital,'' said Trevino. ``I couldn't walk. And I had
to learn to do everything with my left hand.''
	   Mrs. Clinton also spoke at a ceremony for a signing of two
international agreements.
	   One is a U.S.-Chilean scholarship program to bring up to 30
students from Latin America and the Caribbean to training programs
in Chilean institutions. The United States will provide dlrs
250,000, while Chile will contribute dlrs 125,000.
	   The other is a dlrs 5 million U.S.-financed program to bring
American city and county managers together with their counterparts
eleswhere in the Americas.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar,
Slovakia's authoritarian ruler for virtually all of its six years
of independence, announced Wednesday he would step down when the
new Parliament convenes Oct. 26.
	   In an emotional appearance on state television, he also said he
would not serve in the new legislature, and sang an impromptu
farewell song to Slovaks with tears in his eyes: ``God be with you,
I did not hurt any of you.''
	   His ouster as premier was forced by last week's national
elections, in which the governing Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia lost ground to opposition parties. The opposition and some
analysts had expected that the 56-year-old Meciar, who has been
widely criticized for anti-democratic practices, might fight to
cling to power.
	   Slovak Foreign Minister Zdenka Kramplova also resigned
Wednesday.
	   Meciar's party gained 27 percent of the vote in parliamentary
elections last Friday and Saturday _ more than any other party _
but it and its coalition partners lost too much ground to be able
to renew their coalition.
	   Two leading opposition parties, the Slovak Democratic Opposition
and the Democratic Left met Wednesday for a first bargaining round
toward forming a new government without Meciar's party.
	   Even the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia made clear earlier
this week that Meciar was not in its plans, even if it can somehow
overcome the election setback and stay in power.
	   ``We will try to form a government, but it is not probable that
we will be able to form a majority government,'' Interior Minister
Gustav Krajci said Tuesday.
	   In his first public comments since the elections, Meciar said on
a talk show on state TV that he would not seek any government
office. But he left open whether he would also step down as
chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.
	   Meciar said he was disappointed with how Slovaks voted. ``There
will be hard times and devaluation, but you have chosen this,'' he
said.
	   Meciar's party will hold only 43 seats in the 150-seat
Parliament. The opposition parties won 93 seats combined.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Investors pounded stock prices broadly lower
Wednesday after deciding that a one-quarter-point interest-rate cut
by the Federal Reserve would not be enough to rescue fourth-quarter
corporate earnings. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average dropped 237.90 points _ or by 3 percent _ at 7,842.62.
(US-TRADING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A key gauge of future economic activity held
steady in August in a sign the U.S. economy remains healthy and
should continue expanding through early next year. The Conference
Board, a private research group, reported Wednesday that its Index
of Leading Economic Indicators was unchanged last month. It had
rebounded 0.5 percent in July after two months of declines. The
index, which stood at 105.5, was in line with economists'
expectations. Michael Boldin, a Conference Board economist, said
the index held steady in August despite a sharp decline in one of
its components _ stock prices. ``The overall economy remains
healthy,'' he said in a statement. (US-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new government is about to consider a
Soviet-style economic plan that would set back the clock with
nationalized banks and a flood of newly minted money, a newspaper
said Wednesday. The head of the Central Bank strongly denied that
the government was going to take over banks. The government did not
specifically deny the rest of the reported plan, which was said to
have been drafted by a group of Soviet-era economists. According to
the Kommersant business newspaper, it would boost the money supply
by 60 percent, undoubtedly fueling inflation. It also would
reintroduce currency controls, Kommersant said. The newspaper said
the plan would be considered by the Cabinet on Thursday.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The financial firestorm that began in Asia and
spread to Russia will slow world economic growth more than
previously believed, with some of the hardest-hit countries now
facing the prospect of deep recessions, the International Monetary
Fund said Wednesday. The IMF slashed its estimate of total world
growth by more than 1 percentage point for both this year and 1999,
compared to a forecast made just five months ago. The new forecast:
2 percent this year, 2.5 percent next. It blamed the lower
expectations on deepening recessions in East Asia and Japan and the
spreading of the crisis to Russia. ``International economic and
financial conditions have deteriorated considerably in recent
months,'' the IMF said. (US-GLOBAL OUTLOOK)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund has reduced
its forecast for economic growth in Latin America in 1998 and 1999,
saying the Russian financial crisis caused financial markets to
change their mind about the region's prospects. In its World
Economic Outlook Report released Wednesday, the IMF said its 1998
economic growth projections for Latin America were revised
downwards to 2.8 percent from the previous estimate of 3.4 percent
in May of this year. The IMF also cut its 1999 growth estimate in
Latin America to 2.7 per cent from 4.3 percent. (GLOBAL
OUTLOOK-LATIN AMERICA)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Economic recovery is gaining strength in major
European Union countries but Britain faces a slowdown and may have
to ease interest rates, the International Monetary Fund said
Wednesday. In its otherwise gloomy World Economic Outlook, the IMF
said that domestic demand in EU countries is beginning to replace
exports as the principal engine of economic growth. ``The
strengthening of domestic demand in the prospective euro (currency)
area is particularly welcome at a time when two large trading
partners, the United States and the United Kingdom, are likely to
experience cyclical slowdowns,'' the IMF report said. (GLOBAL
OUTLOOK-EUROPE)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union and 71 African,
Caribbean and Pacific countries on Wednesday launched delicate
negotiations to revise the Lome Convention, their 23-year old
trade-and-aid agreement. The negotiations are expected to take
about a year. The current five-year agreement expires in 2000. The
EU wants to gradually replace the current system of trade
preferences with free trade accords with the more
economically-advanced regions or individual countries among the ACP
group. Pressure for change is partly generated by the World Trade
Organization which has castigated the 15-nation EU for the current
accord, which it says violates fair competition rules by giving
Europe's former colonies special preferences. (EU-DEVELOPING

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An assailant on Wednesday lobbed two
hand grenades at Israeli security forces in downtown Hebron,
injuring 11 troops and 11 Palestinian bystanders. Soldiers fired on
the fleeing attacker, apparently a Palestinian, who was shot in the
leg before reaching the Palestinian-controlled part of the divided
city, the army said. The army poured reinforcements into Hebron, a
troubled town of 130,000 Palestinian and 450 Jewish settlers, and
imposed a curfew on 30,000 Palestinians living in the
Israeli-controlled sector. Wednesday's violence erupted during Yom
Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, as Israeli troops
enforced a blanket closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Palestinian security officials also confirmed Wednesday that they
have raided a Hamas bomb factory in Hebron. About half a ton of
explosives and materials used for making bombs were seized in the
raid earlier this week, the officials said. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Backed by the United States, Britain on
Wednesday called an emergency meeting of the Security Council to
denounce the latest massacre of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
Meanwhile, NATO proceeded with final preparations for airstrikes
against Serb forces. ``This was not an act of war, it was plain
cold murder,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said at the
Labor Party's annual conference in Blackpool, England. Informal
consultations on Kosovo were scheduled for Thursday afternoon. Cook
warned that military action could follow the release of Annan's
report on whether Serbia has complied with last week's Security
Council resolution calling for a cease-fire in Kosovo, a withdrawal
of Serbian troops, and the start of ``serious dialogue on real
autonomy'' for the province. Serb police, who are fighting ethnic
Albanian rebels seeking independence for the province, denied
responsibility Wednesday for massacre. (UN-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. officials will raise the issue of North
Korea's development of long-range missiles on Thursday when the two
countries hold missile talks, the State Department said Wednesday.
Spokesman James Foley said the North Korean missile test a month
ago through Japanese air space ``is a matter of great concern to
the U.S. because of its destabilizing impact in the region.'' The
two sides previously held missile talks in April 1996 and June
1997. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Einhorn will head the
U.S. delegation to the New York talks, which are expected to last
two days. The North Korean lead representative will be Han Chang
On, a U.S. expert in the North Korean foreign ministry. Einhorn
also will raise the issue of North Korean production and export of
Scud missiles and the export of missile technology and equipment to
several countries, including Iran, Syria and Pakistan. Meanwhile,
President Bill Clinton has authorized dlrs 15 million to purchase
heavy fuel for delivery to North Korea under a 1994 agreement to
wean the country away from plutonium-producing nuclear reactors.
(US-NORTH KOREA)
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Britain's top official in Northern
Ireland urged the Irish Republican Army to start surrendering
weapons quickly, but gave no deadline over the issue that some fear
could unhinge the peace process. ``There are difficulties ahead,
high hurdles still to climb over,'' Northern Ireland Secretary Mo
Mowlam said Wednesday. ``But we have come so far that I am
confident there is no going back.'' However, Gerry Adams, leader of
the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, and David Trimble, head of Northern
Ireland's largest Protestant party and leader of the province's new
power-sharing Assembly, each came to a Labor Party gathering
showing few signs of compromise. Prime Minister Tony Blair held
several meetings Wednesday in a renewed effort to break the
impasse. Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionist Party, insists that
the IRA must start decomissioning to show the sincerity of its
14-month-old cease-fire before Sinn Fein can get any posts in the
assembly. (BRITAIN-POLITICS-IRELAND)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Sri Lanka's military claimed a major
battlefield prize, but reports of the staggering costs of the
victory _ at least 1,300 Sri Lankan soldiers and Tamil rebels dead
in the worst fighting in a year _ underlined how difficult it will
be for either side to win the 15-year war. Wednesday's victory in
the town of Mankulam and the deaths occurred along a strategic
highway that links Colombo, the capital, to the government-held
northern town of Jaffna. A Red Cross spokesman said the bodies of
600 soldiers were collected from rebels Wednesday, apparent
casualties in fighting that began Sunday. The bodies are in
addition to 262 soldiers whose bodies the military recovered in
battles since Sunday, and 53 soldiers who have died in hospitals.
The military also said it killed 477 rebels in the fighting. The
rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in
the country's north and east, claiming that they are discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese. More than 54,000 people have
been killed since the fighting began in 1983. (SRI LANKA-FIGHTING)

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Naomi Campbell insists she likes Canada. Really.
	   In town filming a movie, the supermodel was responding to a
headline in Sunday's New York Post: ``Naomi gives Canada big
chill.''
	   ``I chose to shoot here,'' she said from the set Tuesday. ``I
wanted to come here.''
	   A column in the Post said Campbell's ``imperious behavior _
we're inured to it here _ while she's been shooting her new film
... has put some Toronto noses out of joint.'' It also said:
``There were even complaints the diva was smoking in non-smoking
areas'' of her hotel and throwing tantrums on the set.
	   Not true, said Campbell, as she puffed on a cigarette. ``I don't
pay any attention to stuff like that,'' she added.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Sly is selling out.
	   Unable to get rid of his five-bedroom mansion, Sylvester
Stallone is courting an ultra-luxury hotel chain, to the chagrin of
his neighbors.
	   London's Orient-Express Hotels Inc. has made a dlrs 24.7 million
offer to build 200 villa-style rooms on the 11.7-acre (4.7-hectare)
property. The company would have to obtain zoning approvals to
build a commercial structure in a residential neighborhood.
	   ``I moved here because it was quiet and lovely, and I would

	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Andrew answered duty's call when he was
summoned for a random drug test by the military.
	   The son of Queen Elizabeth II, a naval lieutenant commander who
works at the Ministry of Defense, was ordered Sept. 15 to provide a
urine sample. The results were negative, Buckingham Palace said
Wednesday.
	   Andrew ``was absolutely happy to take part and accepts that it
is part of the nature of the job,'' said a Buckingham Palace
spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   The Navy said the tests are carried out without regard to rank
or status. Anyone who refuses could face dismissal or other
discipline. More than 80,000 members of the military were tested
last year.
	   The urine was tested for traces of marijuana, cocaine, heroin,
Ecstasy and amphetamines.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ James Caan's 23-year-old son was jailed
Wednesday after being accused of knocking a man out cold at a bar
after the man danced with his date.
	   Scott Caan was arrested for investigation of assault and held on
dlrs 20,000 bail.
	   James Alleyna, 28, was punched several times and lost
consciousness at a bar in West Hollywood, sheriff's Deputy Angie
Prewett said. Alleyna was treated by paramedics.
	   James Caan was nominated for an Oscar as hotheaded mobster Sonny
Corleone in ``The Godfather.'' He was arrested in 1994 after a
musician accused him of pulling a gun. Later that year, he entered
drug rehab.

	   SHAWNEE, Oklahoma (AP) _ Bare-knuckles political fights are to
be expected in the campaign season. Fliers showing a candidate
bare-breasted are not.
	   A candidate for Pottawatomie County associate district judge is
offering a dlrs 50,000 reward for information on who is
distributing campaign fliers that show her baring her breasts.
	   Attorney Paula Sage, 39, said Tuesday that the photo was taken
during a 1990 Halloween party by a former friend who now is her
opponent's secretary.
	   ``I am not Bill Clinton. I do not deny that the photograph is of
me,'' Ms. Sage said, declining to explain the Halloween party.
	   Police Chief Hank Land said the flier showed Ms. Sage with her
sweater lifted. He said only a few copies had been distributed and
police are trying to find the source.
	   Ms. Sage's opponent in the nonpartisan race, incumbent Associate
District Judge John D. Gardner, said he had nothing to do with the
flier, though his court reporter gave him a copy.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman owns a luxury
home, five cars and an extensive art collection, according to his
financial disclosure released Wednesday.
	   The statement, giving Croats a first-ever look at their
president's wealth, complies with newly adopted legislation
requiring politicians to reveal their financial status upon taking
office.
	   Tudjman, an authoritarian ruler who led Croatia to independence
in 1991, listed among his possessions a large home in an upscale
part of the capital Zagreb. He said he bought it in 1992 with
savings and with earnings from more than 70 printed publications.
He said four of the five cars he owns were gifts.
	   The 78-year-old leader also owns paintings and sculptures.
	   Tudjman has often been the target of independent media and
critics who accuse him of indifference to increasing poverty in
Croatia and of amassing fortunes for his family. The average salary
in Croatia is about dlrs 400 a month.

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ On a road strewn with rubble that links
Libya and Tunisia, Moammar Gadhafi is depicted on a billboard
smiling, fist in the air, surrounded by people. A plane is pictured
flying overhead.
	   ``We accept the challenge'' is the message at the bottom, a
reference to Libyan defiance of U.N. air sanctions imposed to force
the handover of two suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   The billboard is but one example of how the Libyan leader has
worked to mold public frustration with the 6-year-old sanctions
into defiant dignity _ a sense of national pride firmly rooted
against a perceived Western prejudice toward Libya.
	   Judging by Libyans' statements and the views of Western
diplomats, Gadhafi largely has succeeded in convincing his people
to put self-esteem before acceptance of U.N. demands, even if it
means more punishment.
	   ``I long for the day when I can fly out of Tripoli airport. I
long for the day when the rights of Libyans are acknowledged with
the same degree of respect as those of other nationalities,'' said
Jumaa Abdullah, a 32-year-old accountant.
	   ``But there is no way that I would want this if it means
succumbing to American and British demands,'' he said. ``This is no
longer just a matter of law, it is a matter of pride _ mine, that
of my family, that of my country.''
	   For years, Gadhafi has resisted demands to allow Abdel-Basset
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah be tried in the United
States or Britain, saying they would be railroaded in either
county.
	   Recently, however, Washington and London accepted Libya's idea
for a trial in a neutral country. In August, the U.N. Security
Council approved a U.S.-British plan for a trial in the Netherlands
overseen by Scottish judges following Scottish law.
	   Libya has accepted the plan in theory, but is demanding
guarantees for the men's safety and assurances they won't be
extradited once in Holland. Gadhafi also wants the men, if
convicted, to serve their sentences in Libya, not in Britain as the
United Nations would have it.
	   At a September rally marking the 29th anniversary of the
bloodless coup that brought him to power, Gadhafi called the
U.S.-British deal an attempt to use the Netherlands as a ``transit
point'' to transfer the two men to Britain.
	   ``We don't care about the sanctions. ... The hell with them!''
he yelled before thousands of supporters gathered in Tripoli's
Martyr's Square.
	   ``We live with integrity. We live to challenge,'' he said.
	   Undoubtedly, there are those who oppose Gadhafi's stand on the
Lockerbie issue, but Western diplomats based in Tripoli say his
popularity is rising on the sanctions issue.
	   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that is
in part because subsidized basic commodities allow Libyans a
relatively comfortable life despite sanctions.
	   On the streets of Tripoli, people indicate they share Gadhafi's
view.
	   ``What else can America do? They've already bombed us once. What
next? Turn us into another Iraq, leave us starving?'' asked Nuri, a
28-year-old waiter who insisted only his first name be used. Nuri
was referring to 1986 American airstrikes that came in retaliation
for the Berlin discotheque bombing America blamed on Gadhafi.
	   Several young men, laughing and cheering while crossing a
downtown street, sing songs praising the Brother Leader, as Gadhafi
is sometimes called.
	   ``Why not sing about him?'' Bashir Abdel-Makarem says. ``He is
the one man who has faced American arrogance and aggression and
still helped us hold our heads high.''

How old is old in the Mediterranean? Scientists hope tree rings
</HEADLINE>
will tell &QL; 
 &UR; AP Graphics TREE RING &QL; 
 &UR; By MALCOLM RITTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ITHACA, New York (AP) _ In a basement laboratory at Cornell
University, scientists are using chunks of wood to revolutionize
the study of ancient history in the eastern Mediterranean.
	   They're gathering tree rings for every year back to 7500 B.C.
Every single year.
	   The payoff? A way to determine the age of wood or charcoal from
archaeological sites, right to the year that the tree toppled.
	   It won't always be that precise. But for archaeologists who are
now delighted if they can date artifacts at give-or-take 50 years,
the prospect is astounding.
	   Some accepted dates for historical events might shift by as much
as 100 years. Movements like that _ and the very precision of the
dating technique _ could overturn ideas about trade, migrations,
wars and whether particular trends were evolutions or revolutions.
	   ``It's going to completely change our understanding of the
chronological sequences of the Aegean and Near East,'' said one
observer, archaeologist Gil Stein of Northwestern University.
	   ``We will really know when these sites were occupied, when these
styles of pottery were used, when these cities arose, when these
areas were abandoned _ very important things that up until now have
been very much subject to debate.''
	   And all this for a time when Pharaohs ruled, the world's first
major cities arose and collapsed, civilizations took root in Egypt
and Mesopotamia, and classical Greece and Rome appeared and
disintegrated.
	   At the center of the tree-ring effort is Peter Ian Kuniholm, 60,
a husky classical archaeologist who minces no words. He can dismiss
a misguided analysis as ``sheer howling nonsense'' and a clutch of
Byzantine samples as ``major site, cruddy wood.''
	   Kuniholm began the work 25 years ago, and he knows his stuff.
During a recent chat in his lab he spoke in encyclopedic detail. He
repeatedly bolted from his chair in mid-conversation to fetch a
phrase from the middle of an inch-thick (2.5-centimeter-thick)
file, a chunk of poplar from the Parthenon or purchasing records -
in drachmas - of an ancient temple treasurer.
	   He's not the first person to use tree rings for establishing
dates. Such ``dendrochronology'' has been applied to thousands of
years of history in Europe and the American Southwest, for example.
But some colleagues initially scoffed at Kuniholm's attempt to
apply it to the eastern Mediterranean, which is not exactly covered
with forests.
	   ``I kept saying to him in the early days, `Well, Peter, where
are you going to find wood?' (It seemed) like counting blades of
grass in the Sahara,'' recalled archaeologist Curtis Runnels of
Boston University.
	   ``He had faith where the rest of us had doubts.''
	   Site by site, chunk by chunk, some 30,000 wood samples have been
collected from about 600 sites in 18 countries, including Italy,
Greece, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Cyprus, northern Syria and
Lebanon. The samples have included a piece of an ancient Turkish
coffin lid, boxwood from a first-century-B.C. Roman boat, and
scorched timbers from a carpenter's workshop - smothered by the
eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D.
	   Kuniholm's lab has made more than 9 million microscope
measurements of tree rings, some finer than a human hair. Even a
finger-sized piece of wood can hold enough rings to be useful, and
a sample the size of a pizza slice can present a bounty of 750
rings.
	   Here's how the analysis works:
	   Trees add a ring each year, sometimes thin, sometimes thick,
depending on growing conditions. ``When I have cool, wet summers my
trees grow like gangbusters,'' Kuniholm said.
	   If a series of years provides a sequence of growing conditions
like poor-poorer-average-great-poor-average, those years should
produce a sequence of rings something like
thin-thinner-average-thick-thin-average. And if two trees share the
same climate, that imprint should be left on both of them, even if
one is young and the other quite old.
	   So when Kuniholm and his assistants analyze a piece of wood,
they see if its tree ring sequence matches one already in the
database. If there's a close-enough match between two long
sequences _ generally 100 rings long at least _ the two trees were
alive during the same years. And if the new wood piece has bark,
Kuniholm knows it was cut in the year represented by the last ring.
	   But what year was that? Kuniholm can tell, so long as the tree
was felled after 360 A.D. His database reaches backward to that
date, starting with ring patterns from contemporary trees _ which
can be dated with certainty _ and extended by sequences from older
wood samples. When a sample matches the oldest rings in the
database and provides still older rings, the older rings can be
dated and the database extended.
	   It's this process that Kuniholm hopes to push all the way back
to 7500 B.C.
	   Even now, he says he can date wood from 2660 B.C to 627 B.C., if
he's right in asserting that a volcano erupted on the Aegean island
of Thera in 1627 B.C. and that a particularly thick ring in his
samples corresponds to that event.

<TEXT>
	   Tree rings can't date every piece of wood precisely. If there's
no bark or other unambiguous sign that the last ring marked the
death of the tree, Kuniholm can say only that the tree was living
during certain years, but not when it was chopped down. And even if
analysis does reveal a precise date on a beam from a building, that
doesn't always say how old the building is. The wood might have
been re-used from some previous building, or newly cut to repair an
old building.
	   All told, the lab database includes tree ring segments covering
about 6,500 years. But most segments are floating in time, not
precisely datable until the database reaches back far enough back
to include them.
	   So, to get more wood, Kuniholm and assistants typically drive
10,000 miles (16,000 kilometers) a summer, visiting digs and
museums, making their faces known, handing out scientific articles
and brochures in eight languages _ anything to locate samples and
spread the word of their quest.
	   ``Everybody is rushing to bring him wood,'' said anthropologist
Mary Voigt of the College of William and Mary. ``It's clear he has
a long-enough sequence that we have some confidence in the dates.''
	   She hopes Kuniholm can help her analyze ruins at Gordion, the
Turkish home of King Midas. That's where Kuniholm began his
project, out of frustration with the imprecision of other methods.
	   Decades later, it's still fun.
	   He once visited a stone castle at Pythion, on the border of
Greece and Turkey. The archaeologist there could say only that it
was built in the first half of the 14th Century, based on pottery,
coins and written histories.
	   Kuniholm rappelled down its face and fished out some rotted
timber, which the ancient builders had used as scaffolding.
	   ``The wood was all cut in 1331,'' Kuniholm said the other day
with obvious satisfaction. ``He can give me within 50 years. I can
tell him the year.''

Hog deer thought almost extinct found after five decades _ as pets

<TEXT>
	   BATAPOLA, Sri Lanka (AP) _ In clearings in Sri Lanka's vast
stretches of cinnamon groves and tropical forest, a Buddhist monk,
a homemaker and a bicycle mechanic are breaking the law.
	   Each could be jailed for six months and fined 30,000 rupees
(dlrs 450) for keeping endangered hog deer in captivity. But in a
curious turn of events, conservationists are thanking them.
	   Had they not preserved the species as pets, Sri Lanka would have
lost them forever.
	   ``Though they broke the law, they did help save the animal,''
said Nandana Atapattu, a deputy director of Sri Lanka's Department
of Wildlife Conservation.
	   Atapattu has combed southern Sri Lanka's cinnamon-growing area
for four years in search of the animal which, as the name suggests,
somewhat resembles a pig.
	   The gentle-tempered, endearingly awkward deer were thought to
have nearly disappeared from Sri Lanka five decades ago. But in
1992, Atapattu's department found two hog deer being kept as pets
at Batapola, a hamlet about 60 miles (95 kilometers) south of
Colombo.
	   ``Since then I have been spending my free time meeting
villagers, school children and asking them about hog deer,''
Atapattu said as he and about a dozen volunteers visited remote
villages collecting the animals.
	   Atapattu plans to keep domesticated hog deer in a barricaded
area until they learn to live on their own, then release them into
one of Sri Lanka's dozen national parks.
	   Hog deer have a thickset appearance and peculiar gait. The
animal runs with its head down and at times collides with fellow
deer, other animals and even trees.
	   An adult hog deer stands at just over two feet (0.6 meters) and
weighs between 75 and 120 pounds (34 and 54 kilos). The female
gives birth to one calf at a time.
	   India, Burma, Thailand, Indochina and Sri Lanka are the known
habitat of the hog deer. They are listed as endangered in all those
countries.
	   The hog deer used to freely roam in Sri Lanka. Its downfall was
its love of rubbing its body against sweet-scented cinnamon trees,
destroying the precious bark that is the spice. Male hog deer often
damage cinnamon trees by digging at the roots with their horns. The
deer also eat cinnamon leaves.
	   Early Portuguese, Dutch and British colonists generally let the
hog deer alone as cinnamon and uninhabited land were plentiful.
After independence from the British in 1948, Sri Lanka accelerated
cinnamon production and the clash with the hog deer began.
	   ``Cinnamon growers used wire-noose traps and even deployed
hunting dogs to get rid of the hog deer,'' Atapattu said.
	   A small group of animal lovers at Batapola and surrounding
villages got together on their own to save the hog deer by
domesticating it. Now many of the do-it-yourself conservationists
are helping Atapattu.
	   ``I knew that for the project to be successful I would need
grassroots volunteers who would ... know which homes are keeping
the pets,'' Atapattu said.
	   ``I have four now,'' said homemaker Tushe Havage Mallika as she
fed her hog deer biscuits. ``One of them even insists on sleeping
on our bed.''
	   A 75-year-old Buddhist monk, Sudama Thero, patted a hog deer he
said had been presented as a gift to his temple four years ago.
	   Atapattu and his men have found 20 captive hog deer. As Atapattu
was leaving a remote village, one of his volunteers brought the
news that a hog deer was being kept in a bicycle repair shop in
another village.
	   Bicycle mechanic T.H. Nandasena handed his pet over with some
reluctance.
	   ``Well, I am feeling very sad. I raised it since it was very
small,'' he said as Atapattu and his men untied the animal and
loaded it onto a jeep.

	   VALLEY FORGE, Pennsylvania (AP) _ The glint in the sky looks at
first like a big star but ignites spectacularly, rivaling the
moon's brightness. Then, in a few seconds, it fades.
	   ``I just say `Wow,' when I see a really good one,'' said Terry
Pundiak, an Allentown physician and amateur astronomer. ``I'm
surprised they don't cause more reports of UFO sightings.''
	   This newfound heavenly body is no unidentified flying object but
one of a year-old constellation of low-orbiting satellites called
Iridiums, and spotting their five- to 30-second flashes is the
latest celestial fad.
	   Planetariums lead nighttime Iridium vigils. Internet message
boards burn with anecdotes and technical details. Backyard
stargazers spend evenings counting how many they can spot with the
naked eye.
	   ``On any given night you have a good chance of seeing them, and
you don't need a telescope,'' said Ron Dantowitz, astronomer at the
Museum of Science in Boston. ``You just need at least one good
eyeball.''
	   Motorola first launched the rotating Iridium satellites in May
1997, and the first flares were reported the following August.
	   Each Iridium has three mirror-like antennas about the size of a
door. Unlike the surfaces of other satellites, which are concave or
not very reflective, Iridium antennas are flat, silver-coated
Teflon panels. When sunlight hits at a certain angle, an Iridium
casts a brilliant reflection up to 30 times brighter than Venus,
reaching a patch on Earth of about 20 square miles (52 square
kilometers).
	   ``I saw one that practically burned my retinas out,'' said Randy
John, a computer programmer and amateur astronomer in Pleasant
Hill, California.
	   With about 70 Iridium satellites in orbit _ including about a
half-dozen broken, or tumbling, satellites that emit less
predictable flashes _ observers just about anywhere in the world
can see a dozen flares of varying brightness in a single evening.
The brightest flares can even be seen through clouds, in daylight
or from the inner city.
	   The satellites' orbits are so punctual that the flares can be
predicted to the second.
	   Queens University chemistry professor Brian Hunter of Ontario
was probably the first to report an Iridium flare, followed shortly
by Don Gardner of Columbia, Maryland. Most of the discoveries are
chronicled on a dozen or so Web sites now dedicated to Iridium
flare pictures, predictions and anecdotes.
	   The flares quickly became eye candy for professional astronomers
as well. In October 1997, a rooftop flare-spotting session was held
at the 48th International Astronomical Congress in Turin, Italy.
	   ``As fascinating as the natural night sky may be, on any given
night it does not vary much, except for the short-lived streaks of
falling stars or meteors,'' said solar physicist Bart De Pontieu of
Palo Alto, California. ``To me, artificial satellites add a touch
of motion and surprise to the otherwise steady, unchanging night
sky.''
	   Astronomers feared at first that satellite flares would be
disruptive because they can be mistaken for a comet or meteor and
leave a sky-long white streak in photographs.
	   ``It could be misconstrued as landing lights from an airplane or
even a nova,'' said amateur astronomer Jeff Hunt of Charlotte Hall,
Maryland, who maintains one of the foremost flare-predicting Web
sites.
	   But most skywatchers have found the flares are predictable
enough that they aren't a problem. Moreover, the brilliant flares
have been a boon to stargazing.
	   ``The Iridium satellites could become astronomers' unwitting
partners in building an interest in the night sky for the Star Wars
generation, which has been hard to impress with telescopic views of
deep sky objects,'' said amateur astronomer Russell Sipe of Anaheim
Hills, California.
	   Sipe said he witnessed the ``wow factor'' of Iridiums at a
softball game in southern California recently, when he knew that an
Iridium satellite would flare overhead.
	   ``We stopped the game for a few minutes. All of a sudden there
are 25 or so people looking up, watching in awe. And for those few
seconds, that had them thinking about space and astronomy,'' Sipe
said.
	   Spotting satellites as a hobby started back in the 1950s with
the launch of the first satellite, the Russian Sputnik, and its
U.S. followers. At the time, newspapers published satellite
schedules, fueling a craze in satellite watching.
	   Motorola's dlrs 3.4-billion digital satellite fleet was named
after the element iridium with the atomic number 77, the number of
satellites that were expected to be launched. Each one is 13 feet
(4 feet) long and 1,500 pounds (680 kilograms), with an antenna
panel designed to and pick up and beam phone signals.
	   The fleet, which is not made of iridium, is the basis of a new
global cellular phone system expected to begin this fall.

Over 50 years, one study changes all we know about heart disease
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY321-322 &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRAMINGHAM, Massachusetts (AP) _ Here's how much things have
changed in 50 years: Back then, an auto mechanic named Joe Pavia
used to eat two jelly doughnuts on his coffee break every morning.
And the really amazing part? He didn't even feel guilty about it!
	   Pavia was 34 at the time, and like folks everywhere, he knew
next to nothing about the stuff that hurts the heart _ bad diets,
high cholesterol, high blood pressure, cigarettes, diabetes and all
other taboos that are now part of the public consciousness.
	   If there were a single moment when all that began to change,
however, it would probably be the fall of 1948, when Pavia and his
wife Lorraine got an odd request: Would they agree to a free
checkup every two years so doctors could listen to their hearts,
run some tests and ask a lot of questions?
	   Pavia remembers what he thought at the time: ``What do they want
me for? I'm in perfect health.''
	   But that was just the point. After World War II, the United
States was beset with an epidemic of heart disease. By the time
outwardly healthy men like Pavia hit their 50s and 60s, they were
dying like never before. No one knew why.
	   So the federal government launched an unprecedented attempt to
understand this killer. The idea: Go into one small town. Amass
volumes of health facts on ordinary 30ish people. Then watch what
happens. Perhaps in time some link will emerge between the way they
live and the fate of their hearts.
	   Pavia and his wife Lorraine signed up, along with his brother
and sister. In all, 5,209 healthy residents of Framingham _ 20
percent of the town's population _ agreed to the exams.
	   The result is the Framingham Heart Study, the longest running
major epidemiological project in medicine and certainly one of the
most influential experiments ever.
	   ``We have a 50-year legacy of scientific advancement, over 1,000
papers published to date,'' says Dr. Daniel Levy, the study's
fourth director. ``I'd like to think that the work from Framingham
really has changed the lives of Americans and contributed to the
public health of our nation.''
	   Few would argue with that. Indeed, it seems just about
everything folks know about what causes heart attacks and strokes,
and what prevents them, comes from Framingham.
	   Experts stumble over superlatives to describe the study's
impact. ``One of the seminal heart studies,'' says Dr. Lawrence
Appel of Johns Hopkins University. ``A watershed event in the
prevention of heart disease,'' says Dr. Rodman Starke of the
American Heart Association.
	   Sentences that begin, ``Framingham shows ...'' settle arguments
wherever doctors gather to talk about heart trouble. But the
study's impact has been equally profound on the health practices of
folks who have never even heard of the Framingham Heart Study.
	   What makes Framingham impressive is how much it has changed. The
depths of pre-Framingham ignorance when the Pavias got their call
are now hard to comprehend. It went way beyond the evils of jelly
doughnuts.
	   ``Fifty years ago, people debated whether cigarette smoking had
anything to do with heart disease, whether cholesterol and blood
sugar were important,'' says Dr. Lewis Kuller of the University of
Pittsburgh. ``What we take as truth today was far from obvious even
in the 1970s. What Framingham did was to establish the relevance of
these risk factors for heart disease.''
	   Even the phrase ``risk factors'' comes from the Framingham
study. Dr. William B. Kannel coined the phrase in a medical paper
published in the 1960s while he was director.
	   When Kannel began at Framingham in 1949, doctors thought any
cholesterol level under 300 was perfectly fine. No one worried much
about stratospheric blood pressures; lots of people had them.
	   Perhaps the study's most important contribution, says Kannel, is
showing that when it comes to health, average isn't always good.
One example of this is how Framingham changed thinking about the
consequences of rising blood pressure as people get older.
	   When the study began, doctors assumed it was a necessary part of
aging. Dr. Phil Wolf remembers the old rule that a patient's
systolic blood pressure, the larger first number in a reading,
should equal his age plus 100. ``I was taught in medical school
that older people needed that higher pressure. If they don't have
it, that will cause fainting and strokes.''
	   The truth, Framingham revealed in 1971, is just the opposite.
Rising blood pressure is worrisome at any age. The higher it gets,
the greater the risk of strokes.
	   At the outset, the Framingham doctors recorded 80 variables,
things like weight, electrocardiogram readings, exercise habits,
cholesterol levels _ anything that might remotely have an effect on
the heart.
	   The study was scheduled to last for 20 years, and after 10
years, some patterns began to emerge. One of the first discoveries,
published in 1959, was that heart attacks could be painless,
leaving a scar on the heart but no symptoms.

FRAMINGHAM: no symptoms.

<TEXT>
	   Soon others piled up:
	   _Ten years before Wolf and Kannel found a link between elderly
blood pressure and strokes, the Framingham doctors discovered that
high blood pressure appears to trigger heart attacks. That
breakthrough was one of the pivotal pieces of evidence that led to
the universal effort to spot high blood pressure and lower it with
drugs, diet and exercise.
	   _Cigarette smoking is bad for the heart. The discovery was
ammunition for the surgeon general's landmark campaign against
smoking.
	   _Too much cholesterol in the blood raises the risk of heart
attacks, while high-density lipoprotein _ HDL _ actually protects
against heart disease.
	   _Physical exercise lowers the risk of heart disease; being
overweight increases it.
	   _Menopause abruptly increases the risk of heart disease.
	   _Atrial fibrillation, the seemingly harmless irregular beating
of the heart's upper chamber, is a powerful trigger of strokes.
	   _Diabetes is an important underlying cause of heart disease.
	   _Estrogen pills after menopause lower the risk of broken hips.
	   The U.S. Public Health Service chose Framingham because it was
such a cross-section of America, at least white America, and close
to Boston's medical expertise. The town of 28,000 people, 18 miles
(30 kilometers) west of the city, was a mix of blue collar and
professional, farmer and factory worker. There were Italians, Jews,
Irish, French-Canadians.
	   Now Framingham, population 70,000, is home to Fortune 500
corporations and high-tech firms. But the Framingham Heart Study is
probably its best-known product. Funded by the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute and staffed largely by physicians from Boston
University, the study has cost a total of dlrs 43 million.
	   The study's biggest drawback is its lack of ethnic diversity.
Because the study's volunteers, like Framingham in 1948, are
virtually all white, doctors cannot automatically extend the
findings to blacks or Asians. The study is adding a new section,
the Omni Study, of about 1,000 nonwhite Framingham residents.
	   It is the study's second expansion. In 1971, as the original
Framingham group pushed 60, the study recruited their children and
spouses, 5,124 in all. Three Pavia daughters _ Lois, Carol and
Joanne _ joined the study.
	   The Framingham doctors hope to add a third generation. The goal
this time will be to go beyond heart disease and use the stored
data and blood samples on children, their parents and their
grandparents to track the genetic origins of all sorts of diseases.

Stop your complaining about no hot water, state premier tells
</HEADLINE>
Victorians &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Note strong language in 6th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australians in Victoria state who
are without natural gas for hot showers were fuming Thursday at
their state leader, who called his people ``soft-bellied'' for
complaining about the crisis.
	   ``What are we coming to where the whole society, where our
underbelly is so soft?'' Victoria state Premier Jeff Kennett
scolded on Wednesday night on a radio show.
	   A huge fire at Esso's Longford gas refinery in Victoria state
last Friday killed two men and injured eight.
	   The plant supplied more than 80 percent of the natural gas for
Australia's second-most populous state, and some 1.4 million
households and 100,000 businesses may be without natural gas for at
least two weeks.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook
their food.
	   But Kennett told his people to stop ``bitching and moaning''
about cold showers and no cooking gas.
	   ``I mean, our grandparents use to have to boil water for a bath
every night,'' Kennett said.
	   But with business losing many millions of dollars and 100,000
workers laid off, callers to talk radio shows in Melbourne
castigated Kennett for his criticism.
	   Some industry sectors have speculated the aftermath of the fires
could last up to six months, even if gas is restored within a
couple of weeks.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions, which took two days to extinguish.
	   At least 100,000 workers in Victoria have been laid off as the
Ford and Toyota auto factories, glass and brick-making plants,
bakeries, dairies and many other industries shut down.
	   Victoria Trades Hall Council union chief Leigh Hubbard said by
next week 120,000 workers will be idled.
	   The Australian Industry Group estimates the crisis could cost
100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) each day it
goes on, which amounts to a third of the sate's production.
	   Economists estimate that the crisis will wipe half a percent off
Australia gross Domestic product if it lasts two weeks, the amount
the economy had been expected to grow in the next quarter.
	   The industrial crisis spread interstate, with other factories
that rely on business with Victoria having to lay off workers.
	   In South Australia, two of Australia's largest automotive
companies, Holden and Mitsubishi, announced they were preparing for
several days of lost production because of a lack of parts from
Victoria.
	   The state on Wednesday raised the fine for turning on gas
without authorization from 500 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 290)
to 10,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5,800).
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP)_ Mexico's state petroleum monopoly Petroleos
Mexicanos signed a dlrs 1 billion loan with Japan's Eximbank, the
Treasury Department said.
	   The credit, signed Wednesday by Pemex director Adrian Lajous and
Eximbank Vice Governor Kensaku Aomoto, is for a period of 8 1/2
years, at an interest of 2.5 percent per year with a 3-1/2 year
grace period.
	   The department said in a news release that the money, the
largest loan ever made to Pemex by a single bank, will be used for
development projects at the Cantarell deposits in the Gulf of
Mexico.
	   Cantarell is Mexico's principal oil deposit, currently producing
1.32 million barrels a day of crude. Proven and probable reserves
at the deposit total 13.5 billion barrels.

Mexico bank lending to shrink, regulators say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Lending by Mexican banks will contract in
1998 due to market volatility and high interest rates, regulators
and bankers predicted Wednesday.
	   Lending is expected to fall for the fourth consecutive year
following the crisis sparked by the December 1994 peso devaluation,
Carlos Gomez y Gomez, president of the Mexican Bankers Association,
said at a seminar.
	   Although in the second quarter of the year, the banking system's
loan portfolio registered 1.1 percent real growth and
non-performing loans fell 3.1 percent, lending levels are expected
to retreat in the last six months of the year, said Javier Gavito,
vice president of the National Banking and Securities Commission.
	   Credit growth is deteriorating ``due to the rise in interest
rates, lower world oil prices, the Asian financial crisis and the
political debate surrounding the reform of Fobaproa,'' Gavito said,
referring to the Bank Savings Protection Fund.
	   ``This situation endangers the banking system, which has
improved when compared to 1995 but still needs to consolidate,'' he
said.

Citibank to begin merger of Mexico's Confia Thursday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Citicorp's banking unit Citibank begins the
final stage Thursday of merging with the Mexican retail bank
Confia.
	   Madeleine Girot, a spokeswoman of Citibank Mexico, said
Wednesday that Citibank this week began installing Citibank signs
and banners on Confia branches.
	   ``Tomorrow (Thursday) we will begin the integration process of
Confia into Citibank,'' Girot said. ``We will implement changes in
a gradual way, including the conversion of credit and debit cards,
checkbooks and other products.''
	   Confia is currently undergoing a reorganization to eliminate
duplicate operations, Girot said. She declined to provide an
estimate of how many Confia employees face layoffs.
	   Citibank is also reorganizing Confia's branch system, Girot
added. So far, 17 Confia branches have been closed as part of an
efficiency program implemented by the U.S. bank.
	   ``Mexico will become Citibank's third-largest country in terms
of branches after the U.S. and Germany,'' Girot said. Citibank will
now have 183 branches throughout Mexico, she added.
	   Citibank has operated in Mexico since 1929, focusing on major

with only seven branches in the country _ five in Mexico City, one

	   The National Banking and Securities Commission intervened and
assumed managerial control of Abaco in August 1997. The
intervention coincided with Citibank's agreement to acquire Confia.

Protection Fund, known as Fobaproa, about dlrs 195 million for
Confia.

	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ Dan Quisenberry, a star relief
pitcher for the Royals whose droll wit and funky delivery charmed
fans and baffled batters, died Wednesday of brain cancer. He was
45.
	   Quisenberry died around dawn in his home in Leawood, Kansas,
after a nine-month battle with the illness. He had undergone
surgery twice since December when sudden, persistent headaches were
diagnosed as the most lethal type of tumor.
	   ``Dan was one of the finest people I've ever known,'' said
Atlanta Braves general manager John Schuerholz, who headed the
Royals' scouting department 20 years ago when an undrafted
Quisenberry had to plead for a tryout.
	   Quisenberry, a three-time All-Star, was the major league career
saves leader from 1979-85 and helped the Royals win two American
League pennants and a World Series.
	   News of his illness last winter jolted Kansas City, where the
affable, quick-witted Quisenberry had remained a popular and active
member of the community. During his playing days, he devoted a
great deal of time and energy to gathering food for the homeless
and needy. While continuing that work since retiring in 1990, he
had also begun giving poetry readings in public libraries.
	   ``I don't remember him as the guy who got all the ground balls
and double plays,'' said Jamie Quirk, a Royals coach and longtime
teammate. ``He was more important than that. He was much more.''
	   Quisenberry came up late in 1979 when injuries devastated the
Royals' pitching staff. Pale and skinny, he had an awkward-looking,
submarine delivery and a sinkerball that big-league hitters figured
to murder.
	   Instead, they usually pounded balls into the ground, where a
talented infield headed by nine-time All-Star second baseman Frank
White scooped them up.
	   In a 12-year career, he compiled 244 saves _ 13th all time. He
was the AL saves leader five times while helping the Royals win
pennants in 1980 and '85. His 45 saves in 1983 was then the major
league record. Between 1979 and 1985, when Kansas City beat St.
Louis for its only World Series title, Quisenberry's 217 saves were
tops in the majors.
	   ``I lull them into a false sense of security by letting them
watch me pitch,'' he once deadpanned. ``If overconfidence can cause
the Roman Empire to fall, I ought to be able to get a ground
ball.''
	   The inveterate jokester's humor was usually directed at himself.
	   ``I found a delivery in my flaw,'' he once explained after
coming out of a slump.
	   During his 10 years in Kansas City, Quisenberry was a pivotal
figure in many of the team's greatest moments. He got the save in
the famous ``Pine Tar Game'' against the New York Yankees after
Billy Martin protested George Brett's bat. And he got the victory
in a 2-1 win over St. Louis in the sixth game of the '85 World
Series.
	   ``He was not only a very big part of the great success we
enjoyed in Kansas City, but he was as fine a man as I've ever
met,'' said Schuerholz, the Royals' GM during their championship
seasons.
	   In May, just before his second surgery, a frail Quisenberry was
inducted into the team's hall of fame during emotional ceremonies
in Kauffman Stadium.
	   ``I'm so blessed,'' he said the crowd. ``I loved playing in
front of you folks, great fans. Great city. Great team.''
	   White, now a Royals coach, stood near first base and sobbed.
	   ``God bless you all,'' Quisenberry said. ``Thanks for the
prayers. Thank you very much.''
	   Quisenberry is survived by his wife, Janie, and teen-age
children Alysia and David.

Caribbean nations voice concerns about environment, trade and
</HEADLINE>
hurricane &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Caribbean nations, grappling with a host
of problems from environmental concerns to trade restrictions and
losses from a recent hurricane, called Wednesday for help,
understanding and reforms.
	   The Caribbean islands ``are continually subject to the pressures
of urbanization and resource exploitation; to the pollution of
their coastal waters; to the threat of natural disasters,''
Jamaica's foreign minister told the U.N. General Assembly.
	   In a speech advocating protection of oceans and seabeds, Seymour
Mullings said, ``We are endangered by the threat of sea-level rise
and face the destruction of our coral reefs.''
	   ``We take this opportunity to appeal to the international
community to provide urgent and generous humanitarian assistance
and support of the reconstruction of our sister Caribbean states,''
he said.
	   The danger of natural disasters was brought home most recently
by Hurricane Georges, which caused ``widespread loss of life and
property'' in Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican
Republic, Haiti and St. Kitts and Nevis, Mullings said.
	   ``This is the stark reality. This is the reality of small island
developing states, said Denzil Douglas, prime minister of St. Kitts
and Nevis. He estimated losses and damages from the hurricane at
more than dlrs 400 million.
	   ``Our reality after a hurricane is about people living without
the basic necessities that we all take for granted,'' he told the
General Assembly. ``It is about families displaced, having to watch
their dreams lie in ruins,'' said Douglas, who is also the foreign
minister.
	   He said that free-trade agreements that go into effect in 2002
threaten the Caribbean banana industry, which brought prosperity to
the islands in the 1960s and 1970s.
	   Last year, the United States and Central American countries
challenged the trade preferences some European countries give their
former colonies _ including those in the Caribbean _ and succeeded
in getting them eliminated.
	   ``Our negligible exports, in percentage terms, cannot pose any
credible threat to any transnational corporation or large producers
or banana or sugar,'' Douglas said.
	   Dominica's prime minister called for more cooperation between
the United Nations and the Caribbean community, especially to
protect the banana trade.
	   ``That cooperation ... is nowhere more necessary than in our
fight to maintain the integrity of the market for bananas,'' Edison
C. James told the U.N. General Assembly in a speech that also
called for Taiwan to regain its U.N. seat.
	   ``Our fight is against some very powerful members of this very
United Nations who seem determined to derail our democracy, upset
our efforts at eradicating poverty and undermine the peace and
security of our region,'' said James, whose island nation gained
independence from Britain in 1978.
	   The foreign minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines also
slammed the United States, saying it did not expect a challenge for
its banana trade by a friendly country.
	   ``My delegation is amazed by the blind and apathetic position of
the U.S.A. on the issue,'' Allan Cruickshank said.
	   He said that a healthy banana industry in his country was
combatting the production, use and trade in illicit drugs.
	   ``How can we convince our own citizens about the need to combat
the production, use and trade in illicit drugs, if our banana
industry is destroyed,'' Cruickshank said.
	   Speaking for the Bahamas, the foreign minister of that Caribbean
nation called for international cooperation in the fight against
drugs.
	   She said that after an abatement in drug trafficking, drug
seizures and the number of people arrested for drugs offenses in
the Bahamas were on the rise.

German to be deported, admits 27 charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ German fugitive Andreas Michael
Lenke admitted 27 charges relating to child pornography and
passport offenses in Wellington District Court on Thursday and will
be deported to Germany next week.
	   Lenke, 31, pleaded guilty to 20 charges of making objectionable
material, two counts of falsifying a passport, two of altering
documents, passport theft, knowingly using an altered document for
fraud, and counterfeiting a passport.
	   Judge Arthur Middleton sentenced Lenke to 25 days in jail, which
included 17 days already spent in custody, to allow him to be
deported to Germany on Oct. 8.
	   Lenke is wanted by German authorities where he has 2 1/2 years
of a jail term for fraud to serve.
	   The German national, who entered this country in March 1996, had
worked as a part-time teacher and soccer coach at a Wellington
college.
	   He was originally arrested after police and Internal Affairs
staff executed a search warrant under the Films, Video and
Publications Classification Act to raid his Wellington home.
	   Senior Police Sgt. Ken McLeod told the court police found 1,400
still or moving images on his computer, 450 of which were
objectionable.
	   McLeod said the material featured the sexual violation and
exploitation of children.
	   Lenke had also stolen a housemate's Australian passport, and
falsified his own German one to include entry to New Zealand and
South America.

Grenades explode in Hebron, 22 injured, curfew imposed

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Undercutting the latest peace efforts,
an assailant hurled two grenades at Israeli troops guarding a
downtown square in the volatile West Bank city of Hebron, injuring
11 soldiers and 11 Palestinians.
	   The Israeli army poured reinforcements Wednesday into Hebron and
imposed a curfew on the area it controls after the attack on Yom
Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar. The attacker was
shot in the leg before he vanished into the Palestinian-controlled
area of the city.
	   Coming amid U.S. efforts to conclude agreement on an Israeli
troop withdrawal in the West Bank, the attack boosted Israeli
claims that the Palestinian Authority is not doing enough to
prevent attacks on Israelis.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would not
hand over more West Bank land until the Palestinians rein in
militants.
	   Troops also set up roadblocks around Hebron, barring
Palestinians from leaving or entering the city of 130,000
Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers.
	   Tensions in Hebron have been rising since the Aug. 20 killing of
a settler rabbi, apparently by a Palestinian militant.
	   In a related development, Israel TV's Channel Two said that
Palestinian security forces raided a Hamas bomb factory in Hebron
on Tuesday, seizing 640 pounds of explosives and bomb-making
materials. The report said it was the largest Hamas laboratory
uncovered.
	   Wednesday's violence erupted during Yom Kippur, the holiest day
on the Jewish calendar, as Israeli troops enforced a blanket
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   The bloodshed came amid intensive U.S. efforts to broker an
agreement on an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West
Bank. Under a compromise, 3 percent of that land is to be set aside
as a nature reserve in which Israel retains control over security.
	   Earlier this week, President Bill Clinton hosted Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat separately and then in a three-way
summit. Israeli and U.S. officials were upbeat, saying the land
issue had been resolved.
	   However, Palestinian negotiators said Wednesday that some
differences remained. Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian
representative in Washington, said one point of contention was
whether Palestinian police could enter the nature reserve.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and U.S. envoy Dennis
Ross are to return to the region Tuesday to prepare another Mideast
summit in Washington in mid-October, Palestinian negotiators said.
	   The grenade blast injured five soldiers and six officers from
the paramilitary border police, as well as 11 Palestinians, the
army and Palestinian doctors said. One Israeli was seriously
wounded.
	   In other developments Wednesday, some 400 Palestinians threw
stones at Israeli soldiers near the West Bank village of Biddou.
Troops fired rubber bullets, injuring six Palestinians.
	   The clashes erupted after the funeral of a Hamas activist,
Zahran Ibrahim Zahran, who was killed Tuesday when a car rigged
with powerful explosives blew up in the village of Beitunia, near
Ramallah.
	   Suleiman and Salim Abu Eid, two Hamas activists who survived the
blast, denied they were preparing the car for a bombing attack in
Israel, Palestinian police said.
	   The Abu Eid brothers told Palestinian investigators that just
before the explosion, they met an Israeli Arab in a car in the
Beitunia industrial zone, expecting him to deliver three guns for
dlrs 1,000. The man delivered a package and got out of the car
before the explosion, they said.
	   A caller to a Palestinian media center, saying he spoke for
Hamas, claimed Israel was behind the bombing. However, Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar, said the group was still investigating the
incident.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
over renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to carry
out suicide-bombings in the Jewish state. Hamas wants to avenge the
recent killings of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.

	   GOLUBOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Reports of recent massacres among
civilian ethnic Albanians in the embattled Serbian Kosovo province
have heightened the likelihood of NATO airstrikes against military
targets in Yugoslavia.
	   Britain called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security
Council, and representatives of the Contact Group of the five
leading powers were also scheduled to meet Thursday at U.N.
headquarters to discuss the fighting in Kosovo that has left
hundreds dead.
	   On Wednesday, residents of Golubovac said that Serbian forces
surrounded a pocket of refugees there last Saturday and singled out
at least 13 men to kill. They said the victims were already buried,
but pointed to saucer-sized pools of dried blood and empty
cartridges in front of a fence where they said the refugees were
shot.
	   Earlier this week, diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies in nearby Obrija, eight
kilometers (five miles) to the north, including those of women and
children.
	   The mass killings last weekend in the Drenica region, where
Serb-led forces are trying to crush ethnic Albanian rebels, are
among the most gruesome developments since the offensive began in
February. The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is seeking independence
for Kosovo, whose population is mostly ethnic Albanian.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center claimed late
Wednesday that 18 more bodies had been found nearby in the area
around a third village, Glogovac. They said all showed clear signs
of torture and that three were shot in the back of the head. The
claim could not be confirmed, and it was possible it referred to
the Golubovac site.
	   There was no way to corroborate the ethnic Albanian accounts.
Both sides have been accused of massacres in Kosovo.
	   Britain and Austria on Wednesday urged an international
investigation into what Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel called the ``bestial'' massacre at Obrija, which the
Serbs call Gornje Obrinje.
	   ``This was not an act of war, it was plain cold murder,''
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said later in calling for the
Security Council meeting.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency called Western reports a
``media farce,'' and said the Obrija killing was staged to generate
more pressure on Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serb authorities promised earlier this week that troops would
retreat to their barracks after claiming victory over the KLA.
	   A U.N. spokesman in Belgrade said fighting was still going on
near Suva Reka, southwest of Pristina, but that the pullback was
continuing. ``It appears there is a methodical, gradual withdrawal
of the military under way,'' said the spokesman, who gave his name
as J. Carter.
	   Only occasional gunshots could be heard in Drenica. But Fernando
del Mundo, the Kosovo spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said he saw Serb troops coming out of a western village
where houses were ablaze.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported that attackers from Albania
staged an hours-long attack on Yugoslav army border forces
northwest of Djakovica. There was no immediate information on
casualties.
	   Also Wednesday, an ethnic Albanian doctor was killed and three
other members of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
including one foreigner _ a nurse from New Zealand _ were injured
when their vehicle hit a land mine west of Pristina.
	   The Serbs have been accused of hindering humanitarian aid for an
estimated 275,000 people driven from their homes.
	   In Golubovac, farmer Naim Hodzaj said that in addition to the
executions, Serb police had killed several other men individually,
including his 37-year-old brother Ramadan, who was doused with
gasoline and set on fire. His brother's burned body lay curled up
on a path on the edge of the woods.
	   Many of the houses of Golubovac are gutted by recent fire, and
the town's perimeter is dotted by small piles of artillery shells
and empty tins of food.
	   The slayings of the Obrija victims, whose bodies were seen this
week by diplomats and journalists in a Drenica forest, inflamed
tensions in Kosovo. Some were carved up with knives, limbs hacked
off; a 10-year-old boy had his throat slit.
	   ``We rule out any possibility that our members did something
like this,'' Serb police Col. Bozidar Filic said. ``In that area,
we had clashes with terrorists and a number of them have been
arrested.''

Council to convene urgent consultations on Kosovo massacre

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is
facing international condemnation _ and the increasing threat of
NATO action as well _ for a Serb massacre on Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians.
	   The Security Council was holding informal consultations Thursday
after British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook called for an emergency
meeting to condemn the weekend massacre of civilians in the forests
around Obrija.
	   The council wasn't expected to take any major action Thursday. A
statement to the press, condemning the massacre, was the likely
outcome, council diplomats said.
	   The call for the meeting, however, came as NATO ambassadors were
finalizing plans for airstrikes against Serbs and the Contact Group
of states were arranging to meet in London to consult on the
situation.
	   Several allied nations have pledged to make planes available for
a strike. Germany has offered 14 Tornado fighter planes, the
Netherlands and Norway have each offered eight F-16 fighters and
Spain has pledged four F-18s.
	   The United States has declined to say publicly what forces it is
offering, but NATO officials said U.S. cruise missiles were ready
for action in the Balkans.
	   Both the council and NATO were awaiting word from
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on how to proceed. The U.N. chief was
to report, probably early next week, on the situation in Kosovo and
whether the Serbs had complied with the latest council resolution
urging a cease-fire.
	   The council threatened to consider unspecificied measures if
both sides in the conflict failed to comply.
	   Cook warned that NATO airstrikes could follow Annan's report,
which is a regular 30-day update that was expected late this week
or early next week.
	   ``Military action will flow from a political decision,'' he
said.
	   Cook also called for a meeting in London Friday of the six
countries represented in the so-called Contact Group on Yugoslavia:
the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia. He
said the meeting was to find a ``way forward on a political
settlement'' for Kosovo.
	   ``This was not an act of war, it was plain cold murder,'' Cook
said at a new conference at the Labor Party's annual conference in
Blackpool, England.
	   In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
Cook by telephone that she agreed with convening a council meeting
to discuss the atrocities in Kosovo, State Department spokesman
James Foley said.
	   As for the possibility of military action, Foley said,
``Clearly, the clock is ticking.''
	   Annan is evaluating whether Serbia has complied with last week's
Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire in Kosovo, a
withdrawal of Serbian troops, and the start of ``serious dialogue
on real autonomy'' for the province.
	   In a possible precursor to his report, Annan issued a statement
Wednesday condemning the slaughter of 18 people in the Serbian
province on Sunday. Annan added that the reported massacre was
``particularly shocking'' since the Yugoslav foreign minister had
as recently as Tuesday denied Serb involvement in any atrocities.
	   Serb police denied responsibility Wednesday for the killings, in
which men, women and children were shot in the back of the head and
mutilated. The bodies were seen Tuesday by diplomats and
journalists in a forest in the Drenica region of Kosovo, where the
ethnic Albanian majority is fighting for independence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed, and over a quarter million
have fled their homes since a Serb crackdown began in February. The
West supports autonomy for Kosovo but not independence.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China are opposed to any
use of force in Kosovo. China abstained from last week's
resolution, claiming that the fighting in Kosovo didn't constitute
a threat to international peace and security.
	   ``Of course we condemned the killing, but at the same time we
should get more information on that,'' said China's deputy
ambassador Shen Guofang said when asked if his government would go
along with a council condemnation of the atrocities.
	   Russia signed off on last week's resolution, but argued that
another resolution was required for council authorization of
military action. Both Russia and China could veto any new
resolution.

Council sends list of judges to assembly for Rwanda tribunal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council has nominated 18
people to be judges for the U.N. tribunal for Rwanda, nine of whom
will be selected to sit on the bench at the court in Arusha,
Tanzania.
	   The General Assembly must choose among the candidates to fill
the three-chamber tribunal, which is hearing cases of the 1994
genocide in Rwanda.
	   The council passed along the names of the judges after a secret
ballot was held Wednesday. The council twice postponed turning over
the list after too few member states put forward candidates.
	   Rwandan Hutu extremists killed more than 500,000 minority Tutsis
beginning in April 1994. Tutsi-led rebels ousted the Hutu
government 90 days later and ended the killings.
	   The tribunal has convicted a former mayor of participating in
the genocide; Jean-Paul Akayesu awaits sentencing.
	   The tribunal has also sentenced former Prime Minister Jean
Kambanda to life in prison, the maximum penalty it can impose. The
tribunal is holding 31 people, and another person is in custody in
Texas.
	   Rwandan courts have tried at least 330 people in the genocide,
and 116 have been sentenced to death. A total of 126,078 people are
imprisoned and awaiting trial, according to the Red Cross.

Stocks, dollar higher in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange inched up
early Thursday despite a drop overnight on Wall Street and
worsening business sentiment at home. The U.S. dollar was higher
against the yen.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 28.35
points, or 0.21 percent, to 13,434.74 in the first 30 minutes of
morning trading. On Wednesday, the index plunged 415.04 points to
13,406.39, the lowest finish since February 1986.
	   Since the close of the latest fiscal year on March 31, the
benchmark average has fallen 19 percent. The market gauge finished
last fiscal year at 16,527.17 and ended the 1997 trading year at
15,258.22.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.67 points, or 0.54 percent, to 1,037.90.
The TOPIX lost 19.33 points, or 1.82 percent, the previous day.
	   The Bank of Japan's worse-than-expected quarterly tankan survey
of business sentiment has also had little impact on the market. The
closely watched indicator showed that the business condition
diffusion index, or DI, for big manufacturers worsened to minus 51
from minus 38 in the previous survey released June 29.
	   Traders said the grim numbers had been expected.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar bought 136.38 yen at 9 a.m.
(0000 GMT), up 0.66 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and but below
its late New York level of 136.75 yen overnight.
	   The dollar slipped from earlier highs as traders sold after the
release of the tankan survey, traders said.
	   ``U.S. and Japanese players had built up significant dollar long
positions prior to the (release of the) tankan. After it was
released, they sold the dollar to unwind those positions,'' said
Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO
Bank in Tokyo.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.720 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.765
percent, driving its price up to 109.79 yen from 109.35 yen.

Iraq says it was obliged to cut cooperation with inspectors

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister called on the U.N.
chief ensure that any ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's efforts to
disarm itself have a finite end, so that Iraqis can have some idea
when sanctions will be lifted.
	   In a speech Wednesday to the General Assembly, Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahaf urged Secretary-General Kofi Annan personally supervise
the review and make sure that it is not ``an aimless process with
no end in sight.''
	   He compared the effects of 8-year-old U.N. sanctions against his
country to genocide and called for a denunciation of countries who
insist on retaining the sanctions.
	   Inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, must
certify Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles and chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons programs before the Security Council
will lift sanctions that were imposed after Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   The sanctions prevent Iraq from selling its most valuable
commodity _ oil _ on the open market.
	   Baghdad stopped cooperating with inspectors Aug. 5 after the
chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that
Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Al-Sahaf said Iraq has cooperated fully with U.N. resolutions
demanding it destroy its weapons of mass destruction. ``However,
the blockade has not so far been lifted, thus rendering the
continuation of cooperation both meaningless and useless,'' he
said.
	   Al-Sahaf welcomed efforts by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
seek an end to the impasse over stalled inspections by conducting a
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's progress over the last seven
years to disarm itself.
	   Such a review could force the council to recognize the steps
Iraq has taken to dismantle its proscribed weapons programs and
could increase pressure for some easing of sanctions.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is in New York this week,
meeting with members of the council and Annan to try to work out
details of the comprehensive review.
	   Aziz and Annan were dining together Wednesday at the Iraqi
ambassador's residence, a tony townhouse on Manhattan's upper east
side _ the second time the two met this week. Earlier in the day,
Aziz met with British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock.
	   In his speech, al-Sahaf harshly criticized the U.N. Special
Commission and its chairman as working only on behalf of one
``arrogant, powerful state,'' to keep the sanctions in place _ a
clear reference to Washington.
	   That undue influence, al-Sahaf said, forced Iraq to stop
cooperating with inspectors last month.
	   He condemned countries ``who insist, for ulterior political
motives, on continuing to inflict on the people of Iraq this
destructive blockade, a blockade parallel in its tragic
consequences to the internationally proscribed acts of genocide,''
he said.

New times, new church in Croatia as pope comes for a second visit

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's archbishop speaks softly but
his words pack a wallop against the government. Increased poverty
and widespread corruption, he says, are ``a sin.''
	   So when Pope John Paul II visits Croatia this weekend, he will
find a different Roman Catholic church than on his first visit four
years ago: a church closer to the people and further from the
government.
	   In 1994, the archbishop was Franjo Kuharic, who was close _
critics charge too close _ to the government of President Franjo
Tudjman.
	   Jozip Bozanic, 49, changed the tune.
	   His appointment by the Vatican was surprising to many, who
believed that one of Kuharic's close associates would replace him
on his retirement at age 78.
	   But Bozanic, former bishop of the northern island of Krk, seemed
to offer what the Vatican wanted for a Croatia developing its
fledgling democracy: he was known as a contemporary churchman who
advocated the church's autonomy within society and its distance
from the political leadership.
	   Indeed, he keeps contacts with the government to ones required
by protocol _ devoid of unnecessary compliments.
	   From his first address last Christmas, he has chided the
country's leaders, however indirectly, for condoning the increasing
gap between rich and poor.
	   But then, times are different now too.
	   ``Bozanic is the archbishop of the postwar era, professing
postwar issues,'' political analyst Ivan Grdesic says.
	   For Croatia, even though the war he refers to was in 1991
against rebel Serbs, the postwar period essentially only ended in
January when it regained control of all its territory and was able
to turn to peacetime issues.
	   Many Croats have turned toward the church since 1990, when
Tudjman steered Croatia to independence from former Yugoslavia,
whose communist leaders suppressed national and religious
activities.
	   The church, supporting independence, stood by Tudjman. That, in
turn, earned him many votes in the country where about 70 percent
of its 4.5 million people are Roman Catholics.
	   Now that the focus is on peacetime topics, such as employment,
low wages and human rights, many Croats have become increasingly
dissatisfied with Tudjman's eight-year rule. While the majority
face economic hardships, the ruling elite and the businessmen they
favor have gotten rich.
	   On Wednesday, Tudjman disclosed that he owns a luxury home, five
cars and an extensive art collection. The average salary in Croatia
is about dlrs 400 a month.
	   Sensing the mood, Bozanic called in his tone-setting Christmas
address for an ``urgent review of the poverty that many people
face.''
	   ``Violent political and economic changes led to rapid enrichment
of some individuals and even bigger impoverishment of many
people,'' he said. ``It is a sin, enabled by the laws and committed
by the structures who didn't care for people and the community.''
	   He expressed concern at seeing that ``people are losing
confidence in state and legal institutions ... while interventions,
recommendations and connections are taking hold'' _ a clear
reference to corruption.
	   Most recently, he said that ``moral values must be restored.''
	   Bozanic may have more influence than any opposition politician,
as Croats generally consider the church a supreme moral authority.
	   Analyst Mladen Plese said no one else has dared ``to denounce
the governing bodies' behavior so drastically.''
	   ``Pity he's not a politician running for president,'' said Mara
Rajic, a 61-year-old retired saleswoman.

 &UR; Small border town washed away in flood waters unleashed by
Hurricane Georges &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FONDS VERRETTES, Haiti (AP) _ Electricity hadn't arrived in this
isolated border town, which government after government _
dictatorial and democratic _ long abandoned to its fate.
	   So when farmer Cantave Brevil, his wife and eight children heard
a terrestrial tidal wave crashing into town last week, they did so
in total darkness.
	   ``Boom-boom-boom. It sounded like cannon salvoes,'' he said. The
Brevils fled in the nick of time.
	   The mighty wave, another of Hurricane Georges' ravages in the
Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, lifted houses off foundations
and foundations off the ground.
	   It wiped most of Fonds Verrettes off the face of the earth,
killing at least 85 people. Many more are feared dead.
	   ``The town is finished, dead. It's reached the point of no
return. Now we live in exile in our homeland,'' said Brevil, 39.
	   The official nationwide death toll from Hurricane Georges,
including that of Fonds Verrettes, was 150 Wednesday, with at least
40 missing.
	   Fonds Verrettes, located about 50 miles (85 kms) west of the
capital of Port-au-Prince, was built in harm's way, at the bottom
of a river bed.
	   Rains began falling in the town around 1 pm on Sept. 22, when
Georges was pounding neighboring Dominican Republic.
	   After midnight, a seven-foot (two-meter) wave roared through the
town, demolishing the stone and cement-block buildings and sweeping
scores of drowned bodies downstream toward the border with the
Dominican Republic.
	   The torrent gouged deep trenches in the soil on each side of the
500-feet-wide (170-meter) river bed. The cemetery teetered, and
tombs fell into the stream and were carried away.
	   The gutted, roofless hulk of the La Croix Catholic church, which
stands on slighty higher ground, looks down on annihilation. City
Hall and the telephone exchange are gone.
	   All that is left now where the town once stood are mounds of
white gravel gleaming in the sunlight.
	   Brevil's case is typical. The 27,000 inhabitants of the town had
little before the storm and now have even less. Brevil lost his
home, belongings, crops and livestock, as well as several
relatives.
	   He and his family have sought shelter at a friend's house, with
50 other hurricane victims.
	   ``Some people can't even tell you where their house was,'' said
Julien Zetren, 42, a public school principal.
	   The day the hurricane struck was market day. Many merchants from
outlying towns, unable to return home because of the rains, bedded
down along the streets.
	   Years ago, wooded mountains surrounded Fonds Verrettes. As farm
incomes fell, impoverished peasants cut down the trees to make
charcoal.
	   Because the highlands surrounding the town have no forest cover
to absorb torrential rains, all the water gushed into the town last
week.
	   ``If the authorities had built a canal, this wouldn't have
happened,'' said Zetren. Fonds Verrettes was hard hit twice in the
past, by Hurricane Hazel in 1954 and Tropical Storm Gordon in 1994,
yet authorities did not order an evacuation last week.
	   On Monday and Tuesday, the government sent two helicopters and a
health ministry vehicle with emergency food aid.
	   Provisions were meager: 24 100-pound sacks of rice, 27 of flour,
and 65 pints of drinking water.
	   ``In every other country, a hand is held out at once. Tents and
food are distributed. Not here,'' said Zetren.
	   A government delegation is scheduled to arrive in Fonds
Verrettes on Thursday to evaluate the damage.
	   In the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo, seven U.S.
congressmen and U.S. Agency for International Development officials
arrived Wednesday to announce a dlrs 47 million aid package for the
Dominican Republic and Haiti _ the two countries most affected by
the hurricane.
	   The congressmen, accompanied by U.S AID administrator Brian
Atwood and Housing and Urban Developemnt Secretary Andrew Cuomo,
flew on to Haiti later Wednesday to tour hurricane damage and to
pledge dlrs 12 million to restart USAID programs damaged by
Georges.
	   ``People in this country have suffered so much and so long that
it seems particularly unjustified that they have had to suffer
through this storm,'' Atwood said.

German to be deported, admits 27 charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A German being sought in his own
country for fraud will be deported after pleading guilty in a New
Zealand court Thursday to charges of child pornography and
counterfeiting a passport.
	   German Andreas Michael Lenke admitted to 20 charges of making
objectionable material, two counts of falsifying a passport, two of
altering documents and one each of passport theft, knowingly using
an altered document for fraud and counterfeiting a passport.
	   Judge Arthur Middleton of the Wellington District Court
sentenced Lenke to 25 days in jail, which included 17 days already
spent in custody, to allow him to be deported to Germany on Oct. 8.
	   Lenke, 31, is wanted by German authorities, where he has 2 1/2
years of a jail term for fraud to serve.
	   The German national, who entered New Zealand in March 1996, had
worked as a part-time teacher and soccer coach at a Wellington
college.
	   He was originally arrested after police raided his Wellington
home, where Senior Police Sgt. Ken McLeod told the court they found
450 objectionable images on his computer.
	   McLeod said the material featured the sexual violation and
exploitation of children.
	   Lenke had also stolen a housemate's Australian passport and
falsified his own German one to include entry to New Zealand and
South America.

Central bank survey shows economy in bad slump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Underlining the seriousness of Japan's recession, a
central bank quarterly survey released Thursday said that
confidence at small and medium-sized businesses plunged to its
worst since the survey was begun in 1967.
	   Business sentiment at major manufacturers was the worst in three
and a half years, according to the Bank of Japan's widely watched
``tankan'' survey.
	   The survey's main index measures the percentage of firms seeing
business conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions
worsen.
	   The measure for small and medium-sized manufacturers was minus
57, worse than the previous record low of minus 51 in May 1975. In
the previous survey released in June, the index was minus 49.
	   For big manufacturers, the index fell to minus 51, the worst
since February 1994 when it fell to minus 56. In the survey
released three months ago, it was minus 38.
	   Japan is stuck in its worst recession in half a century, its
economy dragged down by massive bad loans in its financial sector
and sales dampened by the Asian currency crisis as well as by
pessimism among consumers at home.
	   Bankruptcies among companies have risen. Smaller companies are
the worse hit because they are more dependent on bank loans to
finance their businesses.
	   Shosaku Murayama, director of the Bank of Japan's research
department, said the survey shows that the overall economy is in
``a slump.''
	   ``The survey indicates that companies expect their earnings and
financing to worsen further,'' he said.

Defense lawyer in Swiss drug case accuses judge of sexual
</HEADLINE>
harassment &QL; 
 &UR; By ALFONSO ANZUETO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) _ A defense lawyer for three
Swiss men sentenced in Guatemela for drug trafficking accused the
judge handling the case of sexually harassing her and threatening
her with death.
	   Lea de Leon Marroquin said she filed the complaint against
criminal court Judge Heberto Zapata Gudiel in Puerto Barrios with
the national judiciary oversight board, which handles these issues.
	   ``Yes, it's true,'' the lawyer, Lea de Leon Marroquin told The
Associated Press in a brief telephone interview from her Guatemala
City office.
	   But she refused to say more, claiming her complaint has been
classified as confidential.
	   Repeated telephone calls to Zapata's office in the northeastern
port of Puerto Barrios were not returned Wednesday.
	   The three Swiss men, a German and a Guatemalan were convicted of
drug trafficking and sentenced last Friday from 10 to 20 years in
prison. De Leon is appealing the sentences.
	   The so-called ``German connection'' case involved dlrs 100
million in shipments of cocaine sent from Guatemala to Europe
hidden in containers and ornamental plants.
	   Saturday, the Swiss foreign ministry called the sentences
``extremely hard and disproportionate.''
	   The court sentenced Swiss citizen and former Nestle executive
Andreas Heanggi Wyndler, 60, to 12 years in prison and a fine of
dlrs 77,000.
	   Nicholas Heanggi Chalandrian, 22, Andreas Heanggi's son, was
sentenced to 20 years and a dlrs 155,000 fine, as was Swiss citizen
Silvio Giovanoli, 30.
	   German hotel manager Joachin Frank Schilling, 52, who worked for
another suspect already serving a prison term in the case in
Germany, was sentenced to five years in prison or dlrs 27,375, plus
a fine of dlrs 15,000.
	   A former Guatemalan police commander, Jose Luis Zebadua Salazar,
35, was sentenced to 12 years and a dlrs 77,000 fine for having
protected the shipments. Another Guatemalan who was driving a truck
in which one of the cocaine shipments was found, was acquitted.
	   The alleged scheme was uncovered in November 1996 when police in
Duesseldorf, Germany, found 170 kilograms (375 pounds) of cocaine
hidden in plastic bags in a shipment of Guatemalan hammocks.
	   The defendants said they had been unwitting accomplices to the
scheme.
	   The Nestle group, which has always supported Heanggi since his
arrest, said it was shocked by the verdict.
	   ``Nothing that has been said and brought before the court has
changed our belief in the integrity and innocence of Andreas
Heanggi,'' said the firm's spokesman, Hansjoerg Renk.
	   Nestle will continue to provide support to Heanggi and his
family during the appeal process, Renk said. He said the firm will
do what it can to ensure the appeal process is as short as
possible, Renk said.

 &UR; Debate over becoming U.S. state colors Hurricane George relief &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Despite Hurricane Georges'
destruction, Puerto Rico's pro-statehood governor is insisting the
island can vote in December on whether it wants to become a U.S.
state.
	   Anti-statehood politicians said Wednesday that the U.S.
territorial government should funnel the dlrs 10 million set aside
for the Dec. 13 vote to disaster relief.
	   Georges killed at least three people in Puerto Rico on Sept. 21,
caused at least dlrs 2 billion in damage and left thousands
homeless.
	   ``The crisis that Puerto Rico is living through is going to take
three or four months to recuperate from, and it's not prudent to
hold an activity of this type,'' said Anibal Acevedo Vila, head of
the Popular Democratic Party.
	   Acevedo Vila's party favors retaining Puerto Rico's commonwealth
status, in which it enjoys limited autonomy. The party filed a bill
in the island's Legislature Wednesday that would eliminate funding
for the vote.
	   But Rossello said Puerto Ricans can ``walk and move their arms
at the same time'' and refused to reschedule the vote.
	   A bill to allow Puerto Ricans to choose among statehood,
independence or commonwealth narrowly passed the U.S. House of
Representatives but stalled in the Senate.
	   Soon thereafter, Rossello announced the non-binding December
vote, hoping to force the U.S. Congress to consider the issue.
	   Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and receive limited federal
benefits, but they cannot vote for president, have no vote in
Congress and do not pay federal taxes.
	   The island was ceded to the United States by Spain as part of
the treaty that ended the Spanish-American War in 1898.
	   Rossello had been campaigning heavily for statehood when
Hurricane Georges struck.
	   The Puerto Rican Independence Party urged Rossello to postpone
the vote until March 14, but said it intends to participate
whenever it is held.
	   Political adversaries are also clashing over hurricane relief
efforts, with pro-commonwealth mayors complaining of a lack of
attention from the central government.
	   Jose Otero Garcia, Rossello's municipal affairs commissioner,
criticized San Juan's pro-commonwealth mayor, Sila Calderon, for
radio ads urging residents to help each other. He called the
messages ``frivolous.''

Border town washed away in flood waters unleashed by Hurricane
</HEADLINE>
Georges &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FONDS VERRETTES, Haiti (AP) _ Electricity hadn't arrived in this
isolated border town, which government after government _
dictatorial and democratic _ long abandoned to its fate.
	   So when farmer Cantave Brevil, his wife and eight children heard
a terrestrial tidal wave crashing into town last week, they did so
in total darkness.
	   ``Boom-boom-boom. It sounded like cannon salvoes,'' he said. The
Brevils fled just before the mighty wave that lifted houses off
foundations and foundations off the ground.
	   The wave, another of Hurricane Georges' ravages in the Western
Hemisphere's poorest nation, wiped most of Fonds Verrettes off the
face of the earth, killing at least 85 people. Many more are feared
dead.
	   ``The town is finished, dead. It's reached the point of no
return. Now we live in exile in our homeland,'' said Brevil, 39.
	   The official nationwide death toll from Hurricane Georges,
including that of Fonds Verrettes, was 150, with at least 40 still
missing Wednesday.
	   Fonds Verrettes, located about 50 miles (85 kms) west of the
capital of Port-au-Prince, was built in harm's way, at the bottom
of a river bed.
	   Rains began falling in the town early afternoon on Sept. 22,
when Georges was pounding neighboring Dominican Republic.
	   After midnight, a seven-foot (two-meter) wave roared through the
town, demolishing the stone and cement-block buildings and sweeping
scores of drowned bodies downstream toward the border with the
Dominican Republic.
	   The torrent gouged deep trenches in the soil on each side of the
500-feet-wide (170-meter) river bed. The cemetery teetered, and
tombs fell into the stream and were carried away.
	   The gutted, roofless hulk of the La Croix Catholic church, which
stands on slighty higher ground, looks down on annihilation. City
Hall and the telephone exchange are gone.
	   All that is left where the town once stood are mounds of white
gravel gleaming in the sunlight.
	   The 27,000 inhabitants of the town had little before the storm
and now have even less. Brevil is a typical resident _ he's lost
his home, belongings, crops and livestock, as well as several
relatives.
	   He and his family have sought shelter at a friend's house, with
50 other hurricane victims.
	   The day the hurricane struck was market day. Many merchants from
outlying towns, unable to return home because of the rains, bedded
down along the streets.
	   Years ago, wooded mountains surrounded Fonds Verrettes. As farm
incomes fell, impoverished peasants cut down the trees to make
charcoal.
	   Because the highlands surrounding the town have no forest cover
to absorb torrential rains, all the water gushed into the town last
week.
	   ``If the authorities had built a canal, this wouldn't have
happened,'' said Julien Zetren, 42, a public school principal.
Fonds Verrettes was hard hit twice in the past, by Hurricane Hazel
in 1954 and Tropical Storm Gordon in 1994, yet authorities did not
order an evacuation last week.
	   On Monday and Tuesday, the government sent two helicopters and a
health ministry vehicle with emergency food aid.
	   Provisions were meager: 24 100-pound (45 kilos) sacks of rice,
27 (12 kilos) of flour, and 65 pints (30 liters) of drinking water.
	   ``In every other country, a hand is held out at once. Tents and
food are distributed. Not here,'' said Zetren.
	   A government delegation is scheduled to arrive in Fonds
Verrettes on Thursday to evaluate the damage.

Tyson wants to settle traffic dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with comment from alleged victim's
attorney &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson's handlers want to clear a major
obstacle toward regaining a license for the former heavyweight
champion _ settlement with two men who accuse Tyson of assault
following a traffic accident.
	   The Nevada Athletic Commission will rule on Tyson's effort to
return to the ring, and on Wednesday waited for reports from
doctors who examined Tyson at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston last week.
	   The reports were to have been submitted by Monday. When they
weren't, the commission postponed Saturday's licensing hearing. The
commission said a date for the new hearing probably won't be
determined until Thursday.
	   The attempt to settle comes after two Nevada boxing
commissioners said they want to know what happened in Maryland
before they vote on giving Tyson a license.
	   ``Hopefully, this will all be resolved before the hearing,''
Tyson adviser Jeff Wald said. ``We're going to try to deal with it
before then.''
	   Tyson refused to answer questions about the matter at his Sept.
19 hearing before the Nevada commission. But with commissioners now
on the record saying they want answers before giving Tyson a new
license, the boxer's lawyers have begun negotiations on a
settlement.
	   Richard Hardick, 50, says Tyson kicked him in the groin after
Hardick's car rear-ended a Mercedes driven by Tyson's wife, Monica,
Aug. 31 in a Maryland suburb. Hardick and Abmielec Saucedo, 62, who
said Tyson punched him in the face, have filed criminal complaints.
	   Hardick's attorney, Roger Titus, confirmed Wednesday that he had
talked to Tyson's lawyers about a possible settlement but that no
agreement had been reached.
	   ``I have talked as I would in any case,'' Titus said. ``In any
civil case, settlement is always a possibility.''
	   Even if Tyson settles with the two men, Maryland prosecutors
could go ahead with criminal charges, Titus said.
	   Wald said clearing up this dispute means more to Tyson than just
a return of the license he lost for biting Evander Holyfield's ears
last year.
	   Tyson is still on probation from his rape conviction in Indiana
and could conceivably be returned to prison if convicted of another
crime.
	   ``The impact on Mike's life if there were charges in this
incident far exceeds his boxing license,'' Wald said. ``It comes to
the matter of his freedom.''
	   Wald said Tyson would not give up his right to presumed
innocence by talking about the incident before the commission.
	   Others close to Tyson, who asked not to be identified, said any
settlement would not be especially lucrative for the two men, even
if they believe they have leverage over Tyson because of the
pending commission vote.

At least 43 people dead or missing in heavy rainstorm in Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Tropical storm Yanni moved out of
South Korea Thursday, leaving at least 13 people dead and 30 others
missing, government officials said.
	   The storm also washed away rail lines and highways and flooded
vast residential areas and 252,000 hectares (622,440 acres) of rice
paddies, a quarter of South Korea's total crop land, they said.
	   ``A considerable reduction in rice production is feared because
the damage was done only a few weeks before harvest was to begin,''
Lee Eun-ho, an Agriculture Ministry official, said on MBC-TV.
	   Before the storm, the government predicted a third straight
bumper rice harvest this year. Rice is the staple food of South
Korea's 44 million people.
	   Hardest hit was North Kyongsang province, where up to 516
centimeters (20.3 inches) of rain fell in less than six hours. The
province reported 11 people killed and 19 others missing.
	   About one third of Pohang, a major industrial city in the
province with a population of 650,000, was flooded, forcing 2,000
people to flee their homes, officials said.
	   Pohang Iron and Steel Co., the world's second largest steel mill
located outside Pohang, reported no damage from the storm.
	   In Pusan, the nation's largest port, three people were missing
in a landslide. A Russian freighter moored at the port ran aground
after drifting in rough seas for several hours, officials said.
	   About a dozen people were either killed or missing in other
parts of the southern coastal regions, they said.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two days before the national election,
a poll published Thursday indicates Prime Minister John Howard's
governing conservatives have regained the momentum in the campaign.
	   The ACNeilsen poll published in the Sydney Morning Herald and
The Age newspaper of Melbourne show Howard's conservatives leading
Kim Beazley's opposition Labor Party by 42-40 percent.
	   That was a gain over the previous week's poll of one percent for
the conservatives, and a loss of 3 percent for Labor.
	   The margin of error in the poll is 2 percent, so it shows the
two major parties in virtually a dead heat for Saturday's national
election.
	   But it is the second major poll this week to show that Howard's
conservatives have edged ahead of Labor, which had held a sight
lead in the polls for most of the year until last week.
	   The Newspoll published in The Australian newspaper on Monday
showed Howard's conservatives ahead of Labor 43-42 percent, a
reversal of their standings a week earlier.
	   Labor requires a nationwide lead of about 3.7 percent to win the
27 seats it needs to take government, a feat no Australian
opposition party has ever achieved.
	   In the House of Representatives, Howard's governing Liberal
Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the Labor Party
holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.

Start of NBA season in serious doubt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The start of the National Basketball Association
season was in greater jeopardy than ever as owners and players
announced they won't meet again until Oct. 8.
	   The sides will have only a few days to strike a deal that would
preserve an 82-game schedule, and a quick settlement seems
extremely unlikely with the parties so far apart on the main
economic issue of a ``hard'' or ``soft'' salary cap.
	   ``I'm starting to believe that not playing through this calendar
year is becoming likely,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said as
all parties to the dispute grew increasingly pessimistic.
	   Granik said the league wanted to meet for a formal bargaining
session as soon as possible. He blamed the delay on the union.
	   ``I was bowled over to hear that we can't meet for nine days
while Rome is burning,'' Granik told the Philadelphia Daily News.
	   ``Ask him who struck the match,'' union director Billy Hunter
responded. ``Who lit the fire? Nero set Rome on fire and stood by
and fiddled as it burned. They locked us out.''
	   Hunter added that Oct. 8 was the first mutually agreeable day
because of previous commitments for both sides, not just the union.
He also pointed out that commissioner David Stern insisted on
having a nine-day break during the guaranteed contracts grievance
hearing this summer because he and Granik wanted to take their
vacations.
	   ``If they were really interested in cutting a deal, then they
would have put something better on the table that we could give
some serious consideration to,'' Hunter said. ``Now, all of a
sudden, time is of the essence? Time has been of the essence for
the past three months as far as I'm concerned.
	   The main players in the lockout _ Stern, Granik, Hunter and
union president Patrick Ewing _ have had two sit-down discussions
recently, one last Wednesday and one Monday, at the union's
offices. The owners made their most recent proposal last Friday.
	   There have been no sessions including the owners' labor
committee and rank and file players since Aug. 6.
	   Once a new agreement is reached, it will take at least three
weeks to sign players, make trades and hold abbreviated training
camps. So, unless a deal can be completed a few days after the
sides reconvene, there appears to be no way the season can start on
its scheduled date of Nov. 3.
	   The league already has announced an indefinite postponement of
training camps and the cancellation of 25 exhibition games. More of
the preseason could be scrapped later this week.

World's smallest mammal fossil found in Wyoming tree stump
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SNOWBIRD, Utah (AP) _ Scientists have uncovered the fossilized
fragment of the world's smallest mammal _ a tiny shrew-like
creature no heavier than a dollar bill that somehow survived the
planet-wide catastrophe that wiped out the dinosaurs.
	   Researchers made the assessment based on a set of jaws and a few
teeth so small that their distinguishing details only can be viewed
with a powerful scanning electron microscope. The find was
announced Wednesday at the annual meeting of the Society for
Vertebrate Paleontology.
	   The bones of Batodonoides, colored jet black and in pristine
condition, emerged from a large tropical tree trunk entombed in
limestone sediments, some of which are dated to 65 million years
ago.
	   Paleontologists pried the petrified stump from a treeless
badlands section of north-central Wyoming. The fossil of the
ancient mammal, believed to weigh as little as 1.3 grams, was
discovered in a University of Michigan laboratory by researchers
using acid to dissolve the surrounding limestone.
	   ``At first I thought I was looking at a fish jaw,'' said
Jonathan Bloch. ``Under the microscope, I realized I was looking at
the smallest mammal teeth I had ever seen. It's very primitive.''
	   Other researchers at the meeting said Bloch's discovery was
likely, but they had not yet examined his data to confirm the
finding. The teeth of the batodonoides measure a millimeter or less
in height. That and other features suggest to the researchers that
it was significantly smaller than the two smallest living mammals _
the Least shrew at 2.5 grams and the Bumblebee bat at 2 grams.
	   The discovery challenges long-held views about the smallest body
size a warm-blooded creature can support. The fossil's modern
cousins have the largest heart size-to-body ratio of any mammal to
support bodies that are comparatively heavier. Their hearts pump
furiously and they have to eat voraciously to support a rapid
metabolism and generate enough energy.
	   The shape of the Batodonoides' teeth is similar to a family of
ancient mammals distantly related to shrews that were widely
distributed in the North American West. They scurried in the
underbrush of tropical forests where dinosaurs roamed until the
giant reptiles died off 65 million years ago, possibly from a
colossal comet impact combined with climate change and disease.
	   These tiny mammals, perhaps no larger than a gumdrop, are among
the few creatures in the fossil record that hung on, along with
squirrel-sized primates and other adaptable creatures.
	   Other members of this shrew-like group have been found as far
west as San Diego. They persisted far and wide for 45 million years
after the dinosaurs vanished.
	   Like its cousins, the smallest mammal's teeth have high,
sharply-pointed crowns that probably were used to puncture and
shear insects.
	   Scientists can only speculate as to how the bones wound up in
the tree stump. Shrew-like animals are hunted by birds, and the
stump also has yielded a complete fossil egg and eggshell
fragments. Fine-grained silt may have killed the tree and filled
the stump, covering the bones and eventually hardening into
limestone.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Roy Lassiter and Jaime Moreno scored goals as
two-time defending MLS champion D.C. United beat the Miami Fusion
2-1 on Wednesday night in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference
semifinal series.
	   United has won 11 consecutive postseason games since 1996,
including a 7-0 run at RFK Stadium. Game 2 of the best-of-3 series
is Sunday night in Miami. If necessary, Game 3 would be Oct. 7 in
Washington.
	   Lassiter opened the scoring in the 28th minute, and Moreno made
it 2-0 in the 38th minute. Miami's Paulinho McLaren scored in the
69th minute.
	   United, 24-8 in the regular season, won despite of the absence
of four starters, including Marco Etcheverry. The Bolivian
playmaker, sidelined by a hamstring injury, is questionable for
Sunday's game.
 &UR; Crew 5, MetroStars 3
	   In Columbus, Ohio, Brian McBride scored twice and Ansil Elcock
had three assists as the Crew beat the New York-New Jersey
MetroStars in the opening game of the MLS Eastern Conference
semifinals.
	   The Crew will go for a sweep in the best-of-3 series Saturday
night at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
	   The eight goals were the most ever scored in an MLS playoff
game. The previous high was five goals, which happened six times.
	   Columbus goalkeeper Juergen Sommer had four saves, including
three during a 10-second flurry of shots in the first half that
protected the Crew's 3-0 lead.
	   McBride gave the Crew a 2-0 lead early in the first half with
goals in the ninth and 11th minutes. His second goal was a
one-timer off a pass from Andy Williams that hit the right post and
went in the net.
	   Williams set up the play when he knocked down Diego Sonora's
muffed clearing attempt.
	   Columbus added goals by Rob Smith and Jason Farrell and led 4-0
at halftime.
	   Eduardo Hurtado got the MetroStars on the board with a short
goal in the 53rd minute.
	   Columbus' Ricardo Iribarren set up the MetroStars' next goal
when he tripped up Hurtado in the penalty box in the 60th minute.
Iribarren drew a yellow card and Mike Sorber knocked the penalty
kick past Sommer.
	   New York-New Jersey's final goal came on a 30-yard looping shot
that got over the head of Sommer into the top right corner in the
80th minute.
	   Stern John scored a goal for the Crew in the 58th minute.
	   MetroStars goalkeeper Tony Meola had two saves on seven shots.

Former Royals' ace Dan Quisenberry dead at 45
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with George Brett comments; DELETES reference to
Quisenberry being 13th in saves &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG TUCKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ Dan Quisenberry, a star relief
pitcher for the Kansas City Royals whose droll wit and funky
delivery charmed fans and baffled batters, died of brain cancer. He
was 45.
	   Quisenberry died around dawn Wednesday in his Leawood, Kansas
home after a nine-month battle with the illness. He had undergone
surgery twice since December when sudden, persistent headaches were
diagnosed as the most lethal type of tumor.
	   ``Dan was one of the finest people I've ever known,'' said
Atlanta Braves general manager John Schuerholz, who headed the
Royals' scouting department 20 years ago when an undrafted
Quisenberry had to plead for a tryout.
	   Quisenberry, a three-time All-Star, was the U.S. major league
career saves leader from 1979-85 and helped the Royals win two
American League pennants and a World Series.
	   News of his illness last winter jolted Kansas City, where the
affable, quick-witted Quisenberry had remained a popular and active
member of the community. During his playing days, he devoted a
great deal of time and energy to gathering food for the homeless
and needy. While continuing that work since retiring in 1990, he
had also begun giving poetry readings in public libraries.
	   ``I don't remember him as the guy who got all the ground balls
and double plays,'' said Jamie Quirk, a Royals coach and longtime
teammate. ``He was more important than that. He was much more.''
	   Quisenberry came up late in 1979 when injuries devastated the
Royals' pitching staff. Pale and skinny, he had an awkward-looking,
submarine delivery and a sinkerball that big-league hitters figured
to murder.
	   Instead, they usually pounded balls into the ground, where a
talented infield headed by nine-time All-Star second baseman Frank
White scooped them up.
	   In a 12-year career, he compiled 244 saves. He was the AL saves
leader five times while helping the Royals win pennants in 1980 and
'85.
	   His 45 saves in 1983 was then the major league record. Between
1979 and 1985, when Kansas City beat St. Louis for its only World
Series title, Quisenberry's 217 saves were tops in the majors.
	   During his 10 years in Kansas City, Quisenberry was a pivotal
figure in many of the team's greatest moments. He got the save in
the famous ``Pine Tar Game'' against the New York Yankees after
Billy Martin protested George Brett's bat. And he got the victory
in a 2-1 win over St. Louis in the sixth game of the '85 World
Series.
	   ``The memory that I'll always have of Dan was when I went to see
him right after his surgery in January,'' said former Royals star
George Brett. ``I was dreading every inch of the drive going to his
house.
	   ``But he put me at ease right away. He talked about how glad he
was for every blessing he'd always had. Everybody has the baseball
memories. But there was so much more to Dan than baseball.''
	   Schuerholz, the Royals'GM during their championship seasons,
called Quisenberry ``as fine a man as I've ever met.''
	   In May, just before his second surgery, a frail Quisenberry was
inducted into the team's hall of fame during emotional ceremonies
in Kauffman Stadium.
	   ``I'm so blessed,'' he said the crowd. ``I loved playing in
front of you folks, great fans. Great city. Great team.''
	   White, now a Royals coach, stood near first base and sobbed.
	   Quisenberry is survived by his wife, Janie, and teen-age
children Alysia and David.

Japanese stocks dip lower, dollar higher in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday stock, late morning bond and
currency prices; ADDS 3rd graf trader quote.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese share prices retreated early Thursday
after a short-lived mid-morning rally amid concern over the
deterioration of the economy and the drop overnight on Wall Street.
The dollar rose slightly against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell
123.91 points, or 0.92 percent, to 13,282.48 as of midday after
having moved into positive territory in earlier trading.
	   On Wednesday, the index plunged 415.04 points to 13,406.39, the
lowest close since February 1986.
	   ``The outlook is still very tough,'' said Dhia Amir, a senior
institutional sales trader in the Tokyo office of Nomura Securities
Co.
	   The market lost ground as dismay set in about the results of the
latest quarterly Bank of Japan survey of business sentiment, or
``Tankan,'' traders said.
	   The report, released just before the start of trading Thursday,
showed a key business condition diffusion index for big
manufacturers sank to a worse-than-expected minus 51, down from
minus 38 in the previous June survey.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 17.31 points, or 1.66 percent, to 1,026.26. The
TOPIX lost 19.33 points, or 1.82 percent, the previous day.
	   Investors also sold off shares following Wall Street's dip
overnight, traders said.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 237.90 points, or 3
percent, to 7,842.62 on worry interest rates have not been lowered
enough to boost flagging corporate profit growth.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar traded
moderately higher against the yen in reaction to the disappointing
results of the Bank of Japan survey, traders said.
	   It rose to 135.96 yen in late morning trading, up 0.24 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
136.75 yen overnight.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.730 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.765
percent, driving its price up to 109.69 yen from 109.35 yen.

Yankees beat Rangers to go up 2-0; Indians draw even with Red Sox

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yankees-Rangers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Add the name of Shane Spencer to the long list
of New York Yankees legends.
	   An unknown a month ago, the compact rookie capped his amazing
September by homering in his first postseason at-bat to lead Andy
Pettitte and the Yankees past the Texas Rangers 3-1 Wednesday night
for a 2-0 lead in their American League division series.
	   Pettitte atoned for a season-long struggle and pitched perfectly
into the fifth inning. Texas led the league in batting this year,
but managed only five hits in a Game 1 shutout and got only five
more against the AL's top staff.
	   The Yankees will try to sweep the best-of-5 playoff on Friday
night at Texas. David Cone (20-7) starts for New York against Aaron
Sele (19-11).
	   Spencer got his chance to start in left field partly because of
an ominous medical report on Darryl Strawberry. Told that doctors
had ``found something'' on his colon, Strawberry left the team for
more tests Thursday. It is not known when he will rejoin the
Yankees.
	   Spencer seemed to catch the Rangers by surprise, much the same
way he startled Yankees fans with his power down the stretch. He
hit a solo home run off Rick Helling in the second inning, then
singled ahead of Scott Brosius' homer for a 3-0 lead in the fourth.
	   The sellout crowd of 57,360 rewarded the rookie with standing
ovations all night.
	   Spencer, 26, had spent eight full seasons in the minors before
finally getting his chance in the majors this year. He made three
roundtrips between Triple-A Columbus and New York.
	   Pettitte protected the lead, setting down the first 12 batters
with ease. Juan Gonzalez doubled to begin the fifth and later
scored on a single by Ivan Rodriguez for Texas' only run.
	   Pettitte gave up three hits in seven innings, striking out eight
and walking none. He improved to 6-0 lifetime at home against Texas
and ended a slide in which he won just four of his last 12 starts,
leaving his spot in the postseason rotation in doubt.
	   Jeff Nelson got two outs in the eighth and Mariano Rivera closed
for his second save of the series.
 &UR; Indians 9, Red Sox 5
	   In Cleveland, Dave Burba, rushed into service when starter
Dwight Gooden was ejected after 22 pitches, pitched into the sixth
inning, and David Justice homered and drove in four runs Wednesday
as the Cleveland Indians evened its AL playoff series with Boston,
beating the Red Sox 9-5.
	   The best-of-5 series continues Friday afternoon at Fenway Park
with Cleveland's Charles Nagy facing Bret Saberhagen. Game 4 is set
for Saturday, and the teams would return to Jacobs Field for Game 5
on Sunday if necessary.
	   Game 2 will be best remembered for a wild, 39-minute first that
included three runs, two ejections, two passed balls, three walks,
two stolen bases, a hit batter, two controversial calls and a lot
of heated words.
	   There was more tension in the ninth inning when both benches and
bullpens emptied briefly after John Valentin took exception to an
inside pitch from Indians reliever Mike Jackson.
	   Indians pitchers handled Mo Vaughn, who had a postseason record
seven RBIs in Game 1. Vaughn went 1-for-4 with two strikeouts and a
walk.
	   After being routed 11-3 in Game 1 on Tuesday, the Indians needed
a lift. And although they certainly didn't plan to spend the rest
of the day watching TV in Cleveland's clubhouse, manager Mike
Hargrove and Gooden raised the intensity level of the Indians and
their fans by getting kicked out in the first by plate umpire Joe
Brinkman.
	   Gooden, seeking his first postseason win, was in trouble with
Brinkman after his third pitch. He disagreed with the umpire on a
2-0 pitch to leadoff hitter Darren Lewis, yelling when Brinkman
called ball three.

Rangers woe: Offense vanishes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After leading the American League in batting,
the Texas Rangers hit like an expansion team for the second
straight night.
	   With a 3-1 defeat to the New York Yankees, Texas returned home
just one loss from elimination.
	   The Rangers scored just one run in two games. Only 10 hits. Thus
far, the Rangers' postseason highlight film is a silent movie.
	   It's nothing new.
	   By the time Ivan Rodriguez singled home a run in the fifth
inning, Texas had been blanked in 19 consecutive postseason innings
against the Yankees, who beat them in the first round two years
ago.
	   Texas batters are 10-for-64 in this series, a .156 average. It
doesn't get much better if you add in the four-game loss in 1996.
	   In the six playoff games the Rangers have played in their
history, they have all of 17 runs, an average of less than three
per game. They have lost five straight playoff games to the
Yankees, going 33-for-172, a .192 average.
	   And from the fifth inning on, it gets even worse, with just
three runs in postseason play and 20 hits in 115 at-bats, a .174
average.
	   How can this be happening?
	   Texas set a team record with its .289 batting average this
season, topping the American League for the first time in 24 years
and only the second time in its history. The Rangers set team
records for hits and runs.
	   But David Wells and Andy Pettitte have handled them with ease.
If David Cone does the same on Friday night back in Arlington, the
offseason starts this weekend.

Hong Kong celebrates Chinese National Day in somber mood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong celebrated China's National Day
Thursday with parades, carnivals, banquets and a sobering reminder
that worse economic times may be ahead.
	   In a message to Hong Kong's 6.7 million people, Chief Executive
Tung Chee-hwa praised China's economic achievements but reminded
Hong Kong that it is ``facing the most serious challenges in recent
decades.''
	   Tung was joined by hundreds of Hong Kong and mainland
dignitaries and citizens at an early morning flag-raising ceremony
outside of the massive convention center, where British handed over
the territory to the Chinese in July 1997.
	   Tung was scheduled to host an official cocktail later Thursday
as well as attend several other celebrations.
	   But some people said they had no mood, or money, to celebrate.
	   Restaurants that hosted lavish banquets last year reported
business had fallen by up to 30 percent this year. People were
foregoing exotic vacations to stay home for the public holidays
Thursday and Friday.
	   ``The economy's so bad. I'm not in the mood to celebrate,'' said
Carol Ng, 30, a secretary, buying groceries at a market.
	   Ng said she celebrated the holiday last year dining out with her
family in a fancy Chinese restaurant, just weeks before the stock
market crashed.
	   Hong Kong is mired in the territory's first full-blown recession
in 13 years _ the economy is expected to shrink 4 percent this
year, and unemployment is at a 15-year high.
	   A labor union planned a rally against layoffs and pay cuts later
Thursday.
	   But Tung remained upbeat, saying in his message that Hong Kong
can revive its economy ``with the staunch support of our
motherland'' and Hong Kong people's ``tenacity, flexibility and
creativity.''
	   As the fears that China would meddle in Hong Kong's affairs and
curb civil rights have largely failed to materialize, Hong Kong
people are becoming more open to the mainland.
	   In a clear sign of closer ties, thousands of Hong Kong citizens
enjoyed a rare chance to visit the barracks of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army stationed here.
	   Thursday was the first time the local garrison opened all their
three barracks to the public. All 12,000 tickets were snapped up in
two hours when they were given out Tuesday.
	   China has been Hong Kong's moral support during the 15-month
regional financial turmoil.
	   Chinese officials have repeatedly pledged support for the
territory and promised not to devalue its currency, the yuan. A
yuan devaluation would harm investors' confidence in Hong Kong and
put much pressure of Hong Kong's currency link to the U.S. dollar.

Japanese fishing boats begin operation in waters off south Kuril
</HEADLINE>
islands &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese boats began fishing in waters off the
south Kuril islands Thursday under a fishery agreement with Russia
that ended three years of disputes.
	   Under the treaty signed in February, Japanese fishing boats can
now officially operate in the waters claimed by Russia.
	   The start of Japanese fishing in the area ``is extremely
significant in promoting the larger trend'' of better relations
between the two countries, Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said.
	   Komura also said he hopes the treaty would ensure the safety of
the Japanese fishing boats in the waters.
	   Russian patrols in the area have occasionally fired at the boats
and arrested crewmen.
	   Territorial disputes over the Kuril islands have prevented the
two countries from signing a World War II peace treaty.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Japan's former Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto have pledged to reach an agreement on a
treaty in the next two years.

Wilander defeats Dibbs for first Nuveen Tour win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Mats Wilander beat Eddie Dibbs 6-2, 6-7 (3-7),
10-6 Wednesday night in the first round of the BTI Champions senior
tennis tournament.
	   Wilander, making his Nuveen Tour debut, survived a shaky second
set before closing out the match in the Champions Tiebreaker. He
moves on to play fourth-seeded John Lloyd in the quarterfinals on
Friday.
	   ``Putting somebody away is always the toughest thing to do, even
when you're playing well,'' said Wilander, who won seven Grand Slam
tournament singles titles. ``When you're not playing well, it's
really difficult. But those things happen when you don't play a lot
of matches.''
	   The BTI Champions is the 12th event on the 1998-99 worldwide
senior tennis circuit.

Unions: prime minister losing votes over gas relief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election, BC-Australia-Gas Shortage &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard wasted a
golden opportunity to be seen as a compassionate leader by spurning
gas-parched Victoria's cries for assistance, the state's unions
said Thursday.
	   ``In an election period, you would think he would act quickly to
help the tens of thousands who have been economically damaged,''
Victorian Trades Hall Council secretary Leigh Hubbard told
reporters.
	   Howard reiterated Thursday the federal government would provide
assistance to 1.4 million Victorian households and 100,000
businesses suffering through the gas crisis on the request of the
state government.
	   Opposition Labor Party leader Kim Beazley promised to declare
the gas crisis a national emergency if Labor was elected on
Saturday.
	   Emerging from a briefing with Esso executives, Hubbard said he
was fully satisfied the company was doing all it could to bring its
natural gas production plant at Longford back on line after last
Friday's massive explosion.
	   ``But we are not satisfied with the lack of compassion being
shown by the federal government,'' Hubbard said.
	   ``This is an economic disaster that requires government help as
if it were a natural calamity.
	   ``Many of the families John Howard says he represents are just
one pay packet away from disaster, and this week over 100,000
working families are facing perhaps another fortnight without pay.
	   ``In times of crisis, people look to the government for
leadership, and Mr. Howard has so far failed to recognize the
seriousness of the problem and respond accordingly.''
	   The Australian Council of Trades Unions assistant secretary Tim
Pallas backed the disaster call, demanding the federal government
act immediately to minimize the distress of thousands of workers.
	   ``We do not believe workers should have to be forced to take
holiday leave, and wind down their bank accounts to a few hundred
dollars before getting support,'' he said.
